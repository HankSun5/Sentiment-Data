Stepping away from the helm of Binance, Changpeng Zhao faced legal consequences that led to a significant period of incarceration. His reflections offer a rare glimpse into the personal impact of such an event on one of the most influential figures in the crypto news landscape. What Was CZ Binance’s Prison Experience Like? Speaking with Rug Radio, CZ described his time incarcerated as both “scary” and “extremely hard.” This period marked a stark contrast to his previously relentless schedule building and running Binance. While physically confined, the experience seems to have initiated a significant internal shift. Key takeaways from his description include: Initial Fear and Difficulty: Acknowledging the inherent fear and hardship associated with imprisonment. Mental Challenges: Emphasizing the significant mental toll the experience took. Finding Connection: Developing unexpected friendships with fellow inmates, highlighting the human element within the system. How Did the Experience Change Changpeng Zhao’s Priorities? Perhaps the most impactful revelation from CZ’s interview is the fundamental shift in his priorities. He stated unequivocally that the prison experience strengthened his focus on personal well-being and family, moving these aspects ahead of his previous singular dedication to work. This change is a powerful testament to the transformative potential, even within challenging circumstances. For a figure synonymous with the non-stop world of cryptocurrency, this re-evaluation of life’s most important aspects provides valuable perspective. Why is Accountability Important, According to the Binance Founder? Despite the personal hardship, CZ touched upon the broader theme of accountability. According to reports, he noted that while he wouldn’t wish imprisonment on anyone, he believes it’s important for individuals to be held accountable for their actions, particularly in instances of bad behavior. This viewpoint aligns with the ongoing efforts within the crypto space and regulatory bodies to establish clearer rules and consequences. What’s Next for the Binance Founder? Looking ahead, Changpeng Zhao plans to delve deeper into his experiences. He revealed intentions to detail his time in prison and the lessons learned in an upcoming book. This offers the public a potential opportunity to gain further insight into the mindset of one of crypto’s pioneers after undergoing such a significant life event. The interview provides a brief but impactful look into the personal journey of CZ Binance post-incarceration.

When SUI launched last year, it went from low-key to trending in what felt like a blink. Those who spotted it early turned modest allocations into serious profits. But most people didn’t. They were either late, skeptical, or still stuck debating whether it was worth the risk. And just like that, it was gone—another missed opportunity that blew up without them. If that sounds like your story, you’re not the only one riding the regret wave. Now comes a chance to flip the script. Qubetics is gaining traction as a popular crypto coin to buy before the next big surge—and this time, you’re early enough to act. With its developer-first approach, real-world asset tokenization tools, and a ticking presale clock, Qubetics is doing more than just launching a token. It’s building infrastructure. And here’s the kicker: while the project has already crossed major milestones, it’s still within reach. That window won’t stay open long, and missing out again might be a move your future self won’t forgive. Qubetics Might Just Be the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Before It Gets Too Expensive Those who slept on Qubetics in its earliest stages are already counting what could’ve been. Back in September 2024, early whitelist participants grabbed $TICS at just $0.01—and they didn’t even need to pay upfront. Since then, multiple stages have passed, each offering lower entry points than today. But even now, Qubetics is still priced at a point that screams potential. The platform has locked in a spot as a popular crypto coin to buy , and with its Stage 33 presale currently active at $0.2302, it’s far from overpriced. Over 511 million tokens have already been sold, 25,800+ holders are in, and more than $16.7 million has been raised so far. With every stage lasting just seven days and introducing a 10% price increase, this is a fast-moving train—and it hasn’t left the station yet. Just to make it real: if you drop $2,000 into Qubetics at the current price, you’ll receive 8,684 tokens. Let’s say $TICS reaches $10 after mainnet launch. That single $2,000 investment becomes $86,840—over 4,243% ROI. If it hits $15, you’re looking at $130,260, a massive 6,414.9% return. This isn’t theoretical—it’s based on real-time, on-chain data from the Qubetics presale. That’s why it’s being widely talked about as the best crypto presale this year. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its real-world utility—especially its tokenization marketplace, which isn’t just hype, but a fully integrated tool for transforming physical and digital assets into secure, tradable tokens. It’s one of the main reasons Qubetics is quickly becoming a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. A small art gallery in New York could tokenize its entire collection, allowing global collectors to buy fractional ownership in prized artworks. A local farm in India could tokenize its future crop yield, giving early supporters returns once the produce sells. Or an independent game developer could tokenize early access to future game updates and assets, giving community members a stake in the project’s success. It’s an ecosystem that goes way beyond DeFi—it’s practical, scalable, and tailored for real adoption. SUI Was Slept On—But It Delivered When It Mattered Most SUI wasn’t the flashiest name in crypto when it launched, but those who knew where to look saw a winner forming early. Its ICO price hovered around $0.03 in 2023, and while skeptics questioned the network’s vision, those who backed it watched SUI explode past $1.50 at its peak. That’s a 50x return if you had the conviction—and the timing. But for many, it was another case of too little, too late. It came quietly, gathered steam, and rewarded those who took action early on. Since then, SUI has evolved into one of the more respected Layer 1 chains on the market. Its tech stack drew in developers, its user base grew steadily, and it maintained relevance even during market dips. Those past missed gains are now sealed history, and while SUI still holds value today, the window to 50x it? That’s already closed. It’s still a top performer, but the chance to multiply returns exponentially has passed. And that’s exactly why the crypto crowd is now searching for the next big entry—and Qubetics is quickly filling that gap. You Still Have Time—Don’t Let Another Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Slip Away If you’ve ever sat on the sidelines watching others post their wins from coins you almost bought, you know how brutal it feels. But here’s the honest truth: the next breakout doesn’t always come with fanfare—it comes with solid fundamentals, community backing, and smart tech. That’s what makes Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy right now. It’s still under $0.25, it’s built for real-world use, and it’s got momentum that’s impossible to ignore. If you missed the SUI wave, this might be your bounce-back move. The current stage is still open, but it won’t be for long. Every week, the price ticks up by 10%, and each stage only lasts seven days. The Qubetics mainnet is launching in Q2 2025, and when that day hits, prices are expected to rise—fast. You can still join this best crypto presale while it’s affordable, or sit back and read stories about it later, just like SUI. The difference is, this time, you’ve been warned.

44209711,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157419,1746487207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Issues Urgent Update on ETH Transactions for Ethereum Pectra Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-eth-suspension-update/,"Are you an Ethereum user on Coinbase? Pay close attention, because a significant, albeit temporary, change is coming. Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced it will be pausing certain ETH transactions in anticipation of the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade . What Exactly is Being Paused on Coinbase for the Upgrade? According to recent announcements, Coinbase is taking proactive steps to ensure a smooth transition during Ethereum’s scheduled network enhancement. Here’s a breakdown of the specific services that will be temporarily unavailable: Ethereum (ETH) Deposits: You will not be able to deposit ETH into your Coinbase account during the specified window. Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals: Similarly, withdrawing ETH from Coinbase will be paused. New ETH Staking Requests: If you planned to stake new ETH via Coinbase, this process will be paused. It’s crucial to note the timing for this temporary halt. Coinbase states these services will be suspended from 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7 . This is a relatively short window, designed to cover the critical phase of the upgrade’s deployment. Understanding the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Why it Matters You might be wondering, what is the Ethereum Pectra upgrade , and why does it necessitate a pause in services on a major platform like Coinbase? Pectra is the next significant hard fork planned for the Ethereum network. The name ‘Pectra’ is a combination of ‘Prague’ (the execution layer upgrade) and ‘Electra’ (the consensus layer upgrade), indicating it will bring changes to both fundamental components of Ethereum. While the full scope of Pectra is still being finalized and includes several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), some key areas of focus are expected to include: Staking Enhancements: Improvements related to staking, potentially including changes to validator maximum effective balances (EIP-7251). Account Abstraction Improvements: Further steps towards making Ethereum accounts more flexible and user-friendly, possibly building on EIP-3074. Overall Network Efficiency: Various technical improvements aimed at optimizing network performance and stability. Major network upgrades like Pectra are complex technical events. They involve coordinating changes across the entire network of nodes. For exchanges and service providers like Coinbase, pausing deposits and withdrawals is a standard safety measure during such critical periods. It helps prevent potential issues that could arise from transactions being initiated during the brief window when the network is transitioning, ensuring the safety and integrity of user funds. How Does This Coinbase ETH Suspension Impact You? For most users, this temporary Coinbase ETH suspension is a minor inconvenience. The pause window is short, less than an hour. However, if you absolutely need to deposit or withdraw ETH from Coinbase during that specific time frame on May 7th, you will need to adjust your plans. Existing ETH staking positions held through Coinbase will remain unaffected; the pause only applies to initiating *new* staking requests during the window. This is important Crypto news for anyone actively trading or moving ETH on Coinbase around the upgrade date. Being aware allows you to plan your activities accordingly and avoid any frustration from attempted transactions failing during the suspension period. Actionable Steps: Navigating the May 7th Pause Here’s what you should do: Check the Time: Note the specific Pacific Time (PT) window: 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7. Convert this to your local time zone. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw ETH on Coinbase, do so well before or wait until after this specific window. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase for any potential updates or changes to the schedule. Looking Ahead: The Benefits of Ethereum’s Evolution While a temporary pause might seem disruptive, it’s a necessary step in the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum network. Upgrades like Pectra are vital for improving Ethereum’s scalability, security, and functionality, ultimately benefiting all users in the long run. The smooth execution of these upgrades is crucial for the health and growth of the entire crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Growth In summary, Coinbase’s temporary suspension of certain ETH transactions and new staking requests on May 7th is a standard procedure to ensure a safe and seamless transition during the important Ethereum Pectra upgrade . While brief, this pause highlights the ongoing development of the Ethereum network and the steps platforms like Coinbase take to support its evolution.

The digital RUB had been slated to launch on July 1, 2025. But earlier this year, the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely,” giving no alternative launch timeline. Digital Ruble Rollout: Russians to Wait Until 2027 for CBDC? Per the state-owned Russian newspaper RIA Novosti , Alexey Voylukov, an MBA professor of business practice in digital finance at the Presidential Academy in Moscow, said that the Central Bank will need to provide incentives if it wants people to use its coin. The blackouts across Spain and Portugal are bad news for central bank digital currencies and stablecoins… but good news for cash #CBDCs #DigitalEuro https://t.co/MTlXFb7fwm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 29, 2025 Voylukov also said that in the most optimistic of scenarios, ordinary Russians will be able to start paying in stores with the digital ruble in the second half of 2026. However, he said that a national rollout in 2027 was “a more realistic scenario.” Voylukov’s comments came after claims to the contrary last month from the finance ministry. The ministry said the digital RUB was “almost ready” for a nationwide launch. Earlier, Interfax reported that Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that the digital ruble would launch next year. The minister said: “Last year and the year before, we carried out several transactions, including budgetary transactions, using the digital ruble. The digital ruble is 100% reliable.” Siluanov said that Moscow would focus on the token’s use in the commercial banking sector for the remainder of 2025. Some 15 major banks, including Sberbank and T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), are currently testing the token. However, while Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has continued to champion the CBDC, the banking sector has expressed grave doubts . Russian ruble prices versus the USD over the past 12 months. (Source: Google Finance) Russians Still Unsure About Digital RUB Citizens have also expressed their misgivings about the coin, leading the Central Bank to respond with assurances that “nobody will be forced” to use the CBDC. But the digital ruble’s future was thrown into doubt in late February when Nabiullina announced a “delay.” Voylukov also opined that most Russians are still very wary about the CBDC. He said: “Firstly, the digital ruble does not provide any tangible advantages compared to existing means of payment. Secondly, it uses QR codes. This kind of technology requires stable cellular networks and internet connections. This makes payment less convenient and slower compared to regular bank cards.” The Presidential Academy in Moscow, Russia. (Source: WL959 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Connectivity Problems? Around 88% of Russian households have internet access, per 2023 data. However, while that figure is much higher in urban areas, some think that it may be as low as 83% in rural parts of the country. The central People’s Bank of China has attempted to get around similar connectivity issues by launching offline digital yuan wallets . The European Union will on Tuesday announce a roadmap to phase out the bloc's remaining gas ties with Moscow, but in the absence of sanctions it will be difficult for buyers to exit gas contracts using legal options such as force majeure https://t.co/PIanL3c5yp — Reuters (@Reuters) May 5, 2025 Russia is yet to pilot similar solutions, but may look to Beijing for inspiration as both nations look for more ways to collaborate in the financial sphere. Voylukov concluded that it was “most likely” that the digital ruble would “be of interest to people who are already accustomed” to using QR codes and similar solutions to make payments. He said: “Mass adoption success or failure will depend on what advantages the Central Bank and the commercial banks working with the digital RUB will be able to offer people.” The post Russian Economist: Digital Ruble Rollout May Be Pushed Back to 2027 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-05 23:30:00

For readers tracking companies with significant funding and market potential, news from firms like 11x is highly relevant. A major shift has just occurred at the top of AI sales automation startup 11x, co-founded by Hasan Sukkar, who has announced he is stepping down from the CEO role. Leadership Transition at 11x: Prabhav Jain Takes the Helm Effective immediately, Hasan Sukkar is transitioning from Chief Executive Officer to a Non-Executive Chairman position at 11x. The announcement came directly from Sukkar via a LinkedIn post this morning. Stepping into the CEO role is Prabhav Jain, previously the company’s Chief Technology Officer. Sukkar explained his decision, stating a preference for building companies from the ground up and recognizing that leading an ‘enduring enterprise grade scale-up’ requires different skills. He emphasized his deep love for 11x and belief in its mission, framing the move as knowing ‘when to pass the CEO baton for the next leg of the race.’ In his new chairman role, Sukkar intends to support Jain on strategic direction, product vision, industry relationships, and market expansion, continuing to assist 11x ‘into the future’. Prabhav Jain is described by an 11x spokesperson as a former Brex executive and a three-time founder, bringing a wealth of experience to the CEO position. The company spokesperson framed the change as a strategic move aligned with 11x’s growth trajectory, evolving from a single-product company to a platform serving ‘hundreds of the world’s leading GTM teams’. Past Challenges and Strong Investor Backing This leadership change comes after a period where 11x faced scrutiny. As reported by Bitcoin World in March, the company was previously showing customer logos on its website from companies that were not active clients, leading to potential legal threats from one. Sources also indicated that the 11x product experienced issues and that the company struggled with customer retention. Furthermore, some employees described the startup’s work environment as particularly demanding. Despite these reported challenges, 11x has attracted substantial Venture Capital funding, raising over $70 million to date. This includes a $24 million Series A round led by Sarah Tavel, a general partner at Benchmark, and a significant $50 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Both key investors publicly defended the company and its leadership when the previous reports surfaced. Investor Confidence and the Road Ahead for 11x Joe Schmidt, the a16z partner involved in the 11x deal, publicly reiterated his support for the company and Hasan Sukkar on X in March, calling the team, product, and metrics ‘world class.’ Sarah Tavel of Benchmark also posted on X, stating her conviction in the team and the opportunity was ‘stronger than ever’ based on her view as a board member. It’s worth noting that Tavel recently announced she would be transitioning to a more limited role as a venture partner at Benchmark. The transition to Prabhav Jain as CEO signals a new phase for 11x. While the company spokesperson highlights strategic growth and platform evolution as the drivers, the move also occurs in the wake of past operational and customer-related challenges. The continued support from major venture capital firms like Benchmark and a16z underscores the potential they still see in the company and its new leadership team. The future trajectory of 11x under Jain’s leadership will be closely watched, particularly how the company addresses scaling, product development, and customer relationships while leveraging the substantial funding it has secured.

This was the case when, according to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated his belief that Canada’s Mark Carney would be seeking a significant deal during his visit on Tuesday. This simple statement opens up a multitude of questions, particularly concerning the potential implications for global economic relations and, by extension, the increasingly interconnected world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the Players: Trump, Mark Carney, and the US Canada Dynamic To fully grasp the potential weight of Trump’s comment, it’s essential to understand the key figures involved and the context of US Canada relations . Donald Trump, as a former U.S. President and a likely future contender, has a distinctive approach to international negotiations, often favoring bilateral deals and expressing clear expectations publicly. His past interactions with Canada, particularly regarding trade agreements like the USMCA (formerly NAFTA), have demonstrated a willingness to push for terms he perceives as favorable to the United States. On the other side is Mark Carney. A highly respected figure in international finance, Carney has served as the Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. He has also held significant global roles, including Chair of the Financial Stability Board and currently serves as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Carney’s expertise spans monetary policy, financial stability, and increasingly, the intersection of finance and global challenges like climate change. His perspective is rooted in multilateralism and systemic risk management, contrasting sharply at times with Trump’s more transactional approach. The relationship between the United States and Canada is one of the closest and most complex in the world, marked by deep economic ties, shared borders, and intertwined political interests. While generally strong, the relationship has seen periods of tension, particularly during Trump’s previous presidency, often centered on trade disputes. A high-profile visit from a figure like Mark Carney, coupled with Trump’s explicit expectation of a ‘deal,’ suggests discussions of significant substance are anticipated. What Kind of US Canada Deal Could Be On the Table? Trump’s comment was notably brief, offering no specifics about the nature of the expected deal. This lack of detail fuels speculation across various potential areas: Trade Adjustments: Despite the USMCA being in place, specific sector-by-sector trade issues (like dairy, timber, or critical minerals) often remain points of negotiation between the two countries. Regulatory Alignment: Given Carney’s background, discussions could involve aligning financial regulations, approaches to digital currencies, or frameworks for managing economic risks. Energy and Climate Finance: As UN Special Envoy, Carney is deeply involved in climate finance. Discussions could touch upon cross-border energy infrastructure, carbon pricing, or investment in green technologies. Global Economic Strategy: The visit could be a platform to discuss coordinated approaches to global economic challenges, supply chain resilience, or responses to international financial shifts. Digital Assets and CBDCs: While less likely to be the primary focus, given Carney’s and global central banks’ interest in digital currencies and stablecoins, discussions around the future of finance could touch upon these topics, potentially exploring cross-border implications or regulatory stances. The context of Trump expecting a deal implies a negotiation where concessions or agreements are sought by one or both sides. The exact nature of this potential US Canada deal remains the central mystery. Trump’s Evolving Stance: Is Trump Crypto’s Unexpected Ally? Interestingly, Donald Trump’s public stance on cryptocurrency has seen a notable evolution. Previously skeptical, even critical, he has recently expressed more openness, particularly as crypto has become a significant factor in campaign finance and voter interest. This shift is relevant because any major economic or financial deal discussed during Carney’s visit could indirectly or directly impact the regulatory or economic environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. While it’s highly improbable that a deal between Trump and Carney would be solely focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, discussions around financial innovation, cross-border payments, regulatory frameworks for digital assets, or even the future role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could feature, especially given Carney’s background in central banking and financial stability. Trump’s recent pivot suggests he is more aware of the crypto landscape, potentially making it a subtle consideration in broader financial discussions. Mark Carney’s Perspective: Stability, Sustainability, and the Future of Finance Mark Carney’s involvement signals a focus on systemic issues. His work has consistently emphasized financial stability, the transition to a sustainable economy, and the need for international cooperation to address global challenges. His views on digital currencies have typically been cautious, highlighting potential risks to financial stability and the need for robust regulation, particularly for stablecoins. However, he has also acknowledged the potential for innovation in payments and finance. A meeting involving Mark Carney Canada representing potentially Canada’s interests (or acting in a broader advisory capacity given his international roles) and Trump could involve discussions on how to integrate new financial technologies safely into the existing system, or how cross-border financial flows might be affected by regulatory changes or the emergence of digital assets. His presence suggests the ‘deal’ could have significant implications for the financial architecture shared by the two nations and potentially influence global norms. Potential Implications for Global Finance and Cryptocurrency While the specifics of the expected deal are unknown, any significant agreement between the US and Canada, particularly one touching upon finance, trade, or regulation, could have ripple effects. For the cryptocurrency market, these implications could manifest in several ways: Regulatory Clarity or Uncertainty: Discussions on financial regulation could signal future approaches to crypto, either leading to more clarity or highlighting divergent paths between the US and Canada. Economic Stability: Deals that enhance US-Canada economic stability or address potential risks could positively influence overall market sentiment, including for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: While speculative, discussions on modernizing financial infrastructure could, in the long term, open doors for new payment technologies, potentially including those leveraging blockchain. Investor Confidence: High-level discussions between key economic partners can influence investor confidence in the North American market, which has significant ties to the global crypto ecosystem. The fact that Trump Mark Carney are potentially engaging in high-stakes discussions underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. Crypto, as a nascent but growing part of this system, is sensitive to shifts in regulatory postures, economic stability, and international cooperation (or lack thereof). Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to a Deal Negotiating any significant deal between two sovereign nations presents challenges. Historical points of friction, differing domestic priorities, and the complex web of existing agreements must be navigated. The personalities and negotiating styles of the individuals involved also play a significant role. However, the opportunity exists for a deal that could strengthen the economic ties between the US and Canada, potentially setting precedents for international cooperation on emerging financial issues or trade challenges. A successful negotiation could bolster confidence in North America’s economic future, which could have positive spillover effects, including potentially creating a more favorable environment for innovation in sectors relevant to crypto. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Watch For? While waiting for details on the expected deal, those interested in cryptocurrency should pay attention to any official readouts or leaks regarding the topics discussed during Carney’s visit. Specific mentions of financial regulation, digital currencies, cross-border payments, or trade policies impacting technology sectors would be particularly relevant. Observing the market’s reaction to any news emerging from the visit could also provide insights into how investors perceive the implications of potential agreements between these two major economies. A Compelling Summary: Anticipating the Outcome President Trump’s assertion that Mark Carney will seek a deal during his visit has set the stage for potentially significant discussions between the United States and Canada. While the exact nature of this anticipated US Canada deal remains under wraps, the involvement of figures like Trump and Carney suggests topics of considerable economic and financial weight are on the agenda. For the cryptocurrency world, these high-level talks, though not directly centered on digital assets, are a reminder that the broader macroeconomic and regulatory environment is constantly evolving. Any agreements reached could influence the landscape for finance, trade, and potentially the future integration of new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the traditional system. All eyes will be on the outcomes of this visit to see what deal, if any, materializes and what its implications might be.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the increasing attention regulators are paying to the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights just how significant this focus has become, with SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ reaching an all-time high. Why Are SEC Filings So Important for Cryptocurrency? Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch upon what SEC filings are and why their content matters. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to file various documents, providing transparency to investors and the public. These filings, such as 10-K (annual reports) and 10-Q (quarterly reports), disclose crucial information about a company’s financial health, risks, and business operations. When a company starts mentioning cryptocurrency or digital assets in these formal documents, it signals a few key things: Formal Engagement: Companies are actively involved with crypto, either directly through holdings, services, or indirectly through exposure. Risk Disclosure: They perceive crypto-related factors (like market volatility or regulatory uncertainty) as material risks to their business that must be disclosed to investors. Strategic Direction: Mentions can indicate a company’s strategic plans or investments in the crypto sector. Therefore, tracking the frequency of crypto mentions in SEC filings provides a valuable pulse on both institutional adoption and regulatory focus. Breaking Down the Record-Breaking Numbers According to data cited by The Block, April 2025 marked a significant milestone: Total Mentions: SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ hit a record 786 . Month-over-Month Growth: This represented a substantial 38% increase compared to March 2025. Year-over-Year Growth: The numbers were also up by 8% compared to April 2024. This isn’t just a small uptick; a 38% jump in a single month is quite dramatic and suggests a rapid acceleration in companies feeling the need (or being required) to acknowledge their connection to the crypto world in their formal disclosures. Stablecoins Take Center Stage: A Double in Mentions The report also highlighted another crucial trend: mentions of stablecoins have more than doubled in recent months. Why the sudden surge in stablecoin focus? Stablecoins , digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset (like the US dollar), have attracted significant regulatory attention globally. The increased mentions in SEC filings likely reflect: Systemic Risk Concerns: Regulators worry about the potential impact of large, widely used stablecoins on financial stability if they were to fail or lose their peg. Reserve Standards: There’s intense scrutiny on what assets back stablecoins and whether these reserves are sufficient and transparent. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users understand the risks associated with stablecoins and that issuers operate responsibly is a key regulatory goal. Companies involved with issuing, holding, or facilitating transactions with stablecoins are clearly taking these concerns seriously and disclosing them in their official documents. What Does This Surge in SEC Filings Tell Us? The dramatic rise in crypto and stablecoin mentions in SEC filings paints a clear picture of the current state of the digital assets market’s interaction with traditional finance and regulation. It primarily signals: Growing Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC is clearly paying close attention to how companies interact with crypto. This could precede or coincide with increased enforcement actions or new regulations. Increased Institutional Engagement: More companies, beyond just native crypto firms, are getting involved with cryptocurrency and need to disclose this. This could include banks, payment processors, tech companies, and even non-financial corporations exploring crypto for treasury management or services. Maturation of the Asset Class: As digital assets become more integrated into the broader financial system, they naturally become a more frequent topic in formal financial disclosures. Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities This heightened visibility in SEC filings presents both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry and traditional businesses engaging with it. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The increase in mentions reflects, in part, the ongoing lack of clear, comprehensive crypto regulation in many jurisdictions, forcing companies to disclose potential risks broadly. Compliance Burden: Companies must invest significant resources in understanding and complying with evolving disclosure requirements related to digital assets . Potential for Negative Sentiment: Disclosing risks, while necessary, can sometimes be interpreted negatively by investors unfamiliar with the asset class. Opportunities: Increased Clarity (Eventually): The focus from regulators, while sometimes challenging, is a necessary step towards establishing clear rules of the road, which could ultimately foster greater confidence and adoption. Legitimization: The fact that major companies are discussing cryptocurrency and stablecoins in formal SEC filings lends legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and investors. Informed Investment: Greater disclosure allows investors to make more informed decisions about companies with crypto exposure. What Should Investors and Businesses Do? Actionable Insights Given this trend, what are the practical takeaways? For Investors: Pay attention to SEC filings of companies you invest in or are considering investing in. Search for terms like ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘digital assets’, ‘stablecoins’, and ‘blockchain’ to understand their exposure and disclosed risks. For Crypto Businesses: Ensure robust internal controls and legal counsel are in place to navigate potential future crypto regulation and disclosure requirements. Transparency is key. For Traditional Businesses Engaging with Crypto: Work closely with legal and compliance teams to accurately assess and disclose material risks and involvements with digital assets in your formal filings. Conclusion: A Clear Signal of Mainstream Integration The record number of mentions of cryptocurrency and stablecoins in SEC filings is far more than just a statistical anomaly. It’s a powerful indicator of how deeply digital assets are becoming integrated into the considerations of publicly traded companies and, by extension, the traditional financial system. While increased regulatory focus can bring challenges, this surge in formal disclosure ultimately represents a step towards greater transparency and, potentially, clearer crypto regulation in the future. It signals that crypto is no longer on the fringes; it’s a topic requiring serious attention from boardrooms to regulatory bodies.

Speaking recently on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump emphasized crypto’s resilience and importance. “Crypto is too important to ignore,” Trump said, calling out the Biden administration’s inconsistent stance on the asset class. Trump also downplayed personal gains from the Official TRUMP token, stating, “I haven’t even looked,” when asked if he would contribute crypto-related earnings.

44210920,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157445,1746489625,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial SEC Delay Hits Canary Spot Litecoin ETF Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-litecoin-etf/,"The world of cryptocurrency investments is constantly evolving, with the prospect of regulated financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being a major focus. Investors keen on gaining exposure to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts have been closely watching regulatory bodies, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A recent development has introduced a new layer of anticipation: the SEC delay on a significant filing. What is the Latest on the Litecoin ETF ? According to reports, specifically from Solid Intel on X, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its ruling on the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF. This particular filing seeks approval for an ETF that would directly hold Litecoin (LTC), mirroring the structure of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The delay means that the SEC requires more time to review the proposal before making a final determination – whether to approve, disapprove, or potentially delay it further. This is a standard part of the regulatory process for complex financial products like cryptocurrency-based ETFs, but each delay adds to the market’s anticipation and, at times, uncertainty. Why Does an SEC Decision Matter for a Spot ETF ? The SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When considering a Spot ETF for an asset like Litecoin, the commission evaluates several factors: Market Surveillance: Can the market for the underlying asset (Litecoin) be adequately monitored to prevent manipulation? Investor Protection: Are there sufficient safeguards in place to protect retail investors? Product Structure: Is the ETF’s design sound and compliant with existing securities laws? Liquidity and Valuation: Is there reliable pricing data and sufficient liquidity for the underlying asset? An approval from the SEC is seen as a significant step towards mainstream acceptance for a cryptocurrency. It provides a regulated, accessible investment vehicle that bypasses the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or navigating exchanges. This is why the outcome of any SEC decision regarding a crypto Spot ETF is closely watched by investors and the industry alike. How Does This SEC Delay Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The path to getting a crypto Spot ETF approved in the U.S. has been lengthy and marked by numerous delays and rejections. Bitcoin spot ETFs faced years of setbacks before finally receiving approval in January 2024. Ethereum spot ETFs are currently undergoing a similar process, with deadlines approaching and the potential for delays or even rejections still high. The delay on the Canary Litecoin ETF decision follows this established pattern. It underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to digital assets beyond Bitcoin, where they have expressed concerns about market size, surveillance capabilities, and potential manipulation. Key Considerations Following the Delay: Increased Review Time: The SEC is using the maximum allotted time under its rules to thoroughly examine the filing. Potential for Further Delays: Depending on the filing’s specifics and the SEC’s ongoing evaluation, additional delays are possible before a final decision is reached. Market Impact: While perhaps not as impactful as Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF news, a delay on a Litecoin filing can still contribute to broader market sentiment regarding regulatory progress for altcoins. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: This event highlights the continued need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the United States. What’s Next for the Proposed Canary Litecoin ETF ? Following this delay, the SEC will continue its review. There will be new deadlines established for the next steps in the process. These deadlines are statutory, meaning they are set by law, but the SEC has the power to extend them up to a certain point if they deem it necessary for a complete review. Market participants interested in the prospect of a Litecoin ETF will need to monitor official SEC announcements closely for updates on the new review timeline and the eventual decision. The outcome for this specific filing could also potentially influence the regulatory path for other smaller-cap altcoins seeking ETF approval in the future. Benefits and Challenges of a Crypto ETF Like Litecoin’s Potential Benefits: Accessibility: Easier access for traditional investors via brokerage accounts. Convenience: Eliminates the need for self-custody of crypto. Liquidity: ETFs typically trade on major exchanges, offering liquidity. Regulatory Oversight: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection than unregulated exchanges. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: As seen with this delay, getting approval is a significant challenge. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the underlying asset’s price due to fees and operational factors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall returns compared to direct ownership. Limited Control: Investors don’t directly own the underlying Litecoin, limiting options like staking or using it in DeFi protocols. Actionable Insight: Staying Informed For investors tracking the potential of a Litecoin ETF or other crypto investment products, the key action is to stay informed directly from official sources. Rely on announcements from the SEC and the ETF filers themselves rather than unverified reports for critical timeline information and decisions. Understanding the regulatory process provides valuable context for interpreting delays and potential outcomes. Summary: The Waiting Game Continues The U.S. SEC’s decision to delay the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF decision is a reminder that the regulatory journey for cryptocurrency investment products, particularly those tracking assets other than Bitcoin, remains ongoing and complex. While the delay is not a rejection, it signifies that the commission is taking its time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal.

Unstaked, a new crypto to invest in, is drawing interest not because of market swings but because of structure. Its AI agent-based platform provides a clear approach to on-chain interaction, linking rewards to actual performance instead of price moves. With its focus on use-case delivery, clear token design, and a presale that’s gaining speed, Unstaked brings a different kind of value. It may be the most under-the-radar project with the biggest potential right now. Ethereum (ETH) Activity Slows as Whales Wait at Technical Crossroads Ethereum (ETH) whales are stepping back as the asset nears a critical technical point. The volume of large ETH transactions between $1 million and $10 million has fallen recently, showing that major players are hesitant. This trend extends to mid-sized moves too, with activity in the $100,000 to $1 million range also decreasing, which points to rising caution. Traders are paying attention to an ascending triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart. A move above $1,840 could open the door for further gains. However, if the price slips below $1,690, the tone may shift toward selling pressure. Despite the quiet spell, Ethereum is still holding above the 200 EMA, a long-term support level for many technical watchers. With volumes tapering off and investors becoming more selective, ETH whales might be waiting for a stronger signal. The coming trading days may offer more clarity on which direction Ethereum will take next. Sui (SUI) Price Gains Point to $4.40 as Bullish Setup Builds Sui (SUI) is drawing a wave of attention with its latest price increase, and traders are now watching for a possible push toward $4.40. The token has already passed its $3.45 resistance level, and this move is backed by higher volume and positive signals from the RSI. The near-term test lies at $3.80, where another breakout could confirm further strength. This suggests a 26% upside from current prices, reinforcing positive market sentiment. The MACD also supports this view, showing growing interest from buyers and a potential continuation of the trend. As long as support near $3.20 holds, the setup looks ready for another upward push. Analysts believe $4.40 is within reach if momentum remains steady. With these indicators lining up, the recent Sui price surge is shaping up to be one of the more important developments this week. Could Unstaked Be the Next 27x Token? Unstaked is emerging as a new crypto to invest in, with early signs suggesting that a 27x return might not be out of reach. The platform brings together two of the most talked-about trends in blockchain AI and Web3 into one token-powered system. Its network is designed around autonomous agents that support real community growth. At its core is a “Proof of Intelligence” model that links each agent’s actions to on-chain data, offering rewards based on verified outcomes. This setup ties the token’s value to engagement rather than speculation. Now in stage 2 of its ai crypto presale and priced at $0.006695, Unstaked has raised nearly $1 million in just a few days. The expected launch price is $0.1819. If the AI and Web3 momentum continues, early participants could potentially see the price reach $0.67 to $0.70, pointing to a possible 27x return. What separates Unstaked from others is its focus on use, not just price. Its AI agents are expected to go live once the token launches, giving users the ability to earn $UNSD by deploying agents across platforms like X and Telegram. Along with a plan for decentralized governance and a public-first release, this adds utility to the token’s base. As interest in AI-linked platforms grows, Unstaked shows signs of being an early project with clear function and open metrics, making it one to watch for anyone seeking a real breakout opportunity. Why Unstaked May Outshine Popular Market Names Market trends often catch attention, but long-term value depends on use. Ethereum’s whale slowdown and Sui’s price moves show short-term momentum, but that alone may not bring lasting growth. Unstaked takes a different approach. It is building a space where performance earns rewards and AI agents support on-chain activity in a meaningful way. With its ai crypto presale still early and core features set for release at launch, the project is aiming to deliver more than a temporary jump. For those searching for a new crypto to invest in , Unstaked offers a model driven by structure, purpose, and early traction. That makes it stand out in a market where real action matters more than noise.

In a new report, Santiment says that memecoin mindshare is making a comeback despite the recent high-profile collapses of several assets in the sector. Santiment says that the rise in memecoin-centered discussions on social media suggests an increase in speculation and short-term investing mentality. “Memecoins, in particular, are once again gaining considerable attention. Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a ‘gamble’ mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach. Notice how social volume has been creeping up for top market cap meme coins, and declining for layer-1s and layer-2s. This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains.” Source: Santiment Santiment says that currently, the rise in online discussions about altcoins, altseasons and bull markets suggests that the crypto market will likely witness a correction. “Historically, the best times to invest in altcoins have been when crowd interest is between low and practically nonexistent. But at this current stage, with buzzwords like ‘altcoin,’ ‘altseason’ and ‘bull cycle’ trending, caution is advised, with retailers looking for any opportunity to buy minor dips. Markets move opposite to crowd expectations, so when the crowd’s excitement peaks, it often signals that prices are nearing exhaustion.” Source: Santiment Read the full Santiment report here .

While well-known names like Bittensor (TAO), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are gaining traction, a rising project called BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout. With solid foundations and strong presale performance, it’s drawing attention from across the crypto world. These projects are doing more than just gaining short-term attention. They are showcasing long-term use cases, from artificial intelligence to decentralized computing and scalable smart contracts. The stage is now set for a major move in crypto, and this shortlist captures the top trending crypto performers to follow closely. Bittensor (TAO): Technical Setup Looks Strong Bittensor (TAO) continues to hold its spot among the top trending crypto names this month. With a current price near $362.19 and a 7.72% daily jump, TAO has outpaced Bitcoin. The formation of a bullish pennant suggests a likely breakout, possibly taking the coin up to $451.07. That’s a projected 30% jump in the short term. Longer-term views are even more promising, with estimates ranging from $365 to $1,718 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential return of over 370%. Despite a neutral overall sentiment, price activity suggests growing market trust. As an AI-driven blockchain, TAO offers a unique angle. Its blend of deep learning and decentralized networks keeps it in the spotlight as one of the top trending crypto contenders in 2025. Render (RNDR): Fueling Decentralized Creativity Render (RNDR) has emerged as a key player in creative tech and decentralized GPU rendering. Its current price of $4.47 and a 12% rise over the past week puts it high on the list of top trending crypto projects. A sharp rise in trading volume by 79% shows increasing interest. The technical chart reveals a bullish reversal, with swing targets at $5.22, $6.21, and even beyond $7. Analysts expect RNDR to potentially reach $10.13 this year, delivering returns close to 50%. The project also shows a double-bottom pattern, which adds weight to its upward momentum. Render’s practical use in graphics, AI, and cloud computing gives it staying power in the 2025 crypto landscape. It’s one to watch as a top trending crypto with real-world purpose. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Bullish Pattern in Play NEAR Protocol has re-entered the top trending crypto charts thanks to a rebound from long-term support. At a current price of $2.38, the coin is forming an ascending triangle, suggesting an upcoming breakout if it crosses the $2.69 resistance line. Short-term price targets are set between $7 and $8, while the most bullish projections aim for $13. The RSI indicates a possible overbought condition, so short-term caution is advised. Still, exchange outflows and activity between $2.20 and $2.50 hint at rising demand. NEAR’s edge comes from its strong developer tools and efforts to boost scalability. As DeFi and cross-chain applications grow, NEAR could turn into a dark horse among top trending crypto choices in the coming months. BlockDAG Presale Surges Past $226M With Limited-Time Offer While other top trending crypto projects ride market waves, BlockDAG is building solid ground. Its presale has now raised over $226 million, with more than 19.7 billion coins sold. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, reflecting a profit of 2,520% from its start. A limited-time entry price of $0.0019 is available until May 13, before the launch price hits $0.05. BlockDAG ’s network offers full EVM support, letting Ethereum-based dApps migrate seamlessly. It uses DAG-based architecture to improve speed and scalability. More than 17,310 mining rigs have already been sold, and miner sales have topped $6.9 million. The project’s user base is also growing rapidly, with over 1 million X1 app users. Strategic tech partnerships with HackerEarth and SpaceDev strengthen its developer resources. It has secured listings on 10 centralized exchanges, creating a ready launchpad for mass adoption. BlockDAG isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting them. Its early infrastructure, massive user base, and unique offer price make it a standout in the current market. Among all top trending crypto projects, this one is building the strongest case for long-term relevance. Final Thoughts: Who Leads the Top Trending Crypto Race? As 2025 unfolds, coins like Bittensor, Render, and NEAR show why they remain top trending crypto players. Each has carved out a strong niche backed by real-world applications and solid technical charts. But BlockDAG is making a case of its own. With over $226 million raised and powerful features ready to go, it could leap ahead of more established names. It blends early access with real tech, giving it a strong shot at leading this year’s crypto race.

One remarkable project taking cues from Avalanche’s brilliance is Ruvi AI, which aims to redefine blockchain’s potential by integrating it seamlessly with artificial intelligence (AI). Promising to reshape industries and provide unparalleled opportunities, Ruvi AI is a platform to watch. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI brings a revolutionary approach to blockchain by marrying its transparency and security with the problem-solving power of AI. This unique blend creates a platform capable of addressing real-world problems, from enhancing supply chain efficiency to fraud detection and beyond. With blockchain ensuring immutable, safe, and transparent transactions, Ruvi AI adds value by harnessing AI to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and predict outcomes. Industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare can benefit greatly from Ruvi AI’s efficient solutions, which streamline operations and improve decision-making. Unlike many blockchain-centered projects, Ruvi AI focuses on being user-friendly. It offers tools that allow businesses to integrate its technology smoothly without disrupting their existing workflows. By prioritizing usability and practical outcomes, Ruvi AI stands out as more than just another innovation in the blockchain field. Historic Presale Achievements The excitement around Ruvi AI’s potential is already evident in its presale performance. Within days, the platform sold over 10 million tokens, raising more than $100,000. This achievement reflects investor confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision. Currently, Ruvi tokens are priced at just $0.01 in Phase 1. Early adopters enjoy access at this highly competitive rate, but time is of the essence. Phase 2 will see a 50% price increase, boosting token value to $0.015. This structured growth strategy mirrors Ruvi AI’s anticipated rise in popularity and demand. Adding credibility to its impressive presale progress, Ruvi AI has launched a beta version of its platform. By offering this early access, Ruvi AI demonstrates transparency and a commitment to its roadmap. The beta allows users to experience firsthand how blockchain and AI integrate seamlessly to solve challenges. VIP Tiers for Every Investor Ruvi AI further distinguishes itself through its rewarding VIP-tier program, designed to accommodate a diverse range of investors while offering substantial bonuses. Two notable tiers, VIP Tier 3 and VIP Tier 5, showcase the platform’s commitment to maximizing investor incentives. VIP Tier 2 Ideal for entry level investors, VIP Tier 2 requires holders to accumulate at least 50,000 RUVI tokens, which amounts to a $500 investment during Phase 1’s pricing of $0.01 per token. Participants in this tier earn a 40% bonus, adding 20,000 additional tokens to their holdings. This brings the total to 70,000 RUVI tokens. At the listing price of $0.07, the investment would be worth $4,900, and when Ruvi AI achieves its projected $1 valuation, the total value could soar to an eye-popping $70,000. VIP Tier 5 For committed investors seeking maximum rewards, VIP Tier 5 offers an unmatched opportunity. A minimum investment of 500,000 RUVI tokens, or $5,000, qualifies users for this tier during Phase 1. What sets VIP Tier 5 apart is its 100% bonus, doubling the investor’s holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, this amounts to $70,000. Should Ruvi AI’s valuation reach $1 per token, this investment could yield an extraordinary $1,000,000, showcasing the immense potential of deep engagement with Ruvi AI. Leaderboard Benefits for Early Adopters Ruvi AI’s presale doesn’t stop at boosting token holders directly. The platform has introduced a leaderboard rewards system to incentivize and recognize its top contributors. The Top10 contributors during the presale phase will each receive 500,000 RUVI tokens. At the conservative listing price of $0.07, this amount is worth $35,000. If Ruvi AI achieves its $1 valuation projection, this becomes a life-changing $500,000 reward. Similarly, the Top 50 contributors are awarded 250,000 RUVI tokens each. At $0.07, this reward equals $17,500, which would rise to $250,000 when the $1 valuation is met. Even those who secure a position in the Top 1000 receive 20,000 tokens, valued at $20,000 post listing.With such exciting incentives, Ruvi AI not only drives participation but also creates a strong sense of community and shared success. Pioneering the Future of Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is more than an innovative project; it is a bold leap toward a future where blockchain meets AI in ways that enhance productivity and transparency. Its seamless integration of these two disruptive technologies promises to redefine how industries function and how investors benefit. Whether it’s through its record-breaking presale, the accessible beta platform, or its lucrative reward tiers, Ruvi AI offers a unique opportunity at the cutting edge of technology and finance. For early investors and forward-thinking businesses, joining Ruvi AI’s movement represents a chance not just to adopt but to lead in this groundbreaking space.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space.

44211222,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157447,1746490222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Walkout: House Democrats Boycott Key Congressional Hearing on Crypto Regulation Over Trump Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/democrats-boycott-crypto-hearing/,"A political storm is brewing on Capitol Hill, set to impact the future of crypto regulation in the United United States. In a dramatic move, House Democrats are reportedly planning a walkout from a crucial congressional hearing focused on digital asset legislation. This unprecedented action highlights the deep political divisions currently shaping the debate around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Why the Planned Walkout by House Democrats? The planned walkout by House Democrats stems from significant concerns regarding former President Donald Trump’s increasing involvement and influence in the digital asset space. Led by figures like Rep. Maxine Waters, Democrats are voicing apprehension that the legislative process could be unduly influenced by interests tied to Mr. Trump. According to reports confirmed by a Democratic source, the intention is not merely to abstain but to stage a counter-hearing. This suggests a desire to control the narrative and present their own perspective on how crypto regulation should proceed, separate from the main committee proceedings they view with suspicion. The core of the Democrats’ concern appears to be the potential for the regulatory framework to be shaped in a way that benefits specific individuals or entities connected to the former president, rather than establishing clear, fair rules for the entire industry and protecting consumers. Navigating the Political Divide in a Congressional Hearing The scheduled congressional hearing is hosted by the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Republican French Hill. Chairman Hill has publicly urged his Democratic colleagues to participate, emphasizing that bipartisan discussions on crypto legislation have been ongoing. However, the Democrats’ planned boycott signals that, despite some areas of agreement, fundamental distrust and political maneuvering are overriding collaborative efforts. The committee’s work is critical as it involves reviewing a draft bill aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. This clash underscores the challenges inherent in legislating a complex and rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency within a highly polarized political environment. Reaching consensus on issues ranging from consumer protection and market integrity to innovation and national security is proving difficult. Examining the Draft Crypto Regulation Bill and Stablecoin Legislation The congressional hearing is specifically set to review a draft bill. While details of this particular draft are central to the hearing, it’s important to view it within the broader context of ongoing legislative efforts. For instance, recent attempts to pass dedicated stablecoin legislation have also faced significant hurdles and criticism, particularly from Democrats. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. However, concerns persist regarding their reserves, potential for systemic risk, and the appropriate regulatory oversight. The criticism directed at past stablecoin legislation attempts by Democrats indicates a pattern of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulatory approaches coming from across the aisle. This adds another layer of complexity to the already fraught landscape of digital asset policy. The Trump Crypto Factor: What’s the Connection? The direct link between the planned walkout and Trump crypto involvement is the stated reason by the Democratic source. While the exact nature of Mr. Trump’s current digital asset holdings or specific industry ties prompting this concern are not fully detailed in the initial report, his recent public statements and embrace of cryptocurrencies represent a shift. Having previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Mr. Trump has recently adopted a more favorable stance, even launching NFTs and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. This pivot, combined with his significant political influence, appears to have fueled Democratic fears about potential conflicts of interest or attempts to shape legislation to favor certain factions within the crypto space aligned with his interests. Understanding the perceived influence of Trump crypto activities is crucial to grasping the intensity of the political opposition now impacting legislative processes. Implications for Crypto Regulation and the Industry This political standoff and the potential boycott of a key congressional hearing carry significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Uncertainty surrounding regulation remains one of the biggest impediments to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. Challenges Highlighted by the Standoff: Delayed Clarity: Political gridlock slows down the creation of clear rules for digital assets, leaving businesses and investors in limbo. Fragmented Approach: A lack of bipartisan consensus could lead to piecemeal or ineffective regulation. Increased Political Risk: The industry becomes more susceptible to partisan battles and shifts in political winds. Perception Issues: Public perception of crypto can be negatively affected by association with intense political conflict. While the benefits of effective crypto regulation include greater consumer protection, market stability, and fostering innovation within clear boundaries, achieving this goal appears increasingly difficult amidst the current political climate. The planned walkout is a stark reminder that the path to comprehensive digital asset legislation in the U.S. is fraught with political peril. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US Crypto Policy The planned walkout by House Democrats from a vital congressional hearing on crypto regulation , explicitly linked to concerns over Trump crypto ties and set against the backdrop of ongoing debates like stablecoin legislation , marks a critical and potentially damaging moment for the future of digital asset policy in the United States. It underscores the deep political rifts that threaten to delay or derail efforts to create a clear and effective regulatory framework. As the crypto industry continues to grow, the need for regulatory clarity is paramount, yet this latest development suggests that political considerations may, for now, overshadow the collaborative effort required to achieve it. The coming days will reveal whether dialogue prevails or if this dramatic protest further entrenches the partisan divide, leaving the crypto landscape in the U.S. more uncertain than ever.

For those tracking the convergence of AI and blockchain, understanding the landscape of foundational AI models and the companies building them is crucial. This is where Mistral AI steps in, a French startup making significant waves. What is Mistral AI and Why Does it Matter? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI quickly positioned itself as a significant European tech contender. It’s often regarded as potentially the only European company capable of competing directly with OpenAI. Despite a valuation reported around $6 billion, its global market share is still developing. However, Mistral AI gained notable attention, particularly in France, with the launch of its AI assistant, Le Chat, on mobile app stores. French President Emmanuel Macron even publicly endorsed Le Chat, encouraging its use over competitors like ChatGPT. Mistral AI’s stated ambition is to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” emphasizing a commitment to openness in AI development. This stance offers an alternative perspective compared to some of the more closed approaches in the industry. The company faces the dual challenge of scaling to compete globally while upholding its self-defined goal of being a leading independent and environmentally conscious AI lab. Exploring Mistral AI’s Range of AI Models A core part of Mistral AI’s strategy is its diverse portfolio of AI models , catering to various needs. These models form the foundation of their offerings, including the Le Chat assistant. Here’s a look at some key models: Mistral Large 2: The company’s flagship large language model, replacing its predecessor. Pixtral Large: Introduced in 2024, this model is part of the multimodal Pixtral family, capable of processing more than just text. Codestral: A specialized Generative AI model designed specifically for generating and assisting with code. Les Ministraux: A family of smaller models optimized for deployment on edge devices like smartphones. Mistral Saba: A model specifically focused on the Arabic language. Mistral OCR: Launched in March 2025, this API converts PDFs into text files, aiding AI models in data ingestion. This range shows Mistral AI’s effort to cover different applications, from large-scale language processing to device-specific and specialized tasks. Is Mistral AI an OpenAI Competitor? The comparison to OpenAI is frequent and intentional. Mistral AI is actively building products and models that serve similar markets. Their chat assistant, Le Chat , is a direct alternative to ChatGPT. It saw rapid adoption after its mobile launch, reaching 1 million downloads in two weeks and topping app store charts in France. While OpenAI has a significant head start and market dominance, Mistral AI’s rapid development, strong funding, and political backing in Europe position it as a credible challenger. The competition isn’t just on features but also on philosophy, with Mistral AI advocating for greater openness in AI technology. Funding and Partnerships Driving Mistral AI’s Growth Mistral AI has demonstrated remarkable success in attracting investment since its founding. As of February 2025, the company had raised approximately €1 billion (around $1.04 billion). This includes: A record $112 million seed round in June 2023, valuing the one-month-old startup at $260 million. A Series A round of €385 million ($415 million) in December 2023, at a reported $2 billion valuation. A €600 million mix of equity and debt ($640 million) in June 2024, led by General Catalyst, valuing the company at $6 billion. These funding rounds, attracting major global investors like Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Nvidia, and Microsoft, underscore the market’s belief in Mistral AI’s potential. Strategic partnerships are also key to its growth and distribution. A significant deal in 2024 with Microsoft included a €15 million investment and distribution of Mistral AI’s models via the Azure platform. Other notable partnerships include agreements with Agence France-Presse (AFP), France’s army and job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. These collaborations help expand Mistral AI’s reach and integrate its technology into various sectors. The People Behind Mistral AI Mistral AI was founded by individuals with deep roots in AI research at major U.S. tech companies. The co-founders are: Arthur Mensch: CEO, previously worked at Google’s DeepMind. Timothée Lacroix: CTO, a former Meta staffer. Guillaume Lample: Chief Scientist Officer, also a former Meta staffer. Their background provides the technical expertise necessary to build frontier AI models . The founding team also includes notable advisers from the French tech and political scene, adding valuable strategic insight and connections. Mistral AI’s Open Source Approach Mistral AI adopts a mixed approach to open source. While some of its premier models are proprietary, with weights not available for commercial use, the company also offers free models with weights accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. An example is Mistral NeMo, a research model built and open-sourced in collaboration with Nvidia in July 2024. This dual strategy balances the need for proprietary models to generate revenue with a commitment to contributing to the open AI ecosystem. Monetization and Future Outlook Mistral AI generates revenue through several channels. While many initial offerings were free, monetization includes paid tiers for its Le Chat assistant, introduced in February 2025 with a Pro plan priced at $14.99 a month. For businesses, Mistral AI offers API access to its premier models with usage-based pricing and enterprise licensing options. Strategic partnerships also contribute significantly to revenue. Despite rapid growth and high valuation, reports suggest Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range, highlighting the challenge of translating valuation into revenue at this stage. Regarding the future, CEO Arthur Mensch stated in January 2025 that Mistral AI is “not for sale” and that an IPO is the plan. Given the substantial capital raised and the desire for European sovereignty in AI, an IPO appears to be the most likely path forward. However, realizing a valuation near $6 billion through an IPO will require substantial revenue growth in the coming years. The journey for Mistral AI is just beginning, and its progress will be closely watched as it navigates the competitive global AI landscape.

44211897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157450,1746491419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase PAXG Addition: Major Opportunity for Tokenized Gold,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-paxg-roadmap-addition/,"Get ready for potentially exciting developments in the world of tokenized assets! Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced a significant addition to its asset roadmap: PAX Gold (PAXG). This move has sparked considerable interest within the crypto community, hinting at the possibility of expanded access to gold-backed digital assets for millions of users. Understanding PAX Gold (PAXG): More Than Just a Crypto Before diving into the implications of the Coinbase roadmap inclusion, let’s clarify what PAX Gold (PAXG) actually is. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that are native digital creations, PAXG is a unique ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain that represents ownership of physical gold. Here’s a quick breakdown: Backed by Physical Gold: Each PAXG token is directly backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in secure, Brink’s vaults. Ownership Rights: Holding PAXG means you own the underlying physical gold. Token holders can even redeem their tokens for physical gold bars (though this typically involves minimums and logistical considerations). ERC-20 Token: It operates as a standard token on the Ethereum network, allowing for easy transfer and storage using compatible wallets. Think of PAXG as a digital wrapper around a physical asset, bringing the stability and historical value of gold into the modern, digital economy. This concept of tokenized gold is gaining traction as investors seek ways to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space. The Significance of the Coinbase Roadmap When Coinbase adds an asset to its roadmap, it’s a strong signal that the asset is under consideration for a potential future listing on the exchange. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate or even eventual listing, it indicates that the asset has passed initial reviews and meets certain criteria for further evaluation. For Coinbase , adding PAXG aligns with a broader trend of exchanges exploring and listing assets that bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized assets, particularly those backed by stable, real-world commodities like gold, offer a new avenue for user engagement and investment. What does this mean for PAXG specifically? Increased Visibility: Being on the Coinbase roadmap instantly puts PAXG in front of a massive global audience of crypto investors. Enhanced Legitimacy: Consideration by a regulated and prominent exchange like Coinbase adds a layer of credibility to PAXG and the broader tokenized gold concept. Potential Liquidity Boost: A future PAX Gold listing on Coinbase could dramatically increase trading volume and liquidity for the token. This move highlights Coinbase’s continued effort to expand its offerings beyond native cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, potentially paving the way for more real-world assets (RWAs) to be tokenized and traded on their platform. PAX Gold Listing: What to Expect Next? The inclusion on the Coinbase roadmap is just one step in a multi-stage process. There is no set timeline for when, or if, PAXG will move from the roadmap to an official listing announcement. Coinbase has a rigorous review process that considers various factors, including legal, compliance, technical, and market-related aspects. Investors and interested parties should keep a close watch on official announcements from both Coinbase and Paxos (the issuer of PAXG). Speculation around potential listing dates can be rampant, but reliable information will only come directly from the involved parties. Should a PAX Gold listing occur, here are some potential impacts: Easier Access: Millions of Coinbase users would gain direct access to buying, selling, and holding PAXG alongside their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets. Price Impact: Increased demand and liquidity from a major exchange listing often lead to price appreciation, though this is not guaranteed and depends on overall market conditions. Integration into Coinbase Ecosystem: If listed, PAXG could potentially be integrated into other Coinbase services, such as Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Card, or institutional offerings. Exploring PAXG Crypto: Benefits and Risks for Investors For investors considering adding PAXG to their portfolio, the potential accessibility via Coinbase makes exploring PAXG crypto a timely exercise. Investing in PAXG offers a unique blend of traditional asset exposure with crypto-native advantages. Potential Benefits: Gold Exposure: Gain direct exposure to the price movements of physical gold without the hassle of storage or insurance. Fractional Ownership: Unlike buying physical gold bars, you can buy fractions of a PAXG token, making gold investment accessible at lower price points. Liquidity: As a token on major exchanges, PAXG can potentially be bought and sold more easily than physical gold or certain gold investment vehicles. Portability & Transfer: Transferring PAXG is as simple as sending a crypto transaction, much easier than moving physical gold. Potential Hedge: Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, offering potential portfolio diversification benefits. Potential Risks & Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving and could impact PAXG. Smart Contract Risk: As an ERC-20 token, PAXG is subject to potential risks associated with the underlying blockchain technology and smart contracts. Counterparty Risk: While Paxos is a regulated trust company, there is still a degree of reliance on the issuer to manage the physical gold reserves and token mechanics. Market Volatility: While backed by gold, PAXG’s price can still experience volatility influenced by both gold market dynamics and overall crypto market sentiment. Fees: Be aware of potential network transaction fees (gas fees on Ethereum) and any exchange-specific trading or withdrawal fees. The Rise of Tokenized Gold and Real-World Assets The addition of PAXG to the Coinbase roadmap isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a larger trend towards the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). This involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space, such as real estate, art, commodities, or even equities. Why is tokenized gold , and RWAs in general, gaining traction? Increased Accessibility: Tokenization can break down large, illiquid assets into smaller, more accessible units. Improved Liquidity: Bringing assets onto a blockchain can facilitate easier trading on digital exchanges. Transparency: Ownership and transaction history can be recorded on a public ledger. Efficiency: Streamlining processes like transfer of ownership and settlement. PAXG is a leading example in the tokenized commodity space. A successful listing and adoption on a platform like Coinbase could significantly boost confidence in the RWA sector and encourage the tokenization of other asset classes. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this development, what steps should you consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand exactly how PAXG works, its backing mechanism, and the reputation of its issuer, Paxos. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep an eye on Coinbase’s official channels for any updates regarding a potential PAXG listing. Assess Your Portfolio: Consider whether exposure to gold, via a tokenized asset like PAXG, aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with both crypto investments and tokenized assets. The roadmap addition is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to approach any potential investment with caution and a thorough understanding of the asset. Compelling Summary Coinbase’s decision to add PAX Gold (PAXG) to its asset roadmap is a noteworthy development for both the token itself and the broader tokenized gold market. It signals potential future accessibility for millions of users on one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, offering a new avenue for investors seeking exposure to gold within the digital asset space. While not a guarantee of listing, this step underscores the growing importance of tokenized real-world assets in the crypto ecosystem. As the process unfolds, staying informed and conducting diligent research will be key for anyone interested in this exciting convergence of traditional commodities and blockchain technology.

Crypto Market Has Enjoyed Net Capital Inflows Over The Past Month In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the capital inflows for cryptocurrencies. In the digital asset sector, capital mainly flows in and out through three asset classes: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. The altcoins usually only see a secondary rotation of capital from these coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sandwiched Between Major Support & Resistance Levels—Can Bulls Win Out? As such, the netflows related to the three of BTC, ETH and the stables can provide a sufficient-enough estimation for the situation of the entire cryptocurrency market. For calculating the capital inflows/outflows related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the “Realized Cap” indicator can be used. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that finds the total value of any asset’s supply by assuming the value of each individual token as the same as its last transaction price. This is different from the usual Market Cap, which just sums up the supply at the current spot price. In short, what the Realized Cap reflects is the amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole have put into it. Changes related to the metric, therefore, reflect the inflow or outflow of capital. In the case of the stablecoins, the change in the Market Cap is enough to gauge the capital netflow. This is down to the fact that the Realized Cap is no different from the Market Cap for them, as a result of their price never varying from the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day aggregate cryptocurrency market netflow based on these indicators over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the combined 30-day Bitcoin and Ethereum Realized Cap change is currently at a positive $12.58 billion. This means that these two cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a notable net capital inflow during the past month. Similarly, the stablecoins have seen a net inflow of $6.19 billion in the same period. Thus, it seems the digital asset sector as a whole has witnessed the incoming of $18.77 billion in capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selling Expected Around This Level, Report Says While this trend has occurred, Bitcoin and the other assets have gone through their price recovery runs, so it’s possible that as long as these inflows keep up, the rallies could be sustainable. It only remains to be seen how the investors will behave in the coming days, however, as it often doesn’t take much for sentiment to shift in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,200, down 1% in the last seven days.

Here are the key figures: Direct XRP Holdings: Ripple reported holding 4.56 billion XRP tokens. This represents the amount of XRP directly controlled by the company, outside of its escrow accounts. Quarter-over-Quarter Change: Compared to the end of Q4 2024, these direct holdings saw a modest increase of 1.7%. While seemingly small, any change in a holding of this magnitude is noteworthy. XRP in Escrow: The report also detailed the amount of XRP held in cryptographic escrow accounts. These accounts are designed to release a set amount of XRP back to Ripple on a predetermined schedule, adding predictability to the supply. As of the end of Q1 2025, escrow holdings stood at 37.1 billion XRP. This figure decreased from the previous quarter as tokens were released from escrow. Understanding both direct holdings and escrow is essential to grasp Ripple’s overall potential influence on the XRP supply and market dynamics. The escrow mechanism is a key feature of the XRP Ledger designed to manage the release of the total XRP supply over time. How Do We Calculate the XRP Market Value of Ripple’s Holdings? Putting a dollar value on digital asset holdings requires using the prevailing market price at a specific point in time. According to the report, the XRP market value used for calculation was based on the price of $2.15 per token as of March 31, 2025. Using this price, the value of Ripple’s direct holdings of 4.56 billion XRP comes out to approximately $98.6 billion. This nearly $99 billion valuation underscores the immense financial stake Ripple has in the success and value of the XRP ecosystem. It’s important to remember that market prices for cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and this valuation is a snapshot in time. The actual dollar value fluctuates constantly with the market. While the direct holdings value is substantial, the vast amount of XRP still locked in escrow represents a much larger potential future value for the company as those tokens are released over time, assuming the price of XRP remains stable or increases. Beyond Holdings: What Else Did the Ripple Q1 2025 Report Highlight? The Q1 2025 report wasn’t just about token counts and valuations. It also shed light on Ripple’s strategic corporate moves, indicating a proactive approach to expanding its business lines and market reach. These Ripple business updates are critical for understanding the company’s long-term vision. Two significant points highlighted in the report, as noted by sources like U.Today, were: Acquisition of Hidden Road: Ripple successfully completed the acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm. This move is significant as it expands Ripple’s institutional offerings and capabilities, particularly in the areas of trading, financing, and prime brokerage services for digital assets. Acquiring established financial infrastructure can accelerate Ripple’s push into serving larger institutional clients. Ongoing Interest in Acquiring Circle: The report also reiterated Ripple’s continued interest in acquiring Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. While not a completed deal, expressing this interest publicly (or having it reported) signals Ripple’s ambition to play a major role in the stablecoin market and potentially integrate USDC into its payment solutions. An acquisition of Circle would be transformative for Ripple, significantly broadening its product suite and regulatory footprint. These strategic acquisitions and potential acquisitions demonstrate Ripple’s focus on building a comprehensive suite of financial services built around digital assets, extending beyond just cross-border payments facilitated by XRP. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Crypto Investment News? For anyone involved in the digital asset space, especially those holding or considering XRP, this crypto investment news from Ripple’s Q1 2025 report offers several key takeaways: Transparency: Ripple continues to provide quarterly reports detailing its XRP holdings and sales, which is a level of transparency welcomed by many in the crypto community. This helps manage expectations regarding potential supply increases from the company. Company Strength: A nearly $99 billion valuation of direct XRP holdings (at the time of the report) indicates significant underlying value for the company itself, separate from its operational revenue. This financial strength can fuel further investment, development, and strategic acquisitions. Strategic Expansion: The acquisitions of firms like Hidden Road and the pursuit of others like Circle show a clear strategy to diversify and strengthen Ripple’s position in the broader digital finance ecosystem. These moves could potentially increase the utility and adoption of Ripple’s technologies, which proponents argue could positively impact XRP in the long run. Market Influence: While Ripple has reduced its programmatic sales of XRP over time, the sheer volume of their holdings means their actions regarding these assets are always relevant to market participants. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. The release of XRP from escrow, while scheduled, adds a predictable supply increase that the market must absorb. Furthermore, the success of Ripple’s new ventures and acquisitions will depend on execution and market adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ripple and XRP? The Q1 2025 report paints a picture of a company actively leveraging its resources (including its XRP holdings) to grow and diversify. The focus on institutional services through acquisitions like Hidden Road, and the ambition shown by targeting a major stablecoin player like Circle, suggests Ripple is aiming to be a central figure in the future of digital finance, not just cross-border payments. The value of Ripple XRP holdings is intrinsically linked to the market performance of XRP. While Ripple’s business success doesn’t directly guarantee an increase in XRP’s price (as price is driven by many factors including speculation, utility adoption, and macro trends), a strong and expanding Ripple ecosystem could potentially contribute to increased demand and utility for the digital asset over time. Investors and market watchers will be closely watching how these acquisitions integrate into Ripple’s existing business and what further strategic moves the company makes. The regulatory environment also remains a significant factor influencing both Ripple’s operations and the perception of XRP. In Conclusion: Ripple’s Q1 2025 report demonstrates the company’s robust financial position, highlighted by the substantial value of its XRP holdings, and signals aggressive strategic expansion through key acquisitions. While the nearly $99 billion valuation is impressive, it’s the underlying business growth and diversification efforts that truly underscore Ripple’s ambitions in the evolving digital finance landscape.

Many people are exploring AI tools, specifically AI Chatbots, for quick health information, especially with long waits for traditional care. However, a recent study highlights significant challenges users face when seeking useful health advice from these systems. Why is Getting Health Advice from AI Chatbots Difficult? According to a study led by Oxford researchers, there’s a “two-way communication breakdown” when people use AI Chatbots for health advice. Users struggle to provide the right information, and the chatbots often give answers that are hard to understand or contain a mix of good and bad recommendations. This means people using chatbots didn’t make better decisions about potential health issues compared to those using traditional online searches or their own knowledge. What Did the Chatbot Study Involve? The Chatbot Study included about 1,300 participants in the UK. They were given medical scenarios written by doctors and asked to identify possible conditions and actions using chatbots and other methods. The study tested popular models like GPT-4o, Cohere’s Command R+, and Meta’s Llama 3. The findings were concerning: Participants were less likely to identify relevant health conditions when using chatbots. They were more likely to underestimate the severity of conditions they did identify. Users often left out key details when querying the chatbots. Chatbot responses frequently blended helpful information with poor suggestions. The Push for Medical AI in Healthcare Despite these challenges, major tech companies continue to develop Medical AI applications for healthcare. Apple is reportedly working on tools for exercise, diet, and sleep advice. Amazon is exploring AI to analyze medical data for social health factors. Microsoft is assisting in building AI to manage patient messages for care providers. However, the medical community and AI companies themselves express caution. The American Medical Association advises against doctors using chatbots for clinical decisions, and companies like OpenAI warn against using their chatbots for diagnoses. Risks of Relying on AI Healthcare Tools for Self-Diagnosis The study underscores the risks of relying on current AI Healthcare tools for self-diagnosis. Misidentifying conditions or underestimating their seriousness can lead to delayed or incorrect treatment, potentially worsening health outcomes. Experts recommend using trusted sources for health decisions. Moving Forward with AI in Health Experts suggest that, like new medications, AI systems intended for healthcare use should undergo thorough testing in real-world settings before widespread deployment. Current evaluation methods don’t fully capture the complexity of human interaction with these tools. Conclusion While the potential for AI in healthcare is significant, this Chatbot Study highlights the current limitations of AI Chatbots for providing reliable Health Advice. Users face difficulties in interacting effectively with these tools, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes when seeking Medical AI for self-diagnosis within AI Healthcare systems. Caution and reliance on professional medical guidance remain essential.

From crushing it in the market to finally closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, Ripple’s start to the year has been exciting. SEC Case Closed: Ripple Walks Away a Winner In one of the biggest stories of the year for crypto, the SEC officially dropped its appeal against Ripple, bringing their multi-year legal fight to an end. The regulator also agreed to lower the proposed penalty from $125 million to $50 million and asked the court to cancel the injunction against Ripple. And it’s not just Ripple catching a break. The new U.S. government has already rolled back some of the old restrictions on crypto. A $1.25 Billion Power Move The company bought Hidden Road, a global prime broker, for a whopping $1.25 billion. The deal gives Ripple new tools to expand its institutional services. Hidden Road will start using Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as collateral and will rely on the XRP Ledger for faster and cheaper post-trade operations in foreign exchange, swaps, and repo markets. Ripple’s XRP Holdings on the Rise By the end of March 2025, Ripple held 4.56 billion XRP, up from 4.48 billion at the start of the year. Another 37.13 billion XRP remains locked in escrow, gradually releasing over the next 42 months. XRPL Activity Cools, but DeFi Stays Strong After a big spike in late 2024, on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger settled down a bit. Transaction numbers and new wallet creations both dropped about 30–40%, which tracks with what’s been happening across the broader crypto market. But one bright spot stood out — DeFi activity held up better than most blockchains. Trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) only dipped by 16%, while other major chains saw much steeper drops. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin also gained ground, crossing a $90 million market cap with over $300 million traded on DEXs. XRP Outperforms the Market While Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled for gains in Q1, XRP stole the spotlight. It jumped nearly 50% in early February and held steady while other big names dropped. Even with market ups and downs, XRP proved to be one of the strongest-performing assets in the space. The numbers tell the story. XRP-based investment products saw $37.7 million in inflows in just three months, pushing its 2025 total to $214 million — now just $1 million away from surpassing Ethereum’s global funds. But there’s one big change — after eight years of publishing these detailed reports, Ripple announced this will be the final one in its current format. The company says it’s time to evolve how it communicates with the market. “After careful consideration, Ripple has made the decision to sunset the report in its current form starting in Q2 2025,” the report read.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 00:54:15

This comes after the agency delayed several other applications for spot crypto ETFs last week, including XRP, Hedera, and Dogecoin but hadn’t done so for the Canary Litecoin ETF, sparking hopes that the regulator might have different plans for this fund. But on Monday, the official deadline, the regulator announced the delay and asked for public comments regarding the proposal’s compliance with regulatory requirements. ""In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,"" the agency wrote in a filing . Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. LTC, which stands at a $6.6 billion market cap, is the native cryptocurrency of Litecoin, an open-source blockchain project whose code is copied from Bitcoin’s (BTC).

History shows that many of the biggest gains came not from chasing hype, but from recognizing fundamentals before the crowd. Cardano (ADA) was once that quiet opportunity, trading below $0.05 back in early 2020 — before going on a multi-year rally that surprised even seasoned traders. Today, some analysts are pointing to another early-stage token following a similar path: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently available at $0.025 through its presale, MUTM is drawing serious attention from investors who believe it shares ADA’s early DNA — not in branding or community culture, but in development-first focus, real utility, and a token model built for long-term traction. And if forecasts are accurate, MUTM could hit the $1 mark much faster than ADA ever did. Why MUTM’s Position Resembles Early ADA Cardano’s breakout wasn’t overnight. It came after years of consistent network upgrades, peer-reviewed research, and increasing utility. The reason ADA saw such strong growth was because it transitioned from speculation to actual ecosystem adoption. Mutuum Finance is at a similar crossroads. Though still in development, its foundations are already attracting serious participants in the decentralized finance space. Mutuum Finance is fundamentally a non-custodial protocol designed for lending and borrowing, with a clear focus on ease of use, transparent operations, and generating passive income for participants. Instead of just issuing a token and promising returns, the team has built a structure where utility is baked into the user experience. Participants can deposit assets into the platform, receive mtTokens in return, and earn interest over time. These mtTokens act as a user’s share of the liquidity pool, passively tracking interest as long as they hold them. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies, Mutuum isn’t designed around speculation. It’s engineered to offer practical tools to users — allowing access to on-chain liquidity without giving up asset ownership. Whether for passive income or capital deployment, the platform gives investors ways to stay flexible while putting their assets to work. Momentum behind MUTM is growing quickly. The presale has already raised over $7.5 million, with more than 9,300 holders now on board and over 440 million tokens sold. MUTM is currently priced at $0.025, though the upcoming presale stage will increase it to $0.03, with the official launch price already set at $0.06. That means early participants are locking in a 2.4x return even before listings go live. But many believe that’s just the start. The $1 forecast isn’t built on empty projections — it’s based on a blend of platform potential and investor behavior. Once the token hits exchanges and the beta version of the Mutuum platform launches, user adoption is expected to grow quickly. As more participants engage with the system, interest from borrowers generates yield for depositors, and revenue for the protocol increases. This revenue isn’t left idle either. A portion of it is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to active users — creating a feedback loop that supports demand while rewarding long-term engagement. It’s a practical, scalable system that closely mirrors what successful DeFi cryptos have done — but in a cleaner, more streamlined way. When MUTM climbs from its current $0.025 price to $1, that would mark a 3,900% surge in value. For example, a $1,250 investment today would secure around 50,000 MUTM tokens. At $1, that’s $50,000 — a transformation that resembles ADA’s early returns and explains why so many are keeping a close eye on this token. Another key point working in MUTM’s favor is its upcoming stablecoin — an overcollateralized asset minted from supplied collateral. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this one will be fully decentralized and algorithmically backed by on-chain assets. All interest from stablecoin borrowing will feed into Mutuum’s treasury, reinforcing platform health and sustainability. The protocol is also undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the most trusted names in smart contract verification. This move adds an additional layer of credibility and is a clear signal that the team is focused on long-term viability and user trust. ADA’s journey to the top was built on strong fundamentals. Today, MUTM stands at a similar moment. It has the product vision, the early community, and the groundwork to build something meaningful in DeFi. And with the token still priced at just $0.025, many believe this could be one of the best cryptocurrency investments to make before the next market wave hits. With analysts already forecasting a potential move to $1, and platform infrastructure set to go live around launch, the opportunity here isn’t just early — it’s ticking.

The latest Chainlink (LINK) price update shows promise, but it’s stuck just below $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has pulled it to $1,780, shaking market confidence. These two might recover, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is locking in wins. It just passed its CertiK audit, proving top-tier security, and has already sold over 19.6 billion coins. Unlike LINK and ETH, BlockDAG is not waiting for charts to turn it’s already delivering. With a 2520% ROI and a $0.0019 entry open until May 13, it is ranked as the top crypto to buy right now. Chainlink (LINK) Price Update: Will the $15.30 Barrier Finally Break? Chainlink (LINK) price update shows bullish momentum after weeks of sideways trading. Currently at $15.02, LINK is testing the key $15.30 resistance. A breakout here could send the price toward $17. The technical setup includes an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and an EMA crossover, both hinting at rising buying pressure. However, the breakout needs confirmation with a strong move above $15.30. If that fails, Chainlink might stay between $14.50 and $15.30. On the data side, exchange reserves dropped 1.03%, a positive sign, but a 37.46% spike in netflows hints at possible short-term selling. For now, the Chainlink (LINK) price update stays cautiously optimistic. Traders are watching the next Chainlink (LINK) price update. Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Follows Sharp 2.59% Daily Decline Ethereum (ETH) price drop hit hard on April 30, 2025, falling 2.59% to $1,780.25. This happened during a low-volume trading day with rising market uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) price drop also pulled its market cap down by 2.70%, landing at $214.93 billion. Volume dropped nearly 10%, showing a slowdown in trader activity. RSI now shows neutrality, with traders watching for the next move. ETH’s supply stayed stable at 120.73 million tokens, signalling no inflation pressure. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair bounced back from its monthly low of 0.0180 BTC and now holds steady above 0.0185 BTC. This level is key. If it holds, Ethereum could aim for higher resistance areas, but rising volatility keeps things uncertain. CertiK Verified: BlockDAG Locks in Top-Tier Smart Contract Security BlockDAG has officially cleared the CertiK audit – a major milestone that highlights its serious commitment to blockchain security. As one of the most trusted names in blockchain verification, CertiK’s involvement brings confidence and credibility to the project. This isn’t just a rubber stamp. It’s the final stage of BlockDAG’s rigorous three-tier security strategy designed to protect its treasury and vesting smart contracts. The project doesn’t stop at technical checks; it extends protection through strict internal controls, organizational safeguards, and an ongoing partnership with CertiK for deeper code review and continuous monitoring. Security is the backbone of BlockDAG’s architecture. With its frequent audits, and strict listing protocols, BlockDAG is building a network where trust isn’t just promised, it’s enforced. This level of readiness, especially before launch, puts BlockDAG in a different league. The numbers back it up. BDAG has already crossed 19.6 billion coins sold. ROI from Batch 1 to Batch 28 stands at 2520%. With the launch price set at $0.05, the current limited-time entry point of $0.0019 (available until May 13) is turning heads. All signs point to BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy right now. Crypto Moves That Deserve Attention The Chainlink (LINK) price update reflects cautious optimism, but the $15.30 resistance still holds firm. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has slowed its momentum, with no clear signal of recovery yet. While these two remain uncertain, BlockDAG continues to deliver results. It has successfully completed its CertiK audit, reinforcing strong smart contract security. With over 19.6 billion coins sold and a 2520% ROI from early batches, the numbers show steady growth. The current $0.0019 entry price is available until May 13, offering one last window before listings begin. All signs point to BlockDAG being the top crypto to buy right now—based on real progress, not speculation.

According to information inadvertently published on their website and a blog post that briefly appeared, the evolution of their design language is moving from “Material 3” to something called “Material Design 3 Expressive.” The core idea behind this update is to create interfaces that are not only functional but also emotionally resonant and delightful to use. While the full details are still under wraps until the official reveal at Google I/O , the leaked information points to key characteristics: Bold Use of Shape and Color: Expect interfaces that are visually striking and use these elements to guide the user and create memorable interactions. Emotional Connection: The goal is to move beyond purely functional design to interfaces that users feel a positive connection with. Improved Usability: The design aims to draw attention to key elements and actions, potentially making apps easier and faster to navigate. This evolution impacts app developers directly, influencing how they build and customize experiences, and ultimately affecting the overall User Experience for everyone using an Android device. Tracing the Evolution: From Material Design to Material You To understand Material 3 Expressive, it helps to look back at Google’s design history. The journey began in 2014 with the introduction of Material Design . This open-source system provided a comprehensive guide for developers on creating user interfaces across Android, covering visual style, motion, and interaction patterns. The system received a significant update in May 2021 with the reveal of “Material You,” also known as Material You (or Material 3). This version introduced a new level of personalization. A prime example is the dynamic color feature, where the entire Android interface could adapt its color scheme based on the user’s chosen wallpaper. This made the device feel more personal and unique to the individual. Material 3 Expressive appears to be an iteration building upon the foundation of Material You , pushing the boundaries further into the realm of emotional and visually engaging design rather than being a complete overhaul. Why Focus on Expressive User Experience? The leaked blog post offered insights into the research behind this design shift. Studies indicated that people often prefer a more expressive design style because it actually improves usability. By using bold shapes and colors, the design can effectively highlight important elements and user actions. Google noted that this approach leads to “significant gains in performance” because users can more quickly identify and interact with what they need. Interestingly, Google also highlighted that this type of expressive design can make using apps easier for older adults. By making key elements more prominent and visually distinct, it helps level the playing field, ensuring that the User Experience is accessible and intuitive for people of all ages. However, Google did caution that expressive design isn’t a universal solution. Developers still need to adhere to established design patterns and standards while incorporating these new expressive elements. It requires a thoughtful approach to ensure the design is both expressive and functional. What to Expect at Google I/O? The accidental blog post, initially spotted by 9to5Google and saved via the Wayback Machine, has since been removed. However, the presence of a session titled “Build next-level UX with Material 3 Expressive” in the official Google I/O schedule confirms the upcoming reveal. Developers attending this session will learn how to leverage these “new emotional design patterns” to enhance engagement, usability, and the overall appeal of their products. Google plans to release files and alpha code during the conference, allowing developers to start experimenting with Material 3 Expressive ahead of its wider public release. This early access is crucial for the ecosystem to adapt and begin implementing the new Android Design principles. Conclusion: A More Emotional Android Future? The leak of Material 3 Expressive details gives us an exciting glimpse into the future of Android Design . Moving beyond pure function, Google is pushing towards interfaces that connect with users emotionally, using bold visuals and thoughtful design to create delightful and highly usable experiences. This focus on expressive User Experience promises benefits for users of all ages and presents developers with powerful new tools to build engaging apps. The full picture will emerge at Google I/O , but the direction is clear: Android is aiming for a richer, more personal, and more emotional visual identity.

In a May 5 letter to a Manhattan federal court, lawyers for Samourai co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill said prosecutors disclosed that the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) representatives told them six months before they charged the pair “that under FinCEN’s guidance, the Samourai Wallet app would not qualify as a ‘Money Services Business’ requiring a FinCEN license.” “Shockingly, six months later, the same prosecutors criminally charged Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill with operating just such a business without a FinCEN license,” the lawyers added. The letter claimed that prosecutors were required to share their discussions with FinCEN over Samourai two weeks after they unsealed charges, making the deadline May 8 last year, but instead “suppressed this information for over a year, disclosing it only on April 1, 2025.” Prosecutors charged Samourai CEO Rodriguez and its technology chief Hill with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering conspiracy in February 2024, unsealing the charges and arresting the pair in April that year. Samourai’s mixing service took crypto from multiple users and blended it together to hide its origins. The government alleged the platform helped with over $2 billion in illegal transactions and facilitated over $100 million worth of money laundering transactions from online black markets and scammers. Rodriguez and Hill both pleaded not guilty. In the letter, their lawyers said prosecutors shared details of a call with Kevin O’Connor, chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente. According to an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the call, FinCEN said that “because Samourai does not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].” An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListener The email said O’Connor and Valente agreed that the government could try to argue that Samourai functionally controlled the crypto, “but that has never been addressed in the guidance, and so it could be a difficult argument” for prosecutors. Samourai’s lawyers asked the court for a hearing “to determine the circumstances surrounding the Government’s late disclosure” and to administer a remedy. Samourai to renew dismissal bid if case goes on Rodriguez and Hill’s lawyers said that, using this latest information, they would again ask for the charges to be dismissed, arguing they lacked fair notice and “understood they were acting lawfully.” Related: US Treasury’s OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions, judge rules Prosecutors and Samourai asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider potentially dismissing the case after the Justice Department rolled back its crypto enforcement. Rodriguez and Hill bid to dismiss the case in early April, arguing it should be dropped as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an April 7 memo that the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In the latest letter, their lawyers said if the government “were to resist the Blanche Memo’s directive and push forward,” then they would bid to dismiss as “if they were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance, then they could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.” Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-06 01:17:18

This week, XRP dropped slightly by about 0.3%. While some cryptocurrencies saw a bit of selling, this small dip in XRP isn’t a big concern for most investors. The price is still holding above key support levels. There’s still uncertainty about whether XRP has started its next big move up. On smaller timeframes, no clear breakout has formed yet, though the price is making higher highs and higher lows — a positive sign. Price Correction Could Be Ending Crypto analyst Dark Defender said that XRP recently faced resistance at $2.22 and $2.36, with the price pulling back to $2.13. He believes this pullback was expected and that the market is preparing for the next move up, as long as XRP holds above the $2.00 level. Dark Defender also shared his long-term outlook. He said XRP is in the final phase of a fifth wave structure and expects this to lead to higher prices. He predicts the first move toward $3, followed by further gains with targets of $4.40 and $6.30 if the pattern continues. The key support to watch in the short term is $1.88. However, some analysts warn that short-term trends are still unclear. The recent price movement has been choppy, and there is no strong sign of an upward impulse yet.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

The SEC’s most recent action comes after the regulator decided to postpone verdicts on active altcoin ETF filings until June 17. The agency is seeking public comments on whether the listing proposal satisfies regulatory requirements, specifically preventing deceptive and manipulative practices. “In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,” the agency wrote in a filing. James Seyffart’s prediction becomes a reality The SEC revealed in a statement that it has further delayed deciding on Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). In light of this action, the agency is requesting an inquiry into whether Nasdaq’s proposal to list the ETF conforms with legal requirements. Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. The decision by the SEC has generated conversations within the crypto community. James Seyffart , a Bloomberg analyst with extensive experience, especially with Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), offered commentary on the subject. Based on Seyffart’s argument, he correctly predicted that the SEC would postpone making a decision on the Litecoin ETF, as it had done with other cryptocurrency ETFs so far, such as Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF filing. Moreover, according to Seyffart, Litecoin is the asset with the best chance of receiving early approval . Recently, the analyst predicted that there was a 90% chance that an LTC ETF would be approved this year, which gave the price of Litecoin a positive outlook. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin is currently down by 2.2% over 24 hours, trading hands for over $83. Litecoin (LTC) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency and the 25th biggest digital coin by market cap. The asset is a forked version of Bitcoin established in 2011 by ex-Google employee Charlie Lee. The SEC has delayed Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF just like other crypto ETF proposals The SEC was set to decide on the proposed spot in Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF on May 5. In the meantime, market observers had become more hopeful. In support of this, on Polymarket, approval odds had risen to their highest level since the middle of March. In January, Nasdaq reportedly filed Form 19b-4, a proposed rule change, to list and trade Canary’s Litecoin ETF shares. The proposal was then made available for public comment in the Federal Register on February 4. This was the first day of the 45-day review period, which ended on March 21st. However, the SEC decided to make this time frame longer by 45 days, setting a new 90-day deadline of May 5. The statement said, “Accordingly, the Commission, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 designates May 5, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NASDAQ-2025-005).” For other cryptocurrency ETF applications, the regulator has taken similar actions. The SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) proposal until June 15 and Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP (XRP) ETF until June 17. This was also the case with Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETH) staking ETF. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The post quickly went viral, with some calling it unnecessary fear-mongering and others suggesting it hints at possible market manipulation. What Was Said? The post argued that Ripple’s monthly XRP sales, unusual network patterns, and historic price movements — particularly during XRP’s famous 2017 rally — hinted at possible price suppression. It even cited a study that found a negative connection between XRP’s transaction network and its price performance. Naturally, this raised plenty of questions within the crypto community. Expert Clears The Air However, attorney and XRP supporter Bill Morgan explained that the post made several exaggerated claims. For starters, he clarified that Ripple doesn’t own 43% of XRP’s supply, as the post suggested. According to CoinMarketCap data, around 58.5% of XRP is in circulation, excluding what Ripple holds in escrow. Morgan also said that Ripple’s monthly sales from escrow make up just a small fraction of the total market volume and have no impact on price. In fact, evidence presented in the SEC lawsuit revealed that Ripple took measures to support XRP’s price, such as locking up large amounts of tokens in escrow to reduce market pressure. This post in the thread is over generalised to begin with. Firstly, Ripple does not own 43% of supply. even @CoinMarketCap publishes that the circulating supply (excluding what ripple holes outside escrow) is 58.5%. Secondly, what Ripple releases from escrow and sells each month… https://t.co/XnTBuHaZJ7 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 5, 2025 He added that the SEC spent over 18 months investigating Ripple before filing the lawsuit, and if any proof of price manipulation existed, it would have been used in court. This, he argued, makes the suppression claims hard to believe. Further clarifying the situation, Morgan said that XRP’s price has historically followed the crypto market, moving in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This trend has remained consistent for the past four years, and little has changed to challenge that pattern.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 01:52:25

In the analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman noted that these addresses have increased their exposure to ETH, even as the asset trades well below recent highs. Ethereum Holders Are Staying Put Despite Unrealized Loss Since reaching its cycle high of $4,107 in December 2024, ETH has experienced a sharp pullback of over 50%, currently trading around the $1,800 mark. Despite this steep correction, long-term ETH holders – particularly those behind accumulation addresses – have not been deterred. Instead of exiting their positions, they continue to hold firm.

Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Interestingly, since March 10, on-chain data reveals that many of these accumulation addresses have entered unrealized loss territory. For context, ETH fell to a local low of $1,866 while its Realized Price stood at $2,026. For the uninitiated, an accumulation address is a crypto wallet that steadily receives and holds a particular asset – like Ethereum – without sending it out. These addresses are typically long-term holders, ones who have held ETH for more than 155 days. When accumulation addresses continue to acquire assets in the face of declining prices, it often signals that investors expect a bullish reversal in the near future. These wallets essentially represent “strong hands” in the market. Similarly, Realized Price is the average price at which all coins in a cryptocurrency network were last moved, calculated by dividing the total realized market cap by the circulating supply. It reflects the aggregate cost basis of holders and is often used to assess whether the market is in profit or loss. Since March 10, the Realized Price for these addresses has dropped by 2.32%, from $2,026 to $1,980 as of May 3. Yet, rather than scaling back, these addresses have increased their ETH holdings significantly. Aleman adds: Despite the continued downtrend, and even while in unrealized losses, accumulating addresses have not abandoned their strategy. Instead, they increased their ETH exposure: on March 10 they held 15.5356M ETH, and by May 3 this rose to 19.0378M ETH, a 22.54% increase, as seen in the ETH Cohort analysis and Balance on Accumulation Addresses. Has ETH Hit Market Bottom? While some analysts warn that ETH could fall further – possibly to as low as $1,200 – others believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap may have already bottomed out for this cycle.

A sudden $17 million whale activity spike has renewed focus on the Shiba Inu price prediction. AAVE, on the other hand, is holding its ground above key averages. The AAVE crypto price is pushing toward $196, possibly heading to $240 if bulls stay in control. But both face hesitations that leave room for doubt. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) skips the waiting game. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, with leftovers going to the day’s biggest buyer. This system turns buying into a smart move. Compared to SHIB and AAVE, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market mood, it’s driving it. Among the top names right now, BlockDAG clearly runs the best crypto presale. Whale Surge Sparks Fresh Shiba Inu Price Prediction Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in focus as whale activity jumps by 228%, moving $17 million worth of tokens daily. This sudden interest follows a quiet period and hints at renewed confidence. The Shiba Inu price prediction is gaining attention again, especially as May historically brings upward moves. While retail traders stay cautious, large holders are quietly accumulating. SHIB trades at $0.0000126, with major resistance between $0.0000140 and $0.0000190. Breaking that level could trigger a strong rally. The Shiba Inu price prediction also leans on Bitcoin’s recovery and easing macro fears. With sentiment shifting from fear to neutral, the Shiba Inu price prediction shows potential for a breakout if momentum continues. Aave Crypto Price Could Rally to $240 if Bulls Succeed The Aave crypto price is holding firm above key moving averages, showing positive sentiment as buyers step in on dips. Bulls are eyeing the $196 level, but resistance is expected there. If support holds near the 20-day EMA and the price breaks $180, a move to $220 or $240 is possible. Minor resistance at $190 might not hold back the momentum. However, if bears drag the Aave crypto price below the 50-SMA, it could slip to $155 and even touch $130. For now, steady buying and strong support levels hint at a bullish setup unless sellers regain control. Watching the $180–$196 zone is crucial for the next move. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Drop 50M BDAG Daily, Winner Takes the Leftovers BlockDAG has flipped the usual crypto game with something fresh – Buyer Battles. It has no private rounds, no gatekeeping, just a daily challenge open to everyone. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are set aside. Buyers compete by purchasing, and the day’s biggest buyer takes home any unsold coins as a bonus. It’s not just a fair system, it turns buying into a strategy where bigger moves can lead to bigger wins. This model drives steady action and encourages frequent, bold participation. With BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13, the timing works in favour of early buyers. Once listings go live and the price hits $0.05, those early gains show real weight. The daily battle setup doesn’t just engage users, it rewards them. It creates a path where retail buyers can win big without needing deep pockets or early access. This makes BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles more than just a promo, they’re a key reason it’s being seen as the best crypto presale in 2025. BlockDAG has already raised over $225 million and sold 19.6 billion coins, with 10 exchange listings confirmed, including one tier-one. Since Batch 1, the return has climbed by 2520%, highlighting strong momentum. Best Buys Right Now Shiba Inu is catching fresh attention with a $17 million whale move, reviving the Shiba Inu price prediction ahead of May’s typical uptrend. AAVE is also holding strong, with the AAVE crypto price aiming for $196 and beyond – if buyers stay in charge. But both rely on market shifts. BlockDAG isn’t waiting. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, giving leftover coins to the top buyer. No VIP access needed, just daily action. With a short-time discounted price $0.0019 entry and confirmed exchange listings, BlockDAG is setting the pace. Its early gains make it 2025’s best crypto presale.

The Dogecoin bullish signal is hard to ignore as patterns on the charts suggest a possible 200% price increase. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action has sparked fresh discussion, with over $160 billion SHIB purchased by large holders within just two days. These developments are stirring speculative interest. However, beyond memes and volatility lies a more calculated opportunity. Web3 ai is not driven by hype but by real-time utility and AI-driven trading support. Powered by its $WAI token, the project delivers usable products now, not promises for later. With a presale targeting a 1747% ROI and a complete AI toolset already live, Web3 ai may quietly be the best crypto coin to buy at this pivotal market moment. Dogecoin Bullish Signal Points to a Possible Major Upswing Dogecoin has once again captured the attention of traders and analysts. The Dogecoin bullish signal is now supported by a visible cup-and-handle pattern that traditionally precedes large breakouts. If this pattern follows its usual trajectory, Dogecoin could experience gains of up to 200% from current levels. Investors watching Dogecoin must weigh the bullish setup against these longer-term concerns. While the upside is tempting, staying mindful of resistance levels and overall sentiment shifts is critical. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale Action Signals Confidence, But Questions Remain The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has yet to break out, but whale wallets are making bold moves. In just 48 hours, over $160 billion SHIB tokens flowed into large holder addresses, suggesting growing confidence among seasoned market participants. This significant accumulation has renewed optimism around SHIB’s prospects. At the same time, price movements have not mirrored these inflows. Often in meme-based markets, whale activity can foreshadow major price shifts. Still, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action must be viewed in context. The token continues to face challenges regarding sustainability, particularly around token burns and ecosystem growth. For SHIB to truly capitalize on whale interest, further development within its Layer 2 Shibarium and increased utility will likely be necessary. Until then, the moves by large holders serve as a speculative signal rather than a guaranteed breakout indicator. Web3 ai ($WAI): Combining AI, Utility, and a 1747% ROI Advantage While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture headlines, Web3 ai takes a much more strategic approach. It addresses the growing demand for tools that convert market data into meaningful, real-time trading decisions. Web3 ai’s AI-powered suite includes features like arbitrage discovery, sentiment analysis, yield optimization, and liquidity tracking, all actively working across Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Polygon networks. What separates Web3 ai from traditional meme tokens is the depth of its ecosystem. The $WAI token is not just speculative. It serves multiple functions across the platform, including: Unlocking advanced AI trading and analysis tools Enabling staking for passive income and tiered access Facilitating governance and decision-making on future upgrades Supporting a deflationary model with revenue-driven token burns At the moment, Web3 ai’s crypto presale offers a unique advantage. Early investors can enter across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and concluding at $0.003267. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242, this structure sets up a clear path to a 1747% ROI for early buyers. This positions Web3 ai firmly in the discussion for the best crypto coin to buy right now. Its combination of real products, growing adoption potential, and clear token utility presents an appealing alternative to hype-driven assets. Last Words Dogecoin’s bullish signal could result in significant gains if price patterns hold. Shiba Inu’s whale action demonstrates confidence that may lead to an eventual price surge. However, both remain heavily influenced by sentiment and market cycles. Web3 ai offers something far more aligned with forward-looking crypto trends. Its AI-enhanced platform is already live, helping traders make smarter decisions today. The $WAI token unlocks access to essential AI tools, while the presale offers a rare early-stage opportunity for impressive returns. As the platform grows and AI adoption expands throughout crypto markets, Web3 ai could quickly shift from promising newcomer to established market leader. For those seeking the best crypto coin to buy now , Web3 ai represents a logical and compelling choice. Early access does not just offer profit potential, it offers the chance to be part of crypto’s next major innovation wave.

Whether your focus is security, privacy, strong ecosystems, or practical utility, these projects check the right boxes.

It’s more than just a coin; $CWT activates features, grants governance rights, and unlocks loyalty perks within the ecosystem. More importantly, Cold Wallet isn’t focused on buzz, it’s executing a roadmap packed with exchange listings, cross-chain compatibility, and anonymous dApp access planned across Q3 and Q4. For those seeking digital privacy and real upside, Cold Wallet stands among the top crypto gems to buy now. Chainlink: Core Infrastructure Powering Web3 Chainlink is not focused on headlines, its value lies in being essential to Web3’s backbone. With a current trading price of $24.50 in April 2025 and over $120 million exiting exchanges lately, there’s growing belief in its long-term importance. The CCIP feature is now active on Hedera and heading to Ronin, enabling secure, multi-chain data and asset flow unmatched in scope.

Chainlink holds its spot by being the tech foundation others rely on. For those wanting exposure to dependable Web3 infrastructure, Chainlink is one of the top crypto gems to buy now.

It’s more than just trading behavior, it shows strong faith in a privacy protocol that resists intrusion. With its latest upgrade (v0.18.4.0) and the Cuprate node redesign, Monero continues refining speed and future performance. Privacy features like stealth addresses, ring signatures, and hidden transaction values remain central. Long-term predictions suggest growth toward $454 this year and possibly $1,500 or more by 2031. For those serious about anonymity, Monero is clearly among the top crypto gems to buy now. Binance Coin: Key Asset Behind the Biggest Exchange BNB, currently priced at $610.67, is showing solid progress. Its recent Kraken listing broadens access to a wider audience.

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

BNB was once overlooked, trading for pennies—until it soared and left many regretting they didn’t jump in sooner. That opportunity’s long gone. Now, in 2025, a new contender is drawing major attention: Qubetics ($TICS). This isn’t just another token riding a wave of hype—it’s built to solve real problems with tools that support global payments, cross-border work, and practical blockchain applications. Already crowned the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential, Qubetics is in presale mode and gaining serious momentum. For those who missed the BNB breakout, this might be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. Crypto’s Missed Jackpot: BNB’s Rise and the Lesson It Left Behind Crypto has always been about timing. Back in 2017, BNB was just a low-cost token linked to a new exchange. Nobody thought it would break records. But those who grabbed it early? They saw it climb from mere cents to over $600 at its peak. That kind of return isn’t just rare—it’s unforgettable. What made BNB so big was simple: use case and accessibility. It gave discounts, worked across Binance tools, and built hype. But today, the crypto crowd is more demanding. They want real-life use. They want something that’s not only tradable but useful outside exchanges. And that’s where the next big story begins—with Qubetics ($TICS), a fresh entry gaining traction fast and now crowned as the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential by analysts and crypto circles alike. Why Qubetics Isn’t Just Another Coin—It’s the Bridge to Real-Life Financial Freedom Unlike meme tokens or single-use cryptos, Qubetics is designed for function. It’s a toolkit for freelancers, remote workers, creators, and business owners who want to get paid fast and send money across borders without stress. And it’s doing that through smart tech like: A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that puts control back in users’ hands Built-in support for cross-border transactions Smart routing that reduces wait times and fees That’s why it’s being called the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. It’s not just crypto—it’s a business utility stack wrapped in blockchain. Here’s the current presale data: Stage: 33 Token Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million+ Holders: 25,800+ Funds Raised: $16.7 million+ Analysts are now projecting: $TICS at $1 = 334% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2071% ROI $TICS at $15 = 6414% ROI And there’s even buzz that $TICS could reach $10–$15 after mainnet launch. With applications this practical, the hype isn’t speculation—it’s demand. The Presale Pressure Is Building—But Time’s Running Out Stage 33 of the Qubetics crypto presale is almost sold out. At $0.2302, it’s still within reach—but not for long. Those watching it closely remember what missing BNB felt like. This feels oddly familiar.

Non-profit corporations and exchanges can now sell crypto in South Korea. Analysts think political interests are behind the new crypto guidelines. The South Korean Financial Services Commission has enacted a new set of guidelines, allowing the Asian country’s citizens to engage in cryptocurrency transactions. The latest development marks a landmark decision, setting June 2025 as the date when the new rules will kick in. According to reports, the Commission will allow non-profit corporations and virtual asset exchanges to sell digital assets. However, exchanges must structure their trading processes to minimize market impact when selling. In the meantime, the Commission will create a “Donation Review Committee” charged with supervising external audit corporations engaging in digital asset transactions.

The discussion draft, led by the House agricultural and financial services committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill, is an “incremental, albeit meaningful, rewrite” of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Paradigm’s vice president of regulatory affairs Justin Slaughter said in a May 5 X post. One-pager of the digital asset market structure discussion draft submitted by House Republicans on May 5. Source: US House Agriculture Committee One of the major changes from FIT21 is that the draft defines an affiliated person as anyone who owns more than 1% of a digital commodity issued by the project — down from 5% in the FIT21 bill — a move Slaughter said may curb the influence of big crypto firms and lead to more participation in the crypto market. “This is a portent of the entire bill. There are often criticisms of crypto being too dominated by a few large firms. This bill makes clear the regulatory regime proposed is going to push against that fact and strongly encourage more small-d ‘democratization’ of the space.” The draft also defines a “mature blockchain system” as one that, together with its related digital commodity, is not under the “common control” of any person or group. Source: Justin Slaughter The Securities and Exchange Commission would be the main authority regulating activity on crypto networks until they become sufficiently decentralized, Slaughter noted. The draft also clarified that decentralized finance trading protocols are those that enable users to engage in a financial transaction in a “self-directed manner.” Protocols that meet this criterion are exempt from registering as digital commodity brokers or dealers. The draft also referred to digital commodities as “investment contract assets” to distinguish their treatment from stocks and other traditional assets under the Howey test. According to Slaughter’s analysis, securities laws won’t be triggered unless the secondary sale of tokens also transfers ownership or profit in the underlying business. Crypto firms would also have a path to raise funds under the SEC’s oversight while also having a “clear process” to register their digital commodities with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the committee members said in a separate May 5 statement. Joint rulemaking, procedures, or guidelines related to crypto asset delisting must be established by the CFTC and SEC should a registered asset no longer comply with rules laid out by the regulators. A ‘clear opportunity’ to advance crypto innovation, rules once and for all Speaking about the need for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, the House committee members said crypto is a “clear opportunity” to advance innovation in the US — most notably through modernizing America’s financial infrastructure and reinforcing US dollar dominance. The Republicans criticized the previous Biden administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC for adopting a regulation-by-enforcement strategy rather than creating clear rules for market participants. Related: VanEck files for BNB ETF, first in US Many crypto firms were stuck in “legal limbo” as a result of the unclear rules, which pushed some industry players overseas, where clearer rules exist, the House committee members said. “America needs to be the powerhouse for digital asset investment and innovation. For that to happen, we need a commonsense regulatory regime,” said Dusty Johnson, chairman of the subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets and rural development. Slaughter added: “This is the bill that will, finally, provide a clear regulatory regime on crypto that many have been calling for.” Republicans already facing roadblocks over discussion draft House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters plans to block a Republican-led event discussing digital assets on May 6, a Democratic staffer told Cointelegraph. The hearing, “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets,” is expected to discuss the new crypto markets draft discussion paper pitched by Thompson, Hill, and other committee members. However, according to the unnamed Democratic staffer, the current rules require all members of the House Financial Services Committee to agree on such hearings.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.5 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

Stablecoin legislation nearing next vote It is widely believed that two key pieces of legislation need to be passed into law in the US to cement the position of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act sets out clear definitions for “payment stablecoins” and reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. Lawmakers in the US Senate will move forward with a vote on the GENIUS stablecoin bill before May 26, according to reports. Meanwhile, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, which governs the approval and supervision of “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers,” is also going through Congress. Tether is also planning to launch a US-based stablecoin later this year, with timing dependent on the passing of legislation.

In a post on X, Saylor shared a screenshot of Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker with the caption: “Too much blue, not enough orange.” Saylor Drops ‘Orange Dot’ Hint on X This cryptic message suggests the software firm may soon expand its already record-setting Bitcoin holdings. Notably, orange dots on the tracker represent each instance of Strategy buying Bitcoin. Strategy’s Massive Bitcoin Bet Deepens The company holds 553,555 BTC, worth approximately $52.8 billion, accounting for more than 2% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. Saylor’s remark indicates plans to increase that total. Notably, similar posts in the past have often preceded Bitcoin acquisitions, typically announced on Mondays.

Naturally, traders are hunting for the next best altcoin to buy , and ADA and SOL often top those shortlists. But a fresh contender is storming onto the scene. While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) may offer respectable upside (perhaps 150% gains over the next year), RCO Finance (RCOF) is carving out room for a potential 50,000% surge by year-end. Its trailblazing AI trading platform and DeFi innovations were already turning heads, but now, RCO Finance (RCOF) has secured a hefty $7.5 million VC check. That influx of institutional capital has ignited sky-high forecasts as retail money is expected to flood the presale following the news. Here’s why everyone’s pivoting to RCO Finance. Investors Tread Lightly Despite Cardano (ADA) and Solana Rebound (SOL) Bitcoin’s bounce back into the $95k level has traders buzzing about another bull run, shining a light once more on utility-driven tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). Cardano (ADA) has clawed its way up to challenge the $0.71 barrier after dipping under $0.50 not long ago. Solana (SOL), meanwhile, has rallied past $160 after consolidating in the $140s. Momentum is there for sure, yet market veterans are advising restraint. They point to late 2024 when under-the-radar utility alts outpaced the big names by leaps and bounds once the rally really kicked in. In other words, the next 100x winners might not be the household names. Cardano vs. Solana vs. RCO Finance As traders scope out the best crypto to buy before the next explosion, many are passing on ADA and SOL, noting their upside feels capped at around 80%–150% in the coming 12 months. In contrast, RCO Finance (RCOF) presents a very different picture. Early presale investors have already zipped up 1,300%, and projections hint at another 18,000% boost when RCOF hits major exchanges. Now, with a top-tier VC plowing in $7.5 million, RCOF’s chance at 50,000% returns by the end of 2025 seems more than theoretical. The combination of institutional endorsement and grassroots enthusiasm is turbocharging the adoption of RCO Finance’s native token and setting the stage for some truly unprecedented price moves. Why VC Is Backing RCO Finance (RCOF) With $7.5 Million In under three months, RCO Finance (RCOF) has hit milestones that most projects have chased for years. Its Beta platform swelled from 10,000 to 285,000 active users, relying on its AI to steer trades. The presale racked up $17.3 million and has now secured a landmark $7.5 million VC injection in round 6. This kind of institutional involvement shifts RCOF from mere speculation to real contender status. What sets RCO Finance (RCOF) apart from other emerging crypto projects is democratizing advanced trading strategies. The Robo Advisor engine combs through over 100,000 assets (from crypto and stocks to bonds), using predictive analytics to flag patterns before they explode. It gauges everything: social sentiment spikes, clustered wallet moves, oddball liquidity surges. Picture how this would have worked during SHIB’s early breakout. The system would’ve logged on-chain accumulation by whale wallets, noticed a spike in tweets, and pinged users to buy in. As SHIB rocketed 100,000%, the Robo Advisor could’ve auto-sold when liquidity ebbed and sentiment cooled, locking in gains ahead of the slump. The same model applies to tokens like PEPE and TRUMP. RCO Finance (RCOF) watches post-tweet pumps, decodes chatter that precedes 100x runs, and refines its approach each cycle. With institutional-grade tools now in the hands of every RCOF holder, it’s no wonder a major VC just placed a $7.5 million bet after RCO Finance (RCOF), especially after passing a thorough SolidProof security audit . RCOF Presale: Round 6 Backers to See 50,000% Gains by EOY The RCO Finance presale is making headlines, and for good reason. With $17.3 million raised and the user base exploding from 10,000 to 285,000 in mere months, m fomentum is off the charts. Now, a fresh $7.5 million VC injection has lit a fire under Round 6 demand. Priced at $0.13, early backers are already up 1,300%, and experts insist that’s just the opening act. Analysts are now eyeing 50,000% gains by year-end, meaning a $600 bet today could flip into north of $300,000 before 2026. Of course, institutional capital and retail FOMO won’t wait for stragglers. Once Round 6 closes, the entry point will be a whole lot steeper on the open market. If you’ve been eyeing Cardano (ADA) and Solana’s (SOL) moves but want something with both rocket-fuel potential and real-world utility, RCO Finance (RCOF) could be the best altcoin to buy now. But round 6 won’t stay open long, so if you’re serious about securing life-changing gains, now’s the time to act.

BOSes – we did it. On May 4 2025, we successfully demoed the first *bridgeless* transfer of BTC between Bitcoin and Cardano mainnet. Performed with @SundialProtocol and @adahandle , using our all-new unchained token standard. Here’s what happened. pic.twitter.com/JO9xZKrLUE — BitcoinOS (@BTC_OS) May 5, 2025 BitcoinOS was able to successfully bring 1 BTC token to the Cardano blockchain, before sending it back to Bitcoin without issues. But that news failed to ignite much excitement, with the Cardano price last around $0.65, having broken below key technical support. After a solid recovery rally in recent weeks on hopes that US President Donald Trump would back off from his trade war, crypto markets are coming under pressure once again. Now down well over 10% from late-April highs, ADA has slipped back below its 21 and 50DMAs, as well as short-term support in the $0.67 area. Nerves are understandably high ahead of an FOMC rate decision on Wednesday – the central bank could issue hawkish monetary policy guidance, potentially pressuring risk assets. Traders also seem to be weighing fresh trade war-related developments, which have been the catalyst for a lot of crypto market volatility in recent weeks. These macro themes are for now stealing the attention from bullish Cardano developments behind the scenes, such as BitcoinOS’s latest successful Cardano bridging demo. Cardano is setting out to become the go-to Bitcoin DeFi side chain in the year’s ahead. According to popular crypto analyst Dan Gambardello, this makes Cardano “the best positioned bluechip altcoin for a crypto bull market”. Bitcoin has officially been sent to Cardano and back to Bitcoin. Cardano is the best positioned bluechip altcoin for a crypto bull market. pic.twitter.com/WpQmD11mJd — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) May 5, 2025 Cardano Price Prediction – New Lows Coming? Whilst Cardano might be positioned to perform well in a future crypto bull market, that bull market is not currently here. Macro risks remain elevated – trade tensions might have peaked for now, but upside risks to US inflation and downside risks to the US economy are high. The US Treasury Yield Curve has steepened SHARPLY: The difference between the 10-year and the 2-year Treasury yields has been positive for over 6 months. In the past, once the yield curve turned sharply positive, the US economy was in a recession. Is history repeating? pic.twitter.com/HxP38DbIOz — Global Markets Investor (@GlobalMktObserv) May 5, 2025 Prior altcoin seasons have come in environments of major Fed policy easing. That doesn’t appear to be on the horizon any time soon. So traders would do well not to get overly aggressive chasing Cardano price rallies on the anticipation that “a new altcoin season is here”. It won’t be hear until the Fed and other major global central banks are pumping liquidity, and optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook has returned. In such an environment, its better to embrace the choppy and directionless nature of the market, and trade what you see on the charts. ADA’s short-term technical outlook has soured so far this week. That suggests a retest of recent lows in the $0.50s could be on the cards. Accumulate ADA on the Dip? Despite a bearish short-term outlook and a uncertain medium-term outlook, Cardano presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. While trailing rivals such as Ethereum and Solana in terms of adoption, Cardano’s robust fundamentals and strategic roadmap position it for significant growth, potentially reaching $10 by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. Investors should thus view the current range-bound price action as a chance to accumulate. Cardano’s blockchain excels in scalability, sustainability, and security, leveraging its Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Its focus on rigorous academic research ensures a resilient foundation, distinguishing it from competitors. A key bullish narrative is Cardano’s ambition to become the premier Bitcoin DeFi chain, enabling seamless integration of Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance applications. Initiatives like the Midnight protocol, enhancing privacy, and partnerships in emerging markets further bolster its ecosystem. BREAKING NEWS MIDNIGHT WILL BRING MILLIONS OF USERS TO CARDANO @IOHK_Charles reveals that Midnight has been very well received and could bring millions of users to the Cardano network. The concept of hybrid applications, whether $BTC , $ETH , $SOL , or $ADA to Midnight,… pic.twitter.com/PDYrcZWr4N — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) April 12, 2025 Macro uncertainties may cap near-term gains, but Cardano’s methodical development and growing use cases—spanning DeFi , supply chain, and identity solutions—signal substantial upside. That’s especially the case against the backdrop of a historically favorable global regulatory backdrop for the crypto industry, spearheaded by the ardently pro-crypto Trump administration’s efforts to bolster the industry. However, with a market cap still modest compared to rivals, Cardano offers asymmetric return potential. Strategic investors can capitalize on current consolidation to build positions in a blockchain poised for exponential growth over the next four years.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Tron public relations team confirmed that on May 2, the Tron DAO account posted a contract address and sent direct messages to solicit payments in exchange for promotional advertising on the Tron account. “Our security team quickly identified the intrusion and cut off access to the hacker, but we ask the community to continue to be vigilant. We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000. Asked whether the same hacker could be responsible for the supposed New York Post’s X account hack on May 3, the Tron team told Cointelegraph that there “appear to be some similarities” between the two security incidents; however, they also cautioned that the investigation is ongoing and “any definitive connection would be premature.” After regaining access, Tron DAO said in a May 2 X update that they suspect the hack resulted from a team member being “targeted in a malicious social engineering attack, which led to their account being compromised.” Source: Tron DAO “Even after the perpetrator was logged out and our access restored, they continued contacting others, offering posts from our main account in exchange for payment,” Tron DAO said. The Tron team is still investigating and says they are in contact with law enforcement. Tron founder Justin Sun also accused crypto exchange OKX of failing to act on a law enforcement request to freeze stolen funds connected to the attack. OKX founder and CEO Star Xu has publicly denied the allegation, and Sun has removed the original post with the accusation. Curve Finance joins list of X account hacks Decentralized lending protocol Curve Finance also recently suffered an X account takeover by a bad actor, adding to the growing list of high-profile firms and individuals “silently” accessed by social media hackers. In a now-deleted May 5 X post, a scammer posing as Curve Finance shared a link to a CRV airdrop with a weeklong registration period, which some eagle-eyed X users quickly suspected could be fraudulent. Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov confirmed in a reply to analyst CrediBULL Crypto that it was a bad actor posting sham links so far, “No other account appears to be hacked — the control over X account was just silently taken by someone.” Source: CrediBULL Crypto The Curve Finance team has since regained access with the help of a team that included the cybersecurity group SEAL, and found that aside from posting scam links, the hacker also blocked some users who flagged the account takeover, including CrediBULL Crypto. The cause of the hack has yet to be shared publicly, but in response to a user’s query, the Curve finance team said it’s still “unclear how account” access was taken, and there was “No sign of any client-side compromise.” Source: Curve Finance Other high-profile X account hacks A slew of other high-profile X accounts have also been taken over by bad actors this year. On April 15, a member of the UK’s Parliament, Lucy Powell, had her account taken over to promote a scam crypto token called the House of Commons Coin (HOC). Crypto data aggregator Kaito AI and its founder, Yu Hu, were the victims of an X social media hack on March 15 , when scammers posted that the Kaito wallets were compromised and users' funds were at risk.

The price is trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,830 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $1,785 support level. Ethereum Price Struggles To Clear Resistance Ethereum price failed to clear the $1,880 resistance and started a downside correction, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,850 and $1,820 support levels. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,734 swing low to the $1,872 high. The bears even pushed the price below the $1,800 level, but the price found support near the $1,785 support level. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,800 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,830 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,830 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $1,880 level. A clear move above the $1,880 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,000 resistance zone or even $2,050 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,830 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,785 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,734 swing low to the $1,872 high. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,685 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,640.

Right now, four assets are catching the attention of strategic investors: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE . While the larger caps hold steady, it’s early-phase entries like MAGACOINFINANCE that could define the next growth wave—and the window may still be open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability. NEAR Protocol is accelerating adoption through its developer-friendly design and seamless onboarding for dApp builders. Kaspa appeals to performance-focused users with its proof-of-work blockDAG model—offering speed, scalability, and security. Arbitrum is dominating the Ethereum Layer-2 space, delivering efficient scaling and lower gas costs for decentralized applications. While each of these platforms is building critical infrastructure, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early-stage, undervalued momentum that is increasingly rare. Final Word Can $750 really become $850K ? For those who’ve studied crypto cycles, it’s clear: timing and early conviction matter. XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum offer enduring strength. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offers discovery-phase growth—and that’s exactly where major wealth shifts have historically begun.

After briefly climbing late last month, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain upward momentum since then. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at approximately $94,305, reflecting a modest 1.3% decline over the past day. While price action has slowed, activity on the backend of the market suggests underlying shifts in investor behavior. New on-chain data points to a significant decrease in Bitcoin reserves held on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Incoming? Analyst Flags Indicators That Preceded Every Major BTC Rally One of CryptoQuant’s contributors, Amr Taha, highlighted the development in a recent QuickTake post, signaling that over 51,000 BTC have been withdrawn from Binance wallets since mid-April. This drop from roughly 595,000 BTC to around 544,500 BTC could indicate a recalibration in investor strategy, with growing interest in long-term holding or redeployment of assets outside centralized platforms. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Outflows from Binance? According to Taha, multiple factors may be contributing to this steep decline in exchange-held reserves. One explanation involves institutional investors and long-term holders moving their Bitcoin into cold storage. This off-exchange behavior is typically interpreted as a signal of longer-term conviction, as these participants seek to secure assets while reducing the likelihood of short-term selling. Given the rise of custodial solutions and more institutional-grade wallets, this trend may reflect maturing market behavior. Another key factor could be the increasing use of Bitcoin within decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-platform arbitrage strategies. Taha noted that entities may be withdrawing BTC to access yield opportunities or deploy capital in other blockchain ecosystems. Additionally, the recent positive flows into Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially between April 21 and May 1, where daily net inflows crossed the $2 billion mark on several occasions, may have encouraged larger players to accumulate and withdraw Bitcoin in anticipation of further price appreciation. Exchange Reserve Trends Offer Signals Amid Price Consolidation Though Bitcoin’s price has remained largely stagnant over the past week, the shift in exchange reserve data could carry significant implications for future price action. Historically, a decrease in exchange reserves, particularly from major venues like Binance, has been associated with supply tightening. As fewer coins are readily available for sale, reduced liquidity can amplify the impact of incoming demand, especially in bullish phases. Taha emphasized that while short-term market performance may appear indecisive, tracking reserve metrics offers important clues about underlying sentiment.

A consistent drawdown of BTC from exchange platforms often sets the stage for renewed price movement, especially when accompanied by institutional accumulation and long-term holding behavior. If these patterns persist, they may contribute to reduced sell-side pressure, enabling Bitcoin to challenge its next resistance zones, including the psychological $100,000 level.

This makes Gemini the 15th exchange to support RLUSD, adding momentum to its growing adoption. The announcement was teased earlier with a cryptic acrostic message that highlighted “RLUSD,” sparking buzz within the XRP community. NEW: $RLUSD is now available for trading on Gemini Deposits & withdrawals are enabled Buy, sell, and store today: https://t.co/Vd2sae45kn pic.twitter.com/4g4t226sF7 — Gemini (@Gemini) May 5, 2025 Following the Gemini listing, RLUSD’s 24-hour trading volume soared to over $43 million, marking a 15% increase. The growing bullish sentiment shows RLUSD is gaining traction fast, both among retail users and institutions. Crypto influencer Amelie pointed out that Gemini may have subtly teased Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD by using a sentence with capitalized letters spelling “RLUSD”, sparking buzz in the XRP community. However, Gemini has not responded anything on this cryptic message format. RLUSD’s Bold Moves On May 5, Ripple donated $25 million in RLUSD to support public education in the U.S., distributing funds through DonorsChoose and Teach For America. The initiative is aimed at equipping underserved classrooms with supplies and tech, reinforcing Ripple’s mission to tie real-world use to its digital assets. Ripple is also integrating RLUSD into its enterprise-grade Ripple Payments product, allowing institutions to use the stablecoin for cross-border transactions. In a strategic move, Ripple acquired prime brokerage Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and plans to use RLUSD as collateral in institutional settlement services. What’s Next in Stablecoin Regulations? Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD is now listed on 15 exchanges, including Gemini, Bitstamp, Uphold, and Revolut, making it easier for people to buy, trade, and use it worldwide. Moreover, the U.S. was close to setting rules for stablecoins through the GENIUS Act, but things are now on shaky ground. Some Democrats who once supported it are pulling back, saying the latest version isn’t strong enough on safety and fraud prevention. On top of that, controversy over a Trump-linked stablecoin deal in Dubai is making the situation messier.

In November 2023, both CZ and Binance pleaded guilty to several charges related to money laundering and regulatory violations. To settle the case, Binance agreed to pay over $4.3 billion in fines. Initially facing a three-year prison sentence, CZ’s punishment was reduced to four months after his legal team argued he was not directly involved in the wrongdoing. In an interview with Farokh Radio, CZ opened up about his experience and described prison as an extremely difficult experience. Despite his calm personality and high tolerance for stress, he admitted the process was frightening. From strip searches to sharing a cell with a double-murder convict, CZ said nothing about prison was easy or glamorous. “It was extremely hard when you go through it. I can laugh about it now, but it’s not funny — it’s not fun at all. I wouldn’t wish that experience on anyone. My first cellmate was a double murderer. Once you’re in there, no one cares who you are. They just treat you like anyone else,” he said. He explained that while he was not mistreated, he was not given any special treatment either. Most guards and inmates did not know who he was, and he was monitored like any other prisoner. Since he is not a U.S. citizen, CZ was placed in a low-security prison instead of minimum-security, which is typical for white-collar offenders. CZ said that prison was mentally stressful. One of his biggest fears was that his sentence could be extended unexpectedly, which he said happens to many inmates. Even after serving his four months, immigration issues caused delays in his release, and he was temporarily held in a detention center. Despite the challenges, CZ said that most of the inmates were respectful and that he had no conflicts during his time in prison. He also revealed that he’s writing a book that will include more details about his experience.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 03:37:04

Released by the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees , the new draft attempts to draw a clear line between who regulates what in the crypto space. SEC vs CFTC: A Split in Oversight Unlike the earlier FIT21 proposal , which drew heat for weakening the SEC’s role, this updated bill strikes a more balanced approach. The SEC will continue to oversee crypto tokens that are considered investment contracts, while the CFTC will take the lead on crypto commodities. According to Paradigm’s Justin Slaughter , the bill keeps the CFTC in the driver’s seat but allows the SEC some control until projects prove they are truly decentralized. Interestingly, there’s now a formal “decentralization test.” A project must not be under the control of a single party, and large holders (those with over 10%) must be disclosed while it remains centralized. The bill also defines when a blockchain is considered “mature.” Notably, a blockchain must be open, functional, and not centrally owned — with no more than 20% held by any single party. Retail investors also get a break. They no longer need to meet high income or wealth requirements to participate. This opens the door for everyday people to invest in crypto, not just the wealthy elite. DeFi and Stablecoins Get Some Clarity DeFi protocols that are fully automated and don’t hold user funds might also avoid strict regulations under this bill. It also addresses stablecoins , providing a definition for them but not classifying them as securities.

Despite a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of over $109,000, BTC has rebounded from its April lows near $75,000 to consolidate above $94,000, putting 88% of its circulating supply in profit. Market Reset with Strong Fundamentals Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has cooled off to its long-term mean of 1.74. According to the analytics firm, historically, such a reset level often corresponds with phases of market consolidation, with the latest seen in an August 2022 drawdown where unrealized gains were similarly trimmed before another leg upward. Meanwhile, the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio has gone above 1.0 again, pointing to a change in sentiment as traders move from underwater positions to take modest profits. Per Glassnode’s analysis , the development indicates that the market has enough liquidity and confidence to absorb the realized gains, which is an important sign of strength. Macro indicators seem to agree, with analyst Axel Adler Jr indicating that the 30-day change in Bitcoin’s Composite Volatility Index remains at -3.5%, suggesting that the market is still in an accumulation phase. According to Adler, panic-selling phases usually emerge when the index climbs above 15%, further strengthening the notion that the majority of market participants are quietly positioning for a bigger price boost. Consolidation Before the Next Move? However, BTC’s current market movement paints a more tempered short-term picture. At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap was down a slight 1.3% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $94,306 after oscillating between intraday opposites of $93,806 and $95,741. It had also slipped 0.9% over the past week, but still remained up 8.5% across two weeks. Additionally, the asset has gained 13% in the last 30 days, and is also just 13% away from its ATH. Still, risks remain. As BTC approaches the psychological $100,000 mark, a level linked with aggressive distribution by long-term holders in past cycles, observers are wary of a potential influx of supply. Glassnode warns that sustaining upward momentum from here will require equally strong demand to absorb any profit-taking. Whether this comes from continued ETF inflows , corporate treasury buys , or retail interest remains the key question as May rolls along.

Trump Price Prediction After Sudden $800M Volume Dump,https://cryptonews.com/news/smart-money-exiting-trump-price-prediction-after-sudden-800m-volume-dump/,"Trump Coin (TRUMP) price predictions are becoming more bearish, amid a sudden $800 million volume dump at the start of the week amid speculation that smart money might be exiting the meme coin. The TRUMP price was last around $11 per token, a 5% drop from earlier Monday highs, putting its market cap around $2.2 billion per CoinMarketCap . However, trading volumes spiked up to $800 million in the past 24 hours, possibly a sign that smart money might be on the move out of the meme coin with President Trump seemingly in hot water in Congress. Senate Democrats came together to block the passage of an important stable coin bill amid concerns that the bill might directly help to line the pockets of the Trump family.

Trump Coin Price Prediction – More Downside Coming Macro uncertainties remain exceedingly high heading into this week’s FOMC meeting, where the Fed could dampen risk appetite if they come across overly hawkish. The US economy faces both upside risks to inflation (thanks to tariffs and associated supply chain disruptions) and downside risks to economic growth (again, thanks to tariffs and associated supply chain disruptions). That’s a very difficult environment for the Fed, and investors more broadly to operate in. And this isn’t exactly the right environment for a new meme coin season. Quite the opposite in fact. That suggests that the TRUMP price is likelier to fall in the weeks and months ahead than it is to rally. That said, the ever present risk that President Trump, the Trump family, of the White House manipulates the price is there.

The legislation would establish federal oversight for payment-focused stablecoins and create standards aimed at promoting safety and transparency in digital asset markets. Initially, GOP leaders argued that codifying clear rules would encourage innovation and help the US maintain its edge over rivals in the burgeoning crypto sector. Fast-Track Move on GENIUS Triggers Democratic Withdrawal They moved quickly after Senate Majority Leader John Thune launched a fast-track process last week to tee up the floor text without further committee revisions. However, nine Democrats who once backed the bill announced on Saturday that they could not vote for its current form . “We have approached this process constructively and with an open mind, with the understanding that additional improvements to the bill would be made,” they said.

Floor Text Surprise Adds to Democratic Discontent Moreover, key senators who advanced the measure in March faulted leadership for stripping out negotiated improvements. Sen. Ruben Gallego wrote on X that Democrats “were trying to negotiate with the Republicans for weeks.” He added that the version heading to the floor “back-pedaled on a lot of the progress we made.” Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers complained that they saw the floor text for the first time when it went public. Critics Say Trump’s Crypto Ties Warrant Deliberation Next, critics flagged new crypto ventures by former President Trump and his family. They argued these deals warranted a slowdown. World Liberty Financial unveiled a proposed $2b transaction with Binance that would use its own stablecoin. Sen. Elizabeth Warren referenced this deal , while urging colleagues to delay the bill. She warned “the Trump family stablecoin surged to seventh largest in the world because of a shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates.” In response, House Democrats scheduled a separate hearing to examine Trump’s crypto activities, including his meme coin and the World Liberty arrangement. They argue that rushing a broad regulatory framework without addressing potential conflicts could open the door to corruption. As Democratic support erodes, the GENIUS Act’s prospects become increasingly uncertain. Republicans and the White House had aimed to secure stablecoin and trading-structure reforms by August. Now they face the risk of postponement or significant rewrites if the floor vote fails to win bipartisan backing.

Right now, that formula may be activating again—with Ethereum , MAGACOINFINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin all flashing signs of renewed strength. While established leaders like Bitcoin and Solana grab the spotlight, some investors are focused on a rising contender: MAGACOINFINANCE . And the window to enter early might be closing fast. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving Faster Than the Market Realizes Smart investors watch for subtle but steady signals—and MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering exactly that. Wallet numbers are increasing rapidly. The community is expanding without artificial hype. And developer updates are landing on schedule, building consistent trust. Momentum isn’t speculative anymore—it’s structural and strengthening. This setup feels familiar: similar to early Bitcoin cycles and Solana’s breakout stages. Those who enter now could find themselves ahead of the curve—before the broader market arrives. Accelerating Momentum: Watch These Additional Movers Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the smart contract world, though network congestion and high fees keep alternative chains and Layer-2s in focus. Polygon remains a leader in Ethereum scaling, with major partnerships and real-world integrations driving continued growth. Tron still commands impressive on-chain volume, particularly across stablecoin and international payment flows. Arbitrum leads Ethereum Layer-2 scaling efforts, attracting dApp developers who demand lower fees and higher performance. All are relevant—but when it comes to pure early discovery opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with clear upside potential. Final Word Could $1,100 realistically become $3.2 million ? In the crypto world, it has happened before—with the right project at the right moment.

It has announced the agenda and panelists for the event, where top Wall Street leaders will join to discuss the future of finance. The event titled “Tokenization — Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet” is scheduled for May 12 at the agency’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., where the event will explore how TradFi and DeFi meet through blockchain-based asset movement. The event will be open to the public and webcast live on the SEC’s website. SEC’s Peirce Calls Tokenization Game-Changer SEC Chair Paul Atkins will deliver the keynote address at the event. Commissioner Hester M. Peirce opened up about the importance of the event, calling Tokenization a technological development that could change many aspects of the financial markets. “I look forward to hearing ideas from our panelists on how the SEC should approach this area,” she said. The event has two key sessions scheduled: “Capital Markets 2.0,” led by Jeff Dinwoodie from the law firm Cravath, and “The Future of Tokenization,” headed by Tiffany Smith from WilmerHale. The session will focus on the long-term implications, use cases, and how regulators may react to tokenized assets in capital markets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Robinhood Join In The roundtable will feature panelists from Wall Street Giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Robinhood. Participants include Robert Mitchnick (BlackRock), Cynthia Lo Bessette (Fidelity), Eun Ah Choi (Nasdaq), Will Geyer (Invesco), Sandy Kaul (Franklin Templeton), Christine Moy (Apollo Management), among others. Representatives from Robinhood, Maple Finance, Securitize, and Blockchain Capital will also share their views at the event.

The quarterly XRP Markets provides transparency into Ripple’s XRP holdings and updates on the state of the crypto markets and the XRP ecosystem. “However, the reality is that the report has not had the intended effect,” Ripple said in its Q1 2025 report Monday. “In many instances, Ripple’s transparency has been used against the company, most notably by former SEC leadership.” “As more institutions engage with XRP, additional perspectives and insights are expected to follow, pushing the market conversation forward,” it added. This comes amid a flurry of XRP-based ETF filings in the U.S. and Brazil, with a leveraged XRP ETF already offered to investors since April. XRP delivered one of the strongest performances among major cryptocurrencies in Q1 2025, surging nearly 50% in early February and outpacing both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) during a period marked by market turbulence and rising macroeconomic uncertainty. While BTC remained range-bound and ETH trended lower, XRP stood out for its relative strength, with the XRP/BTC ratio rising more than 10% during the quarter, the report noted. That strength was matched by growing institutional interest. XRP-based investment products recorded $37.7 million in net inflows during the quarter, pushing the year-to-date total to $214 million, just $1 million shy of surpassing ETH-focused funds. XRP spot market activity remained robust throughout the quarter. Average daily volumes hovered around $3.2 billion, with Binance maintaining a dominant share at 40%, followed by Upbit and Coinbase. Price volatility spiked in February, pushing realized volatility to around 130%, as XRP touched levels not seen since early 2018. On-chain activity on the XRP Ledger moderated after a period of expansion in late 2024. Wallet creation and transaction volume dropped by 30–40%, in line with broader slowdowns across Layer 1 networks. However, XRP DeFi activity showed resilience, with DEX volume slipping just 16% quarter-over-quarter. RLUSD was a key driver of activity, with its market cap surpassing $90 million and cumulative DEX trading volume crossing $300 million.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 04:34:18

That’s what Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, laid out during a market segment this week, where he broke down why he thinks the rebound in crypto points directly to more upside for equities. This came as investors braced for the Federal Reserve decision, while stocks pulled back slightly on Monday. Tom said the bottom was already in. He reminded viewers that he’d called 5500 for the S&P 500 weeks ago, and the market hit that without resistance. “Bitcoin is above its April 2nd level,” Tom said. “Bitcoin is telling us the S&P should recover towards the 5800 level in the near term. That’s still upside from here.” He pointed to how the crypto’s performance tends to lead risk-on sentiment, and this pattern is still intact. Tom Lee says tariff fears are fading fast Tom said that although tariff fears could resurface, the macro picture looks better now than it did in early April. He said April 7 was the peak for tariff panic and conditions since then have improved. Tom also pointed to signs from other assets that lead stocks. Credit markets, high-yield bonds, and the VIX are all signaling reduced stress. “High yield has recovered almost all the widening that happened since April 7,” he added. Tom explained that the VIX term structure is now inverted, which tells him volatility is calming down. He said that sets the stage for stocks to move higher. Looking ahead, he said 2026 offers potential confidence, especially if there’s deregulation and better comparisons for corporate earnings. If new tariff rules open the door to more exports, then earnings could get another boost. Tom wasn’t pretending the rally to new highs will be easy though. “The bar for recovering to all-time highs is of course higher,” he said, but made it clear that the current setup is favorable. “The risk reward is actually still positive here,” he added. He said the market can still go higher, even with all the noise. Tom Lee points to crypto and commodities for direction Tom said companies have proved they can handle shocks. He pointed to Covid, inflation, and even the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes. “Companies survived a bullwhip effect on the economy. They survived a surge in inflation. They survived the Fed hiking at the fastest rate ever,” he said. He expects earnings to beat forecasts again, especially if conditions stabilize. Tom listed off names that had been dragging the market down—Tesla, the Magnificent Seven, and Bitcoin—but said they’re all rebounding now. “They’ve begun to recover,” he said, before stressing again that Bitcoin is already ahead of its April 2 price and that’s the biggest clue that stocks should follow. Fundstrat’s Tom also slammed the Fed for sitting on their hands while the European Central Bank is already cutting rates. He pointed out that the ECB’s inflation measure leaves out shelter costs. If the Fed did the same, Tom said, “Core inflation here would be lower than Europe’s.” Still, US interest rates are 125 basis points tighter than the ECB, which he said makes no sense. He said it’s easy to see the argument for the Fed to start cutting now, even before the full effects of tariffs show up. But he also questioned if Trump’s pressure might have boxed Chair Jerome Powell in. If inflation drops but growth slows, Powell might get blamed. “It sets him up to possibly be the fall guy,” Tom said .

Despite initial momentum, price action has leveled off after failing to break out of this corridor in March. XRP ( XRP ) is currently trading at about $2.14, down 1.2% over the last day and more than 8% over the previous week. On-chain activity shows a similar picture to the stalling of price movement. According to Santiment data , the number of daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger has significantly dropped, averaging roughly 40,000, the lowest since November 2024. This is a huge drop from March, when daily activity consistently hovered around 300,000 and peaked at over 612,000 on March 19. XRP price and daily addresses.

The relative strength index is at 44.7, leaning in the neutral zone while the stochastic RSI suggests that XRP is oversold. The moving average convergence divergence indicator points to a short-term downward trend. XRP price analysis.

Only the 200-day estimated moving average, which is currently trading at $1.99, is providing some support. A deeper correction toward the 200-day average or even lower may be possible if XRP breaks below $2.03 with significant volume, particularly if on-chain activity stays weak. However, a clean move above $2.30 might lead to a breakout in the direction of the next significant resistance level, which is close to $2.45. XRP appears to be in a holding pattern at the moment. Low user activity and a decline in transaction volume may hurt sentiment, despite the Securities and Exchange Commission’s legal pressure having eased and new developments growing.

According to data from crypto.news price tracker , Pi Network’s ( PI ) trading volume has dropped by over 35% in the past 24 hours, to about $46.8 million. This is a significant decrease from the over $800 million at the start of mainnet trading. Pi is currently trading at about $0.59, 80% below its peak of $2.99. The token has dropped 11.4% over the past month, continuing a gradual decline that doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon. In a shorter timeframe, it has decreased 3.3% in the last week and 0.1% in the last 24 hours. A key reason for the decline is supply pressure. According to PiScan data , the network is set to unlock 231 million new PI tokens in May and another 222 million in June. Over the next year, over 1.4 billion tokens, worth over $850 million, will enter circulation. Due to dwindling demand and fewer liquidity outlets, this supply pressure could lead to further price declines.

In terms of listing , PI is still unavailable on popular exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Even though trading is available on OKX, Bitget, and MEXC, setbacks like BitMart’s trading pause and HTX’s delisting have undermined market confidence. Development on the network offers a more promising outlook. By June, a full SDK release is expected, which could facilitate the development of third-party decentralized applications and boost actual on-chain activity. On the technical side, PI is trading sideways just below the $0.60 resistance with mixed signals from momentum indicators. The relative strength index is 40.87, which suggests that the market is weak but not oversold. PI has continuously hovered below all significant moving averages from the 10- to 50-day range, indicating that the overall trend is still downward. Right now, the 20-day simple moving average at $0.62 acts as immediate resistance. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A short-term recovery toward $0.67 is possible if the price can break above and hold the $0.62 level. However, considering the significance of impending token unlocks and the ongoing lack of institutional interest, a decline below $0.56 might cause Pi to test new lows.

Bitcoin Is Currently Retesting A Major Supply Cluster In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate has talked about how Bitcoin is looking based on its UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator that tells us about what part of the BTC supply was last purchased at the different price levels that the cryptocurrency has visited in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Fueled By Almost $19 Billion In Crypto Inflows, Data Shows Below is the chart for the metric that the analyst shared in the post. As is visible in the graph, a notable part of the Bitcoin supply was purchased around the price range that BTC has been trading inside recently. In particular, there seem to be two massive supply clusters at these levels. When Checkmate shared the chart yesterday, the cryptocurrency’s price was trading right between the two supply walls. That is, investors who bought in the lower of the walls were in the green and those who did at the upper one were underwater. The analyst called the asset’s location as being “right in the middle of a decision point.” This is because of the fact that any large move up or down from that point would have an effect on the profit-loss status of a large amount of addresses. In on-chain analysis, large supply walls under the spot BTC price are assumed to be locations of probable support, as the investors who bought there might defend their break-even mark during a retest. Similarly, the levels above can act as resistance, as those holders might take the opportunity to sell the cryptocurrency and get out with the whole of their investment back. Since the post, Bitcoin has seen a small pullback, so the asset is now leaning toward the green supply zone. It’s possible that this area would help keep BTC from falling under, given the large amount of supply that was purchased inside it.

As Checkmate puts it, “all it will take is one big red or green candle from here to convince people of a lower high, or bull continuation, respectively.” Bitcoin is currently also near a macro on-chain support level: the short-term holder Realized Price. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has explained in an X post, this level is situated at $93,364. The short-term holder Realized Price refers to the average cost basis of the Bitcoin holders who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. This level has historically served as a boundary between bullish and bearish trends for BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $94,000, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are climbing the ranks quickly, with a clear uptick in engagement and positioning. Meanwhile, names like Solana (SOL) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Injective (INJ) are gaining quiet traction, especially among technical analysts and long-horizon investors looking for sustained momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE – Smart Positioning in a Crowded Market MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t aiming to compete through hype—it’s aiming to win through precision. With over $7.8 million raised , rising pre-sale demand, and a $0.007 listing price in view, the fundamentals are aligning fast. Its message, branding, and consistency in execution make MAGACOINFINANCE stand out among early-stage contenders. Investor communities across X, Telegram, and YouTube are increasingly focused on this project—not as a trend, but as a calculated long-term position. Use code MAGA50X at checkout to unlock a 50% bonus and secure early access before the broader listing surge begins. XRP – Strong Foundation and Institutional Appeal Current Price: $2.15, XRP continues to show impressive resilience, supported by rising ETF volume and on-chain strength. Analysts are closely monitoring the $2.45 breakout level, which could trigger renewed upward movement as institutional investors deepen their positions. Solana (SOL) – Strengthening as a Scalable Leader Current Price: ~$148, Solana has regained momentum after a robust 41% surge in April , positioning itself as a core platform for high-performance decentralized apps and real-world tokenization. If buying pressure holds, SOL is likely to test resistance around the $180 mark—opening the door to new upside in Q2. Kaspa and Injective – Quiet Builders with Real Fundamentals Kaspa (KAS) continues to gain ground among proof-of-work advocates. Trading around $0.10, the project is benefiting from rising interest in blockDAG tech and scalable architecture. If demand continues, a breakout above $0.30 remains a plausible scenario. Injective (INJ) remains anchored near $35. While not making headlines daily, its developer adoption and cross-chain ecosystem give it solid long-term fundamentals. Smart money continues to accumulate INJ quietly, anticipating future infrastructure relevance. Final Thoughts In a market where timing and traction are everything, XRP and Solana offer strength backed by structure, while Kaspa and Injective quietly build. But for those looking at pure early-stage upside, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to shine through with increasing conviction.

In a May 5 letter to a Manhattan federal court, the attorneys for Samourai co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill revealed that prosecutors had been informed by officials from the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) months before the charges were filed. FinCEN had reportedly told prosecutors that Samourai Wallet did not need a license to operate. “Shockingly, six months later, the same prosecutors criminally charged Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill with operating just such a business without a FinCEN license,” the lawyers noted in the letter. The disclosure came after a year of suppression, with prosecutors only revealing the information on April 1, 2025, despite a legal requirement to share it months earlier. Notable update in the Samourai Wallet Case: Today, devs’ lawyers revealed that despite being *explicitly* told by FinCEN that non-custodial software such as Samourai Wallet is most likely not a money transmitter, DOJ prosecuted the devs anyway… pic.twitter.com/uTms4i99iR — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) May 5, 2025 Samourai Wallet Founders Were Arrested Despite FinCEN’s Clear Stance on Legal Status Rodriguez and Hill were charged in Feb. 2024 with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering conspiracy. The charges were unsealed and the pair arrested in April . The allegations stem from Samourai’s mixing service, which allegedly helped launder over $100m through over $2b in illegal transactions. Prosecutors claimed the service aided in transactions involving black market dealings and scammers. The defense team pointed out that FinCEN had informed prosecutors that Samourai Wallet, which does not hold custody of cryptocurrencies, did not qualify as a “money services business” under existing guidance. Despite FinCEN’s Position, Prosecutors Push Forward with Charges Against Samourai Wallet This information came after a conversation between prosecutors and FinCEN officials, including Kevin O’Connor and Lorena Valente. They considered whether Samourai met the criteria for a money transmitter. The officials noted that Samourai did not take custody of crypto. Therefore, it does not control the private keys to any stored assets. This suggested that Samourai was not operating as a money services business. Despite this, prosecutors proceeded with the charges, arguing that Samourai could still be accused of functional control over the cryptocurrency. However, FinCEN had not addressed this argument in their official guidance, and it was considered a weak position by the officials. Samourai Lawyers Demand Hearing Over Delayed Disclosure and Call for Case Dismissal Now, Samourai’s lawyers are seeking a hearing to investigate the delay in disclosure. They want to determine an appropriate remedy. If the government resists dismissing the case, the defense will renew their request for dismissal . They argue that the charges were brought without fair notice. The defense also claims the company acted in good faith based on the available guidance at the time. Further, the defense team pointed to a recent memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The memo stated that the Justice Department would no longer prosecute crypto mixers like Samourai for regulatory violations. Issued on April 7, 2025, the memo prompted the defense to demand that the case be dismissed. They argued that, under FinCEN’s guidance, Samourai was not a money transmitter and could not be prosecuted for lacking a license. The outcome of the hearing could impact the broader industry. It is especially important for developers of non-custodial platforms like Samourai Wallet. If successful, it could set a precedent for how crypto mixers are regulated in the future. This would particularly affect their classification under US financial laws.

SOL price is now consolidating near $145 and might extend losses below the $142 support. SOL price started a fresh decline below the $150 and $148 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $150 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term rising channel or a continuation pattern forming with support at $144 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Solana Price Consolidates Gains Solana price formed a base above the $142 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $145 and $150 resistance levels. However, the bears were active below the $155 resistance zone. A high was formed at $153.90 and the price started a fresh decline. The price dipped below $150 and $148. A low was formed at $142.64 and the price is now consolidating losses.

There is also a short-term rising channel or a continuation pattern forming with support at $144 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $147 level. The next major resistance is near the $150 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $153.90 swing high to the $142.64 low. The main resistance could be $155. A successful close above the $155 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $165. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $145 zone. The first major support is near the $142 level. A break below the $142 level might send the price toward the $135 zone. If there is a close below the $135 support, the price could decline toward the $122 support in the near term.

Alexander Gurevich will be investigated for his alleged involvement in several “computer crimes,” including laundering millions of dollars and transferring stolen property allegedly connected to the Nomad Bridge hack in 2022, The Jerusalem Post reported on May 5. Gurevich returned to Israel from an overseas trip on April 19 but was ordered to appear before the Jerusalem District Court for an extradition hearing soon after, according to the report. On April 29, Gurevich changed his name in Israel’s Population Registry to “Alexander Block” and received a passport under that name at Israel’s Ben-Gurion Airport the next day. He was arrested at the same airport two days later, on May 1, while waiting to board a flight to Russia. Gurevich allegedly identified a vulnerability in the Nomad bridge, which he exploited and stole roughly $2.89 million worth of tokens from in August 2022. Dozens of copycat hackers discovered and capitalized on the security vulnerability soon after, leading to a total loss of $190 million . Gurevich allegedly reached out to a Nomad executive on Telegram Prosecutors allege that shortly after the hack, Gurevich messaged Nomad’s chief technology officer, James Prestwich, on Telegram using a fake identity, admitting that he had been “amateurishly” seeking a crypto protocol to exploit. He allegedly apologized for “the trouble he caused Prestwich and his team” and voluntarily transferred about $162,000 into a recovery wallet the company had set up. Prestwich told Gurevich that Nomad would pay him 10% of the value of the assets he had stolen, to which Gurevich responded that he would consult his lawyer. However, Nomad never heard back from him after that. Alleged messages between Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel. Source: Yoav Itiel At some point during the negotiations, Gurevich demanded a reward of $500,000 for identifying the vulnerability. Related: Do Kwon is in US custody after extradition battle US federal authorities filed an eight-count indictment against Gurevich in the Northern District of California on Aug. 16, 2023, in addition to obtaining a warrant for his arrest. California is where the team behind the Nomad bridge is based. The US submitted a formal extradition request in December 2024, the Post noted. The money laundering charges that Gurevich faces carry a maximum of 20 years, significantly harsher than the penalties he would face in Israel. Gurevich is believed to have arrived in Israel a few days before the $190 million exploit occurred, prompting Israeli officials to believe he carried out the attack while in Israel.

Right now, four names are aligning as early movers: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the breakout contender MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As dominant players consolidate, new opportunities are taking form—and for investors seeking aggressive upside, this may be the time to pay close attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum in crypto is earned—not manufactured—and MAGACOINFINANCE is earning it in all the right ways. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is showing real strength: wallet activity is up, the community is expanding organically, and development milestones are being met with precision. Rather than chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is focusing on structure and sustainability. It’s laying a true foundation for breakout growth—something few early-stage projects achieve. Those entering now aren’t late—they’re early, and they may be entering just as the wider market starts to notice. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism remains a leader in Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, drawing demand for fast, cost-effective smart contracts. Arbitrum is thriving on strong developer activity and a vibrant dApp ecosystem, pushing Ethereum usability to new levels. Sei is gaining attention with its trading-focused architecture, built for speed and reduced congestion. Litecoin continues to hold its place as a reliable peer-to-peer transfer coin, especially where simplicity and speed are essential. Each of these assets has a clear use case—but none offer the raw early-stage momentum of MAGACOINFINANCE at this moment. Conclusion The next wave of crypto wealth won’t be built by those holding yesterday’s champions—it will come from those spotting what’s quietly emerging today. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP continue to command relevance. But MAGACOINFINANCE is the rising player offering one of the rarest setups in the space: early access to a project that’s already raised $7.8 million and is just getting started.

According to the 7-day active address count, Solana continues to lead by a wide margin with over 24 million addresses, followed by Tron, Base, BNB Chain and Aptos. Here are the blockchains and numbers with the most active addresses in the last 7 days: Solana – 24,215,077 Tron – 5,851,957 Base – 5,420,215 BNB Chain – 5,243,621 Aptos – 4,889,094 Ethereum – 1,874,615 Polygon – 1,837,339 Sei v2 – 1,088,095 Arbitrum – 1,032,622 Ronin – 532,290 Optimism – 493,944 Sonic – 360,666 Unichain – 327,753 Gravity – 327,048 Berachain – 232,190 Nearby – 717,249 Cell – 699,193 Stellar – 148,323 Blast – 26,450 Victory – 80,987 It is noteworthy that the network of Ethereum, the world's largest altcoin, is not the network with the most active addresses. The reason for this is that the ETH network is slow and expensive. On the other hand, layer-2 networks, which can be explained as performing transactions on an external network and finalizing them on the Ethereum network, maintain their popularity. These networks include Base, Arbitrum and Optimism. Related News: Will Success Finally Come This Time?

In two separate but closely timed developments, asset manager VanEck has filed with US regulators to launch the country’s first BNB-based exchange-traded fund, while Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has recommended that Kyrgyzstan use BNB and Bitcoin as the foundation of its national cryptocurrency reserves. VanEck Files First-Ever BNB ETF Application in the US as Crypto ETF Race Heats Up According to a newly published S-1 registration statement , the proposed VanEck BNB ETF is structured to directly hold spot BNB tokens and may periodically stake a portion of its assets through trusted staking providers. If approved, this fund would become the first ETF in the US to offer exposure to the BNB token — a digital asset with a market capitalization of approximately $84 billion and a staking yield near 2.5%, according to StakingRewards.com. BNB, initially launched to support trading fee discounts on the Binance exchange, has since evolved into a key component of the BNB Chain ecosystem — a leading smart contract platform. BNB Chain is among the most popular blockchain networks (Source: DeFILlama ) With over $6 billion in total value locked (TVL) as of early May, according to DeFiLlama, BNB Chain ranks among the top blockchain networks globally. It powers a wide range of decentralized applications, including DeFi platforms, games, and NFT marketplaces. The VanEck proposal comes at a critical time for Binance and its ecosystem. Despite regulatory headwinds in the US and abroad, Binance continues to maintain its position as one of the largest global crypto exchanges. The potential listing of a BNB ETF in the United States could serve as a symbolic turning point in the token’s institutional legitimacy. Riding the Bitcoin ETF Wave VanEck’s filing also reflects a broader momentum shift in the crypto ETF landscape, particularly in the wake of the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. Since their approval in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted more than $40 billion in cumulative inflows, according to data from Farside Investors . Total inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs (Source: Farside Investors) Speaking at the recent Token2049 conference in Dubai, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he expects this ETF-driven enthusiasm to spread beyond Bitcoin. “This cycle so far has been the ETFs. And it’s almost all Bitcoin,” CZ said. “Ether hasn’t had as much success, but Bitcoin’s success will spill over to the others eventually.” That “spillover” appears to be in full swing, with a growing list of asset managers seeking SEC approval for ETFs that track a wide variety of cryptocurrencies — including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and now BNB. VanEck’s BNB filing is just the latest in a series of moves by asset managers to gain a foothold in the altcoin ETF market. Over the past few months, VanEck has also submitted applications for ETFs based on Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), both prominent Layer-1 blockchains. Meanwhile, other firms have taken bolder steps, floating ETF concepts tied to meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), capitalizing on the speculative energy in the crypto market during the 2025 bull run. The SEC, under increased pressure to modernize its approach to digital assets, has formally acknowledged dozens of these filings since Jan. 20, when President Donald Trump returned to office. The Trump administration has so far signaled more openness toward crypto-related financial products, though the SEC's ultimate stance on altcoin-based ETFs remains uncertain. Staking Could Add a Yield Component to ETFs An interesting detail in the VanEck BNB ETF filing is its potential to stake a portion of its BNB holdings. Unlike traditional ETFs, crypto staking provides an opportunity for funds to generate yield while maintaining exposure to the underlying asset. This could enhance the fund’s appeal to yield-seeking investors in a high-inflation environment and further differentiate it from Bitcoin and Ethereum-based ETFs, which do not yet widely integrate staking. As of May 5, BNB staking yields around 2.5% annually, providing a modest but consistent reward to long-term holders. BNB price chart (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While the VanEck BNB ETF still faces a potentially lengthy regulatory review process, its filing marks a new chapter in the US crypto ETF narrative. Institutional interest is clearly growing beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the door now appears open — at least slightly — for altcoin ETFs to follow the same path toward approval. If the SEC gives the green light, the VanEck BNB ETF could act as a bellwether for other altcoin ETFs and help usher in a new wave of digital asset investment products designed specifically for mainstream markets. CZ Proposes Bitcoin and BNB for Kyrgyzstan's National Crypto Reserve as Country Pushes Ahead with Web3 Ambitions The proposal follows a string of developments that suggest Kyrgyzstan is positioning itself as a forward-thinking crypto hub in Central Asia. From launching a national crypto payments platform to piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the Kyrgyz government appears to be embracing digital assets as part of a broader financial modernization strategy. In a post shared on X, CZ confirmed he had advised Kyrgyzstan’s government to accumulate Bitcoin and BNB as part of its reserve strategy. “Start with the strongest,” CZ wrote, suggesting that Bitcoin’s status as the leading decentralized asset and BNB’s connection to one of the world’s largest blockchain networks make them ideal candidates for foundational crypto reserves. Zhao’s influence in the crypto world cannot be understated. According to Forbes, he holds approximately 94 million BNB tokens — over 64% of the total circulating supply — valued at around $55 billion at current prices. While he no longer leads Binance, CZ remains a powerful figure in shaping global crypto policy, and his endorsement could carry significant weight for emerging economies looking to integrate digital assets into their financial systems. CZ’s proposal comes shortly after Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency (NIA) to introduce Binance Pay — the exchange’s crypto payment platform — to the country. The partnership aims to allow both residents and visitors to conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies, and it marks a significant step toward real-world crypto adoption. In addition to the payments initiative, Binance Academy is working alongside Kyrgyz institutions to provide blockchain education and help establish a skilled local workforce capable of supporting the country’s growing digital asset ecosystem. Binance CEO Richard Teng also revealed in a Financial Times interview that the exchange has been advising various nations on the formation of crypto reserves. Kyrgyzstan appears to be among the first to act on that advice. Government Embraces Web3 Future The Kyrgyz government has shown a strong willingness to integrate digital assets into its national strategy. On April 17, President Sadyr Zhaparov signed into law a framework enabling the country’s central bank to pilot a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Under the new legislation, the digital version of the Kyrgyzstani som has been granted legal tender status, putting the country on a short list of nations ready to test government-backed digital currencies in the real economy. The pilot program aims to improve financial inclusion, modernize monetary infrastructure, and reduce dependency on foreign intermediaries in domestic transactions. Kyrgyzstan’s ambitions don’t end there. The country reportedly plans to launch a gold-backed stablecoin called the “Gold Dollar” (USDKG), pegged to the US dollar but backed by $500 million worth of gold reserves held by the Ministry of Finance. If confirmed, the stablecoin would act as a hybrid between traditional commodity backing and modern digital finance — a concept that could appeal to countries seeking to hedge against inflation and dollar volatility. Regional and Global Implications CZ’s advisory role in Kyrgyzstan is part of a growing trend of crypto leaders acting as informal diplomats for blockchain adoption. He previously disclosed that he had been officially and unofficially advising governments on regulatory and technological frameworks for the crypto sector. In April, similar news emerged from Pakistan, where Zhao was reportedly appointed to advise on digital asset policies. If Kyrgyzstan follows through on building national crypto reserves and launching a gold-backed stablecoin, it could set a precedent for other nations in Central Asia and beyond. By combining decentralized digital assets like Bitcoin with sovereign-backed instruments such as stablecoins and CBDCs, the country may be laying the groundwork for a unique hybrid monetary system. Changpeng Zhao’s proposal to use Bitcoin and BNB as the foundation of Kyrgyzstan’s national crypto reserve shows the rapid evolution of global finance. Backed by Binance’s ongoing educational and infrastructure initiatives in the country, Kyrgyzstan is emerging as a surprising but determined player in the race toward blockchain integration at the national level. With a CBDC pilot underway, a potential gold-backed stablecoin in development, and direct collaboration with major industry leaders, Kyrgyzstan’s crypto experiment is one to watch closely in the months and years to come.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-06 05:30:00

This latest acquisition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 555,450 BTC, valued at approximately $38.08 billion, with an average purchase price of $68,550 per BTC. Strategy Announces New $21 Billion ATM Offering The acquisition was financed through a strategic combination of common and preferred stock sales. Specifically, Strategy raised $128.5 million through its common stock at-the-market (ATM) program and an additional $51.8 million from the sale of STRK preferred shares. Notably, this latest transaction exhausts the company’s previous $21 billion ATM offering that was initiated last year. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy and a well-known advocate for BTC, also shared on social media that the company has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 14.0% as of May 4, 2025. He emphasized that the firm currently holds 555,450 BTC, acquired for approximately $38.08 billion. In a bid to further bolster its BTC accumulation strategy, Strategy announced last week plans to double its capital raising capacity. This includes introducing a new $21 billion ATM offering and expanding its debt purchase program to $42 billion. These initiatives indicate the company’s commitment to enhancing its BTC-heavy balance sheet, even in light of recent financial challenges, including five consecutive quarterly net losses. Institutional Demand For Bitcoin Surges During its latest earnings call, Strategy unveiled the “42/42 Plan,” a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The plan involves splitting the funding equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all earmarked for future BTC acquisitions. Despite reporting ongoing losses, investor sentiment remains optimistic. Strategy continues to be the largest corporate holder of BTC, with its holdings representing nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. At current market prices around $94,000, the company’s bitcoin assets are valued at over $52 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Says $2 XRP Price Is Low As It Still Isn’t “Activated” This recent purchase comes amid a backdrop of strong institutional demand for BTC, particularly through regulated investment vehicles. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) has experienced significant inflows in the past two weeks, reflecting growing interest from institutional investors. However, despite the positive outlook on its BTC strategy, Strategy’s shares were down 2.7% in pre-market trading on Monday, following a gain of over 3% last Thursday. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $94,596, a slight decrease of 0.2% in the 24-hour time frame, and gains of up to 13% in the monthly period for the market’s largest cryptocurrency.

With interest rate decisions and Powell’s speech on the agenda, the market is on edge. After a long pause following aggressive hikes in 2022–2023, the Fed began cutting rates in late 2024, bringing the current rate to 4.25%–4.50%. Now, with a 94% probability that the Fed will hold rates steady, investors are watching closely. Despite strong job numbers, inflation remains slightly high, clouding the timeline for future cuts. Experts say more rate cuts may come later in 2025, but there’s still no clear roadmap. Volatility Ahead of Powell Speech Market analyst King Baldwin shared his pre-FOMC outlook on X, pointing to the high odds of no change in interest rates. However, he warns that a hawkish tone from the Fed could send Bitcoin down to a support zone between $91,500 and $92,000. If Jerome Powell Jerome Powell Jerome Hayden ""Jay"" Powell is an American attorney and investment banker who has served since 2018 as the 16th chair of the Federal Reserve Finance signals a dovish stance or hints at near-term cuts, Bitcoin could rebound toward the $100,000 mark . Baldwin notes that Core PCE inflation stands at 2.6%, and recession odds are at 60%—both factors keeping investors cautious. All eyes are now on Powell’s press conference, with hopes for a June rate cut signal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run 2025 at Risk as Fed Rate Cut Doubts Grow , No Rate Cut Expected, Says Michaël van de Poppe Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes a rate cut is highly unlikely at this FOMC meeting. He suggests the Fed will stay cautious due to sticky inflation. A surprise cut would shock markets. Adding to the pressure is Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President who continues to push for cuts amid rising tariffs. But the Federal Reserve is expected to focus on inflation control rather than bow to political pressure. Crypto Market Braces for Powell’s Speech Trump’s aggressive stance on trade and monetary policy is stirring debate about the Fed’s independence. With fiat volatility rising, many investors are turning back to Bitcoin as a hedge. With Powell’s speech scheduled for May 7, both traditional and crypto markets are bracing for volatility. Analysts are urging traders to avoid leverage and expect short-term turbulence. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Following a strong rally in April, the token has lost some of its recent gains, falling 7% in the last day and more than 22% this week. Trading activity in Worldcoin ( WLD ) has increased 64% despite of the price drop, indicating that traders are responding swiftly to any changes. This comes at a time when Worldcoin is increasingly dealing with global regulatory issues. In one of the latest developments, the Worldcoin Foundation was ordered by a Kenyan High Court on May 5 to remove all biometric information it had gathered in the nation, including facial and iris scans. As reported by local media outlet Kenyans.co.ke, the ruling also bans the project from collecting any new data. It criticized Worldcoin’s past use of crypto incentives in exchange for sensitive information. This came after a lawsuit from the Katiba Institute challenged how the company handled personal data using its app and orb devices.

One of the businesses that operated under the Worldcoin umbrella, according to the Ministry of Communication’s May 4 statement , was not properly registered. As a result, authorities put a hold on Worldcoin’s certification and summoned the relevant parties for additional questioning. From a technical perspective, WLD is currently trading close to $0.88 after declining from its April highs of $1.20. The price has been stable since late April and is trading just above support, which is around $0.86. Worldcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, the token has indicated short-term weakness by breaking below the 20-day moving average. After cooling from overbought levels to 47, the relative strength index indicates less buying pressure but not yet complete bearish momentum. The next area to keep an eye on is $0.80 or even $0.75 if WLD loses support close to $0.86. Conversely, a rebound might drive the price back toward the $0.94 resistance level, but regaining bullish momentum might require high volume and positive developments. The future of Worldcoin now depends on how it handles mounting regulatory pressure in key markets.

However, if the Fed fails to deliver these cuts, the market narrative will shift, choking these speculative flows. “For Bitcoin, which thrives on liquidity and risk appetite, the absence of rate cuts could stall momentum or even trigger a drawdown.” The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday, May 7. Finally, event risk, or unforeseen macro-level shocks that cannot be predicted in timing or magnitude, can cause severe disruption to financial markets. “For Bitcoin, these risks bypass conventional forecasting tools and risk models, creating sharp breaks from trend behavior.” Peterson cited examples that included nuclear accidents, large-scale terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure, cyberattacks on financial systems, another pandemic, or massive natural disasters. Bitcoin behaves like a “high-beta asset” under these conditions, “subject to indiscriminate selling, access limitations, and temporary narrative collapse,” he said , concluding the analysis on May 5. BTC Price Outlook Doom and gloom aside, Bitcoin was still trading within its rangebound channel, where it has been for the past fortnight. The asset has swung from below $93,750 in late trading on Monday to retap $95,000 during Tuesday morning trading in Asia.

The company and existing stockholders are aiming to raise $500 million through offering a total of 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 apiece, eToro said on May 5. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows eToro is offering 5 million shares, with a further 5 million being put up by the likes of the company’s co-founder and CEO, Yoni Assia; his brother and executive director, Ronen Assia; along with venture firms Spark Capital, BRM Group and Andalusian Private Capital, among others. The company offers stock and crypto trading targeting retail and plans to list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.” It's slated to compete with Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which saw crypto trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly 30% so far this year, according to Google Finance. In the filing, eToro said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO . eToro has also put aside 500,000 shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at employees. The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter. Source: Matthew Sigel In a section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.” Other crypto-related risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate in certain jurisdictions, if at all.” It also said it expects “to continue to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) laws “on an ongoing basis.” IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24. The company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings.

In a tweet posted on May 3, Ali highlighted that 71.54% of traders with open XRP positions are betting on the price going up. Only 28.46% are taking short positions. The resulting long/short ratio stands at 2.51. 71.54% of traders on Binance Futures with open $XRP positions are leaning bullish! pic.twitter.com/zDHbN1o1sl — Ali (@ali_charts) May 4, 2025 This data indicates a significant bullish bias among traders using the Binance Futures platform. The long/short ratio is a metric that helps gauge market sentiment by comparing the number of accounts holding long positions versus those holding short positions. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are expecting price appreciation, while a ratio below 1 indicates bearish expectations. At 2.51, the current figure shows that more than twice as many traders are betting on an XRP price increase than a decline. The chart shared by Ali also reflects the movement of this ratio over time. At earlier timestamps, the bullish dominance was slightly lower, with a visible decline before rebounding and stabilizing above the 2.0 mark. This recent shift upward in the long/short ratio shows increasing confidence among long-position holders. Price Performance Diverges from Trader Sentiment Interestingly, this bullish sentiment appears to be forming in contrast to recent price performance. According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP has declined by 4.34% over the past seven days and by 0.37% in the last 24 hours. These figures show that despite the falling price trend, many traders maintain their optimistic outlook. The divergence between market sentiment and price action could be interpreted in many ways. Some traders might view the recent decline as a short-term correction within a broader bullish structure. In contrast, others may expect a price rebound based on technical indicators or anticipated news developments related to XRP or the crypto market. Implications for the Market The dominance of long positions can impact price movements if sentiment begins to unwind or traders begin to take profits. If the price continues to drop despite long-term exposure, there may be an increased risk of liquidations, which could intensify downward pressure in the short term. Conversely, if market conditions begin to favor upward movement, the current positioning could lead to rapid price recovery, amplified by the existing bullish bias. It is worth noting that while the long/short ratio provides useful insights into trader sentiment, it does not predict price direction on its own. It should be interpreted alongside broader market indicators and price trends. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This critical detail was only disclosed to the defense almost a year later, which prompted calls for case dismissal and hearings over prosecutorial conduct. Meanwhile, OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer criticized the SEC’s past enforcement-heavy tactics under the Biden administration, and described them as stifling innovation. He praised the Trump-era regulatory shift that led to dropped cases against Coinbase, Ripple, and others. At the same time, the trial of former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony is beginning under new DOJ leadership, adding further complexity. Overall, it seems like there is a growing clash between US federal prosecutors and the crypto industry cross multiple high-profile cases. Samourai Wallet Fights Back Samourai Wallet’s legal team is accusing federal prosecutors of withholding critical information that could have changed the course of the criminal case against its co-founders. In a letter that was submitted to a Manhattan federal court on May 5, attorneys for Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill revealed that prosecutors were informed by the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in late 2023 that Samourai Wallet did not qualify as a Money Services Business (MSB) under existing guidance. Despite this, prosecutors still moved forward six months later with criminal charges alleging that the crypto mixing service was operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. The defense claims this guidance should have been disclosed by May 8, 2024, but was only shared with them on April 1, 2025, almost a year late. Rodriguez and Hill were charged in February of 2024 and arrested in April for allegedly facilitating over $2 billion in unlawful transactions, including $100 million linked to online black markets and scams, through Samourai’s crypto-mixing technology. Both men pleaded not guilty. Samourai Wallet website Their lawyers argue that FinCEN explicitly told prosecutors in a call that the Samourai app, which does not take custody of funds or hold private keys, would not be considered an MSB. According to a prosecutor's email summarizing that call, FinCEN representatives said that without custody, Samourai would likely not require a license, and that any attempt to argue otherwise would be legally difficult due to lack of precedent. The defense is now requesting a court hearing to examine the government's delayed disclosure and explore potential remedies. They also plan to renew a motion to dismiss the case, due to the new evidence and a recent Justice Department policy shift. In an April 7 memo , Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated that prosecutors should not pursue cases against crypto mixers for accidental regulatory violations. The defense argues that if Samourai was never required to register as a money transmitter under FinCEN’s own guidance, the entire basis of the criminal charges collapses. Both sides already asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider whether to continue the case in light of the Justice Department’s changing stance on crypto enforcement. OpenSea CEO Slams SEC Others in the industry are also not very happy with how crypto enforcement was treated. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer recently criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SECs) prior approach to crypto regulation, and described it as overly broad and harmful to innovation. In a recent interview , Finzer argued that under the Biden administration, the SEC unfairly targeted legitimate players in the digital asset space, including OpenSea, by treating all digital assets with a one-size-fits-all approach. This, he said, created a persistent regulatory overhang that stifled progress in the sector. OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC in 2024, signaling a potential enforcement action over claims that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange. Finzer pushed back against the charge, and called it an example of “regulation by enforcement.” Finzer is very optimistic that the new leadership under SEC Chair Paul Atkins will take a more nuanced and innovation-friendly stance. He firmly believes that there is a need for regulation that protects consumers while still allowing space for experimentation and growth. Since the transition to the Trump administration, the SEC greatly reduced its legal pressure on crypto firms, including dropping cases against Coinbase, Kraken, Uniswap, Yuga Labs, and OpenSea. It even dismissed its years-long battle with Ripple. This change followed strong support from the crypto industry during the 2024 US elections, with pro-crypto candidates receiving over $119 million in donations. While the broader crypto market suffered after the FTX collapse in 2022 , Finzer is still confident in the long-term future of NFTs. He said that despite low trading volumes, innovation in areas like gaming and digital art continues to thrive. OpenSea, meanwhile, is now working to expand beyond NFTs to support a wider range of on-chain assets. SafeMoon Trial Opens During DOJ Shake-Up The US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) underwent a leadership change just as the criminal trial of former SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony is set to begin. On May 5, the office announced that Joseph Nocella will take over as interim US Attorney for a period of 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee is appointed. Statement from the United States Attorney’s Office Nocella was appointed by President Donald Trump, replacing Acting US Attorney John Durham. He vowed to focus on prosecuting narcotics traffickers, gang members, terrorists, and other serious offenders. The timing of Nocella’s appointment happened as jury selection begins in the high-profile crypto fraud case against Karony. This raised some questions about whether the leadership transition could affect the prosecution’s direction. SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony Karony, along with co-defendants Kyle Nagy and Thomas Smith, was indicted in November of 2023 on charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Prosecutors allege the trio misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth of SafeMoon (SFM) tokens between 2021 and 2022. Karony maintained his innocence and has been out on a $3 million bond since February of 2024. Earlier this year, Karony asked the court to consider delaying the trial due to proposed changes to US securities laws under the Trump administration, which he argued could influence the legal grounds of the case. However, jury selection is proceeding as scheduled under US Magistrate Judge James Cho, with District Judge Eric Komitee set to oversee the full trial starting May 6. While EDNY has not traditionally been the focal point for high-profile crypto enforcement actions, it has handled several cases involving digital assets, including a SEC complaint against Hex founder Richard Heart. Its neighboring jurisdiction, the Southern District of New York, will oversee the sentencing of former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky on May 8.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-06 05:58:34

Caroline D. Pham, acting chairperson of the CFTC, spoke at the Medici Conference, and she said they intend to monitor multiple tokenization pilot schemes . She noted that they must understand how tokenized securities can function within legacy financial infrastructure and ensure that laws are written to support that vision. Through studying these pilots, the CFTC wants to gain technological expertise that could help provide input on future regulations. The agency’s observer role signifies a proactive approach to engaging with emerging financial technologies without direct market intervention. The approach permits the CFTC to closely watch developments without giving up its regulatory oversight. Crypto community members are pleased with the CFTC’s planned tokenization pilot initiative The CFTC wants to learn more about the practical impact of tokenized assets and how they operate in the real world. In an interview at the Medici Conference with Journalist Eleanor Terett, Pham argued that they wanted to understand tokenization tech. Terett even posted on X: CFTC plans to be an observer on a handful of industry tokenization pilot programs in order for the agency to learn first hand how well-tokenized assets can function in the real world and gain experience with the technology. Eleanor Terett Responding to Terett’s post, most crypto members seemed pleased with the CFTC’s initiative, with some arguing that it’s the best approach. The Department of Government Efficiency also commented on the matter, posting an automated message on X. It described the CFTC’s decision as smart, saying that using stablecoins as collateral could modernize financial systems and reduce bureaucratic insufficiencies. The CFTC declared it would host a CEO forum to talk about a pilot program for stablecoins In February, the CFTC announced it would hold a CEO forum to discuss a pilot program focused on non-cash collateral like stablecoins. The forum would include Circle, Coinbase, Crypto.com, MoonPay, and Ripple’s leaders. Back then, Pham insisted that the agency was geared toward innovation and would engage with market participants to achieve Trump’s crypto agenda. In September 2023, she also suggested having a pilot initiative focused on regulating crypto. In her proposal, she detailed they would start discussions with multiple stakeholders, and then the agency would propose and adopt rules around registration requirements and risk management. Then, the agency would assess whether to modify the rules permanently. Last year, The CFTC’s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC), sponsored by Acting Chairman Pham, also proposed expanding the use of non-cash collateral through distributed ledger technology. At the time, Pham believed the GMAC’s recommendation on tokenized non-cash collateral represented a meaningful first step toward achieving regulatory clarity for digital assets in the U.S. She said this development would help unlock opportunities for the derivatives markets while maintaining the same guardrails and protections already in place.

Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business. “The government's venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said. “It concludes by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.” Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client's background in its sentencing request. Source: Court Listener Mashinsky pleaded guilty to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023. Lawyers acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action, every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation, and every employee's watercooler speculation,” they said. As part of its April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive and steal. Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe. Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky? Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions. In November 2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius' restructuring plan to repay customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors. Former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.

The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. The proposal ( PR 32359 ) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs. OP_RETURN is a special type of Bitcoin ( BTC ) transaction output that allows storing small amounts of data on the blockchain, popularized during the ordinals inscriptions craze in early 2024. Unlike regular transaction outputs, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable and don’t bloat unspent transaction outputs ( UTXOs ). The original limit is no longer effective as people found ways around it, such as using fake output addresses, which are actually worse for the network, while some mining services were already ignoring the limit, said Sanders. “Large-data inscriptions are happening regardless and can be done in more or less abusive ways; the cap merely channels them into more opaque forms that cause damage to the network.” Related: Bitcoin block size could grow to 4 MB with inscriptions: Research Benefits of removing the limit include a cleaner UTXO set, or database of spendable outputs, more consistent behavior across the network, and better alignment with how Bitcoin is actually being used, he added. Three possible paths were considered: keeping the cap, raising the cap and removing the cap, which was ultimately decided upon after earning “broad, though not perhaps unanimous, support.” A controversial change to Bitcoin “Many users find this to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons,” said Bitcoiner Samson Mow on X on May 5. He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent. Some also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest. Critics of OP_RETURN limit removal.

That’s just how it is in 2025. But London startup SpacePay is trying something different. They’ve created a system where merchants don’t need expensive new equipment – just a software update to their existing terminals. Their platform lets over 325 different crypto wallets work with regular card machines, charges just 0.5% per transaction, and has pulled in more than $1 million during their ongoing presale. Solving the Merchant Adoption Problem Store owners don’t want the hassle of accepting crypto payments. Who can blame them? They worry about price swings, expensive equipment, and complicated setups. Most just stick with what they know. SpacePay’s approach is pretty straightforward. They update existing Android payment terminals with new software. That’s it. No new machines to buy or complicated systems to learn. Shops keep their setup, and customers get to use their crypto. The beauty is in the simplicity. Customers use what they already have in their digital wallets, and shops don’t need to change much on their end. With support for hundreds of different crypto wallets, it works for most crypto users without extra steps. Redefining the way you pay with $SPY pic.twitter.com/OasS0KIIrZ — SpacePay (@SpacePayLtd) April 26, 2025 The Economics of the 0.5% Fee Small fees add up fast in retail. Every percentage point matters when you’re running a small business. SpacePay charges 0.5% per transaction – noticeably less than what most payment processors take. Think about it. Regular card processors often take 1.5% to 3.5% of each sale. For a coffee shop doing $2,000 in daily sales, that difference could mean saving hundreds or even thousands monthly. Lower costs make a real difference for small businesses trying to stay profitable. This fee setup helps everyone involved. Stores pay less per transaction, and the fees collected help keep SpacePay running. Some of that money goes back to people holding $SPY tokens through their revenue-sharing program. It’s a practical approach that works for the long run. Volatility Protection – The Missing Piece Let’s be honest – crypto prices jump around a lot. This scares shop owners. Who wants to accept $100 worth of crypto only to find it’s worth $80 tomorrow? That’s just bad business. SpacePay handles this with a simple fix. When someone pays with crypto, the shop gets their local currency right away. No waiting for conversions, no worrying about price drops. The money hits their account in dollars, euros, or whatever currency they normally use. This also helps with cash flow – something every small business owner thinks about daily. Unlike traditional systems that might hold funds for days, shops get their money immediately. This matters when you’ve got bills to pay and inventory to order. Presale Progress and Token Generation Timeline So far, SpacePay has raised over $1 million from people interested in what they’re building. Each token is priced $0.003181 right now. Their presale uses tiered pricing, which means the price goes up as more tokens sell. Originally, they planned to launch their token earlier, but they’ve pushed it back to sometime between April and June 2025. They say this is about getting things right – lining up the right partners and picking the best market conditions. Sure, waiting longer isn’t ideal for people who got in early. But rushing to market has killed plenty of good ideas before they had a chance. The team seems focused on getting the details right rather than just launching quickly. Visit SpacePay Presale The $SPY Token Economy The $SPY token sits at the center of how SpacePay works. With 34 billion tokens total, they’ve divided them for different purposes. About 20% goes to public sale, with the rest split between user rewards, development work, partnerships, marketing, reserves, and the team who built it. Holding these tokens comes with some perks. You get to vote on decisions about the platform’s future. You receive monthly rewards just for holding. You get early access when they roll out new features. And you can join quarterly online meetings with the people running the show. The most interesting part might be the revenue sharing. Token holders get a piece of those transaction fees mentioned earlier. As more stores use the system and more people pay with crypto, that could mean ongoing income for token holders. Their success becomes your success, basically. How to Participate in the SpacePay Presale If you’re thinking about jumping into the SpacePay presale, getting started isn’t complicated – go to their website and hook up whatever wallet you normally use. They take pretty much whatever crypto you’ve got lying around – Ethereum, Binance Coin, those MATIC tokens collecting dust in your wallet, AVAX, or just plain old stablecoins if you’re not feeling risky. Haven’t bought crypto before? No sweat – they’ll take your regular bank card too, which honestly saves a ton of hassle for first-timers.

That’s the big question after over 5,000 options contracts were placed betting on a $300K BTC target by June 26, totaling $484 million in notional open interest. Meanwhile, Ethereum bulls are circling as a key technical level—one that previously drove a 450% surge—has just resurfaced on charts. And amid all this heat, a fresh wave of attention is hitting an early-stage contender: Qubetics . While Bitcoin and Ethereum battle headlines, Qubetics is building something very different—and it’s still in presale. What’s driving all this sudden noise? It isn’t just hype—it’s politics. Trump’s recent appointment of David Sacks as his so-called crypto czar has flipped sentiment almost overnight. Sacks, a former PayPal executive and known Web3 advocate, is expected to create a more stable and serious tone for U.S. crypto regulation. And while that’s great news for Bitcoin and Ethereum, it also breathes credibility into new infrastructure-layer projects like Qubetics that aim to solve the mess of fragmented chains. In a space where interoperability is still mostly just a buzzword, Qubetics is shaping up to be the most potential crypto of 2025—and the presale window is still open. Qubetics Is Fixing Blockchain’s Biggest Flaw: Isolation Between Chains At the heart of Qubetics is a single mission: solve the silo problem. Right now, major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and even Bitcoin are stuck in isolated ecosystems that don’t talk to each other. That lack of interoperability limits every application—from DeFi to logistics—and creates serious friction for both users and developers. Qubetics addresses this directly by acting as a Web3-aggregated chain, where tokens, data, and smart contracts from different blockchains can interact seamlessly. This isn’t a theoretical concept—it’s a working model. Let’s take real scenarios. A supply chain company operating across Solana and Ethereum can use Qubetics to sync all its contract records without bridging or duplicating data. A developer building a dApp that needs liquidity pools from both Uniswap (Ethereum) and Raydium (Solana) no longer needs workarounds or middle layers. Even an everyday user sending funds across chains benefits—Qubetics does it in one click, without wrapping tokens or relying on insecure bridges. This ease of use is what pushes Qubetics into the spotlight as the most potential crypto—not because it’s trendy, but because it fixes what’s broken. Qubetics Presale: The Most Potential Crypto Investment Opportunity in 2025 The Qubetics presale is currently in its 33rd stage, with a strict seven-day structure that ensures scarcity and steady price appreciation. Every Sunday at midnight, a new stage begins, and the price automatically increases by 10%. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.2302, and over 511 million tokens have already been sold. That’s not small change—$16.7 million raised and over 25,800 token holders prove the interest isn’t just surface-level. This rapid growth is a clear indicator that Qubetics is being recognized as the most potential crypto in the market today, and the window is getting smaller by the week. Here’s where things really get interesting for early participants. If someone puts in $100 at the current stage, they receive 434.20 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 post-presale, that turns into $434.20, a 334.33% ROI. At $5, that’s $2,171.00. Go higher? $10 means $4,243.26, and $15 rockets that $100 investment to $6,414.90. Those are serious figures—and they’re backed by clear math. Unlike speculative plays on the open market, this crypto presale gives a structured growth path. And with the mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this isn’t just a token play—it’s a roadmap-based infrastructure project. That’s why this isn’t just any crypto presale. It’s currently being labeled one of the best crypto presale offers for this cycle, especially for those who missed early-stage entries on now-dominant coins. Bitcoin’s $300K Bets Are More Than Just Hype—Here’s the Real Story At Deribit, the world’s top crypto options exchange, over 5,000 open contracts are now betting on a $300,000 BTC price by the end of June. That’s not some random call—it’s a calculated play with $484 million in open interest, making it the second most popular trade for Q2 2025. The $110K strike still leads in volume, but this $300K bet has grabbed the spotlight because of its boldness and the sheer volume backing it. This surge in derivatives trading is a strong signal that community members are looking beyond short-term dips and betting big on long-term blowouts. But it’s not just about price—it’s also about who’s in the room now. The appointment of David Sacks as Trump’s crypto czar is reshaping the narrative. Sacks, with his deep tech roots and a serious track record, is expected to inject a level of policy clarity and structure that’s been missing for years. That’s music to the ears of early adopters holding long positions—and a clear signal that regulatory uncertainty may finally be giving way to a more builder-focused environment. Ethereum’s 450% Signal Is Back—And Traders Are Watching Closely Back in 2019, Ethereum’s ETH/BTC pair dropped over 90% after the ICO crash. Fast-forward to now, and it’s down 80% from its 2021 peak—but something’s changing. According to analysts like Chartist Jimie, the “bearish parabola” that’s held ETH down since December 2021 is finally losing steam. This key resistance level, which once preceded a 450% pump, is now back in play—and traders are watching it closely. Breaking above this pattern could signal a new bullish phase. Of course, there’s still risk—Ethereum could retest 0.016 BTC, but the pressure is building, and the charts don’t lie. While Bitcoin is riding a wave of macro and derivatives-based momentum, Ethereum’s strength right now is all about technicals. Combined with Sacks’ appointment, it sets the stage for a potential dual-surge scenario—one where both legacy coins could regain dominance amid shifting market sentiment. Why Today’s Crypto Shift Affects Bitcoin, Ethereum and Qubetics Equally The appointment of David Sacks as crypto czar is more than just a political play—it’s a message to the market. The days of regulatory fog might finally be ending, and that optimism is already trickling into charts, calls, and presale dashboards. For Bitcoin, it’s opened the door to bold predictions and six-figure option plays. For Ethereum, it may be the final push needed to break resistance and return to a growth phase. And for Qubetics, this new stability gives early adopters confidence that a long-term infrastructure bet might finally pay off. Qubetics stands in a unique position. It’s not reliant on spot market trends because of its structured weekly price increases. Every 7 days, the Qubetics presale adds 10% to the token price. That offers a built-in form of measured growth, something rarely seen in today’s volatile environment. For anyone trying to avoid short-term chaos but still wants meaningful ROI potential, that matters. It’s this blend of timing, tech, and structure that’s giving Qubetics its spotlight alongside the giants. Conclusion: These Three Cryptos Are Writing the 2025 Narrative The first half of 2025 has made one thing clear: speculation is back, but it’s smarter this time. Bitcoin’s $300K options tell a story of bold conviction. Ethereum’s resurging chart signals technical strength that could catch fire. And Qubetics—the most potential crypto—offers something entirely different: real interoperability across chains, and a token sale that’s still accessible. For those looking to make meaningful plays instead of chasing late-stage runs, now might be the time to join this best crypto presale and get in before the gate shuts. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the current stage of the Qubetics presale?

It is down over 80% from its all-time high, with a market cap of over $4 billion. Token Unlocks Increase The Selling Pressure Pi Network’s demand is dropping as more and more tokens are entering the market. Data from PiScan shows that 231 million Pi tokens will be unlocked in May, and another 222 million will be unlocked in June. Over the next year, more than 1.4 billion new tokens worth over $850 million are expected to enter the market. Today, 10.4 million Pi tokens are set to be unlocked, which could further increase the selling pressure. Pi Coin’s price has remained in a tight range since early April, along with a lower trading volume. The price action suggests that it has entered the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase usually comes before a big price jump, where prices spike due to a fear of missing out among traders. Exchange Listing Concerns Prevail A major event like an exchange listing could help determine the next move. HTX has hinted at a possible listing for Pi Coin. Also, users have recently spotted Pi being mentioned in Binance test pages and backend updates, sparking rumors of an upcoming listing. However, Binance has not confirmed anything. If confirmed, this could be Pi’s biggest turning point. A Binance listing could help Pi Coin gain momentum, improve liquidity and accessibility, and help show its real market value. Will Pi Reach $1? Pioneers believe that the coin could reach $314,159, but experts believe it’s an unrealistic target since Pi currently trades around $0.60. A rise in its price could push the token to $0.7932. If it breaks through this level, the road to the big $1 milestone could be just around the corner.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 06:17:14

TRON (TRX) , Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Ethereum (ETH) remain among the most closely tracked coins. But in the background, MAGACOINFINANCE is building serious momentum—quietly becoming a top candidate for early-stage upside this year. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Sustained Momentum While leading coins grab the spotlight, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction for its calculated rise. With a strong branding, and increasing investor engagement, this project isn’t reacting to trends—it’s establishing one. Community traction is growing across channels, and top analysts are beginning to recognize MAGACOINFINANCE as more than a passing opportunity. The 50% bonus offer (code: MAGA50X) is still live—providing an edge to those who act before listings go public. TRX and Bitcoin Are Holding Strong in the 2025 Rotation TRX is trading near $0.245 , maintaining long-term network reliability and steady ecosystem usage. While not always in headlines, TRON’s user base and DeFi integrations continue to expand, making it a stable presence among Layer-1s. Bitcoin (BTC) , currently hovering around $95,000 , remains the macro pillar of the crypto market. Following April’s ETF-driven growth and institutional accumulation, BTC continues to show strength. Analysts still maintain targets ranging between $120,000–$132,000 by mid-year, with many viewing it as both a hedge and a leader in capital inflows. XRP and Ethereum Continue to Anchor Market Confidence XRP , priced around $2.15 , is gaining new institutional credibility through futures ETFs and expanding real-world payment solutions. Traders are watching for a breakout above the $2.45 resistance mark, which could open the door to significant rallies through Q2. Ethereum (ETH) trades near $1,830 , sustaining strong fundamentals thanks to growing Layer-2 adoption, AI integration, and whale interest. It remains the core foundation for decentralized innovation, with analysts forecasting a potential climb above $2,700 in coming weeks. Final Thoughts Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and TRX each present compelling stories backed by fundamentals and ecosystem leadership. But MAGACOINFINANCE is shaping a new narrative—one defined by timing, community strength, and early-stage positioning.

Two proposed bills — House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 — were officially withdrawn from the legislative process on May 3, according to the Florida Senate . The legislative session had adjourned a day earlier, on May 2, without taking action on the crypto-focused proposals. Florida Extends Session, But Crypto Bills Left Behind Though lawmakers agreed to extend the session until June 6 for budget negotiations, the crypto bills will not be reconsidered. HB 487, introduced in February, would have authorized Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to allocate up to 10% of select state funds into Bitcoin. SB 550, filed in parallel, aimed to facilitate similar investments of public funds into the digital asset. Their removal places Florida alongside a growing list of states — including Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma — that have recently failed to pass legislation allowing Bitcoin-based investment strategies. The data comes from Bitcoin Laws, a site tracking crypto-related state policy efforts. During the recent Florida legislative session, lawmakers passed roughly 230 bills addressing a wide range of issues, from banning smartphones in schools to protecting state parks. However, cryptocurrency initiatives were noticeably absent from the final tally. Arizona has two more chances to be the first in the nation to establish a Bitcoin Reserve. The most likely to pass (HB 2749) was authored by @JeffWeninger , and it offers a budget neutral method to fund the reserve using profit from the unclaimed property fund. @EleanorTerrett pic.twitter.com/yGlrz2saql — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 5, 2025 Florida’s move follows closely behind developments in Arizona, where a promising crypto initiative was also halted. Arizona’s House Bill 1025, which had advanced further than any other similar bill nationwide, was vetoed on May 3 by Governor Katie Hobbs. She called digital assets “untested investments,” effectively stopping the proposed Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Act in its tracks. Crypto Advocates Slam Politicians Over Bitcoin Veto The veto sparked backlash from crypto advocates, including investor Anthony Pompliano, who criticized political leaders for dismissing Bitcoin’s potential. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, pointed out that Arizona still has two remaining bills under consideration — HB 2749 and SB 1373 — that could revive the state’s efforts to become the first in the U.S. to create a Bitcoin reserve. HB 2749 is particularly notable for being budget-neutral, as it proposes using profits from the state’s unclaimed property fund. SB 1373, meanwhile, would allow the treasurer to invest up to 10% of state funds in digital assets, though it has not yet faced a final vote. As reported, the US Senate is also facing a sudden breakdown in negotiations over a landmark cryptocurrency bill, placing one of former President Donald Trump’s top financial policy priorities in jeopardy. The legislation, aimed at establishing the country’s first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins—digital assets pegged to the U.S. dollar—has hit a bipartisan snag, following pushback from key Senate Democrats. On Saturday, nine Democratic senators, including some who had previously backed the bill in committee, issued a joint statement rejecting a revised version of the legislation introduced by Republicans last week.

In a new Crypto Prime interview, Matt Hougan points out a key difference between the current Bitcoin bull market and the one witnessed in 2020. According to Hougan, the current market cycle is being driven by major institutions laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s evolution into a trusted store of value. “The Bitcoin of today really is different than the Bitcoin of five years ago. That was a Bitcoin driven by retail investors and crypto-native investors. This is increasingly a Bitcoin driven by institutions, corporations, governments and macro hedge funds. And you’re seeing it behave differently. You’re seeing it behave more like a hedge asset. I think it’s maturing before our eyes. Bitcoin’s a teenager. It’s 15 years old. It’s in a transition phase from a risk asset to a hedge asset. But I think that’s the direction of travel. I think you’re going to see it act like that more and more in the future. And as it does, it’s going to bring more investors into it because it’s a really useful tool in the macro quiver.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,703.

The CEO wants Ripple Labs to improve its transparency following the end of a prolonged legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Garlinghouse made the announcement via a post on social media platform X, in which he described the first quarter of 2025 as “incredible” for Ripple for the acquisition of institutional crypto firm Hidden Road, the conclusion of the SEC’s appeal, and a surge in global institutional interest in XRP-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). “Moving forward, the XRP Markets Report will look a little different,” Garlinghouse wrote. “Our commitment to transparency doesn’t change with this evolution.” SEC withdrew appeal, but Ripple case not fully resolved Ripple has been publishing quarterly reports since 2017 to provide insight into the company’s XRP holdings and market activity. However, Garlinghouse noted that this transparency was “unfortunately… used against us by the SEC and others,” referencing the commission’s past arguments that relied in part on Ripple’s own disclosures. Q1’25 was an incredible quarter for Ripple, with our acquisition of Hidden Road and end to the SEC case, not to mention institutional interest in XRP ETPs globally. Moving forward, the XRP Markets Report will look a little different. As some may remember, the objective of… https://t.co/0f9oarmi70 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 5, 2025 The SEC relinquished its challenge to a landmark July 2023 decision by US District Judge Analisa Torres. The judge had ruled that XRP sales by Ripple on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions. Still, the court also delivered a partial win to the regulator, concluding that $728 million in XRP sold to institutional investors did fall under securities laws. Ripple was fined $125 million in August 2024, though the penalty remains suspended as Ripple appeals the ruling to the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan. Market reports go from formal to flexible In his social media post, Garlinghouse said future updates related to XRP markets and Ripple’s holdings will be distributed via Ripple’s website and social channels rather than consolidated into a formal quarterly report. The company will continue to publish holdings data on its website. One X user commented on Garlinghouse’s post, speculating that the shift might be a precursor to an initial public offering (IPO). “ Until then, I believe that if you collate it into quarterly reports and publish them to the Ripple website, it is more legitimate than social channels ,” the commenter said. “ Social media is rife with misinformation, and your posts could be used to manipulate the market .” Another user disagreed, suggesting that an IPO would lead Ripple to “lose operational control and be answerable to shareholders.” The original commenter responded, “ Yes IPO… they need funds for acquisitions, and they need the legitimacy being registered with the SEC will provide. It’s the next logical step. January 2026 .” Institutional demand for XRP grows Meanwhile, XRP ETPs recorded $37.7 million in net inflows during Q1 2025, pushing year-to-date inflows to $214 million, just $1 million short of surpassing Ethereum-based funds, according to market data. Trading activity in the spot market also remained high, with average daily volumes reaching $3.2 billion. Binance retained a dominant market share at 40%, followed by South Korea’s Upbit and US-based Coinbase. On-chain usage of the XRP Ledger, Ripple’s blockchain, moderated after experiencing strong growth in late 2024. Wallet creation and transaction volumes fell by 30–40%, much like the slowdown witnessed across Layer 1 blockchain networks during the same period. A significant portion of that activity was driven by RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. RLUSD surpassed a $90 million market cap during the quarter, with cumulative DEX trading volume exceeding $300 million. Per Coingecko data , at the time of this publication, XRP was changing hands at $2.11, a 2.8% downtick intraday and a 7% drop from its weekly highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) prices held above $94,000 after briefly dipping below that level on Sunday, continuing its recent range-bound behavior. ADA price dropped nearly 4% while XRP slid similarly. Ether (ETH) fell nearly 1%, BNB Chain’s BNB rose 1.3% and memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) was down 2% in the past 24 hours. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index that tracks the largest tokens by market capitalization, dropped a little over 1.8%. Elsewhere, some DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve’s CRV, and Hyperliquid’s HYPE have seen a bump in demand over the past week in a sign of trader interest toward projects with utility and yield mechanisms, some say. “As memecoins fall out of favor, traders are turning to projects with stronger fundamentals and token economics,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “DeFi ecosystems are benefiting from this pivot, especially as Bitcoin shows decreased volatility and macro uncertainty lingers. We're hopeful to see the DeFi trend continue as Bitcoin maintains decreased volatility and crypto acts as a hedge for economic uncertainty,” Lu added. HYPE led gains among the top 100 tokens with a 72% surge in the past week, with AAVE and CRV up as much as 40%. Powell's comment in focus Traders across both crypto and traditional finance markets are eyeing this week’s FOMC interest rate decision, with consensus expectations pointing to a pause in rate hikes. However, uncertainty around inflation, tariffs, and the broader U.S.–China trade tensions has left many participants cautious. “We don’t expect the FOMC to trigger a major move in markets,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “It’s a coin flip on direction. Crypto will likely take cues from broader earnings growth and how the economy digests the impact of recent trade policies.” Recent stock market strength suggests that investors are pricing in only a mild recession risk, around 8%, according to historical drawdown models. That contrasts with more bearish signals from bond markets and macroeconomic forecasts, Fan added. Last week, President Trump confirmed no immediate plans for talks with China, dampening hopes for a breakthrough in U.S.–China trade negotiations. Still, the possibility of separate trade agreements has helped keep risk sentiment intact, as reported Monday .",Markets|Cardano|XRP|Bitcoin|FOMC|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 07:08:01

This rally is characterized by increased participation from the ""smart money"" wallets, according to on-chain data tracked by Nansen. VIRTUAL has rallied 207% to $1.66 in 30 days to rank as the best performer among the top 100 tokens by market value, according to data source CoinDesk. Prices have risen 11% in the past seven days. Market leader bitcoin, meanwhile, has gained just 13% in four weeks, with flat performance over the past seven days. VIRTUAL is also the most traded token by smart money—wallets identified by Nansen as owned by institutions, funds, and influential whales. The token has attracted smart money inflows of $14.2 million over the past 30 days and $8.56 million in the past week. EBTC, LINK and PEPE are the other smart money favorites. The table shows the top tokens traded - bought or sold on a DEX or sent/received from centralized exchanges - by smart money wallets. Per Nansen's explainer , the buying activity is represented in green and the selling activity in red. VIRTUAL's leadership is likely led by excitement about the debut of the Genesis launchpad two weeks ago. The new system, designed to reward genuine contributors and not mere speculators, uses a ""proof of contribution"" points system, where participants earn Virgen points through activities like staking or staking AI projects. ""Since its debut, most tokens launched through it have 2x'd or more, fueling demand for Virgen Points and showing there's still room for creativity in token design,"" Bankless said on X. Other key features of the new system include contribution-based allocations, automatic refunds if goals aren't met, and transparent vesting schedules. ""Genesis breathes fresh life into Virtuals while also showcasing a novel mechanism for designing token launches,"" Bankless said, adding that while the contribution-based system is not perfect, it certainly ""rivals"" who-knows-who or other primitive systems prone to manipulation.",Markets|virtual|Markets|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 07:11:45

This is a big deal, as it opens the door for global buying and selling of Pi. According to reports, Banxa had earlier purchased over $30 million worth of Pi, and now plans to sell it worldwide. Pi Coin Price Fails To React? However, the price of Pi Coin (PI) is currently under pressure. It has been stuck in a consolidation phase for around 40 days and is now trading just above $0.58. The coin needs to reclaim the $0.60–$0.62 range with strong volume to regain momentum. Technical indicators show weakness: the price is below its 10, 20, and 50-day moving averages, the RSI is near 40 (indicating weak buying interest), and the MACD shows no sign of a bullish reversal. Traders remain cautious while major token unlocks continue. Pi Coin launched at around $2 and quickly rose to $2.90. It was listed on five exchanges and even appeared in the top 11 on CoinMarketCap. But after that, the price dropped, falling as low as $0.40. Many began doubting the project, calling it useless. While the network’s growth is strong, the next few weeks will be crucial for the price direction of Pi. Still, for many in the Pi community, the long-term vision matters more than short-term price moves.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 07:21:10

This stability might be the calm before a major price surge. On lower timeframes, XRP continues to form bullish price structures with higher highs and higher lows, keeping traders on alert. While a decisive breakout hasn’t occurred yet, several key signals suggest growing upside momentum. Technical Levels to Watch Crypto analyst Fabio Zuccara has identified a symmetrical triangle pattern on the XRP chart—often a precursor to sharp price moves. The token currently trades just above its 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $2.167 , while facing resistance at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near $2.208 . A breakout above the EMA resistance could push XRP toward $2.27 , $2.33 , and possibly beyond $2.50 . However, failure to break out might lead to a retest of support at $2.068 or even $1.993 . Whale Accumulation Suggests Confidence On-chain data indicates strong institutional interest. Over 200 million XRP were added last week to wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million tokens. A notable whale transaction involved 29.5 million XRP (worth over $64 million) moved to Coinbase . Sasha Varela , senior analyst at ChainWave Metrics , stated, “This volume is not retail-driven. It reflects informed buyers anticipating a significant price movement.” XRP ETF Speculation Fuels Market Optimism Speculation around a potential ProShares XRP spot ETF is intensifying. Analysts currently estimate an 80% probability of approval . Linda Moh , ETF strategist at WaveX Funds said : “ETF anticipation alone can drive FOMO-led rallies,” especially when combined with technical strength and whale accumulation. An ETF approval would mark a significant regulatory milestone for Ripple and the broader altcoin market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Ripple Blamed for XRP Price Stagnation, but Legal Expert Calls It a Myth , Long-Term XRP Price Prediction Source: Dark Defender X Post Crypto analyst Dark Defender believes XRP is in the final phase of a fifth wave Elliott structure, expecting a move toward $3, followed by potential targets at $4.40 and $6.30, as long as XRP stays above $2.00.

The June 28 confirmation intensified the debates across crypto forums and social media, triggering visible changes in the exchange’s user base. CryptoQuant data shows KuCoin’s BTC reserves started falling after the announcement. The trend persisted, reflecting user worries over privacy, safety of funds, and regulation. The metric dipped from 18,300 BTC in June 2023 to 4,100 BTC in April 2025, which translates to a 14,200 BTC outflow or a 77.6% plunge. CryptoQuant.com @cryptoquant_com · Follow KuCoin loses over 77% of its BTC reserves following mandatory KYC announcement“On-chain data shows a drop from 18,300 BTC to just 4,100 BTC, marking a net outflow of 14,200 BTC — a 77.6% decrease.” – By @onchainschool 8:53 PM · May 5, 2025 184 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies KuCoin’s policy shift triggers user exit The trading platform confirmed the updated KYC requirements, which demanded identity verification for anyone using its services, including depositing and spot and futures trading. KuCoin emphasized the move was essential to guarantee user safety and compliance. The press release highlighted: Starting from July 15, 2023, all newly registered users must complete KYC to access KuCoin’s comprehensive suite of products and services. This requirement ensures a high level of accountability and transparency within the platform. For users who registered before July 15, 2023, failure to complete the KYC process will restrict their access to certain features. However, the community responded by quitting, catalyzing substantial declines in KuCoin’s BTC reserves. Users have withdrawn 14,200 Bitcoin assets since the updated KYC requirements. Moving to self-custody? The staggering Bitcoin outflow from KuCoin highlights a broader change in user preference. As centralized exchanges (CEXs) tighten compliance and KYC policies, individuals seem to shift to platforms promising greater control over user assets and data. Most people, especially in jurisdictions with stiffer digital asset laws or privacy concerns, are moving to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and custodial wallets. Unwelcoming incidents such as crypto fraud have made users hesitant to share their details unless necessary. Such sentiments reflect the increasing trend toward privacy-focused cryptocurrency tools and decentralized finance (DeFi). Impact on KuCoin While KuCoin affirmed that the KYC changes aimed to prevent unlawful activities and guarantee a secure investment space for users, the declined reserves present significant challenges. Low reserves can impact user trust, drain liquidity, and spark insolvency speculations, which are crucial for any entity to survive the massively competitive exchange marketplace. That explains why some platforms, including OKX and Binance, have opted to delay KYC mandates. Meanwhile, KuCoin’s incident reminds us of the benefits of trust in the tech world. While governments’ involvement has made regulations unavoidable, exchanges should balance user autonomy and compliance. The massive reserve dip reflects the impact of isolating users who prioritize privacy. The case shows users will choose control over convenience in the crypto realm. Meanwhile, KuCoin and other trading platforms should consider regaining user trust without sacrificing compliance.

While Ripple still reigns supreme over cross-border payments, investors eager for more thrilling returns are turning eyes to a new DeFi token gaining notoriety as “XRP 2.0.” With faster adoption potential and ambitious utility vows, this fresh sensation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is being likened to XRP’s early breakout years. With an unambiguous launch cemented at listing price $0.06, Phase 4 investors are poised to reap 140% returns before the token hits the open market. The venture so far has raised in excess of $7.6 million and boasts over 9500 holders. As XRP finds its footing, the spotlight may soon fall on this ambitious next-generation rival. Implosive Presale: Over $7.6M Raised from 9,400+ Early Adopters Mutuum Finance presale is not easing off. Now in Phase 4, the $0.025 token is on the verge of sell-out. When the presale enters Phase 5, the value will rise to $0.03, treating current investors to an instant 20% gain. With a projected launch price of $0.06, the profit potential grows by the day. Crypto analysts have already designated MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. With more than $7.6 million funded and 9,400+ users, it’s no longer a secret anymore. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance’s foundation is its lending architecture. Unlike most DeFi platforms, it offers both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending: Users get passive returns by offering stablecoins like USDT to pools of smart contracts. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending: Investors borrow or lend from each other directly, customizing terms without middlemen. The hybrid model not only amplifies flexibility and potential yield, but also drives liquidity and user scalability, positioning it as a genuine disruptor within the DeFi ecosystem. Driving Engagement Through Leaderboards and Incentives Mutuum Finance has introduced a real-time leaderboard for the holders of MUTM to display the top 50 holders which is more community driven. These holders are to be rewarded with bonus tokens that bring innovative competitive aspects to their platform.

Verasity (VRA) surged to an intraday high of $0.0032 on May 6 during afternoon Asian trading, pushing its total gains to over 250% since hitting its monthly low. VRA’s strong performance made it the top gainer among the top 1,000 cryptocurrencies on CoinGecko. This comes even as the broader crypto market slipped 2.2% over the past day, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) staying relatively flat while Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), and Cardano ( ADA ) dropped 1–4% amid market caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision due tomorrow. VRA rallied to a level not seen since Feb. 1, lifting its market cap above $30 million. Meanwhile, daily trading volume jumped by around 200% compared to the previous day. The price surge coincided with a notable increase in futures open interest, hitting an all-time high of $25 million today, markedly up from just $3.17 million recorded a month earlier, according to data from CoinGlass. Additionally, its funding rates have been consistently positive over the past four days. The long/short ratio has remained above 1, indicating more traders are optimistic about continued upward price movement. Launched in May 2018, Verasity is a blockchain-based platform that specializes in video monetization and combating ad fraud through its patented Proof of View (PoV) technology. It uses the VRA token as the primary currency within its ecosystem, enabling users and creators to earn rewards, access premium content, and facilitate transactions securely and transparently across video and gaming platforms. You might also like: Worldcoin pulls back after parabolic run amid suspensions in Kenya and Indonesia The optimism around VRA is likely due to recent partnerships that seem to have renewed investor interest. On May 5, Verasity announced a partnership with SoonChain, an AI-powered gaming Layer 2 platform. Through this collaboration, SoonChain is integrating Verasity’s VeraPlayer to drive its video content economy. Three days earlier, on May 2, Verasity announced another key partnership with MAIV , an RWA platform aiming to provide broader access to institutional-grade investment opportunities. MAIV has already integrated Verasity’s VeraPlayer technology to power its video content, currently live on its homepage. Future plans include enabling monetization safeguarded by Verasity’s PoV technology. Additionally, a joint airdrop for holders of VRA and MAIV tokens has been teased as part of this strategic alliance. Verasity’s traders are also buzzing with anticipation over a potential Binance listing , which has added to the hype. VRA price analysis On the 1-day/USDT chart, VRA has broken out of a multi-week ascending triangle pattern, which is seen in technical analysis as a bullish continuation signal. It has also moved above the horizontal resistance zone at $0.020–$0.021, a key barrier that has capped price action since early March. VRA price, 20-day and 50-day EMA — May 6 | Source: crypto.news Adding to the bullish case, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.24, showing increased buying pressure, while the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, another sign of positive momentum. VRA Supertrend and CMF chart — May 6 | Source: crypto.news A golden cross has also formed on the daily chart, with the 20-day EMA (green) crossing above the 50-day EMA (blue), typically considered a bullish signal. The last time this happened, VRA surged over 145% within a month. If the current setup plays out similarly, VRA could soon test the $0.0037 resistance level, which is about 15.6% above where it’s trading now. Analysts remain optimistic that the rally could extend much further. According to Crypto Patel, if VRA holds above its key breakout level of $0.0025, the token could target its previous all-time high, representing a potential 40x gain from that resistance zone. However, all this will still depend largely on Bitcoin’s price moves, as BTC dominance continues to climb higher, meaning broader altcoin rallies like VRA’s may ultimately hinge on whether Bitcoin maintains its strength or pulls back.

In 2019, Bitcoin dropped 49% before recovering 37%. Currently, in 2025, Bitcoin has fallen 33%, with a 30% recovery so far. The question remains—will Bitcoin make lower lows or follow the M2 chart for a bullish run? This comparison highlights past performance during Fed cuts, acknowledging both bullish and bearish possibilities for the future. May 6, 2025 07:56:22 UTC FOMC Meeting: Powell’s Stance on Rate Cuts and Economic Outlook in Focus Ahead of the FOMC meeting, markets are closely watching Chairman Powell’s press conference. While the interest rate is expected to remain unchanged, Powell’s cautious stance suggests no rate cuts unless economic downturns occur. With recent positive employment data and slowing PCE growth, some anticipate a rate cut by June. Key focus points include Powell’s views on the U.S. economy, preparations for a rate cut, and how interest rates will respond. May 6, 2025 07:56:22 UTC FOMC Meeting in Less Than 48 Hours: How to Play the Market Movements The next FOMC meeting is less than 48 hours away, and as usual, market movements will be slow leading up to it. In the 24 hours following the meeting, markets tend to make a counter-move based on the Fed’s decision. Here’s the strategy: if the market is in the red after 24 hours, consider going long. However, if there’s a pump within the same timeframe, avoid going long. It’s all about reading the market’s initial reaction and positioning yourself accordingly. May 6, 2025 07:55:11 UTC Bitcoin at $94.4K, Gold Hits ATH: All Eyes on FOMC Meeting and Market Volatility Ahead Bitcoin is holding strong at $94.4K, while Ethereum is still hovering around $1800. With big days ahead, all eyes are on Jerome Powell and the upcoming FOMC meeting to see if the Fed will cut rates — markets are betting it won’t. Two CME gaps are open, and the question remains: which one will close first? In the world of RWAs, the U.S. 2-month and 3-month yields have broken above the 100-day MA, signaling potential downside for financial markets. Meanwhile, gold (XAU/USD) hit an all-time high, pulled back slightly, but is now on track to rise again. Leverage traders, be prepared for a lot of volatility ahead! May 6, 2025 07:53:47 UTC What Time is FED Meeting? This week, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision followed by the release of the FOMC statement. Shortly after, at 2:30 PM ET, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak, providing insights into the Fed’s stance on economic conditions and potential future actions. These key events will likely influence market sentiment and expectations for the economy. May 6, 2025 07:52:21 UTC FOMC Meeting Expectations Ahead of the FOMC meeting on May 7, 2025, the market outlook is cautious but anticipates potential movements. There is a 94% chance the Fed will maintain the 4.25%-4.50% federal funds rate, with a hawkish stance possibly pressuring crypto prices. Bitcoin may test $91,500–$92,000 support, and holding above this level could signal a recovery toward $100,000. High volatility is expected due to macroeconomic uncertainty, with a possible dip early in the week before a potential rebound if dovish hints are given. The persistent 2.6% core PCE inflation and a 60% recession probability could dampen risk sentiment, affecting Bitcoin and altcoins. Political pressures, including Trump’s push for rate cuts and tariff policies, may raise concerns over Fed independence but could boost Bitcoin as a hedge. The key focus will be on Powell’s press conference for any signals on rate cuts in June and comments on tariffs, which could trigger a crypto rally if dovish tones emerge. May 6, 2025 07:50:31 UTC Post-FOMC Expectations: Market Remains Bullish as Liquidation Data and M2 Money Supply Soar Post-FOMC, markets are showing bullish momentum with liquidation data indicating upward movement. Truflation is at 1.45%, below the Fed’s 2% target, while M2 money supply continues to rise. With these indicators, many believe now is the time to buy. May 6, 2025 07:48:29 UTC Bitcoin’s Price Moves After FOMC Meetings: 3 Bullish, 2 Bearish Trends Bitcoin’s price action has historically shown strong correlation with FOMC meetings. Out of the past five meetings, three led to bullish price movements, while two resulted in bearish trends. As the FOMC meeting cycle continues, many are watching for similar patterns, with potential market shifts following each key decision. Investors are particularly focusing on how upcoming rate decisions may influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming months. May 6, 2025 07:43:27 UTC Bitcoin Set for Low Correction Ahead of FOMC Michaël van de Poppe suggests that Bitcoin is holding up well despite the ongoing correction, predicting that the low of the correction may occur within the next day or two. He attributes this phase to a standard correction ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. Poppe remains optimistic, expecting an “up-only season” to follow, as the market gears up for potential bullish momentum in the near future. May 6, 2025 07:43:27 UTC What Time is FOMC? The FOMC meeting will take place from May 6 to May 7, 2025. The meeting will be a two-day event, and the press conference is scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m. on May 7, 2025, where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will provide insights into the committee’s decisions and outlook on economic conditions. May 6, 2025 07:22:55 UTC When is the Next FED Meeting The Federal Reserve’s next meeting is scheduled for May 6–7, 2025, where policymakers will assess the evolving economic landscape and determine if adjustments to interest rates are warranted. Despite political pressure for rate cuts, the Fed is expected to maintain its current federal funds rate of 4.25%–4.5%, as inflation remains above the 2% target and economic uncertainty persists.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 07:31:41

The cryptocurrency billionaire, who is serving time after legal troubles in the US, described his early days in a low-security prison, saying he was surrounded by “big, loud inmates with tattoos,” which instilled a deep sense of anxiety and fear. Because he is not a US citizen, he was not allowed into a low-security facility and was instead placed in a harsher environment. Zhao said that while she initially felt apprehensive about her cellmate, who was sentenced to 30 years for double murder, it eventually blossomed into an unlikely camaraderie. “We actually got along well,” CZ said. Related News: Big Whales' Stance on Altcoins Revealed: Are They Long or Short? Despite his wealth and notoriety, CZ said his status did not entitle him to special treatment behind bars. He said many of his fellow inmates treated him with kindness and respect, and he still keeps in touch with many of them. “They were very friendly,” he said. He admitted that one of the most tiring aspects was the mental toll, particularly the uncertainty of whether his sentence would be extended without warning: “The fear is real. Many of my friends in prison have experienced this.” Reflecting on his time in prison, CZ shared a newfound understanding of life’s priorities: “Health is the most important thing, then family, then work and other things.” Zhao also criticized aspects of the American justice system. “To be frank, long sentences don’t really help,” he said. “After what I’ve seen in prisons, that’s what people who get long sentences like 10 years are going through. They’re not thinking about reforming themselves anymore.” *This is not investment advice.

Developers from Bitcoin OS, a smart contract platform, claim they’ve successfully sent one Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet to a Cardano wallet and then back — all without using a bridge, custodian, or other intermediary. This, according to experts, is a big deal because it shows how Bitcoin can move securely between blockchains without third-party services.

CEO Brad Garlinghouse described the quarter as “incredible.” The company shared a summary of the report on X, highlighting major accomplishments and revealing that this would be the final XRP Market Report. After years of litigation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally withdrew its appeal , marking one of the most significant developments for the company. Ripple, in turn, dropped its cross-appeal. As part of the final agreement, the SEC reduced its proposed penalty from $125 million to $50 million and agreed to request that the court vacate the previously issued injunction preventing XRP sales to institutional investors. Q1’25 was an incredible quarter for Ripple, with our acquisition of Hidden Road and end to the SEC case, not to mention institutional interest in XRP ETPs globally.

As some may remember, the objective of… https://t.co/0f9oarmi70 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) May 5, 2025 Strategic Acquisition to Support XRP and RLUSD Ripple recently completed the $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , a prime brokerage platform. The company stated that this acquisition will help accelerate institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Garlinghouse highlighted the strategic nature of this move, describing it as a critical driver for Ripple’s broader product expansion and institutional engagement. Institutional Interest in XRP Intensifies Institutional demand for XRP-related financial instruments also showed considerable momentum. XRP outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum during the quarter, rising nearly 50% in early February. Investment products linked to XRP attracted $37.7 million in quarterly inflows, bringing the year-to-date total to $214 million, just short of surpassing global Ethereum-based funds.

The anticipated debut of XRP futures on CME and the regulatory approval of a dedicated XRP ETF in Brazil further highlight expanding global access. Policy Developments Signal Regulatory Shift From a regulatory standpoint, the current U.S. administration has introduced several measures that favour the crypto industry. Key developments include the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chairman and repealing SAB 121, which had previously constrained bank participation in crypto custody. New guidance from the OCC further enables financial institutions to engage in crypto-related activities. The Evolution of XRP Markets Report Following its Q1 report, Ripple has announced changes to its longstanding XRP Markets Report. Originally launched in 2017 to promote transparency regarding XRP holdings, the report is being retired in its current form. Despite the intent for transparency, Garlinghouse acknowledged that the report was “used against us by the SEC and others.” Going forward, Ripple will continue disclosing its XRP holdings on its website and shift to communicating updates through official social media channels rather than quarterly reports.

The pullback continues to reflect short-term profit-taking after a strong two-week rally. Amid this consolidation, three tokens—Tron, TRUMP, and Bitcoin Pepe —are showing early signs of decoupling from the broader market trend. Each has attracted increased investor attention, positioning for potential upside in a liquidity-rich environment still lacking a clear directional catalyst. Tron Tron (TRX) is trading steadily around $0.246 on Tuesday, holding above a key support level with an upside target of $0.260 if the current trend holds. The bullish outlook is being reinforced by surging on-chain activity, particularly on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). According to DefiLlama, DEX trading volume on the Tron network surged to a year-to-date high of $751.08 million, pointing to rising liquidity and increased user participation. Tron’s stablecoin market capitalization has also reached a new all-time high of $71.93 billion, continuing a steady climb since mid-March. This growth underscores strong demand and user confidence in the Tron ecosystem. TRUMP The TRUMP meme coin is drawing attention after US President Donald Trump confirmed that the May Gala dinner will proceed as planned, despite criticism surrounding the event and its perceived association with the token. Some TRUMP holders are expected to attend the dinner, raising speculation about the coin’s potential exposure and momentum. Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump · Follow 7:46 pm · 5 May 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The token remained stable around $11 following the president’s post on X. Crypto analyst Emma believes TRUMP could rally to $13 in the near term. She pointed to the coin’s recent bounce from the $10.50–$11 support zone and its push toward the $12.50 resistance level. According to her, a clean breakout above that threshold could trigger the next leg higher, with prior highs acting as price magnets. Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as the first project to bridge two dominant forces in crypto—Bitcoin’s credibility and the explosive reach of meme coin culture. The project’s messaging is unambiguous: “Meme coins hit $100B without Bitcoin. Bitcoin sits at $2T without memes. We’re the first to merge them.” Momentum continues to build behind the project, with its presale raising over $7.7 million so far. The campaign is nearing stage 10, which will trigger once contributions surpass $7.78 million. At the heart of Bitcoin Pepe’s offering is a technical milestone: the PEP-20 token standard, which enables meme coin deployment directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Presale pricing rises roughly 5% per round, with BPEP advancing from $0.021 in the first stage to $0.031 in stage 9—a gain of over 40%. If momentum holds, the token is scheduled to reach $0.0864 by the final stage, setting up early backers for potential triple-digit returns. With escalating demand, a unique token standard, and a unique marketing approach, Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a serious contender in a segment often dismissed as unserious.

In a recent post, the Coinbase CEO called for immediate action from congress in advancing its stablecoin and market structure draft legislations. He believes that the momentum built through the discussion surrounding FIT21’s momentum in the House will propel the bill further. FIT21 or Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act is a bill in the United States that aims to clarify the regulatory framework for digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. It is meant to clarify whether the SEC or CFTC have jurisdiction over crypto. While it was rejected in May 2024 under the Biden administration, House lawmakers have recently revived it through the release of a discussion draft of a market structure bill, which is essentially a successor to FIT21, aiming to set clear boundaries for crypto. “We also welcome House efforts to build on FIT21’s momentum. Both chambers need to act now if we hope to pass comprehensive legislation into law before August,” said Armstrong in his post . Congress has a real opportunity this week to advance stablecoin and market structure legislation. We strongly support the Senate starting debate on the GENIUS Act — and we need 60 votes to get there. We also welcome House efforts to build on FIT21’s momentum. Both chambers need… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) May 6, 2025 At the moment, the Senate is currently mulling over the GENIUS Act, a bill is designed to bring legal clarity to the stablecoin market that now accounts for more than $240 billion in market value, with heavyweights like Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin ( USDC ) leading the charge. It needs at least 60 votes to advance to the next phase of legislation. You might also like: Founders Factory, Coinbase and more join forces to launch U.K. web3 accelerator Despite initially garnering bipartisan support, the bill recently received push-back from nine Senate Democrats who declared they would not support the landmark stablecoin bill, due to concerns regarding what they perceived as a lack of anti-money laundering and national security safeguards. Previously, major industry figures such as Satoshi Act Fund co-founder Dennis Porter and chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Senator Tim Scott, have both predicted that crypto market legislations will be formalized into law by at least August 2025. So far, the White House has two stablecoin bills underway, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, with the latter progressing further. On April 3, 2025, the STABLE Act passed through the House Financial Services Committee markup hearing by a vote of 32-17. However, it still needs to pass through the House of Representatives and then the Senate before it can become law. According to a Nansen report , Coinbase is one of the firms that will benefit most from the stablecoin regulations, as the company is already focused on compliance and is not attached to any strong ecosystems.

Analyst Says A Correction To This Level Could Come First,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-breakout-to-4-imminent-analyst-says-a-correction-to-this-level-could-come-first/,"SUI, one of the leading altcoins of this cycle, targets the key $4.00 barrier after its recent price surge. Amid its reclaim of key supports, an analyst suggests the cryptocurrency could retest a crucial level before its upcoming expansion. Related Reading: Avalanche Bounces Off Key Price Level: Top Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal SUI Eyes 17% Jump Over the last two weeks, SUI has jumped nearly 85%, breaking above the crucial $3.80 barrier and recovering from its multi-month downtrend. During the Q1 market retraces, SUI lost key support levels and retraced over 68% from its January high of $5.35 toward its $1.71 six-month low. In March, the cryptocurrency attempted to reclaim the crucial $3.00 barrier, driven by the news of institutional adoption, but failed to confirm the breakout. Before its recent token unlock, the cryptocurrency saw its price rise from the $2.11 mark and reclaim the $3.00 resistance for the first time since February, rallying to a two-month high of $3.87. Its bullish momentum slowed after the unlock of 88.34 million SUI tokens, worth around $300.4 million, on April 30. The cryptocurrency saw an 8.5% retrace, dropping from $3.51 to $3.21. On Monday, SUI’s price jumped 5.2%, recovering the $3.40 support as the recent selling pressure decreased. Analyst AMCryptoAlex considers that the altcoin could hit the $3.90-$4 resistance after the unlock, if the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, holds the $94,000 mark. Meanwhile, analyst Lennaert noted that SUI could see a bullish continuation of its recent performance after retesting the $3.20-$3.25 support zone and bouncing. “If momentum flips, we’ll be testing the highs in no time. SUI repeatedly proved it doesn’t need much to pump hard. The team keeps on building, and it’s already growing to be one of the most promising ecosystems,” the analyst concluded. Is A $3.25 Retest Coming? Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that SUI is potentially forming a Power of 3 (Po3) setup in a low timeframe. The Po3 pattern divides the price cycle into three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. In the accumulation phase, a consolidation occurs near the recent high after a strong price performance. Meanwhile, the manipulation phase sees a token’s price falling below the accumulation phase’s support level and trades within a range below the recently lost zone. The distribution phase consists of a strong price breakout, with momentum building and participants entering the market. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges According to the analyst, SUI started the accumulation phase after its recent breakout, hovering between the $3.25-$3.85 price range over the next few days. Amid the Sunday price drop, the cryptocurrency began the second phase, falling below the range’s lower boundary and trading near that level throughout the day. Since recovering the $3.25 mark today, SUI has seemingly entered the distribution phase, which could see SUI test the $3.25 support before soaring toward the $4.00 resistance. “Watch for a retest of that support level—or close to it—as we might see an expansion afterwards,” he concluded. As of this writing, SUI trades at $3.46, a 56% increase in the monthly timeframe.

Right now, smart investors are circling four assets: Bitcoin , Solana , XRP , and the under-the-radar contender MAGACOINFINANCE . With early momentum building and the broader market gearing up for the next run, even a $480 placement today could be the key to something much larger tomorrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Strength Beneath the Surface Not every project needs a spotlight to grow. MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining traction where it matters most—on-chain activity, steady development, and meaningful community interaction. Wallet numbers are climbing. Updates are rolling out on time. And the buzz isn’t artificial—it’s real believers showing up early. The project’s disciplined rollout is a familiar pattern to those who’ve seen how the biggest crypto success stories often start. This is still the early window—and those catching it now are the ones history tends to remember. Key Players Supporting the Ecosystem: Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sei Ethereum remains the foundation of decentralized applications, and with continued scaling, its lead looks even more secure heading into 2025. Chainlink powers essential infrastructure for price feeds, data access, and cross-chain connectivity—positioning itself at the core of real-world blockchain utility. Sei is gaining developer traction fast, thanks to its trading-first architecture and ultra-fast execution layer built for performance-focused DeFi. Each of these is shaping the crypto landscape—but none are still in the early price discovery phase like MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Take In the crypto space, $480 has changed lives—if placed early in the right project. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP have already proven themselves. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare opportunity to act before full-scale recognition hits. The groundwork is being laid. The traction is measurable. And the potential? It’s still unfolding.

Against such a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, however, Jordi Visser of 22V Research is convinced that the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, will do well in 2025. BTC has already recovered nearly 25% in recent weeks and Visser expects that momentum to continue moving forward. Notably, a potential Bitcoin rally, as it often does, could drive more interest into other crypto assets, including meme coins like the up-and-coming CartelFi . Is CartelFi a good investment for 2025? Speaking with CNBC this week, the market expert argued Trump’s new tariffs are further hurting confidence in the FIAT currencies. When that happens, liability-driven investors like pension funds, turn to assets that have a history of performing well amidst uncertainty. In 2025, they’ll likely find that relief in Bitcoin, he added, noting the crypto king’s outperformance over every other asset since 2010. “If people need to get performance this year, and they’re not getting it from bonds, and they’re not getting it from stocks – you’re gradually going to see more adoption into Bitcoin.” And while the professional investors will turn to BTC and drive its price up this year, ones that are capital restrained and are interested in quick returns could turn to the promising meme coins like CartelFi. You can learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin on its website. What Fed’s rate cuts may mean for CartelFi Experts believe that the US Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged on May 7 th . However, the central bank could resume rate cuts later this year as “there are persuasive economic reasons for the Fed to aggressively cut rates”, according to Wharton’s professor emeritus Jeremy Siegel . Lower interest rates could also drive more interest into cryptocurrencies, including meme coins like CartelFi, as they push money out of the less-appealing bonds and saving accounts. CartelFi could emerge as a meme project that attracts at least some of that money, given its mission is an attractive one. CartelFi is committed to turning your idle meme coins into productive yield-generating assets. In a way, CartelFi promises a unique source of passive income in 2025 – a narrative that’s already driving massive interest into its native meme coin. CartelFi is going for $0.045 in presale but has still raised more than $1.5 million in recent weeks, indicating strong demand that often translates to upside once a coin goes live on a crypto exchange. This suggests that building an early position in CartelFi at writing could prove a lucrative investment as we proceed through the remainder of 2025.

The investment management firm filed a Form S-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 2, marking a significant step toward launching the first BNB-focused ETF in the United States. Aiming to Break New Ground in Crypto ETFs Should the SEC approve the proposal, VanEck’s BNB ETF would be the first of its kind in the U.S. market to offer direct exposure to BNB through physical token holdings. The fund’s ticker symbol has not yet been revealed. This initiative follows VanEck’s recent registration of a trust entity in Delaware last month, a strategic move intended to lay the legal groundwork for this novel offering. BNB is the fifth digital asset VanEck has targeted for a dedicated ETF registration in the U.S., joining the ranks of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This continued push illustrates VanEck’s commitment to expanding crypto accessibility through regulated financial products. Potential for Passive Income Through Staking In a notable feature, the preliminary prospectus suggests that the ETF might incorporate staking mechanisms, depending on the approval from the listing exchange. If allowed, investors could benefit from passive income via staking rewards. VanEck indicated that staking operations could be conducted through approved providers, including potentially affiliated entities. This aspect sets the BNB ETF apart from traditional crypto funds, as it introduces an income-generating element that could appeal to long-term holders and institutional investors alike. VanEck’s Track Record in Digital Assets VanEck is no stranger to pioneering crypto ETFs. The firm launched spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year after securing long-awaited approval from the SEC. It was also one of the early players to propose a Bitcoin futures ETF as far back as 2017. These achievements have positioned VanEck as a leader in the evolving landscape of digital asset investment products. The firm’s experience and proactive approach could work in its favor as it navigates regulatory hurdles with the BNB ETF. BNB’s Market Position and Utility BNB currently ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. At the time of the filing, the token was trading around $608 with minimal fluctuations. As the utility token of the BNB Chain, BNB is widely used to power transactions, smart contracts, and various services across the Binance ecosystem. The introduction of a regulated investment vehicle for BNB could significantly expand its appeal to mainstream investors, especially those seeking exposure through familiar structures like ETFs.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-06 08:03:37

But it’s not just BTC making moves—altcoins are gaining real momentum as capital shifts and investor focus broadens. If you're looking for the best crypto to buy now, this is one of those rare windows when early positioning can really pay off. Rising stablecoin flows are signaling confidence, and the broader market is heating up fast. Among the top contenders, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is standing out with a unique mix of utility, staking, and AI-powered tech. In this breakdown, we’ll cover five altcoins that are shaping up to lead the charge in 2025. Bitcoin Rallies Amid Rising Stablecoin Liquidity Thanks to growing inflows into the stablecoin market, Bitcoin is making waves. The stablecoin market cap grew by $5 billion in April alone, rising 2.2% to an impressive $238 billion. Leading the charge are USDT and USDC, with gains of $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Historically, rising stablecoin liquidity aligns closely with Bitcoin price gains, reflecting greater market capital and liquidity availability. According to investors, this continued trend suggests a favorable environment for altcoins to thrive as well. Altcoins, especially those with unique utility and strong community support, are poised for accelerated growth in the coming years. Here’s a closer look at five coins you should keep on your radar.

Key Highlights One of the most active and loyal communities in the meme coin niche. Continued explosive price action with room for further growth.

44225626,https://coinpedia.org/?p=451142,1746519240,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Solana ETF Explained: Key Players, Approval Timelines, and Market Impact",https://coinpedia.org/information/solana-etf-explained-key-players-approval-timelines-and-market-impact/,"The post Solana ETF Explained: Key Players, Approval Timelines, and Market Impact appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As institutional interest in crypto continues to rise in 2025, Solana has emerged as one of the top contenders for a spot ETF listing in the United States. With its fast-growing DeFi ecosystem, low transaction fees, and expanding developer base, Solana is increasingly seen as the leading alternative to Ethereum — and now, the race is on to bring a regulated Solana ETF to market. Full List of Solana ETF Filings as SEC Reviews Key Applications The push began in mid-2024, just months after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. Since then, a wave of asset managers — from established giants to crypto-native firms — have filed to launch spot Solana ETFs. Despite lingering questions around Solana’s regulatory classification, Bloomberg currently gives a 75% chance that a Solana ETF will be approved by the end of the year. The current SEC under Chair Paul Atkins has shown more openness to crypto products, especially those that meet rigorous market surveillance, custody, and pricing standards. The fact that two Solana futures ETFs — SOLZ and SOLT — are already listed by the DTCC, and that CME is preparing to launch Solana futures contracts later this year, has only strengthened the case for a spot ETF. Here’s a breakdown of the key players leading the Solana ETF charge in the US. 1. VanEck Solana Trust VanEck was the first to move, filing an S-1 registration statement with the SEC in June 2024. The fund would directly track SOL’s market price and marks the first formal attempt to list a spot Solana ETF in the US. VanEck’s early application gave it a first-mover advantage in the altcoin ETF race. 2. 21Shares Core Solana ETF Also filed in June 2024, 21Shares closely followed VanEck with its own S-1. The fund is intended to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange, where several crypto ETFs, including Ethereum, already trade. 21Shares has positioned itself as a key player in altcoin ETFs globally, and its Solana filing builds on that momentum. 3. Bitwise Solana ETF In November 2024, Bitwise initiated its filing by establishing a statutory trust in Delaware. It later withdrew the original structure and refiled directly with the SEC via an S-1. The fund would hold SOL directly and aligns with Bitwise’s strategy of targeting long-term crypto exposure through trusted frameworks. 4. Grayscale Solana ETF Grayscale submitted a filing in January 2025 to convert its existing Solana Trust (GSOL) into a spot ETF . GSOL had over $134 million in AUM at the time of filing. The move mirrors Grayscale’s earlier strategy with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, and would see the ETF listed on NYSE Arca. 5. Canary Solana ETF Filed between late 2024 and early 2025, Canary Capital’s application came amid a flurry of altcoin ETF filings following the US presidential election. The firm submitted an S-1 for a spot Solana ETF, seeking to capitalize on growing institutional demand for compliant SOL exposure. 6. Franklin Templeton Solana ETF Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets, entered the space in March 2025 with filings for both S-1 and 19b-4 forms. Its proposed Solana ETF would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange and represents one of the most high-profile institutional entries into the Solana ETF race. 7. Fidelity Solana ETF On March 25, Cboe BZX Exchange submitted a 19b-4 filing on behalf of Fidelity for a proposed spot Solana ETF. The SEC acknowledged the application in early April. Notably, Fidelity’s fund plans to stake a portion of its SOL holdings through trusted third-party providers, offering the potential for yield — a unique feature among current filings. Will Solana ETF Be Approved in 2025? While the SEC has not yet ruled on any of these applications, the sentiment has shifted notably since the start of 2025. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already live, analysts believe it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the SEC to justify rejecting similar products — especially those that trade on regulated futures markets or are supported by mature custody and pricing infrastructure. Regulatory classification remains one of the last unresolved hurdles. The SEC has not made a formal determination about whether Solana is a security, and ongoing litigation involving other altcoins could influence the decision timeline. Still, ETF sponsors are updating their filings to address concerns proactively, including surveillance-sharing agreements and expanded disclosures — tactics that were key to winning approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, a spot Solana ETF could draw $3–6 billion in inflows, making it one of the largest altcoin ETF launches to date. The fact that futures ETFs tied to Solana are already recognized by US clearing houses only adds to the momentum. If any of these Solana ETFs are approved in the second half of 2025 — which many analysts now expect — it would mark a major step toward bringing institutional-grade investment access to one of the most dynamic blockchains in the crypto ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 08:14:00

The stock and crypto trading company plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.” In documents submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 5, eToro revealed plans to raise $500 million through the sale of 10 million shares, priced between $46 and $50 each. eToro IPO to Offer 10M Shares Split Between Company and Existing Investors Half of the shares—5 million—will be issued by the company, while the remaining 5 million will be offered by existing shareholders. These include co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia, his brother Ronen Assia, and prominent investors such as Spark Capital, BRM Group, and Andalusian Private Capital. eToro, which offers commission-based trading in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, is positioning itself as a competitor to firms like Robinhood. Although Robinhood reported a decline in crypto trading during Q1, its stock has climbed nearly 30% since the start of the year. The filing also notes that investment giant BlackRock has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. Additionally, 500,000 shares have been reserved for a directed share program, typically aimed at employees and early supporters. Crypto remains a significant part of eToro’s business, with $12.1 billion in crypto-related revenue in 2024—up sharply from $3.4 billion in 2023. Still, the company expects crypto to represent a slightly smaller share of its total trading commissions in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year. eToro filed an updated IPO prospectus seeking to raise $500M at a $4B valuation $ETOR . >Mentions crypto 630 times >Crypto trading is 38% of transaction revenue >$ETOR held $113M in digital assets (likely BTC) as of year-end 2024 >Net income of $192M, so ~21x PE. pic.twitter.com/o0vt83pqYz — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 5, 2025 Despite the momentum, eToro acknowledged potential headwinds. These include user retention risks tied to negative media sentiment about listed cryptocurrencies, as well as regulatory pressure from U.S. state laws and the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which the firm expects will incur ongoing compliance costs. eToro initially filed confidentially with the SEC in January before publicly announcing its IPO plans in March. The offering was delayed following market turbulence triggered by former President Donald Trump’s April 2 trade policy announcements, which affected numerous planned listings. More Crypto Firms Expect IPO Other crypto firms, including Circle and Kraken , are also exploring IPOs, signaling a broader industry push toward public markets. eToro’s offering will be led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank, and Citigroup. Plans to explore IPOs come amid growing regulatory clarity in the US. As reported, Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC , marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action.

In spite of this the market remains slightly depressed as US and global economic uncertainty persists. The market is waiting for the FOMC meeting The US economy was given a bit of a filip recently when nonfarm payrolls increased by 177K in April, instead of the 133K that were forecast. However, this is only likely to strengthen Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s hand on Wednesday at the FOMC meeting for keeping interest rates at their current level. No interest rate cuts mean that borrowing cannot get cheaper and so businesses have to continue curbing their growth, possibly leading to more economic stagnation. The market is definitely expecting no change in interest rates, but of course, every single utterance by Jerome Powell in his speech will be dissected for any ulterior meanings, and the Fed chairman will be careful to stick to a particular tone that could be hawkish or dovish, depending on which way the Fed wants the market to lean towards. With this in mind, it could be the reason why there’s still not much going on in the shape of positive price action for Bitcoin. Money is being clutched tightly to chests, perhaps until after the FOMC meeting, but this is in the face of technical indicators signalling that a rally should be getting into its stride. Nevertheless, one can’t have a decent rally without plenty of investor money and confidence to back it. This is probably still in the pipeline, but perhaps we need to get Wednesday out of the way first. Decision point about to be reached Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows that volume is decreasing. This could be that the market is waiting for a catalyst, which could come in the form of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It can also mean that sellers are becoming exhausted and that a reversal back to the upside may not be far away. It’s difficult to define the actual chart pattern that the $BTC price is following. However, the price action is funnelling into the apex of two converging trend lines right now, and so $BTC should emerge from one side or the other. Of course, the price could just push through the top trendline and then continue limping sideways. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is starting to cross back down, and this would then perhaps favour a drop through the bottom trendline. A price decrease below $93,000 would need to be avoided by the bulls in order to prevent a lower low from occurring. $BTC trend is still up Source: TradingView Meanwhile, in the higher time frame of the weekly chart, all is looking very positive still. The current price is holding support. Given the amount of strong resistance here, it was only to be expected that there would be a pause in this area as the bears defended this level. Three indicators at the bottom of the chart all show that the $BTC price could continue to go up. The Stochastic RSI has its indicators passing the middle line, the RSI is still displaying a cross up, and the MACD at the bottom of the chart shows the indicator lines posturing to cross back up, and the histogram about to turn back to the green.

44228092,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66339,1746524030,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,This New Apple Report Is Bullish For Ripple and XRP. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-new-apple-report-is-bullish-for-ripple-and-xrp-heres-why/,"On May 2, 2025, Apple formally implemented a significant revision to its U.S. App Store policies, enabling developers to integrate external payment options into their applications. This move follows a federal court ruling enforcing a 2021 injunction issued in the Epic Games antitrust case, which found Apple in violation for restricting developers from directing users to non-Apple payment systems. Crypto influencer Amelie reacted to the update by stating on Twitter: “BREAKING: APPLE TO ALLOW CRYPTO PAYMENTS OUTSIDE THE APP STORE! APPLE IS INTERCONNECTED WITH RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL! #XRP APPLE.” BREAKING: APPLE TO ALLOW CRYPTO PAYMENTS OUTSIDE THE APP STORE! APPLE IS INTERCONNECTED WITH RIPPLE‘S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL! #XRP APPLE https://t.co/Ha7aniqe84 pic.twitter.com/AZ0YUyAD5Y — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 4, 2025 Her tweet strongly emphasizes the potential linkage between Apple’s policy transition and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP), a framework designed to facilitate interoperability between various payment networks, including traditional banking systems and cryptocurrencies such as XRP . External Transactions Now Permitted Without Apple Fees The underlying court order mandates Apple to permit app developers to include buttons or links leading users to third-party websites for purchasing digital content. Previously, Apple had imposed 15% to 30% commissions on such transactions, including warning labels about external payment risks. Under the revised guidelines, these charges and prompts are no longer applicable within external payments made via links embedded in U.S.-based applications. Many crypto community members viewed this development as a strategic milestone for wider adoption. Applications that deal with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) functionalities, and crypto wallets can now process transactions outside Apple’s fee infrastructure, thereby retaining most revenue. Developers also gain the option to use third-party payment processors such as Stripe, which supports crypto transactions, thus broadening the operational flexibility of blockchain-integrated applications. Ripple’s Interledger Protocol Highlighted by Crypto Community Amelie’s mention of Ripple’s Interledger Protocol introduces another layer of significance for those observing the convergence of major tech platforms with blockchain-based infrastructure. Ripple’s ILP aims to enable the seamless transfer of value across disparate payment networks, which, if integrated with systems like Apple’s, could accelerate real-world utility for XRP and similar digital assets. While no official partnership between Apple and Ripple has been confirmed, Amelie’s tweet underscores a growing sentiment that interoperability protocols may eventually underpin the backbone of digital payment evolution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Future Implications Depend on Ongoing Legal Developments The timing and scope of this policy change coincide with increasing regulatory scrutiny and the enforcement of antitrust measures across major technology firms. Apple’s decision, though driven by a U.S. legal obligation, parallels the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, which promotes open and competitive digital ecosystems by challenging closed-platform models. While Apple has officially opposed the court’s ruling and intends to appeal, enforcing these new terms remains effective within the United States as of early May. As Apple complies with legal requirements, the broader implications for the crypto sector are considerable. With fewer restrictions and lower transaction fees, developers are positioned to deliver enhanced user experiences and broader crypto adoption within mobile ecosystems. Whether Apple maintains this stance for long will depend on the outcome of its pending legal challenge, but for now, the crypto industry sees an open path to integration.

Unlike other cryptocurrency ETF filings that faced early delays, the Litecoin ETF proposal had remained on schedule, leading some analysts to consider the possibility of an early approval. However, the SEC's recent postponement aligns with its ongoing cautious approach toward altcoin fund approvals. Industry observers note that the delay may be influenced by the recent swearing-in of a new SEC commissioner two weeks prior, who is still acclimating to the role. Despite this setback, expectations remain that the majority of existing cryptocurrency ETF filings could receive approval before the end of the year. The Litecoin ETF, if approved, would mark a notable development in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

Now, a new performer priced at $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is capturing investor attention with a bold mix of utility and explosive potential. Once Phase 5 begins, the token price will increase to $0.03, offering 20% ROI for Phase 4 investors. The project has already raised over $7.6 million from more than 9,500 investors, with Phase 4 already more than 50% sold out. With analysts projecting a 30x to 50x rally in the months ahead, some believe Mutuum Finance could ignite an even steeper surge than DOGE ever managed. While DOGE rode hype, MUTM is riding fundamentals, and that might make all the difference this cycle. Presale growth and launch price outlook The MUTM token is currently priced at $0.025 and is in high demand. Investors entering during this Phase 4 stage stand to gain a 20% increase when Phase 5 kicks off. With a final launch price set at $0.06, several crypto analysts are already forecasting a potential surge to as high as $3 shortly after its release, an exponential jump from today’s presale value. These factors contribute to why MUTM is one of the most talked-about low-price DeFi tokens. Mutuum Finance: shaping the next generation of DeFi lending Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a forerunner in the DeFi market because of its hybrid lending model, which takes the best from Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract model provides users with a stable way of earning passive income. The platform uses smart contracts to control the liquidity pools, removing intermediaries and reducing human error. Users can earn stable yields by participating in the pools as the smart contracts allocate funds, interest, and risk management in an automatic manner. This passive approach appeals to users who want a secure and automated method of earning income in the DeFi ecosystem. On the contrary, the Peer-to-Peer model offers the users the opportunity to negotiate terms of a loan directly between themselves. The decentralized system offers greater privacy and control, with both borrowers and lenders in a position to structure agreements to fit individual needs. P2P lending is different from the traditional model of lending centered on centralized platforms or authorities in that it enhances transparency and trust among the stakeholders through blockchain verification and direct communication. The model is most attractive to buyers who value independence and personalized terms of finance. This dual structure provides both flexibility and high yields, with liquidity providers earning over 10% returns, a rare feat in today’s DeFi environment. $100K giveaway fuels community growth As an enticement and reward for being an early adopter, Mutuum Finance is offering a $100,000 contest, where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 of MUTM tokens each. Along with a consistent referral program, these incentives are helping build a successful, loyal community, key to long-term project success. Security and stability: collateralized stablecoin and audits Security is at the heart of Mutuum Finance. The platform is preparing to launch a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin backed by Ethereum, not algorithmic, but reliable and transparent. In addition, Mutuum Finance team is committed to rigorous smart contract audits and ongoing financial transparency, giving investors peace of mind in a sector often marred by exploits and instability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top contender in the altcoin space, with a bold mix of utility and explosive potential. With its Phase 4 presale already raising over $7.6 million from more than 9,500 investors, the project is poised for a 20% price jump when Phase 5 begins. As the presale nears sell-out and the token prepares for launch at $0.06, now is the time to secure your investment before the surge. Don’t miss out on the next big DeFi breakout.

In January 2025, DeepSeek’s R1 surpassed ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app on the US Apple App Store. Unlike proprietary models like ChatGPT, DeepSeek is open-source, meaning anyone can access the code, study it, share it, and use it for their own models. You might also like: DeepSeek, China and Russia AI partnership: Western world is on notice | Opinion This shift has fueled excitement about transparency in AI, pushing the industry toward greater openness. Just weeks ago, in February 2025, Anthropic released Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a hybrid reasoning model that’s partially open for research previews, also amplifying the conversation around accessible AI. Yet, while these developments drive innovation, they also expose a dangerous misconception: that open-source AI is inherently more secure (and safer) than other closed models. The promise and the pitfalls Open-source AI models like DeepSeek’s R1 and Replit’s latest coding agents show us the power of accessible technology. DeepSeek claims it built its system for just $5.6 million, nearly one-tenth the cost of Meta’s Llama model. Meanwhile, Replit’s Agent, supercharged by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, lets anyone, even non-coders, build software from natural language prompts. The implications are huge. This means that basically everyone, including smaller companies, startups, and independent developers, can now use this existing (and very robust) model to build new specialized AI applications, including new AI agents, at a much lower cost, faster rate, and with greater ease overall. This could create a new AI economy where accessibility to models is king. But where open-source shines—accessibility—it also faces heightened scrutiny. Free access, as seen with DeepSeek’s $5.6 million model, democratizes innovation but opens the door to cyber risks. Malicious actors could tweak these models to craft malware or exploit vulnerabilities faster than patches emerge. Open-source AI doesn’t lack safeguards by default. It builds on a legacy of transparency that has fortified technology for decades. Historically, engineers leaned on “security through obfuscation,” hiding system details behind proprietary walls. That approach faltered: vulnerabilities surfaced, often discovered first by bad actors. Open-source flipped this model, exposing code—like DeepSeek’s R1 or Replit’s Agent—to public scrutiny, fostering resilience through collaboration. Yet, neither open nor closed AI models inherently guarantee robust verification. The ethical stakes are just as critical. Open-source AI, much like its closed counterparts, can mirror biases or produce harmful outputs rooted in training data. This isn’t a flaw unique to openness; it’s a challenge of accountability. Transparency alone doesn’t erase these risks, nor does it fully prevent misuse. The difference lies in how open-source invites collective oversight, a strength that proprietary models often lack, though it still demands mechanisms to ensure integrity. The need for verifiable AI For open-source AI to be more trusted, it needs verification. Without it, both open and closed models can be altered or misused, amplifying misinformation or skewing automated decisions that increasingly shape our world. It’s not enough for models to be accessible; they must also be auditable, tamper-proof, and accountable. By using distributed networks, blockchains can certify that AI models remain unaltered, their training data stays transparent, and their outputs can be validated against known baselines. Unlike centralized verification, which hinges on trusting one entity, blockchain’s decentralized, cryptographic approach stops bad actors from tampering behind closed doors. It also flips the script on third-party control, spreading oversight across a network and creating incentives for broader participation, unlike today, where unpaid contributors fuel trillion-token datasets without consent or reward, then pay to use the results. A blockchain-powered verification framework brings layers of security and transparency to open-source AI. Storing models onchain or via cryptographic fingerprints ensures modifications are tracked openly, letting developers and users confirm they’re using the intended version. Capturing training data origins on a blockchain proves models draw from unbiased, quality sources, cutting risks of hidden biases or manipulated inputs. Plus, cryptographic techniques can validate outputs without exposing personal data users share (often unprotected), balancing privacy with trust as models strengthen. Blockchain’s transparent, tamper-resistant nature offers the accountability open-source AI desperately needs. Where AI systems now thrive on user data with little protection, blockchain can reward contributors and safeguard their inputs. By weaving in cryptographic proofs and decentralized governance, we can build an AI ecosystem that’s open, secure, and less beholden to centralized giants. AI’s future is based on trust… onchain Open-source AI is an important piece of the puzzle, and the AI industry should work to achieve even more transparency—but being open-source is not the final destination. The future of AI and its relevance will be built on trust, not just accessibility. And trust can’t be open-sourced. It must be built, verified, and reinforced at every level of the AI stack. Our industry needs to focus its attention on the verification layer and the integration of safe AI. For now, bringing AI onchain and leveraging blockchain tech is our safest bet for building a more trustworthy future.

44228338,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157539,1746524401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Edge Computing Breakthrough: Anduril’s Klas Acquisition Powers Military AI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anduril-edge-computing-acquisition/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, advancements in areas like artificial intelligence and decentralized systems are constantly pushing boundaries. For those following the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the infrastructure that enables sophisticated, real-time data processing is key. This is where Edge Computing becomes critically important. Imagine systems that can process vast amounts of data instantly, right where it’s collected, without relying on distant data centers. This capability is essential for everything from autonomous vehicles to advanced AI applications, and it’s a field seeing significant development, particularly with companies like Anduril. Why Edge Computing is Critical for the Future Traditional computing relies heavily on centralized data centers. Devices collect data and send it to the cloud for processing. While effective for many tasks, this model has limitations, especially when speed and reliability are paramount. This is where Edge Computing steps in. Reduced Latency: Processing data closer to the source means less delay. This is vital for applications requiring immediate responses, such as autonomous systems or real-time sensor analysis. Increased Reliability: Edge devices can operate even when connectivity to central networks is limited or unavailable, making them ideal for remote or challenging environments. Lower Bandwidth Costs: Processing data locally reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over networks, saving bandwidth and associated costs. Enhanced Security: Keeping sensitive data processed locally can reduce exposure compared to sending it across public networks to a central cloud. The challenge with Edge Computing is making powerful compute and networking equipment rugged, compact, and easy to deploy in non-traditional settings. This is a complex engineering task that few companies have mastered. The Strategic Importance of the Anduril Acquisition Anduril, a defense technology company, recently made a significant move to bolster its capabilities in this difficult area. On Monday, the company announced its ninth acquisition: Dublin-based Klas. Klas is known for manufacturing ruggedized Edge Computing equipment specifically designed for demanding environments, serving military and first responders. While financial details of the deal were not disclosed and it is subject to regulatory approval, Anduril confirmed that Klas employs 150 people. This acquisition is not a new partnership; Anduril was already a Klas customer, integrating Klas’s technology into its existing product lines. The purchase solidifies this relationship and brings Klas’s specialized expertise and proven hardware in-house, accelerating Anduril’s ability to deliver advanced edge solutions. Powering AI Edge Computing in Extreme Environments Klas’s flagship product line, known as Voyager, consists of ruggedized compute and networking systems. These systems are built to withstand harsh conditions, making them perfect for deployment in remote, off-grid, or inhospitable locations where traditional IT infrastructure is impossible. Anduril had already been utilizing Voyager systems within its Menace command center products. Furthermore, Klas’s Voyager technology was already integrated with Anduril’s core software platform, Lattice. Lattice is Anduril’s AI software that integrates data from various sensors and applies artificial intelligence, such as computer vision, to perform tasks like object identification and tracking. This existing integration means the Anduril Acquisition of Klas creates immediate synergy, allowing Anduril to tightly couple its advanced AI software with purpose-built, ruggedized hardware at the edge. Revolutionizing Military AI with Portable Power Alongside the Klas acquisition announcement, Anduril also unveiled a new product called Menace-T. This product embodies the goal of bringing powerful AI Edge Computing capabilities to the field in a highly portable format. Unlike traditional command systems that might require a large vehicle, Menace-T is designed to fit into just two carry-on cases. Anduril states that one person can set up the system in minutes. This portability is a game-changer for Military AI applications. It allows sophisticated computing and communication capabilities to be deployed rapidly wherever needed, supporting troops and equipment in dynamic operational environments. Anduril reports that Menace-T is already being used in military ground vehicles and maritime vessels, demonstrating its immediate utility in real-world scenarios. Achieving Real-time AI : The IVAS Example One prominent use case for Menace-T and the underlying Klas technology is supporting the military’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) VR headsets. The IVAS project, initially awarded to Microsoft in 2018 with a substantial budget, aimed to develop ruggedized HoloLens headsets for soldiers. However, the project encountered technical challenges over the years. Anduril took control of the troubled IVAS contract in February, with Microsoft remaining a cloud partner. Anduril had previously integrated its Lattice software into the IVAS headsets, enabling computer vision AI for object detection, tracking, and classification. Now, Anduril believes that Klas’s technology, which powers Menace-T, can address some of IVAS’s historical problems, particularly those related to reliable data processing and communication at the tactical edge. Tom Keane, Anduril’s SVP of Engineering, highlighted this connection, stating, “There are scenarios where those soldiers need to communicate with the tactical edge to send data, to receive data, to task autonomous systems, and that’s a place where the Klas technology can help.” He added that Klas had already been supplying technology to IVAS for several years in this context, indicating a natural progression for deeper integration and reliance on Klas’s capabilities to achieve truly Real-time AI performance for soldiers in the field. Beyond the Battlefield: Commercial Potential of Edge Computing While Anduril’s immediate focus is clearly on military, national security, and law enforcement applications, the underlying technology has significant potential far beyond these sectors. The ability to perform complex processing, including advanced computer vision and Real-time AI , directly at the point of data collection opens up numerous commercial possibilities that are currently impractical due to the limitations of traditional cloud computing or less robust edge hardware. Examples of potential commercial applications include: Automotive: Enabling more sophisticated on-board processing for autonomous driving, vehicle diagnostics, and safety systems. Industrial Automation: Powering AI-driven quality control, predictive maintenance, and robotics in manufacturing and industrial settings. Remote Monitoring: Deploying AI for environmental monitoring (like pollution detection), infrastructure inspection, or surveillance in areas with limited connectivity. Healthcare: Enabling real-time analysis of medical imaging or patient data at the point of care. Anduril has not ruled out pursuing these commercial avenues in the future. Tom Keane confirmed that the technology from Klas has many use cases across military, national security, law enforcement, autonomy, and more, and Anduril intends to support a wide array of customers and applications alongside its partners. The advancements made in meeting the stringent demands of Military AI could very well pave the way for robust, reliable Edge Computing solutions across numerous industries, impacting how data is processed and acted upon in real-time globally. In conclusion, Anduril’s acquisition of Klas is a strategic move that significantly enhances its capabilities in Edge Computing and AI Edge Computing . By bringing Klas’s ruggedized hardware expertise in-house, Anduril is better positioned to deliver powerful, portable, and reliable computing solutions essential for demanding applications like Military AI and the challenging IVAS project. This development underscores the growing importance of processing power at the edge and highlights the potential for these advancements to eventually influence a wide range of technological fields, including those relevant to the future of decentralized systems and real-time data applications that interest the Bitcoin World community.

Now, technical analysts say a new altcoin is mirroring that same parabolic setup, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced under $0.03, MUTM is drawing comparisons to early-stage XRP due to its explosive potential, real DeFi utility, and aggressive growth roadmap. Already in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025 per token, the project has attracted over 9,500 investors and has raised over $7.6 million. There is a 20% price increase to $0.03 in Phase 5, and a 140% return at launch for investors who buy today. If it follows a similar trajectory, that $800 portfolio could swell to $290,000 in just five months. For high-risk, high-reward seekers, this might be the cycle’s breakout star. Presale frenzy: Mutuum Finance gathers steam Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $7.6 million has already poured into the project from more than 9,500 backers, and that number continues to grow. One of the platform’s standout innovations is its Buy-and-Distribute strategy. Through this mechanism, Mutuum Finance actively purchases market tokens and redistributes them to stakers, ensuring constant engagement and strengthening the project’s tokenomics. This system not only manages supply in a smart way, but also offers sustained rewards, making it appealing for long-term participants. In a market often dictated by hype and volatility, Mutuum Finance introduces a stabilizing force grounded in continuous utility. Leaderboard rewards system boosts engagement To deepen user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently launched a leaderboard dashboard that highlights the top 50 MUTM holders in real-time. Those who maintain their positions will receive additional rewards, adding a gamified edge that boosts loyalty and community involvement. CertiK audit brings added security and trust Security is another key focus for Mutuum Finance. The team has partnered with blockchain security leader CertiK to carry out a full smart contract audit. Once completed, the audit results will be published on Mutuum’s social media channels to give the community full visibility and peace of mind about the safety of their investments. mtToken system unlocks passive yield without locking assets Mutuum’s mtToken technology also raises the bar for passive income in DeFi. This feature allows users to tokenize assets like ETH and DAI into mtTokens that earn yield while remaining fully liquid and accessible. It’s a flexible, high-return system that lets users put their crypto to work without giving up control. For borrowers, Mutuum Finance system is just as appealing. It offers loans like $5,000 USDT backed by $7,000 in ETH collateral, using a secure loan-to-value ratio that keeps the process transparent and low-risk. The protocol’s approach to lending is both practical and progressive, offering a clear alternative to outdated centralized systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has all the makings of a breakout altcoin, with its presale momentum mirroring the explosive growth of XRP in 2017. Priced at just $0.025 in Phase 4, early investors could see a 140% return once the token launches at $0.06, and a potential 30x to 50x rally in the coming months. With over $7.6 million raised and 9,500+ investors already on board, the project is gaining serious traction. Combining DeFi innovation, long-term value strategies, and strong community engagement, MUTM is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that could turn a modest investment into a significant windfall. Don’t miss the chance to get in early, this may be the cycle’s breakout star.

Daily active addresses historically predict price trends; recent decoupling suggests speculative price movements without sustained user interest. Transaction volume shows a shift from DeFi and payments to wallet-to-wallet transactions, indicating less robust ecosystem growth. Future BNB price hinges on increased gas consumption and active addresses in DeFi and NFT sectors; regulatory risks could impact long-term prospects. The evolution of the Binance Coin (BNB) price has a close relationship with key activity indicators on its blockchain. To forecast the future direction of BNB's price, it is important to examine underlying trends in key indicators such as active addresses, transaction volume and gas consumption. Daily Active Addresses: Thermometer of Interest Node Analytica Node Analytica Historically, daily active directions have acted as a leading indicator of asset interest. During the periods marked in green on our charts, increases in active directions usually anticipate a significant appreciation in the asset price. A clear example of this was between 2020 and 2021, when a sharp increase in active directions accompanied a notable rise in BNB's price. However, from 2022 until today, we observe a partial decoupling between the two variables. Although BNB reached historical highs, active directions failed to sustain consistently at previous levels, suggesting a significant speculative component in the past appreciation. Between January 2022 and December 2022, BNB's daily active addresses fell by 33%, while the price rose by 54% (from USD 350 to USD 540). This phenomenon coincides with the launch of new pairs on Binance and the development of its zero-fee campaigns for transfers with BNB. Attracting speculative flows in specific periods (buying peaks before announcements), without the day-to-day adoption (real user - value) being sustained. Overlaying the two graphs shows a USD 200 divergence in price as the directions decreased by a third, suggesting an excess of financial demand over usage demand. Transaction Volume: Real Usage Indicator Node Analytica Node Analytica Analysing the sectoral distribution of daily transactions in the BNB chain, we can observe that there is a strong initial participation of the decentralised financial sector ( DEFI ) and payments, especially between the years 2021 and 2022. Since then, there has been a significant volume reduction in these recently discussed sectors. On the other hand, sectors such as gaming and NFT Apps showed sporadic spikes in activity, albeit without sufficient consistency to sustain a prolonged price rise. Currently, the dominant sector in the BNB chain remains wallet-to-wallet, reflecting mostly simple transactions and not necessarily robust growth in the value-adding ecosystem. Gas Consumption: The Economic Health of the Network Node Analytica Node Analytica Gas consumption, measured in USD, gives us a direct insight into the real economic ‘demand’ for executing smart contracts in the BNB chain. Between late 2020 and early 2022, this gas consumption spiked, correlating positively (0.80) with substantial increases in the asset price. However, from mid-2022 to the present, gas consumption has largely decreased, evidencing lower demand in the interaction with complex smart contracts, possibly due to a migration of this demand to other networks. Average daily gas consumption on the BNB blockchain went from USD 8.2M in June 2022 to USD 2.7M in June 2023 (down 67%). This USD 5.5 M drop is partly explained by the migration of DeFi volumes to networks such as Arbitrum (LTV volume on Arbitrum +45% in 2023) and strong competition from Solana, whose contracts cost 80% less in fees. In addition, Ethereum Layer 2 initiatives absorbed some of the activity, while Binance's incentives for dApps did not reach pre-bear market volumes. Price Forecast and Conclusions Considering all the above metrics, BNB's price evolution will depend mainly on two factors in our view: (1) The sustained recovery of gas consumption (higher actual usage of applications) and (2) The significant and sustained increase in active directions, especially from key sectors such as DeFi or NFT. We believe that, in a positive scenario, where there is a rebound in activity in decentralised applications, BNB could return to levels above USD 400-500 by the end of 2025. This is because in previous times (2022), when activity in decentralised applications was at record highs, the Binance token reached that price. So we think it is feasible that this could happen again if the above conditions occur. On the other hand, if current usage (mostly wallet-to-wallet) continues to dominate without a noticeable recovery in decentralised applications, the price trend could remain flat or even decline. Strategic Recommendations For long-term investors, it is useful to monitor the evolution of gas consumption and active addresses by specific sectors (mainly DeFi and NFT). This can be done using platforms such as Glassnode or Dune Analytics. They should set up alerts when active addresses accumulate +10% in four weeks compared to the previous month. A drop > -10% in gas consumption in two weeks signals bearish risk. For short-term traders and speculators, the green periods identified on our charts can be strategic entry points, as long as they are supported by real increases in activity. These periods are rises of more than 10% in metrics over 4 week periods. Personally, I believe that the increasing integration of BNB into real payments (Binance Pay, BNB Visa) can reverse some of the decline in gas if incentives are stabilised. However, the lack of top-tier DeFi projects on the Binance blockchain limits its ability to grow sustainably.",OBNB|BNB-USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ARB|BNB,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-06 09:45:38

The allegations, filed in a letter to a Manhattan federal court on Monday, assert that prosecutors charged the Samourai executives with operating an unlicensed money transmission business despite being told by regulators that no license was necessary. Keonne Rodriguez, CEO of Samourai Wallet, and William Hill, CTO of the company, were charged with crimes in April 2024, two months after the government first brought criminal charges. The Justice Department accused them of conspiring to run an unlicensed money-transmitting business and laundering over $100 million in illicit funds. Their legal team now argues that the evidence was withheld, violating their rights and making the case illegitimate. FinCEN said no license was required The defendants believe the prosecutors filed criminal charges six months later, omitting FinCEN’s legal interpretation from the initial disclosure. “ The non-disclosure prejudiced our clients’ ability to seek bail, prepare their defense, and pursue early dismissal of the case ,” the filing stated. The defendants have requested a formal hearing to investigate what they call a “Brady violation,” referring to the constitutional requirement that prosecutors must disclose evidence favorable to the defense. In their May 5 submission, lawyers for the defendants insisted the suppression of evidence wasn’t trivial. They cited FinCEN’s interpretation as aligned with Samourai’s sentiment, that the company’s non-custodial wallet software did not qualify as a regulated money transmitter under US law. Rodriguez and Hill pleaded their innocence pre-arrest Samourai’s co-founders had previously addressed regulatory concerns in public forums years before their indictment. On July 12, 2021, Rodriguez stated on a podcast that CoinJoin, a technique used by Samourai to anonymize transactions, was legal and not subject to transmission laws unless custody of funds was involved. “ Users are entirely entitled to use this type of tool. It’s just a collaborative transaction. It gets iffy if you’re providing CoinJoin services, and you’re taking custody, then you’re a money transmitter and you better have a money transmission license ,” he surmised. He reiterated this position on January 30, 2022, claiming that FinCEN and other regulators had consistently said non-custodial wallet developers were not subject to MSB licensing. “We aren’t transmitting money,” Rodriguez said at the time, a legal opinion later FinCEN staff also mentioned in their internal discussions. The defense team contends that if FinCEN was of the opinion that Samourai was outside the scope of its regulatory purview, then the prosecution lacked grounds to pursue criminal charges. “ It is hard to imagine a clearer example of ‘regulation by prosecution, ’” the letter continued. On April 30, the defense demanded that the government produce documentation explaining why the FinCEN call had not been disclosed earlier. Two days later, on May 2, the government provided some emails from August 2023 but refused to share internal deliberations discussing the delay. Prosecutors have not yet offered an explanation for the year-long suppression, and this has led Rodriguez and Hill to request a court hearing to determine the circumstances behind the delayed disclosure. DOJ legal contradiction after policy changes On April 7, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a memorandum titled “Ending Regulation by Prosecution.” The memo directed prosecutors to avoid using criminal charges to impose regulatory frameworks on digital asset businesses, especially “tumbling and mixing services,” like those operated by Samourai Wallet. In its original indictment, the Department of Justice alleged that Samourai facilitated over $2 billion in crypto transactions through its mixing service, with more than $100 million tied to criminal activity from darknet marketplaces and online scams. Rodriguez and Hill pleaded not guilty to all charges.

44228575,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157540,1746525004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Crucial Shift into Greed Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-greed/,"The pulse of the cryptocurrency market is often hard to read, but tools like the Crypto Fear and Greed Index offer a valuable snapshot of prevailing market sentiment. Recently, this index has shown a significant shift, moving firmly into the ‘Greed’ zone. What does this mean for investors and traders navigating the volatile world of digital assets? Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a barometer designed to gauge the dominant emotion driving the market at any given time. Developed by Alternative.me, it aggregates data from various sources to produce a single score between 0 (Extreme Fear) and 100 (Extreme Greed). Think of it this way: when the market is experiencing ‘Extreme Fear’ (low scores), it often suggests that investors are overly worried, potentially leading to selling pressure. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes presented opportunities for those brave enough to buy when others are panicking. Conversely, when the index shows ‘Extreme Greed’ (high scores), it can signal that the market might be overheating, with investors potentially becoming overly optimistic and perhaps reckless, which could precede a correction. How is the Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on a single factor but is a composite score derived from six key market indicators. Understanding these components helps appreciate the depth of the sentiment analysis: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the past 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum (price changes) to average values. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment from social media posts (specifically Twitter) related to Bitcoin. A high number of posts with certain hashtags and high engagement can indicate rising greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users weekly to gather their sentiment. While currently paused, historically, these surveys contributed to the score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. Rising dominance can indicate fear (as investors move to perceived safer Bitcoin) or greed (as Bitcoin leads a rally). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might suggest fear, while searches for “buy crypto” could indicate greed. By combining these factors, the index provides a holistic view of the prevailing Crypto Market Sentiment . Entering the Greed Zone: What a Score of 59 Signifies As of May 6, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index climbed seven points to reach 59. This move is significant because it crosses the threshold from the ‘Neutral’ zone (40-59) into the ‘Greed’ zone (60-79). A score of 59 is right on the cusp, indicating that sentiment has improved considerably from previous days but is not yet in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory (80-100). Moving into the Greed Zone suggests that market participants are becoming more optimistic and confident. This can be driven by positive price action, favorable news, or increasing momentum. While not yet indicative of irrational exuberance, it signals a shift away from caution towards a more bullish outlook. Is This a Signal to Buy or Sell? This is the million-dollar question many ask when looking at the index. Traditionally, the index is viewed as a contrarian indicator: Extreme Fear (0-20): Often seen as a potential buying opportunity when others are panicking. Extreme Greed (80-100): Often seen as a potential selling opportunity when the market might be topping out. A score of 59, on the lower end of the Greed Zone , is less definitive than the extremes. It suggests improving sentiment, which can potentially support further price increases. However, it also means the market is no longer operating from a position of widespread fear, reducing the ‘blood in the streets’ buying opportunity. Using the Index in Your Crypto Trading Strategy Incorporating the Crypto Fear and Greed Index into your trading approach requires nuance. It should not be your sole decision-making tool but rather one indicator among many. Here’s how traders and investors often use it: As a Confirmation Tool: If other technical or fundamental indicators suggest a potential market turn or continuation, the index can provide sentiment confirmation. For example, if technical analysis shows a breakout and the index is moving from Fear to Neutral or Greed, it could add conviction to a bullish view. As a Contrarian Signal (Especially at Extremes): While 59 isn’t an extreme, recognizing the index moving towards Greed can prompt caution. If the index were to climb rapidly into the 80s or 90s, a contrarian trader might start considering reducing exposure or taking profits, anticipating a potential pullback driven by irrational exuberance. For Risk Management: As the index moves higher into the Greed zone, it’s a good reminder to review your risk management plan. Are you overexposed? Are your stop-losses set? Increased greed in the market can correlate with increased volatility and potential sharp reversals. For those focused on Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index specifically, remember that Bitcoin sentiment heavily influences the overall crypto index due to its market dominance. Therefore, movements in the main index often reflect sentiment specific to Bitcoin, which then cascades to the broader altcoin market. Navigating the Risks as Sentiment Shifts While moving into the Greed Zone might feel positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the associated risks. Greed can lead to irrational behavior, such as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), overleveraging, and ignoring fundamental warnings. When sentiment is predominantly greedy, the market can become more susceptible to sudden downturns. Positive news might have less impact as it’s already priced in, while negative news can trigger disproportionate selling as overly optimistic investors quickly reverse course. Therefore, even as the index rises, maintaining a disciplined Crypto Trading Strategy is paramount. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on rising sentiment. Stick to your pre-defined entry and exit criteria. Beyond the Index: Other Factors for a Complete Picture Relying solely on the Crypto Fear and Greed Index would be a mistake. A comprehensive market view requires considering multiple factors: Price Action and Technical Analysis: Chart patterns, support and resistance levels, moving averages, and volume analysis provide direct insights into market structure. Fundamental Analysis: Understanding the underlying technology, use cases, development teams, and adoption rates of specific cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and traditional market performance can all influence crypto. Regulatory News: Government regulations and announcements can have significant impacts on market sentiment and prices. On-Chain Analysis: Looking at data directly from the blockchain, such as transaction volumes, active addresses, and exchange flows. By combining the sentiment gauge from the index with these other analytical methods, you can build a more robust and informed Crypto Trading Strategy . Conclusion: A Signal for Caution and Opportunity The recent rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 59 and its entry into the ‘Greed’ zone is a notable development. It signals improving Crypto Market Sentiment and a potential shift away from cautious neutrality towards more optimistic behavior. While this could indicate potential for further upside, it also serves as a crucial reminder that market dynamics are changing. The ‘easy’ contrarian buys of extreme fear are behind us, and the risks associated with increased greed, such as potential overheating and sharper pullbacks, start to become more prominent. Use this signal wisely, integrate it with other analysis tools, and maintain discipline in your Crypto Trading Strategy to navigate the opportunities and challenges this new sentiment phase presents.

PEPE, the meme-fueled rocket, continues to surprise with its viral momentum and fast-growing community. XRP, with its $2+ price range and institutional backing, remains a cornerstone of long-term crypto plays, especially as regulatory pressure eases. But the wildcard is Mutuum Finance a DeFi newcomer priced at $0.025, yet projected by some analysts to deliver outsized returns. Its decentralized lending platform is already turning heads, attracting over 9,500 investors and raising more than $7.6 million in its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in Phase 5, a 20% increase, before its projected launch at $0.06. For Phase 4 participants, that could mean a 140% return on investment. For risk-tolerant investors, these three could turn a humble $100 into a five-figure win within 100 days. PEPE vs. XRP: Meme Coin madness vs. digital finance power PEPE, currently around $0.0000087, continues to capitalize on meme coin mania, fueled by viral trends and an ever-expanding online community. As it rides the waves of social media hype, it can deliver quick and massive gains for those willing to embrace its volatility. While PEPE brings excitement, XRP, trading around $2.20, takes a more established route with its focus on cross-border payments and growing institutional adoption. XRP’s utility and legal clarity are driving its steady rise, with analysts predicting long-term value growth as it becomes more integrated into global financial systems. Both coins offer unique opportunities, but as PEPE surges in unpredictable bursts, XRP remains a stable bet in the evolving crypto landscape. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly builds momentum as a new contender with aggressive growth potential. Presale momentum builds in Phase 4 The excitement around Mutuum Finance keeps building as its presale gains traction. Selling at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token has already attracted strong interest from more than 9,500 participants and continues to pull in capital, crossing the $7.6 million mark. With the next phase set to raise the token price by 20%, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. To further boost user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently rolled out a new dashboard that features a live leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those ranked in the top 50 will be eligible for bonus tokens, adding a gamified twist that not only incentivizes holding but also builds community loyalty and long-term participation. Reimagining DeFi lending with a hybrid model Mutuum Finance is breaking new ground in decentralized lending by combining the benefits of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models into a single, powerful hybrid framework. In the P2C model, users can earn passive income by staking stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-managed liquidity pools, while also enabling fast, permissionless borrowing for others. On the other side, the P2P option eliminates intermediaries altogether, letting borrowers and lenders negotiate directly and privately. This dual-model setup brings a higher level of decentralization, flexibility, and efficiency. Whether you’re a cautious investor looking for predictable returns or someone seeking more control and yield, Mutuum Finance offers a tailored solution that meets both ends of the risk spectrum. It’s a DeFi platform built for inclusivity and autonomy, two pillars the current financial system often lacks. PEPE, XRP, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining traction this altcoin season. PEPE thrives on meme power, XRP brings utility and stability, but MUTM, now at $0.025, offers serious breakout potential.

Turner, who has spent over 20 years at the IRS and most recently served as a senior adviser within the Digital Assets Office, will now head the unit, according to a report from Bloomberg Tax citing a person familiar with the situation. Her promotion marks a significant leadership transition at a time when US crypto tax enforcement is facing both internal and external pressures. On May 5, Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, two private-sector experts brought in to lead the IRS’s crypto unit, exited after roughly a year in their roles. Mukherjee served as compliance and implementation executive director, while Wilks oversaw strategy and development. Wilks announced his departure on LinkedIn, while Mukherjee confirmed his decision in a statement to Bloomberg Tax. “The reality is that federal employees have faced a very difficult environment over the past few months,” Wilks wrote. “If stepping aside helps preserve someone else’s job, then I am at peace with the decision.” Seth Wilks announced his departure on LinkedIn.

It also attempted to introduce broad crypto broker reporting requirements, which drew sharp criticism from industry stakeholders and was eventually overturned by President Donald Trump . Set to take effect in 2027, the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule would have expanded the tax authority’s existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms , requiring them to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions.

With the return of the Trump administration in January, federal agencies have scaled back regulations perceived as burdensome to digital asset innovation. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies. Additionally, the Department of Justice has announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit , signaling a softer approach to the sector. Internally, the IRS is also navigating instability. Over 23,000 employees have reportedly expressed interest in resigning after Trump reintroduced a deferred resignation policy, raising concerns about long-term staffing and morale within the agency.

On May 3, both House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 were “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration,” marking a clear end to the state’s legislative experiment with Bitcoin-backed public funds. Introduced in February, HB 487 proposed allowing Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to allocate up to 10% of certain state-held assets into Bitcoin . SB 550 echoed a similar intent, pushing for broader permission to invest public money in the digital asset. Crypto Reserve Hopes Fizzle Out in Florida Legislature But despite a legislative session that pushed through more than 230 bills—including ones banning fluoride in water, protecting parks, and limiting smartphone use in schools—Bitcoin didn’t make the cut. Though lawmakers extended their session to June 6 to finalize budget talks, the crypto bills weren’t part of the conversation. Their quiet removal from the docket suggests not just a loss of momentum, but a broader reluctance to wade into the volatile waters of digital assets at the state level. Florida now joins a growing list of U.S. states—including Wyoming, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, North Dakota, and Oklahoma—that have seen their own Bitcoin reserve efforts falter in recent months. While the legislative appetite for Bitcoin-based treasuries once looked promising, the tide has clearly shifted. A Growing List of State-Level Bitcoin Bill Failures Much of that shift can be attributed to growing regulatory uncertainty and political caution. Just days before Florida’s bills were pulled, Arizona’s ambitious Bitcoin reserve bill, HB 1025, was vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs, who dismissed digital assets as “untested investments.” The move drew strong backlash from crypto proponents like Anthony Pompliano, who criticized the governor’s decision as short-sighted and uninformed. Still, Arizona remains in the game . Two other bills—HB 2749, which offers a budget-neutral reserve strategy funded by unclaimed property profits, and SB 1373, which proposes a 10% cap on digital asset investments—are still on the table and could make Arizona the first state to hold Bitcoin in its treasury.

KuCoin Releases 30th Proof of Reserve Report, Shows Full Asset Backing and Overcollateralization The latest statement confirms that the platform’s major digital assets are fully backed and, in many cases, overcollateralized. As of the last audit, KuCoin's reserves were reported as follows: Bitcoin (BTC): 10,306.78 BTC, 106% supported Ethereum (ETH): 168,779.13 ETH, supported by 116% Tether (USDT): $1.34 billion, 114% supported USD Coin (USDC): $93.4 million, 109% supported The company said the report was independently verified and aligned with its mission to maintain high standards of asset safety and operational integrity. Proof of Reserve reports have become a key measure of trust for centralized exchanges, especially following the industry’s call for greater financial accountability. KuCoin’s consistent monthly reporting places it among the few exchanges that maintain a long-term public commitment to asset transparency. The report comes amid broader scrutiny across the digital asset sector as both regulators and users increasingly demand verifiable proof of solvency from custody platforms. *This is not investment advice.

A key metric—the Coinbase Premium Gap—has turned negative, signaling growing selling pressure from U.S Bitcoin whales. While this indicator had improved recently, it’s now dropping again, aligning closely with Bitcoin’s price correction. So, is more downside ahead? Coinbase Premium Gap Seeing a Dip According to Abram Chart, a verified on-chain analyst at CryptoQuant, a key metric called the Coinbase Premium Gap is showing that BTC is trading at lower prices on Coinbase, a U.S.-based exchange, compared to other global exchanges. Read more https://t.co/xiFc9a4VIF — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) May 6, 2025 When this happens, it usually indicates that U.S. traders are selling more than they are buying, which can result in a price drop. At present, the Coinbase Premium Gap stands at -5.07. However, this aligns with the recent correction in Bitcoin’s price, which pushes back bitcoin from a high of $97,865 to $94,162 , suggesting that U.S. selling pressure could be contributing to the downturn. Why Does It Matter? The Coinbase Premium Gap is an important tool to track investor sentiment. The chart from Abram shows that the premium, which had gone up recently, is now going down again. If the gap stays negative, Bitcoin may keep dropping. But if the premium goes positive again, it could mean U.S. buyers are coming back, which might help the price go up. Institutions Keep Buying Despite Whale Selloff Even though the data suggests that U.S. whales might be selling, big institutions and corporate Bitcoin holders are buying more. Bitcoin ETFs have recently seen strong inflows. According to Farside Investors, Bitcoin ETF net inflows reached $425.5 million on May 5, 2025, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF leading the way, pulling in $531.2 million. At the same time, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, announced a new purchase . The company bought 1,895 BTC for $180.3 million at an average price of $95,167 per Bitcoin on 5th May.

For many miners, even though they are using highly efficient mining equipment, the instability of market prices can still have a significant impact on their profits. In this context, how to ensure a stable income has become a core issue for miners. ViaBTC provides effective risk management and liquidity solutions for miners through two innovative financial tools—Hedging Service and Crypto Loan. These tools offer unique advantages in helping miners cope with market fluctuations, lock in profits, and maintain liquidity. This article will introduce these tools and analyze how they help miners secure their profits during market volatility. Hedging Service: A Strategy to Lock in Profits in Advance The operation of the Hedging Service is relatively simple. It is an effective way to hedge against market price fluctuations by locking in profits in advance. When the market is at a high point, miners often worry that prices will drop, which could negatively affect mining profits. The Hedging Service provided by ViaBTC is essentially a profit insurance. Miners can borrow cryptocurrency and sell it at the current market price, locking in profits for a future period. This approach prevents potential losses from price volatility. Afterward, miners continue mining in the pool, using the Bitcoin they earn to repay the borrowed coins, ultimately achieving stable profits. For example, when Bitcoin reaches a high price of $100,000, experienced miner Alice sees her account steadily producing 0.1 BTC per day, but she is filled with anxiety. Based on her years of mining experience, she believes this price might be a temporary high, and a correction could happen in the next six months. If she continues to mine and sell in the traditional way, her actual profits will shrink drastically if the price drops. At this point, Alice uses ViaBTC’s Hedging Service: the platform estimates her output over the next 180 days will be 18 BTC. With only 3 BTC as collateral, she immediately gains $1.8 million in stable funds. Over the next six months, the 0.1 BTC she mined each day will automatically repay the loan, while releasing an equivalent of 10,000 USDT to her available account. 180 days later, the market confirms Alice’s prediction. When the price drops to $80,000, the 18 BTC would only be worth $1.44 million under the traditional approach. However, by locking in profits in advance, she successfully maintains the $1.8 million in earnings, effectively making an additional $360,000 even as the price drops. This method of locking in profits ahead of time essentially uses financial tools to cash out future earnings at an ideal price, building a buffer for miners against a bear market. The advantage of the Hedging Service is that it helps miners secure future profits during market fluctuations. This way, miners not only avoid losses caused by price declines but also generate stable profits, allowing them to focus on mining without constantly worrying about market price volatility. Crypto Loan: Retaining the Upside and Flexibly Managing Liquidity In addition to preventing losses caused by price declines, miners may also face short-term cash flow issues. In many cases, miners may want to hold onto large amounts of cryptocurrency and believe in the long-term price appreciation potential. However, they may urgently need funds for electricity bills or mining machine maintenance. This is where the Crypto Loan service becomes especially important. Unlike Hedging, Crypto Loan is a flexible financial tool for miners who are optimistic about future price trends. By using this service, miners can avoid selling assets due to financial needs, thus preserving the appreciation potential of their holdings. In contrast to Alice, miner Bob firmly believes that Bitcoin is still undervalued. When he urgently needs $600,000 to maintain his mining farm, he is caught in a dilemma with his 10 BTC. Selling them now for $1 million might cause him to miss out on future gains, but his electricity bill and other expenses are already pressing. At this moment, ViaBTC’s Crypto Loan tool becomes the solution. Bob pledges his 10 BTC to ViaBTC and immediately receives $600,000 in working capital. After 30 days, the price of Bitcoin soars to $120,000, making his 10 BTC worth $1.2 million. He only needs to repay the loan and can reclaim his entire pledged asset. Compared to the traditional method of selling BTC to cash out, this approach not only solves his immediate problem but also allows him to enjoy an additional $200,000 in appreciation. The advantage of Crypto Loan is that it allows miners to have the best of both worlds: they can retain ownership of their cryptocurrency assets while also accessing liquidity support when needed. For miners who need ongoing operational funds, it’s like having an “crypto credit account”—they don’t have to sell their Bitcoin at a loss, while ensuring their mining operations run smoothly. A Dual Approach to Safeguarding Miners’ Earnings For miners, the risks posed by market uncertainty cannot be ignored. By combining the use of Hedging Service and Crypto Loan , miners can respond flexibly to different market conditions. When they anticipate a market downturn, Hedging helps lock in existing profits; when they are optimistic about long-term value, Crypto Loan ensures operations continue without missing out on potential gains. Though these two tools may seem to have opposite objectives, together they form a complete risk management matrix that breaks free from the rigid constraints of traditional finance. For example, a miner could start using the Hedging Service to lock in next year’s mining profits during the early stages of a bear market in late 2021. In 2024, they might use Crypto Loan to obtain funds for upgrading their mining machines and increasing hash rate, thus gaining more mining profits when Bitcoin reaches a higher price. This “preserve profits during downturns, increase investments during upturns” strategy has allowed some miners to achieve growth even during industry reshuffles. With the continuous development of the mining industry, the core competitiveness of miners is shifting from merely competing on hash power to having comprehensive risk management capabilities. ViaBTC provides not just two financial tools, but a survival philosophy for managing market cycles: while others passively bear losses during price fluctuations, financial derivatives can help miners build a safety net for their earnings. In an environment where uncertainty is the norm, miners can not only find stable income pathways amid market fluctuations but also flexibly seize market opportunities for higher profits by utilizing ViaBTC’s two financial tools. Therefore, in facing future market challenges, miners should strategically leverage these innovative tools to ensure their long-term profits and stable mining development.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-06 09:56:26

In preparation for a bigger drop, it is up today as it recovers from last weekend’s drop. Following a back-to-back drop since the start of the year, last month saw SUI bounce, and the price increased significantly following a major recovery that hit the entire crypto market. It eventually lost steam after witnessing multiple rejections under the $4 level in the late month. That led to a drop, and it started this month on a weak note. Testing the $3.15 level yesterday, it found support and briefly recovered to where it is changing hands at $3.38. From a technical perspective, the latest recovery looks more like a retest of the lost $3.5 level over the weekend. We can expect more drops as soon as the price retests this mentioned lost level. Though a rebound is possible if the recently flipped resistance levels hold as support. A dip below April’s low of $1.7 could trigger a serious bloodbath, validating a bearish expansion in the mid-term. However, if by any chance the market continues to recover, especially above April’s high, we can anticipate more gains in the future. But from the look of things, the bears will likely have the upper hand. SUI Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating a drop, the support levels to keep in mind are $2.83 and $2.42. Lower levels for drops are located at $2.02 and $1.71. A collapse through these levels could send the price to a new multi-month low. For more recovery, SUI must overcome $3.8. If it succeeds, the higher resistance levels to watch for a test would be $4.25, along with the $5 level in the future.

In addition, a recently spotted bullish moving average convergence/divergence cross could signal the start of a rally to $150,000 . Moreover, the proportion of BTC being held at a loss has shrunk significantly — a fact that serves to further weaken sell pressure. Lastly, institutional investors remain quite bullish — Standard Chartered is now forecasting that the digital asset could reach a price of $200,000 by the end of the year, which would equate to a 112.22% rally.

Grab, which is known for its taxi services in southeast Asia but also crowdsources mapping data for its technological mapping arm, will be using its collaboration with NATIX to expand its footprint into the U.S. and Europe. The partnership consists of the NATIX team using Grab’s hardware and software technologies for mapmaking. “We take care of the data collection side, and we essentially monetize this together,” said Alireza Ghods, the co-founder of NATIX to CoinDesk in an interview. “They're buying the data that we generate to build their pipeline for the U.S. and for Europe. And on the other side, they're giving us both their hardware technology as well as the AI technology that basically analyzes the images to build maps and map services like navigation.” “We’re starting in the markets of the EU and US, where [Grab] is not present. So this is us combined with Grab, going for global expansion,” Ghods added. DePIN is a blockchain-based system that crowdsources real-world infrastructure, like data collection, and verifies them through decentralized technologies. DePIN projects often appear in the Solana ecosystem thanks to the blockchain’s fast transaction speeds and low transaction costs. NATIX is a project within Solana’s DePIN ecosystem that enables users to contribute street data and mapping visuals via smartphones. The crowdsourced data is then used to build decentralized maps, which can be leveraged by AI models, especially for autonomous driving and smart city applications. Users are also rewarded NATIX’s native token, $NATIX, for their contributions as a way to incentivize them to participate in the network. “The reason that we actually did the collaboration is due to the power of DePIN combined with a very well established enterprise grade technology, "" said Ghods. “I think it's one of the few sectors in crypto that really, really makes sense.” Read more: DePIN 2.0: What the Next Generation of DePINs Is Doing Differently",Tech|Solana|DePIN|grab|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-06 10:00:00

The new company, helmed by Anthony DeMartino, co-founder of Trident and former head of risk strategies at Coinbase (COIN), is also on track to close a $25 million founding round with New Form Capital leading the investment. Ripple, Tribe Capital, UDHC, Joint Effects also participated in the fundraising round, with further backing from strategic ecosystem investors including Curved Ventures, Flare and Bankai Ventures. While most investors have already closed the investment, two firms will close the process by June, the company told CoinDesk. The merger comes at a time when DeFi is maturing from its ""wild west"" beginnings into a blockchain-based financial economy with offerings increasingly catered towards sophisticated investors. It also underscores the ongoing trend of consolidation within the crypto industry. There were 88 mergers and acquisitions in the first four months of 2025, according to Architect Partners, putting this year on track to surpass the record years of 2022 and 2024. Sentora combines IntoTheBlock’s track record in DeFi analytics—spanning over $3 billion in institutional deployments—with Trident’s experience structuring liquidity programs and financial products. The platform aims to provide a one-stop shop for institutional investors, offering yield strategies, compliance, risk management and access to structured products all under one hood. ""The vision is to build all the core primitives that are needed for any institution whether it's a crypto institution, DAO foundation, traditional finance investor or individual family office, to interact with DeFi in a way that feels intelligent, that feels safe, that feels secure,"" Jesus Rodriguez, co-founder of IntoTheBlock and now CTO of Sentora, said in an interview with CoinDesk. A key roadblock that has hindered asset managers entering DeFi at scale is that the space is getting increasingly complex and fragmented across new chains and protocols, DeMartino explained. ""It shouldn't be this hard,"" he said. ""You shouldn't have to learn about a new chain and learn about a whole bunch of different protocols and understand bridging and different wallets every time you want to go to a new chain."" What can help bridge this gap and attract even traditional finance firms on-chain, according to DeMartino, is to abstract away from interacting with individual protocols with a single platform that handles all the risk management and liquidity, while keeping transparency about the underlying plumbing. ""DeFi rails are the future of finance, but it's still a very small market,"" he said. DefiLlama data shows that there are less than $130 billion of assets on DeFi protocols, dwarfed by the the multiple trillions of assets under management at the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity Investments. ""We're building the rails for the next 130 trillion of assets to come onchain,"" he said.

33767162,[object Object],1746525600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Strategy Starts May With $180 Million Bitcoin Purchase—Will Larger Buys Follow?,https://bitcoinist.com/strategy-may-180-million-bitcoin-purchase-buys/,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy has announced a new Bitcoin purchase to start off May. Here’s how the rest of the month could go, based on past pattern. Strategy Has Just Added 1,895 BTC To Its Bitcoin Stack In a new post on X, Strategy chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor has announced the latest Bitcoin purchase by the company. According to the filing with the SEC, Strategy acquired a total of 1,895 BTC at an average price of $95,167 between April 28th and May 4th. With this $180.3 million purchase, the combined BTC holdings of the firm have risen to 555,450 BTC. In total, the company spent $38.08 billion to acquire this stack. During the last few months, Strategy has been active with their Bitcoin buying and CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has noticed an interesting pattern related to these purchases. Below is the chart that the analyst has shared. “The first MicroStrategy purchase of the month is always the smallest. It build up as the month progresses,” notes the analyst. The latest 1,895 BTC acquisition happens to be the first one for the month of May. As such, it’s possible that later buys in this month, if any, would involve a larger amount than this, if the pattern is anything to go by. The Bitcoin reserve of the company currently has its cost basis at around $68,550, so at the latest exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, it would be sitting on a profit of about 38%. So far, it would appear the bet of Saylor’s firm is working out. In some other news, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has shared how BTC is currently looking from the lens of the Composite Volatility Index devised by the analyst. “Analysis of Bitcoin address activity, which underpins the Composite Volatility Index and its 30-day change, allows us to identify market macro phases,” notes Adler Jr. Here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analyst, which shows the trend in its daily value and 30-day change over the last few years: According to Adler Jr, the 30-day change in the Bitcoin Compositive Volatility Index being below the 0% mark suggests an accumulation phase from the investors. Similarly, it being above 15% indicates a distribution or panic-selling phase. From the above graph, it’s apparent that the 30-day change in the indicator has assumed a negative value recently. At present, it’s sitting at -3.5%. Therefore, from the perspective of this indicator at least, the investors are accumulating. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a pullback to levels below $94,000 earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has found a rebound as its price is now back at $94,800.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin accumulation|Bitcoin pURCHASE|btc|BTCUSDT|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-06 10:00:00
44228867,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157541,1746525607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent: US Stablecoin Regulation Faces Critical Democratic Pushback Over Regulatory Gaps and Trump Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/democrats-stablecoin-bill/,"The path forward for US stablecoin regulation just hit a significant hurdle. Nine Senate Democrats have reportedly expressed strong reservations about the current draft of key legislation, potentially slowing down crucial progress in the digital asset space. If you’re following the world of cryptocurrencies and how governments are trying to bring clarity to this evolving market, this development is something you need to understand. Why Are Democrats Concerned About the Stablecoin Bill? According to recent reports, a group of nine Senate Democrats, including Arizona’s Senator Ruben Gallego, have stated they cannot support the current version of the proposed stablecoin legislation. The bill in question is formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025, or the GENIUS Act . While these lawmakers acknowledge the critical need for bipartisan regulation of stablecoins, their statement highlights several key areas where they believe the bill falls short. These unresolved issues raise red flags regarding the safety and integrity of the financial system: Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Concerns exist that the current bill may not have sufficiently robust provisions to prevent stablecoins from being used for illicit financial activities. Foreign Issuers: There are questions about how the legislation would effectively regulate stablecoins issued by entities based outside the United States, potentially creating loopholes. National Security: The potential risks stablecoins could pose to national security if not properly overseen are a significant point of concern. Financial System Integrity: Lawmakers are focused on ensuring that stablecoins do not introduce systemic risks that could destabilize the broader U.S. financial system. These points suggest the Democrats are pushing for a more comprehensive and stringent regulatory framework than what the current stablecoin bill may offer. How Do Trump’s Crypto Ties Impact Crypto Regulation US? Adding complexity to the legislative landscape are recent developments involving former President Donald Trump and his connections to the crypto world. Reports suggest these ties may be influencing the hesitancy among some Democrats regarding the Democrats stablecoin stance and the bill’s progress. Two specific instances have drawn attention: Memecoin Dinner: President Trump reportedly planned a dinner for top holders of his namesake memecoin, TRUMP. USD1 Stablecoin: Reports indicate that Abu Dhabi-based MGX plans to utilize a Trump-backed stablecoin, USD1, in a significant investment via the Binance exchange. USA Today reported that both of these moves could potentially result in substantial personal financial benefits for Mr. Trump, potentially totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. While the direct link to the stablecoin bill negotiations isn’t explicitly stated by the Democrats, one source told CoinDesk that there is indeed concern that Trump’s growing involvement and potential financial interest in crypto could become a political obstacle, potentially stalling progress on this specific bill and even derailing broader crypto regulation US efforts. What Are the Potential Consequences of This Standoff? This Democratic pushback on the GENIUS Act introduces significant uncertainty. Here are some potential outcomes: Delayed Legislation: The most immediate impact could be a delay in passing the stablecoin bill. Without bipartisan support, getting the necessary votes in the Senate becomes much harder. Stalled Broader Crypto Reform: As the source mentioned, the stablecoin bill is often seen as a potential stepping stone or even a prerequisite for broader market structure legislation concerning other digital assets. A failure here could ripple out, delaying clarity for the entire crypto industry in the U.S. Continued Uncertainty: For businesses and consumers using or looking to use stablecoins, the lack of clear federal regulation means continued uncertainty regarding their legal status, consumer protection, and stability. Innovation Risk: While regulation is needed, excessive delays or overly burdensome rules could potentially stifle innovation in the U.S. stablecoin market, pushing development and adoption overseas. This situation highlights the complex interplay between technological innovation, financial regulation, and political dynamics in Washington D.C. Looking Ahead: Can a Compromise Be Reached? The statement from the nine Democrats doesn’t necessarily kill the stablecoin bill entirely, but it signals that significant changes or clarifications are needed to gain their support. For the bill to move forward, proponents will likely need to address the specific regulatory gaps raised concerning AML, foreign issuers, national security, and financial integrity. The political element introduced by concerns over Trump’s crypto ties adds another layer of complexity that will need careful navigation. Reaching a bipartisan agreement on US stablecoin regulation is crucial for providing clarity and fostering responsible innovation in the digital asset space. The coming weeks and months will be critical in determining whether lawmakers can bridge their differences and pass meaningful legislation. Conclusion The current standoff over the GENIUS Act underscores the challenges facing crypto regulation US . Nine Senate Democrats have voiced significant concerns, primarily focused on regulatory gaps within the bill and potentially influenced by recent events linking Donald Trump to the crypto market. This pushback threatens to delay or derail critical legislation aimed at establishing clear rules for stablecoins in the United States. The path to comprehensive US stablecoin regulation remains complex, requiring lawmakers to find common ground on key issues to ensure both financial stability and continued innovation in the digital asset landscape.

Web3 ai, AVAX, ADA, and HBAR Are Positioned to Lead the Next Crypto Wave in 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/which-altcoin-to-buy-web3-ai-avax-ada-and-hbar-are-positioned-to-lead-the-next-crypto-wave-in-2025/,"The crypto market is lighting up again in 2025, and savvy investors know this is not just about chasing trends. The real question now is which altcoin to buy that offers genuine staying power. In a space where short-lived hype fades quickly, success increasingly depends on real utility, technical strength, and growing adoption. This year, four projects are emerging with serious momentum. Web3 ai is drawing attention with its AI-powered trading suite and impressive presale potential. Avalanche (AVAX) is surging on bullish technical patterns and whale accumulation. Cardano (ADA) is breaking resistance with strong fundamentals and growing community interest. Hedera (HBAR), meanwhile, is quietly advancing with institutional partnerships and technical validation. These tokens are not just trending. They are creating meaningful waves. Let’s explore why they are becoming the clear answers to which altcoin to buy as 2025 unfolds. Web3 ai ($WAI): The $0.0003 Altcoin Positioned to Dominate in 2025 Web3 ai is capturing the attention of forward-thinking investors for good reason. Unlike many early-stage projects still in development, Web3 ai has a full suite of twelve AI-driven trading tools already built and ready to go live with the token’s launch. These include advanced analytics, predictive models, automated signal generation, and powerful fraud detection systems. At the core of Web3 ai’s offering is its AI Trading Assistant. This innovative tool is designed to help traders simplify their decision-making process. Instead of analyzing countless charts and interpreting multiple indicators, users can rely on AI to deliver real-time buy and sell signals. This assistant blends technical data, market trends, and social sentiment to generate clear and actionable recommendations. Web3 ai’s $WAI token is currently in Stage 1 of its ai crypto presale, priced at just $0.0003. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242, early buyers are eyeing a potential 1,747% ROI. As traders increasingly adopt AI to sharpen their edge, Web3 ai is positioned as a leader. For those searching for which altcoin to buy that combines innovation with practical use, Web3 ai looks ready to deliver in 2025. Avalanche (AVAX): Bullish Momentum & Whale Action Avalanche (AVAX) continues to gain momentum as it breaks key resistance levels. The token has risen more than 10%, trading near $22.56 as of late April 2025. After clearing resistance at $21.71, AVAX is now aiming for higher levels, with $25.15 in sight and analysts expecting $24.80 by month-end if momentum continues. What makes AVAX particularly promising is the support from large holders. Whales have been steadily accumulating the token, a sign that institutional and deep-pocketed investors are betting on its future. Beyond the charts, Avalanche is expanding its utility through improved payment infrastructure and deeper DeFi integrations. This growing ecosystem strengthens its long-term appeal. For those asking which altcoin to buy for solid technical setups backed by increasing adoption, Avalanche stands out with confidence. Cardano (ADA): Breakout Patterns and Expanding Ecosystem Signal Strong Upside Cardano (ADA) has reentered the spotlight after a significant breakout. Recently, ADA surged to $0.69 after pushing past a symmetrical triangle pattern. This move coincided with Bitcoin’s rally past $93,500, which added momentum across the altcoin space. Cardano, however, is showing particular strength. Large holders are also joining the trend. Whale wallets have increased their ADA holdings, often a precursor to long-term market moves. Technically, ADA faces little resistance until $0.80, and analysts see potential for higher gains. Some projections even target $7 based on historic bull market trends. As its developer community grows and DeFi adoption expands, Cardano is regaining relevance. For investors weighing which altcoin to buy that offers strong technical and fundamental alignment, ADA is once again a serious contender. Hedera (HBAR): Steady Climb Backed by Institutions and Positive Technicals Hedera (HBAR) is quietly building momentum in 2025. Trading at $0.1835 after a 6% increase, HBAR’s bullish signals are clear. Indicators such as the Directional Movement Index, Ichimoku Cloud, and ADX all suggest strengthening trend conditions. A break above the 0.382 Fibonacci level could quickly take HBAR toward $0.25 and potentially $0.2586. What makes Hedera especially promising is its deep ties to enterprise users. Major partnerships with companies like IBM, Google, and Dell give its network unmatched credibility. As more corporate projects turn to Hedera’s fast and secure consensus model, its fundamental strength grows. HBAR’s steady rise, combined with institutional backin,g makes it a standout for anyone considering which altcoin to buy based on enterprise adoption and technical growth. Key Takeaways The difference between short-term speculation and lasting value has never been clearer. In 2025, smart investors are shifting focus from hype to substance. Web3 ai is offering real AI-powered trading tools with an early-stage advantage, positioning it as a serious future market leader. Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining trust with clear bullish breakouts and whale support. Cardano (ADA) is reclaiming its position with strong price action and expanding network development. Hedera (HBAR) is making quiet but important progress with enterprise use cases and solid technical backing. Each of these altcoins delivers real utility and momentum. For anyone wondering which altcoin to buy in 2025 , these projects offer powerful reasons to pay attention now rather than later. Waiting too long could mean watching them lead the next wave of crypto growth without you on board. The post Which Altcoin to Buy?

This resulted in a hacker posting a fake contract and soliciting $45,000 from users. Despite quick action to regain control, the hacker continued posing as Tron online. Curve Finance also suffered an X account breach, with a scammer promoting a fake CRV airdrop and blocking users who tried to raise the alarm. Most recently, the verified X account of the New York Post was compromised and used to privately message crypto figures, posing as journalists to lure victims into Telegram or Zoom-based scams. Tron DAO X Account Hacked A wave of social media account takeovers is once again plaguing the cryptocurrency industry, and the Tron DAO and Curve Finance became the latest victims. On May 2, the official X account of Tron DAO was compromised . The hacker reportedly solicited approximately $45,000 from unsuspecting users by posting a fake contract address and sending direct messages offering promotional opportunities in exchange for payments. According to Tron’s public relations team, their security team quickly regained control of the account, and it is believed that the breach stemmed from a malicious social engineering attack targeting a team member. Despite recovering access, the attacker continued trying to engage others by falsely offering paid posts from Tron DAO’s main account. The team is working with law enforcement to investigate the incident. Tron founder Justin Sun initially accused crypto exchange OKX of failing to freeze funds linked to the hack, though the post making that claim was later deleted after a denial by OKX CEO Star Xu. Curve Finance also experienced a takeover of its X account. On May 5, a scammer used the account to promote a fake CRV airdrop, which prompted concern among users. Founder Michael Egorov confirmed the account was silently compromised but not the underlying client devices or systems. The Curve team, with assistance from cybersecurity firm SEAL, eventually regained access . During the attack, the hacker not only shared malicious links but also blocked users who tried to warn others about the breach. These incidents only add to a growing list of high-profile X account hacks. In April last year, UK Member of Parliament Lucy Powell’s account was hijacked to promote a scam token, House of Commons Coin (HOC). In March, Kaito AI and its founder Yu Hu saw their accounts misused to spread false claims of compromised wallets. And in February, Pump.fun’s account was taken over to promote fraudulent tokens, including a fake governance token. Tron Closes in on Ethereum Despite its recent social media account hack, Tron’s momentum is still building. In fact, the Tron network is rapidly closing the gap with Ethereum in terms of Tether (USDT) circulation after another major mint by the stablecoin issuer. On May 5, Tether issued $1 billion worth of USDT on Tron, which pushed the network’s total USDT supply to $71.4 billion. This places Tron just $1.4 billion behind Ethereum’s $72.8 billion in USDT, according to Tether’s Transparency report and data from Arkham Intelligence . Tron previously led Ethereum in USDT circulation between July of 2022 and November of 2024, but an $18 billion Ethereum mint reversed the standings. Solana ranks third among USDT-supporting networks, hosting $1.9 billion, while smaller amounts circulate on Ton, Avalanche, Aptos, Near, Celo, and Cosmos. Overall, Tether’s total USDT supply reached an all-time high of $149.4 billion, up 8.6% since the beginning of the year. This growth reinforces Tether’s dominant 61% market share in the stablecoin sector, according to CoinGecko , while rival Circle holds a 25% share with $62 billion in USDC. The broader stablecoin market has seen a sharp resurgence over the past six months and now comprises 8% of the entire crypto market capitalization. Looking ahead, the United States Treasury Department projected the stablecoin market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028 if a regulatory framework is established. Current state of the stablecoin market (Source: United States Treasury Department ) Two key legislative proposals—the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act—are currently making their way through Congress. The GENIUS Act will define payment stablecoins and set reserve requirements, while the STABLE Act would regulate nonbank stablecoin issuers. The Senate is expected to vote on the GENIUS Act before May 26. Tether is also preparing to launch a new US-based stablecoin later this year. For now, its release is contingent on the passage of regulatory legislation. New York Post X Account Also Compromised In addition to Tron’s DAO account, the New York Post’s verified X account was also compromised in a sophisticated scam targeting members of the crypto community. Multiple users, including well-known people in the space, reported receiving direct messages from the account inviting them to participate in a podcast interview and urging them to continue the conversation via Telegram. The suspicious activity was first flagged on May 3 by Alex Katz, CEO of Kerberus, who shared a screenshot of the deceptive message, allegedly sent by journalist Paul Sperry through the official New York Post account. What makes this incident so interesting is the attacker’s strategy: instead of posting publicly visible scam links, like a wallet drainer or a Pump.fun address, the bad actor focused entirely on direct communication. This more subtle approach may have been done to delay detection and exploit users' trust in the verified media outlet. Cybersecurity engineer and NFT collector known as “Drew” shared that the attacker blocked recipients after sending the message, likely to prevent the actual New York Post team from being alerted. Donny Clutterbuck from NFT Bitcoin’s ordinals platform Fomojis also reported being contacted by the hacker. He raised concerns that the scam may involve a Zoom exploit. According to Clutterbuck, clicking to enable audio during a Zoom call prompted an unusual pop-up with an option to “enable WiFi,” which he speculated might give the attacker unauthorized network access. Blockchain analyst ZachXBT compared the method that was used in this hack to a similar compromise of The Defiant’s X account several weeks ago, where scammers also leveraged direct messages to lure crypto users. This incident now adds to the growing concerns about the security of social media accounts and communication platforms used by high-profile organizations and people in the crypto sector. In April, Emblem Vault CEO Jake Gallen reportedly lost $100,000 in crypto during a Zoom interview in which malware was installed on his device.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|ORDI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-06 10:02:00

This time, four names are rising to the top of investor radars: MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP . With sentiment shifting and the market heating up, early entries into these assets could deliver transformational upside. But windows like this rarely stay open for long. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Accelerating With Real-World Traction Momentum doesn’t start with hype—it starts with proof. And MAGACOINFINANCE is stacking real progress fast: rising wallet activity, consistent roadmap progress, and community growth that’s authentic and investor-driven. There’s no flash, no gimmicks—just measured growth and recognition from those who’ve seen breakout cycles before. If early signs hold, MAGACOINFINANCE may soon move from quietly building to dominating headlines. Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP Continue to Lead the Charge Bitcoin (BTC) still serves as crypto’s core anchor, and ETF tailwinds are giving it new exposure. Solana (SOL) is pushing deeper into real-world applications—from tokenization to NFTs—with growing developer support and high-speed architecture. XRP is finally operating without legal overhang, expanding into financial markets with renewed energy and momentum. These giants offer proven resilience—but for investors seeking asymmetrical opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the center of the early-stage conversation. More Movers to Watch: Polygon, Kaspa, and Others Polygon continues to lead Ethereum’s scaling frontier, onboarding major brands and scaling dApps with ease. Kaspa is gaining a loyal following for its efficient proof-of-work design and unique DAG structure—solving speed and scale simultaneously. These are meaningful ecosystem players—but they’ve largely passed their early discovery windows. MAGACOINFINANCE , in contrast, is still in its prime entry phase. Summary The next wave of crypto wealth will come from those who are positioned ahead of the headlines. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP remain pillars—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the overlooked asset setting up for the kind of 60,000+% run that changes everything. If you’re watching the market, don’t wait for confirmation. Look for momentum. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing all the right signals.

In recent trading, XRP has abandoned its brief upswing, which took it to $2.29 in the final days of April, and has developed a relatively decisive downtrend since. Will XRP continue plunging? Considering that the token is changing hands below its previous nearest support level of $2.10, there is reason to believe it could soon plunge further, possibly to its next foothold at about $2.09. XRP one-month price chart. Source: Finbold Should the native asset to the XRP ledger fall to the low and break below it, its next opportunity to regain stability could be as distant as $2.05. On the flip side, and possibly signaling a bullish correction, XRP already tested the $2.09 level early on May 6 and bounced higher. However, a larger rally remains distant as the nearest resistance is at a lofty $2.18. The wisdom of the drop in the prevalence of bearish bets can be seen in the fact that the token’s relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 47.85. This demonstrates that the cryptocurrency is neither particularly overbought nor oversold and hinting that it could soon end the downturn and find some stability at its current, admittedly depressed, price.

Besides, the trading volume has surged above $20 billion after plunging close to $15 billion. This suggests a notable rise in the trading activity as the whales and the institutional interest in the token have increased. However, the BTC price has broken down from a pattern, which suggests a steep upswing could follow after a decent pullback. The institutional interest in the token has increased yet again as the markets recovered from the Liberation Day shocks. With this, the spot ETF inflows record more than a week of inflows, with BlackRock leading the accumulation. In the past week, BlackRock bought $2.5 billion worth of BTC and accumulated over 41,452 BTC in the past couple of weeks. While institutions are buying, whales are offloading BTC. As per the Santiment data shared by an analyst, Ali, the wallets with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC tokens have dropped from 4.56 million to 4.52 million in the past 10 days. Specifically, the U.S. whales are selling as the Coinbase premium, which had recovered significantly, is now dropping again. Besides, the Bitcoin balance on Binance has also dropped in the past couple of weeks and has reached a multi-year low, flashing the possibility of a supply shock incoming. The BTC price is looking pretty weak after the recent rejection and needs to reclaim the local highs for a bullish continuation. However, a small pullback appears to be in line before the next price action. The daily chart of BTC shows that the price has broken from a rising wedge after reaching the apex of the consolidation. Although the MACD shows an increase in the selling pressure, the rise in the CMF levels suggests a notable rise in the money flow. Hence, after experiencing a small pullback below $92,000, a rise to $100K appears to be inevitable. However, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is believed to maintain a healthy upswing thereafter and form new highs.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 10:07:13

It currently appears bullish on the daily scale and seems ready to print a new high following a fresh surge in volatility. As the crypto market takes a little downturn in the past few days, Form remains bullish and continues to display strength on the daily chart. The bullish move, which started after months of correcting to a low of $0.135 in February, looks set to expand to a new high. This latest buy signal came after witnessing a serious contraction throughout April. Earlier today, the price got rejected after almost breaking out of a key resistance level of $2.66 – marked as all-time high. A successful flip through this resistance level could rocket the price to a new high. If the rejection triggers a drop, we may see a serious crackdown in the next few days following a double-top formation on the daily timeframe. However, looking back from where it bounced back in February, Form has seen over 15x gains to where it is changing hands, and from the look of things, it has shown no signs of slowing down at the time of writing. Form’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A breakout of the important $2.66 resistance level should trigger a surge to a new all-time high of $3 and potentially $4. Higher price levels to consider for test would be $7 and $10 in the far term. The current bullish signal is supported by the $1.83 level. A sudden drop off this level should confirm a bearish double-top pattern to $1.3. Losing grip above $1 could roll the price back to the $0.81 support.

The narrative driving Bitcoin’s price is anchored to the process of regulation and institutionalization, which began with ETFs and is now potentially continuing with Bitcoin as a strategic national reserve. The concept of ""strengthening american leadership in digital financial technology"" is fueling rumors that shouldn’t be ignored, and on which the market seems to be building a bullish outlook. On a practical level, the inverse correlation with the dollar and the potential beginning of one with gold support this narrative. It remains important, in my view, not to base the investment on rumors, given the high political uncertainty, but to maintain an adaptive approach. When I first approached Bitcoin back in 2014, I never imagined that less than ten years later it would be possible to buy it through funds like IBIT. And yet here we are, what once seemed impossible has become reality. I begin this research with that thought, because I believe it highlights how almost everything seems impossible until it happens, and in financial markets, it often makes sense to “expect the unexpected.” Especially today, as Bitcoin is at the center of a true process of mainstream adoption, even encouraged by the Trump administration, which has chosen to use it as a strategic national reserve. That possibility becomes even more tangible when we look ahead, even just by considering recent signals from the U.S. government, about a potential ""monetary system"" based on stablecoins. I’d like to use this emerging narrative, one we’re hearing more and more about, to revisit one of the most common intermarket analyses involving Bitcoin (its relationship with the dollar and gold), and use that as a foundation to introduce my rating on what I believe is one of the best ETFs in the space: IBIT. Data by YCharts Why IBIT? IBIT is an ETF managed by BlackRock, listed on the NASDAQ, but not registered or regulated by the CFTC (so it’s not considered a commodity pool), a key detail that, in my view, means it should be technically classified as a passive Bitcoin custody vehicle. But yes, it’s an ETF in the sense that it’s a passive investment instrument, with no trading or secondary management. Its sole purpose is to track the price of Bitcoin , net of fees and operating costs. Currently, those costs amount to 0.25%. IBIT’s Bitcoin custody is handled through Coinbase Custody , in segregated cold storage, and the fund clearly states that no speculative operations are conducted with the BTC held, for example, the assets are not used as collateral elsewhere (this may sound obvious, but it isn’t), and that marks a major difference compared to extreme cases like FTX (just to illustrate the point). In short: the asset truly belongs to the trust. Transactions are carried out by Authorized Participants (APs), but without directly handling BTC, they do it through third-party execution, such as Coinbase Prime. I consider it a competitive solution. If I had to make a selection, I’d definitely place it among the top Bitcoin ETFs, alongside BTC ETF. (I talked about this in more detail here , and if you come across it, the comment section also sparked an interesting discussion.) Profile (Seeking Alpha) What’s happening to the price of Bitcoin In an administration like Trump’s, terrified of the dollar and high interest rates, and strongly attracted to the crypto market, whether for political reasons or actual financial motives, how might Bitcoin react to market stimuli? To answer, I’ll start with the context: The prevailing narrative, according to which Trump might use stablecoins as a strategic pillar to maintain dollar dominance while simultaneously increasing commercial advantage, seems to appeal to Bitcoin (even if, in the end, it's “little more than a rumor”). However, crypto has in fact reached some “institutional” milestones: starting with the launch of ETFs, such as IBIT, and even Bitcoin entering government accounts, with BTC as a “strategic national reserve.” Therefore, the strategic introduction of dollar-pegged stablecoins may not be so “theoretical.” And I think this glimmer of possibility is the narrative currently driving the crypto stream, because in the end, stablecoins have always been a strong bridge of connection with the traditional market. That said, today we hear talk of a “new Bretton Woods,” a kind of banking “wild west” tied to the use of these stablecoins. These, indeed, are rumors, but since there’s still a lot of media speculation, I’d now like to move directly to intermarket analysis to try interpreting the market through this perspective. Gold-Dollar-(Bitcoin?) Following an intermarket logic, it’s still interesting to observe how certain forces are forming that align with this narrative. The weakness of the dollar has in some way played a positive role for Bitcoin, even while the S&P 500 was falling , and usually, when the market shifts from risk-on to risk-off, Bitcoin has followed suit. Data by YCharts A second element is a potential de-correlation with gold . I say potential because it’s a recent development that could be just emerging, but even in this sense, it seems to follow the narrative described in the previous paragraph: a kind of digitalization of the real asset, and ultimate safe haven, gold. Data by YCharts Risk I don’t know whether the Trump administration will continue in this direction; but continuing down this path would, in my opinion, be an event the market would interpret positively, and I believe this can be read between the lines of the intermarket analysis. Since it’s an open and widely debated issue, I think it will likely be revisited during upcoming developments. Naturally, this is a highly debatable point of view. Moreover, with the back-and-forth on tariffs, the Trump administration could increasingly lose credibility in the eyes of the market . This is a risk, because it could easily make a U-turn from the steps taken so far, generating significant discontent among market participants and fueling bearish speculation, so it is indeed a risk. Personally, however, I believe that even if we were blind to political developments, we still would have observed a relative strength in Bitcoin from a technical perspective, one that would have been hard to ignore. Data by YCharts Conclusion As an active investor, I try to follow the market’s underlying narrative and adapt accordingly. At this moment, in my view, the institutionalization and regulation of the crypto market are strong driving forces, and so are the rumors surrounding a stablecoin-based monetary system. I see all of these as bullish elements that, combined with the underlying upward momentum, reinforce this outlook. However, considering the high level of political uncertainty and the market’s growing skepticism toward the current administration’s political statements, I believe a fair rating for IBIT is HOLD.",BTC-USD|BTC|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-06 10:09:05

44229206,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157542,1746526218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CFTC: Strategic Move to Observe Tokenization Pilots for Crucial Digital Assets Insight,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cftc-observe-tokenization-pilots/,"Big news from the world of financial regulation and digital assets! The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ), a key player in overseeing derivatives markets, is taking a proactive step into the rapidly evolving landscape of tokenization . This move signals a growing interest from regulators in understanding the practical applications of blockchain technology and how it might impact traditional finance. Why is the CFTC Joining Tokenization Pilots? Acting Chair Caroline Pham recently announced that the CFTC will participate as an observer in several industry tokenization pilot programs. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise; the primary goal is to gain firsthand, real-world insights into how tokenized assets function. Think of it like getting a backstage pass to see how the technology performs in live environments, rather than just reading about it in reports. According to reports from the Medici Network conference, where Pham made the announcement, the agency wants to see the mechanics up close. This includes understanding: How assets are tokenized and managed on distributed ledgers. The operational workflows involved in trading, clearing, and settlement of tokenized assets. The potential benefits and efficiencies tokenization might offer. The inherent risks and challenges associated with this new technology. This observational role is crucial for building informed regulatory frameworks. Instead of regulating from a distance based on abstract concepts, the CFTC aims to base potential future crypto regulation on practical experience. What Exactly is Tokenization? Before diving deeper, let’s quickly clarify what we mean by tokenization . In simple terms, it’s the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This asset can be tangible, like real estate or art, or intangible, like company shares, funds, or even carbon credits. Each token represents a fractional or full ownership stake or specific rights related to the underlying asset. The benefits often touted include increased liquidity (making it easier to buy and sell fractions of expensive assets), faster settlement times, enhanced transparency (due to the blockchain’s immutable ledger), and reduced costs by cutting out intermediaries. How Does Observing Pilots Help Shape Crypto Regulation? For a regulatory body like the CFTC , direct observation provides invaluable data. It allows them to see the technology’s capabilities and limitations in action. This is particularly important for digital assets , which often blur the lines between traditional asset classes and introduce novel technical and legal complexities. By seeing how these pilots handle aspects like custody, transfer of ownership, compliance checks (KYC/AML), and interoperability, the CFTC can better assess: Where existing regulations might apply or need adaptation. What new risks emerge that aren’t covered by current frameworks. How consumer protection and market integrity can be maintained in a tokenized environment. The potential impact on systemic financial stability. This hands-on approach is a significant step towards developing pragmatic and effective financial regulation that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. What Kind of Digital Assets Might the CFTC Observe? The world of digital assets is vast, but tokenization pilots often focus on specific areas. While the exact pilots the CFTC will join haven’t been fully disclosed, potential areas of observation could include: Asset Class Potential Tokenization Use Case Why it’s Relevant to CFTC Commodities Tokenized gold, oil futures, agricultural products Directly relates to CFTC’s core mandate over commodity markets and derivatives. Real Estate Fractional ownership of properties via tokens Could impact financing, investment structures, and related derivatives. Securities (Stocks, Bonds) Tokenized shares or bonds While often under SEC purview, the lines can blur, especially with novel structures or derivatives built on these tokens. Funds & Investment Products Tokenized investment funds or ETFs Relevant for oversight of pooled investment vehicles and related derivatives. Carbon Credits/Environmental Assets Tokenized environmental commodities CFTC has jurisdiction over certain environmental markets. Observing these diverse applications will give the CFTC a broad understanding of the technology’s versatility and the unique regulatory considerations each asset class presents when tokenized. Benefits and Challenges of the Observer Role Taking an observer role offers several advantages for the CFTC . It’s a low-impact way to learn without immediately imposing new rules. It allows for flexibility and direct interaction with the innovators building these systems. For the industry, having the CFTC observe can provide valuable feedback and potentially lead to clearer future guidance, reducing regulatory uncertainty. However, challenges exist. An observer role is passive; the CFTC isn’t actively participating in the pilot’s operations. This might limit the depth of understanding in certain complex areas. Ensuring the pilots selected are representative of the broader tokenization landscape is also important. Furthermore, translating observational insights into effective and balanced financial regulation requires careful consideration and rulemaking processes. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Assets and Financial Regulation? The CFTC ‘s decision to join these pilots is a clear signal that U.S. regulators are moving beyond simply monitoring the crypto space from afar. They are engaging directly with the technology and its applications. This strategic move suggests a path towards more informed and potentially more nuanced crypto regulation in the future. By understanding the technology’s practicalities, the CFTC can develop rules that are not only effective in managing risk but also avoid stifling legitimate innovation in the digital assets space. It highlights a growing recognition that tokenization could play a significant role in the future of finance, and regulators need to be prepared. Conclusion: A Pivotal Step Towards Informed Oversight The U.S. CFTC ‘s decision to embed itself as an observer within industry tokenization pilots is a pivotal development. It underscores the agency’s commitment to understanding the practical realities of digital assets and the potential impacts of tokenization on markets under its purview. By gaining crucial real-world insights, the CFTC is better positioning itself to develop effective and informed financial regulation for the evolving landscape of blockchain-based finance and crypto regulation . This proactive engagement is a positive sign for the maturation of the digital asset ecosystem and its integration with traditional finance.

But according to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao Changpeng Zhao Changpeng Zhao, populalrly known as CZ, is a Chinese-Canadian businessman. He founded Binance, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the world based on trading volume. CZ came across Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013 from a friend. Quick Facts Full NameChangpeng ZhaoBirth 1977 in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, ChinaNationalityChinese-Canadian, UAEEducationBSc. from McGill UniversityMarital StatusMarried to Yang WeiqingFamous ForBinance, Advocate for decentralized finance, blockchain tech.Net Worth$59.4B (refer for realtime) Before starting Binance in 2017, he was the Head of Development at Blockchain.info and the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at OKCoin. Under CZ, Binance launched an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) that raised $15 million and rapidly became the largest exchange within months. To improve trading options, the firm introduced Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Binance Labs, Binance Academy, Binance Launchpad, and other blockchain-based solutions. CZ has influenced the global adoption of crypto by offering regulatory compliance, DeFi solutions, and infrastructure for digital assets. CZ’s Career Timeline Tokyo Stock Exchange (2001–2003) – Developed trading systems for financial institutions.Bloomberg Tradebook (2003–2005) – Worked as a software developer for high-frequency trading systems.Fusion Systems (2005–2013) – Co-founded this financial technology firm specializing in ultra-low-latency trading solutions.Blockchain.info (2013–2014) – Served as Head of Development, working with early Bitcoin adopters like Roger Ver and Ben Reeves.OKCoin (2014–2015) – Worked as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at one of the largest fiat-to-crypto exchanges at the time.Binance (2017–2023) – Founded Binance and led it to become the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange before stepping down as CEO in 2023. Awards and Recognizations of CZ List of achievementsYearBloomberg 50 – Most Influential People in Finance2021Forbes Crypto Rich List – Billionaire Status2022Top 10 Most Influential People in Crypto (CoinDesk)2022Binance – World’s Largest Crypto Exchange by Volume2018-23 There were regulatory issues in some countries about crypto.

In a recent interview with Rug Radio’s Farokh Sarmad , CZ made a bold prediction: the total crypto market cap could skyrocket to $5 trillion by the end of 2025 , with Bitcoin potentially reaching between $500,000 and $1 million . His confidence stems from the rising wave of institutional adoption , particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs . As of now, Bitcoin’s dominance sits at 65% , signaling cautious optimism among investors. But CZ believes the real opportunity lies beyond BTC — in emerging altcoin sectors poised for exponential growth. Here’s a breakdown of the four key crypto trends CZ is most bullish on : 1. The ETF Boom Is Just Beginning CZ emphasized that Bitcoin’s current rally is largely driven by U.S.-based institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. He believes this is only the first phase of institutional involvement, with much more capital yet to enter the market. As demand increases and supply tightens, Bitcoin’s price could see a parabolic rise. 2. AI and Blockchain Are Converging With the U.S. government, particularly under Trump’s renewed leadership, taking a pro-AI stance , CZ believes AI and blockchain integration is inevitable. He suggests that AI will increasingly rely on blockchain for security, transparency, and decentralization . While he didn’t name specific tokens, popular AI-focused projects like Fetch.ai (FET) and SingularityNET (AGIX) are seen as top contenders in this emerging space. 3. DeSci – Decentralized Science Is the Future Another under-the-radar sector CZ is bullish on is DeSci (Decentralized Science) . He envisions a world where smart contracts fund research and pharma innovation through milestone-based crypto payments , empowering global, small-scale labs. While early in its development, DeSci offers real-world utility and long-term impact beyond trading. 4. Real-World Assets (RWA) Enter the Blockchain Era Tokenizing real-world assets like stocks, real estate, and bonds is becoming a major theme in crypto. With players like BlackRock entering the space, CZ sees massive potential in platforms that facilitate this transition. Projects like Ondo Finance and Polymesh are leading the charge, bridging traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems.

The positive sentiments come as experts highlight the impact of a Solana-based ETF on the community and the broader cryptocurrency market. In a report from Bloomberg Intelligence, market experts revealed that a Solana Spot ETF could usher in a staggering $3-6 billion in inflows, further positioning it as one of the largest ETFs to debut on the market. The Solana blockchain offers sustainable fee charges that further validate the potential success of an ETF. To this effect, JPMorgan notes that lower fee charges on Solana positions the network above its long-standing competitor, Ethereum. Another upside is the increased staking yield on Solana, which sits at 8% against Ethereum’s 3%. Solana ETF approval in 2025: what are the possibilities? Demand for a Solana-based ETF has risen over the past months, with seven leading institutions sending applications to the U.S. Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Some players anticipate approval from the SEC. Although regulatory classifications are still vague, and the SEC has not ruled on any pending applications, justifying the rejection of an altcoin-based ETF continues to prove challenging for the SEC, with the changing market landscape. As such, key players remain largely optimistic about the near future. Meanwhile, SOL bulls lost momentum this week after selling pressure surged, resulting in a fresh decline from its $155 high. After experiencing rejection at higher price levels, SOL is consolidating around the $145 price. Solana (SOL) trades at a press time price of $144. Although the price value decreased by 1.0.3% from the previous day, SOL appears to have erased most of its weekly losses.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-06 11:31:46

And with the fear index still hovering low it might just be the right time to prepare. Pepe may have hit legendary status with its early gains, but its meme-only status and high market cap leave little room for the next explosive jump. With whispers of internal conflict within Pepe, Pepeto claims to be the true evolution. It builds on the frog legacy with real applications and a strong narrative. As Solaxy Expands Tech Goals, Pepeto Captures Market Hype While Solaxy seeks to enhance Solana’s ecosystem at a presale price of $0.001714, Pepeto brings both innovation and affordability. With tools like PepetoSwap in the pipeline, Pepeto is clearly being seen as a project with broader impact. Solaxy Builds Infrastructure, Pepeto Builds Ecosystem At $0.001714, Solaxy is gaining investor attention for its promise of improved blockchain performance. However, Pepeto’s presale is proving more attractive with its utility focus and much cheaper token price. Its real world applications are hard to overlook. Judgement Approaches: Pepeto’s Moment to Lead Pepe played its part. It climbed the charts with four letters. But without the rest, it never had staying power. Pepeto brings the full six. It brings tools. It brings a mission. The presale is still open. The listing is coming. Exploring Potential and Price Dynamics: Why Early Access Can Be a Game-Changer A presale, or ICO, gives early investors the chance to buy tokens before public launch — usually at a much lower price. It’s the stage where backers can get in cheap and projects raise the funds they need to bring their utilities to life. Both PEPE and PEPETO have 420 trillion tokens in total supply, but their stories take different turns. Pepeto’s message is clear: Pepe ran with four key values — Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency — but left behind the last two: Technology and Optimisation. Pepeto now steps forward with the full blueprint. Pepeto is currently in presale at $0.000000126, while Pepe trades at $0.000008274. At this gap, a $10,000 investment in Pepeto could give you about 79.3 billion tokens. If Pepeto reaches Pepe’s current price, that same investment could grow to over $657,000. This is the kind of potential that draws attention to presales. With a strong story, clear vision, and real tools being built, Pepeto is shaping up to be a project worth watching from the ground floor. PEPETO presale enters its final stretch ahead of exchange launch Investors can still secure $PEPETO at the presale rate of $0.000000126 on pepeto.io. Supported payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. With PepetoSwap development nearly complete and listing announcements underway, early buyers are positioned to benefit from staking rewards and early access to the expanding ecosystem. Pepeto is quickly becoming one of the top tokens to watch in this emerging market cycle. Ongoing Hype: Pepeto s official accounts stats: OVER 31,3 K in Instagram, Over 18,1K in X (Twitter), and 30,8K in Telegram. To stay in touch with listing updates, here are the official links.

44231890,https://cryptonews.com/?p=357732,1746531438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44231890.jpeg,Bitwise CIO Warns Congress May ‘Fumble’ Crypto Regulation at Final Stretch,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitwise-cio-warns-congress-may-fumble-crypto-regulation-at-final-stretch/,"Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has voiced serious concerns over Congress’s ability to pass meaningful crypto regulation, warning that the industry could face a rough summer if lawmakers drop the ball on pending legislation. In a note to clients on Monday, Hougan expressed optimism about crypto’s broader outlook—predicting all-time highs for many digital assets and a potential $200,000 price for Bitcoin under the current administration. However, he cautioned that such progress remains fragile unless Congress codifies regulatory clarity into law. Hougan Warns Trump’s Crypto Wins Could Be Reversed Without Congressional Action Despite supportive moves from the Trump administration—including a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, reversed SEC enforcement actions, and regulatory rollbacks—Hougan warned that these executive measures could be undone by future leaders. “We need Congress to pass legislation enshrining crypto’s progress in law,” he said. The Bitwise CIO had been hopeful that stablecoin legislation would sail through this year, particularly after the GENIUS Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan support. The bill mandates 100% reserve backing for stablecoins, regular audits, and strict marketing and insolvency rules. But momentum stalled last weekend when nine Senate Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, abruptly withdrew support. They cited concerns over anti-money laundering and national security provisions—despite the updated bill being stronger in those areas than its earlier version. From me: Crypto-friendly Dems abandoned a stablecoin bill they voted for in committee,after Trump crypto corruption grew too big to ignore. Even Sen.Alsobrooks, cosponsor of the bill & the only Banking Cmte member who didn't back away from it, told me she supports her colleagues: pic.twitter.com/dFwylebTpR — David Dayen (@ddayen) May 5, 2025 Hougan suggested that shifting political winds, including Trump’s declining approval ratings and growing scrutiny over his crypto business ties, are playing a bigger role than policy disagreements. He also criticized efforts within the crypto industry to bundle the GENIUS Act with broader market structure reforms, warning that doing so risks derailing both. Democrats Plan to Boycott a Hearing on Crypto Market Meanwhile, the House is facing its own turmoil. Democrats are reportedly planning to boycott a joint hearing on crypto market structure, while another bill—the STABLE Act—continues to make headway. Adding to the complexity, World Liberty Financial, a DeFi platform backed by Trump, recently launched its stablecoin. Despite the political setbacks, Hougan remains cautiously hopeful. “Stablecoins are too obviously beneficial—for America, the dollar, merchants, and entrepreneurs—for petty political jockeying to derail progress,” he wrote. “If Washington can get its act together, I think the bull market will be unstoppable. If not, we’re in for a very difficult summer.” In another development, Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback to the broader push for state-level crypto adoption. Two proposed bills — House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 — were officially withdrawn from the legislative process on May 3. The legislative session had adjourned a day earlier, on May 2, without taking action on the crypto-focused proposals.

Among thousands of options, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Tron (TRX), and Rexas Finance (RXS) stand out as tokens priced under Cardano’s $0.40 level. While meme coins like DOGE and SHIB battle skepticism over utility, projects like RXS are reshaping real-world asset ownership through blockchain innovation. Early investors in these tokens could turn $750 into $25,000, with RXS leading the pack due to its presale momentum, CertiK audit, and real-world use cases. Dogecoin Struggles With Tokenomics Dogecoin remains a top-ten crypto by market cap, yet analysts question its potential to reach $1. Unlimited token supply and reliance on Elon Musk’s endorsements create hurdles. Though a spot DOGE ETF approval could spark temporary gains, the absence of a supply cap limits long-term upside. Technical charts show DOGE bouncing from multi-month lows, but resistance at $0.22 suggests it might not break past $0.25 without major catalysts. Investors seeking transformative returns may find better prospects elsewhere. Shiba Inu Faces Burn Rate Concerns Shiba Inu teases a bullish ascending triangle pattern, hinting at a possible 550% rally. However, declining token burns and shrinking meme coin market caps cast doubt. SHIB’s 75% drop in burn rate reduces scarcity, while macroeconomic pressures dampen speculative interest. Even if SHIB defies odds, reaching $0.000155 requires overcoming massive sell pressure from early holders. The token’s reliance on hype contrasts sharply with projects offering tangible utility. Pepe Coin Shows Technical Promise Pepe Coin’s Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) hit yearly highs, signaling strong holder confidence. A falling wedge pattern suggests a breakout toward $0.00001715—a 173% surge. However, PEPE’s 77% crash from its 2024 peak highlights volatility risks. Futures open interest stabilizing at $195 million indicates cautious optimism, but meme-driven tokens remain vulnerable to market sentiment shifts. Tron’s Bearish Signals Raise Alarms Tron trades at $0.2309, down 2% amid bearish technical indicators. Declining RSI and resistance at $0.2408 point to further downside. While long-term predictions suggest TRX could hit $1.75 by 2031, short-term charts show selling pressure outweighing bullish momentum. Investors may wait for clearer signals before committing funds. Rexas Finance Bridges Real-World Assets and Blockchain Rexas Finance merges blockchain with real-world assets, letting users tokenize property, gold, or art. Imagine owning a fraction of a Dubai skyscraper or a Paris café from your living room. This ERC-20 token eliminates intermediaries, enabling fractional ownership and global liquidity. Unlike meme coins, RXS solves tangible problems, driving its presale to $48 million—86% of its $56 million target. RXS Presale Dominance and Whale Activity Stage 1-11 sold out swiftly, raising $41 million. The current Stage 12 prices RXS at $0.20, a 6.6x jump from its $0.03 debut. With 92% of presale tokens sold, the final stage precedes a 2025 launch at $0.25. Etherscan data reveals whales acquiring RXS, including a $150,000 purchase (750,000 RXS at $0.20). Such demand hints at post-launch surges, with analysts predicting $10+ per token—a 50x gain. Rexas Finance’s CertiK audit ensures secure smart contracts, boosting investor trust. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko amplify visibility across 100 million monthly users. Plans to launch on three top-tier exchanges in 2025 will further liquidity and accessibility. The ongoing $1M Rexas Millionaire Giveaway, offering 20 winners $50,000 each, fuels community growth. Rexas Finance’s token builder lets anyone mint asset-backed tokens, while its launchpad helps projects raise capital. The Quickmint Bot and AI Shield streamline asset tokenization, closing gaps between traditional markets and blockchain. With 22.5% of tokens allocated to staking, RXS rewards long-term holders passively. Final Call for Exponential Gains While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and TRX face uncertain trajectories, Rexas Finance combines innovation, security, and real-world impact. Early investors at $0.20 could see 50x returns post-launch. The presale’s final stage offers a narrow window to join a revolution democratizing global asset ownership. With $48 million raised and whales accumulating, RXS stands poised to redefine the crypto market—and your portfolio.

According to a detailed note shared by Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, Bernstein analysts believe this surge will primarily be driven by public companies emulating MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. Bernstein: ""We expect ~$330Bn corporate treasury led inflows to Bitcoin by 2029E. Over the next 5 years (CY25E-29E), we expect listed corporates to allocate ~$205Bn capital for Bitcoin acquisition, led by small-low growth companies, trying to emulate MSTR’s Bitcoin treasury… pic.twitter.com/RPgXkLG1Gt — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) May 5, 2025 These firms, particularly small-cap, low-growth companies flush with cash, are seeking alternative growth paths amid stagnating business fundamentals. Bernstein forecasts that listed corporations will spearhead $205 billion of this potential capital infusion over the next five years, from calendar year 2025 through 2029. In a bullish scenario, Bernstein estimates an additional $124 billion in inflows could come from MicroStrategy (rebranded as Strategy) itself, particularly after the firm’s recent announcement that it has doubled its capital raise plans from $42 billion to $84 billion through 2027, of which 32% has already been completed. The motivation for such aggressive treasury diversification is that many companies with large cash reserves and few viable reinvestment options see Bitcoin as a hedge and a path to value creation. “There is no visible road ahead for them for value creation,” Bernstein analysts noted. “The success of the MSTR model offers them a rare growth path.” The Bernstein note also highlighted that firms holding over $100 million in cash could contribute around $190 billion of the projected inflow. Even under conservative estimates, high-growth small firms might inject $11 billion into Bitcoin by 2026, and at least $5 billion could stem from just ten large corporations by 2027. However, Bernstein cautioned that the Strategy model isn’t universally replicable. Its efficacy is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price performance, and not all firms have the risk appetite or capital access to engage at the same scale. MicroStrategy and the VanEck Effect: Corporate Accumulation Accelerates Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the most high-profile corporate case study in Bitcoin accumulation. On May 5, the firm purchased an additional 1,895 BTC for over $180 million , bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 555,450 BTC. @Strategy continues its aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy with the latest purchase of 1,895 BTC for approx $180.3 million. #MSTR #Bitcoin https://t.co/hInTpnDniN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 That cache is worth roughly $52.5 billion at current market prices, with an average purchase price of $68,569 per BTC. According to the Saylor Tracker , Strategy’s Bitcoin bet has yielded nearly $14 billion in unrealized profit, amounting to a 38% gain. This performance has not gone unnoticed by investors. Strategy’s share price has soared 97% since the start of the year , outperforming even Bitcoin, which has remained relatively flat. @Strategy (MSTR) jumps 32% in April, fueled by $1.9B Bitcoin buys and BTC optimism ahead of Q1 earnings report. #Bitcoin #MSTR https://t.co/QWMe6IMoOF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 1, 2025 BitBO data further illustrates the growing institutional interest, showing that public companies now collectively hold more than 723,000 BTC worth over $68 billion.

Additionally, a new joint venture, 21 Capital, launched by Softbank, Tether, and Cantor Fitzgerald, aims to purchase $3 billion worth of Bitcoin . Cantor Fitzgerald is reportedly eyeing a multibillion-dollar Bitcoin acquisition vehicle with SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex as institutional interest heats up under Trump. #TradFi #Cantor https://t.co/r9bNZYTJa7 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2025 VanEck’s April 2025 Digital Assets Monthly report added further momentum to this narrative. The asset manager observed that Bitcoin briefly outperformed equities amid a turbulent market environment triggered by geopolitical tensions and former President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. While traditional assets like the S&P 500 and gold slumped, Bitcoin surged from $81,500 to over $84,500, indicating a possible shift in investor perception of BTC as a macro hedge. Although Bitcoin’s correlation with equities reasserted itself by the end of April, rising from under 0.25 to 0.55, VanEck identified structural tailwinds favoring its future decoupling. Sovereign and institutional interest in Bitcoin as an uncorrelated, store-of-value asset is growing. VanEck cited examples such as Venezuela and Russia using Bitcoin for international trade as early signs of this trend. Still, the broader crypto market remains shaky. While Bitcoin gained 13% in April, altcoins, including Ethereum and various meme coins, continued to falter. The MarketVector Meme Coin Index plunged over 50% year-to-date, while Layer-1 platforms like Ethereum saw significant fee revenue declines. Source: MarketVector Even with notable activity on networks like Sui and Solana, speculative fervor has cooled, and Bitcoin stands out for its relative resilience and maturing institutional appeal. State-Level Ambitions Falter Amid Federal Uncertainty Despite surging interest from private institutions, state-level adoption of Bitcoin is facing significant headwinds. Florida became the latest state to abandon its plans to integrate Bitcoin into its treasury strategy . Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback. #Bitcoin #Reserve https://t.co/kRZo2V0BzE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Two proposed bills, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550, were withdrawn from the legislative process on May 3, despite the legislative session being extended until June 6 for budget deliberations. Had they passed, the bills would have authorized Florida’s chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to allocate up to 10% of certain state funds to Bitcoin. Their quiet removal mirrors similar failures in other states, including Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma, all of which have recently shelved crypto investment proposals. While corporations and hedge funds increasingly embrace BTC as a treasury reserve and macro hedge, policymakers remain cautious, often citing volatility and fiscal responsibility as barriers to entry. If Bitcoin maintains momentum, Bernstein’s bullish $330 billion forecast may well become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Endless forms, complicated dashboards, technical setups—too often, participation in the decentralized world feels like a job, not a journey. Homnifi is changing that. Built for everyday people, not just digital natives or technical elites, Homnifi transforms Web3 participation into something natural, intuitive, and even enjoyable. Because in the next evolution of the internet, contributing to the network shouldn’t be exhausting—it should be empowering. The Problem: When Decentralization Becomes a Chore Let’s be honest: many Web3 platforms expect users to climb a steep learning curve before they can even get started. Between wallets, nodes, gas fees, protocols, and private keys, the average person can quickly feel overwhelmed and underqualified. Instead of welcoming participation, these platforms often raise invisible barriers. And when taking part feels more like managing a second job than being part of a community, people are left behind. That’s not the Web3 the world needs—and it’s not the future Homnifi is building. Homnifi’s Approach: Effortless by Design Homnifi was created with a simple belief: participation in the next internet should feel as easy as opening your favorite app. From the moment you join, Homnifi removes friction at every step.

With just a few taps, your everyday device can begin supporting decentralized applications, quietly contributing to a network designed for global inclusion. There are no complicated setups, no coding skills required, and no mental gymnastics needed to understand how you’re making a difference. Homnifi takes care of the complexity behind the scenes, so you can focus on what matters: being part of something bigger. Participation That Fits Into Real Life Unlike platforms that demand constant attention, Homnifi respects your time. Once connected, your device operates in the background—no need to micromanage, monitor, or maintain. Whether you’re working, relaxing, or on the move, your contribution continues, seamlessly. This “set-it-and-forget-it” model is part of what makes Homnifi so approachable. It’s not about maximizing screen time—it’s about minimizing effort while still allowing you to participate meaningfully in a growing ecosystem. In other words: you don’t need to be online 24/7 to make an impact. Empowerment Without Exhaustion Homnifi doesn’t just make Web3 participation easier—it makes it more human. There’s no pressure to perform, no race to the top, no sense of falling behind. Instead, users are invited into a shared space where their presence matters. Contributions—no matter how small—are recognized and rewarded. This changes the narrative. Instead of feeling like a task, participation becomes a choice rooted in curiosity, community, and impact. And that’s exactly how it should feel. Everyone Has a Role. Everyone Belongs. Homnifi’s mission isn’t just to simplify technology. It’s to shift the culture of Web3—from one of complexity to one of clarity, from exclusivity to inclusion. You shouldn’t need a degree in blockchain to take part in the future of the internet. You just need the desire to be involved—and a platform that welcomes you in. That’s the world Homnifi is building: one where participation doesn’t drain you, but energizes you. Where everyday people help power the most transformative shift in digital history—without needing to overhaul their lives to do it. Because in this new internet, everyone should have a role. And no one should feel left out. About Homnifi Homnifi is a dynamic and secure digital platform that enables a 360-degree experience of the world of web3.

44231955,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157554,1746531637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Florida Bitcoin Reserve Effort Suffers Shock Defeat as Bills Fail,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/florida-bitcoin-reserve-fails/,"The Sunshine State’s foray into the world of digital asset reserves hit a significant roadblock recently. Efforts to establish a dedicated Florida Bitcoin Reserve have stalled, marking another instance where state-level cryptocurrency initiatives face considerable hurdles in the legislative arena. This development is particularly noteworthy as it involves direct state investment in a volatile, yet potentially rewarding, asset class like Bitcoin. Understanding the Proposed Florida Bitcoin Reserve The concept was straightforward: allow Florida to diversify a portion of its state funds into Bitcoin. Specifically, two bills, HB 487 and SB 550, were introduced with the intention of paving the way for this innovative approach to treasury management. These pieces of Bitcoin Legislation aimed to permit up to 10% of certain state funds to be invested in Bitcoin. The idea behind such proposals often centers on exploring alternative assets for growth and as a potential hedge against traditional financial risks, such as inflation. While the exact details of which specific state funds would have been eligible for this 10% allocation were subject to the legislative process, the very proposition signaled a growing interest among some lawmakers in integrating digital assets into state financial strategies. Proponents likely argued that holding Bitcoin could offer long-term appreciation potential and serve as a modern form of reserve asset in an increasingly digital global economy. Why Did the Florida Bitcoin Reserve Bills Fail? According to reports, the primary reason for the failure of HB 487 and SB 550 was simply time. The bills missed the critical May 2 legislative deadline. In the busy environment of a state legislative session, numerous proposals compete for attention and floor time. Lawmakers were reportedly focused on other legislative priorities, including debates surrounding issues like banning fluoride in water and implementing restrictions on smartphone use in schools. This highlights a common challenge for novel or complex legislation like Crypto Bills : they can easily be sidelined when faced with more traditional or politically charged issues that dominate the legislative calendar. Passing laws that involve state funds and volatile assets requires significant debate, understanding, and consensus, which can be difficult to achieve within tight deadlines. Beyond the missed deadline, other implicit factors might have contributed to the bills not advancing: Volatility Concerns: State treasurers and finance committees are typically risk-averse. The inherent price volatility of Bitcoin is a significant concern for managing public funds. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear federal and state regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies creates hesitation. Custody and Security: Securely storing and managing state-owned digital assets presents technical and logistical challenges that require careful consideration. Political Opposition: Not all lawmakers or constituents may be comfortable with the idea of using taxpayer money to invest in cryptocurrencies. Is This a Trend? State Bitcoin Reserve Attempts Across the US Florida’s experience is not unique. The state joins a growing list of U.S. states where similar initiatives aimed at state-level crypto investments or broader digital asset adoption have failed to pass. Florida is now the seventh U.S. state where such proposals have been unsuccessful, alongside: Wyoming South Dakota North Dakota Pennsylvania Montana Oklahoma While some states have made progress in areas like accepting crypto for tax payments or establishing legal frameworks for DAOs, direct state treasury investment in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies remains a frontier that few have successfully navigated. This suggests a broader pattern of caution and legislative difficulty when it comes to states directly holding volatile digital assets. Arguments For and Against a State Bitcoin Reserve The debate around a State Bitcoin Reserve involves compelling arguments on both sides. Understanding these points is crucial to grasping why states might consider, or reject, such proposals. Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its fixed supply. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can potentially improve the risk-adjusted returns of a state’s portfolio. Innovation & Attractiveness: Embracing digital assets can signal a state’s openness to technological innovation, potentially attracting tech companies and talent. Long-Term Growth: Proponents believe Bitcoin’s value will appreciate significantly over the long term. Significant Challenges: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, posing a risk to public funds that require stability. Security Risks: Storing digital assets securely from hacks or loss is a complex technical challenge. Regulatory Ambiguity: The evolving regulatory landscape creates uncertainty for states holding crypto. Public and Political Opposition: Using taxpayer money for risky investments can face strong resistance. Custody Solutions: Finding reliable and secure custodians for state-owned digital assets is a new challenge. Here is a simplified comparison of the core arguments: Argument Type For State Bitcoin Reserve Against State Bitcoin Reserve Financial Inflation hedge, Portfolio diversification, Potential long-term growth High volatility risk, Security/custody costs Policy/Political Signals innovation, Attracts tech industry Regulatory uncertainty, Public/political risk aversion, Focus on traditional priorities What Does This Mean for US State Crypto Adoption? The failure of these Crypto Bills in Florida and other states indicates that while interest in digital assets exists at the state level, significant barriers remain for direct treasury investment. This doesn’t necessarily mean the end of US State Crypto adoption, but rather highlights the areas where proponents need to focus their efforts. Future state-level crypto initiatives might focus on less risky areas first, such as: Developing clear regulatory frameworks for businesses operating with crypto. Exploring the use of blockchain technology for government services. Accepting cryptocurrency for specific payments (taxes, fees) with immediate conversion to fiat. Establishing study committees to better understand digital assets and their potential use cases for the state. Direct investment in volatile assets like Bitcoin for state reserves appears to be a more advanced step that requires greater legislative comfort and public understanding than currently exists in most states. Actionable Insights for Crypto Advocates For individuals and groups who support state-level crypto adoption, including the concept of a State Bitcoin Reserve , these legislative setbacks offer lessons: Education is Key: There is a clear need to educate lawmakers and the public about how digital assets work, their potential benefits, and the risk mitigation strategies available (e.g., secure custody solutions). Start Small: Advocating for less controversial applications of crypto or blockchain technology might build trust and understanding before proposing direct asset investment. Address Concerns Directly: Proponents must be prepared to address lawmaker concerns about volatility, security, and regulatory compliance with clear, actionable solutions. Build Coalitions: Working with industry groups, think tanks, and other states that have made progress can strengthen advocacy efforts. Conclusion: A Temporary Setback for Florida Bitcoin Reserve Hopes The failure of Florida’s HB 487 and SB 550 to pass the legislative deadline represents a setback for those hoping to see the state establish a Florida Bitcoin Reserve . It places Florida among several other states where similar ambitious Bitcoin Legislation and Crypto Bills have not yet come to fruition. While the immediate cause was missing a deadline, the underlying challenges of volatility, regulation, security, and political risk aversion are significant factors that continue to impede direct US State Crypto investment efforts. This doesn’t signal a complete halt to state-level interest in digital assets, but rather indicates that the path to integrating cryptocurrencies into state treasuries is complex and likely to be a gradual process. Future efforts will need to overcome significant educational and political hurdles to build the necessary consensus for such novel financial strategies.

We strongly support the Senate beginning debate on the GENIUS Act, and we need 60 votes to do so,” a pro-legislative coalition said in a statement. Meanwhile, the House continues to build momentum behind its own landmark bill, FIT21, which recently cleared some hurdles in committees. Supporters hope both chambers can combine their efforts to deliver a final bill for President Biden’s signature before the August recess. The call to action reflects growing urgency in Washington to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry amid growing institutional interest and global competition. Failure to act before the summer recess could push meaningful legislative progress into 2025 as attention turns to the upcoming election season. *This is not investment advice.

According to FT , AI code editor Cursor just closed a jaw-dropping $900 million funding round at a $9 billion valuation. Just in: AI coding platform Cursor has raised $900 million in funding, reaching a $9 billion valuation. In 2022, #Alameda invested $200,000 in Cursor’s seed round, but #FTX liquidators later sold the stake for the same amount. That investment is now potentially worth… pic.twitter.com/y1A8HJyp7h — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) May 6, 2025 But while top VCs like Thrive Capital, a16z, and Accel are celebrating, there’s one name glaringly missing from the winners’ circle: FTX. Here’s why. From $200K to $500M: What Went Wrong? Back in 2022, Alameda Research – FTX’s sister trading firm – quietly invested $200,000 into Cursor’s seed round. Fast forward to today, and that stake could be worth an estimated $500 million . Unfortunately for FTX creditors, the platform’s liquidators sold it off for the exact amount it was purchased at: $200,000. No markup.Just a clean exit… from half a billion dollars in potential recovery. Ouch, right? Cursor’s Impressive Rise Cursor, built by Anysphere Inc., is trying to redefine how developers write code. With a sleek split-screen interface and AI-powered chatbot, Cursor allows users to automate complex coding tasks using simple natural language prompts. It analyzes, breaks down tasks, fetches context from documentation, and applies real-time changes. Its engine runs on models from OpenAI and Google, along with its own internal model, Cursor-Fast. And with over $200 million in annual recurring revenue, the momentum is great. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FTX News: Lawsuits Filed to Recover Assets and Boost FTX Repayment , FTX’s Loss, Big Tech’s Gain? This funding round wasn’t too hush-hush. Thrive Capital led the $900M investment, the same firm that backed OpenAI’s $6.6B round last year. The buzz? OpenAI reportedly tried – and failed – to acquire Anysphere earlier this year. They’re now eyeing Windsurf (Exafunction Inc.) for up to $3 billion instead. If we’re being real… This seems like a major loss for FTX. Is there more than meets the eye?

He shared what he believes might have propelled the regulator to backpedal on its stance in the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. The SEC’s decision to drop its appeal in the Ripple case has had an undeniable impact on the cryptocurrency industry. However, the development has since sparked a long debate about the factors fueling the SEC’s decision to end the four-year legal battle. In a new Ripple segment dubbed “Crypto in one minute,” the firm’s CLO addressed the SEC’s move to halt its appeal case against Ripple, explaining that the regulator’s reasoning for filing the lawsuit was largely vague. “I think the real question is, why did they [the SEC] bring the case? The SEC has not only dropped its appeal against Ripple, they’ve now dropped every case against every crypto company in the United States.” He remarked. Can the SEC become Crypto-friendly? Ripple’s CLO shares his views As Stuart Alderoty stated, the SEC has dropped investigations and many high-profile cases against leading cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, ConsenSys, Kraken, Yuga Labs, Immutable, and many others. “The SEC has now admitted what we’ve always been saying; that you can’t bring endorsement actions for violating the law, without first explaining what the law is. We never had clear laws, rules, and regulations regarding crypto in this country. So we’re gonna clean up this mess, we’re gonna get out of the courtroom, we’re gonna get back to running business.” Alderoty added. The CLO expresses optimism in the long term, observing that the regulator appears committed to working with Congress to implement crypto regulations that protect consumers and the integrity of the market, eliminate bad actors, and foster innovation in the industry.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-06 11:41:43

A peaking Bitcoin dominance chart suggests that altcoins are close to outshining BTC. “Bitcoin dominance has one final leg left in its macro uptrend on the road to 71% (red). Any dips into 64% would constitute a retest. A successful retest would enable final trend continuation on the road to 71% (green box).” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.82%. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin needs to hold a key support level at $93,500 on the weekly chart to maintain bullish momentum. “Bitcoin has rejected from the lower high resistance (black diagonal). Going forward, Bitcoin will need to hold the $93,500 range low to fully confirm a reclaim of the range.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Lastly, the analyst says Bitcoin may follow a similar pattern seen in April of 2024 on the weekly chart, eventually hitting new all-time highs if it plays out. “This idea was first explored in mid-October 2024 and actually ended up playing out. It would be poetry if Bitcoin repeated history and followed through on the same path in this current range as well. For history to repeat, BTC would need to: Reject from $99,000. Hold $93,500. Break $97,000-$99,000. Reject from $104,500. Hold $97,000-$99,000 as support. Breakout to new all-time highs.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $94,604 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

The move coincides with what has been a week of volatility, with ETH trading within a narrow range but closing the week at a 3% loss. As the US-China trade war starts to hit consumers and U.S. GDP contracts for the first time since Q1 2022, market momentum has broadly stalled. Yet Ethereum’s traction in traditional investment circles signals growing institutional confidence—strengthening its case in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Traditional Markets Back Ethereum: What Do They Know? According to CoinGlass data , ETHA attracted $20.1 million on May 2. The addition brings BlackRock’s ETH holding to almost 2% of the total market cap. With ETF inflows in play, BlackRock now holds almost 2% of the $ETH supply. These guys don’t make moves without understanding the bigger picture. pic.twitter.com/an7u6CLCBE — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) May 6, 2025 This substantial accumulation signals heightened institutional interest and could tighten ETH liquidity on major exchanges, easing volatility through longer-term supply-demand dynamics. The move also comes just ahead of the May 7 Pectra hard fork . The upgrade aims to improve network speed, reduce fees, and improve the quality of life for its users. Pectra also raises the staking cap from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, giving institutions a stronger foothold in Ethereum staking. Ethereum Price Analysis: Could This Really Rally to $10K? While a $10,000 Ethereum price is an unrealistic near-term target as economic concerns continue to weigh on risk-on sentiment, there is merit to the argument that ETH could see a surge. The past few months have been turbulent, but they have yet to invalidate a symmetrical triangle pattern forming since 2021. ETH / USDT 1-week chart, symmetrical triangle breakdown. Source: Trading View / Binance. Still, the validity of this pattern hangs in the balance—if the past month’s reversal holds, the dip below the pattern’s lower boundary could be brushed off as a false breakdown. But if momentum fades, Ethereum risks a return to the support zone that has underpinned its 4-month decline at $1400. A breakdown there would open the door to a deeper 40% slide toward $1,050—fully invalidating the pattern. That said, signs of strength are emerging. The MACD line is en route to form a golden cross, surpassing the signal line—often signaling a long-term trend shift on such a high time frame. However, the RSI struggles to break free of oversold territory below 40—a sign that buyers currently lack the conviction to push the next upwards move. Should buying pressure return and the Ethereum price break back into the triangle pattern, the next major target sits at $2,520—a 40% move from current levels. Institutions’ Favourite Crypto Could Be Boosted By This New ICO Despite institutions favouring Ethereum as the altcoin of voice, Bitcoin remains the go-to cryptocurrency, attracting $675 million inflows during May 2 trading. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $5.3 million raised in its initial 6 weeks, the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 77% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

A recent development has caught the attention of the crypto community: a significant test transfer involving StakeStone , a prominent omnichain liquidity infrastructure, and USD1 stablecoin , a project by World Liberty Financial. This event, while seemingly small in value, carries considerable weight and potential implications for the future of both projects and the broader DeFi integration landscape. What Happened: The StakeStone and USD1 Test Transfer According to on-chain analysis shared by @EmberCN on X, the deployer address associated with StakeStone recently received a test transfer of 10,000 USD1 stablecoin tokens. What makes this transaction particularly noteworthy is the source: the official custody address of World Liberty Financial’s USD1 project. This isn’t just a random transfer; it’s a direct interaction between the official stablecoin issuer and a leading liquidity infrastructure provider. This type of on-chain activity is often a precursor to deeper collaboration or integration between protocols. Test transfers allow projects to verify addresses, confirm transaction flows, and prepare the groundwork for more substantial interactions, such as minting, burning, or liquidity provision mechanisms. Why This USD1 Stablecoin Transfer Matters The core speculation arising from this test transfer, as highlighted by @EmberCN, is that StakeStone could be positioned to become the first DeFi protocol minting service provider for USD1. If true, this represents a significant step for both entities: For USD1: Partnering with a well-established liquidity infrastructure like StakeStone could provide USD1 with a crucial entry point into the wider DeFi ecosystem, enabling its use across various protocols for lending, borrowing, trading, and yield generation. For StakeStone: Becoming a preferred or primary minting partner for a stablecoin like USD1 would solidify StakeStone’s position within the DeFi space, potentially increasing its transaction volume, user base, and overall relevance as a key piece of the omnichain liquidity puzzle. This potential DeFi integration could pave the way for USD1 to gain traction and utility beyond its initial scope, leveraging StakeStone’s infrastructure to ensure seamless flow and accessibility across different blockchain networks. StakeStone’s Role as Liquidity Infrastructure StakeStone positions itself as an omnichain liquidity infrastructure . In simple terms, this means it aims to provide seamless and efficient ways for users and protocols to access and utilize liquidity across multiple blockchain networks. By abstracting away some of the complexities of cross-chain interactions, StakeStone seeks to create a more unified and liquid DeFi environment. A partnership where StakeStone helps facilitate the minting and distribution of a stablecoin like USD1 directly aligns with this mission, potentially enhancing the utility and reach of both assets. What Potential Benefits Could This DeFi Integration Bring? If the speculation holds true and StakeStone becomes a key minting partner for the USD1 stablecoin , several benefits could emerge: Increased Utility for USD1: Access to StakeStone’s infrastructure could quickly make USD1 available and usable across a wider range of DeFi applications and chains. Enhanced Liquidity for StakeStone: Facilitating stablecoin flows is fundamental to any liquidity infrastructure . This partnership could bring significant stablecoin volume through StakeStone’s platform. New Opportunities for Users: Users of both StakeStone and USD1 could benefit from new yield farming opportunities, improved trading pairs, and easier access to stablecoin liquidity across chains. Validation for Both Projects: A successful integration would serve as a strong validation for StakeStone’s infrastructure capabilities and USD1’s potential to become a widely adopted stablecoin. This potential collaboration is a prime example of how protocols in the DeFi space seek strategic partnerships to expand their reach and utility, driving innovation in the process. Stay tuned for more crypto news regarding this developing story. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for StakeStone, USD1, and DeFi Integration? While the 10,000 USD1 transfer is currently just a test and the speculation about StakeStone being the first minting partner remains unconfirmed by official announcements, it’s a strong indicator of potential future developments. The crypto community will be watching closely for: Official announcements from either StakeStone or World Liberty Financial regarding a partnership or integration. Further on-chain activity involving larger transfers or specific contract interactions between the two entities. Details on how such a minting partnership would function technically and operationally. The impact of this potential DeFi integration on the adoption and usage of the USD1 stablecoin across various platforms utilizing StakeStone’s liquidity infrastructure . This news highlights the dynamic nature of the DeFi ecosystem, where even seemingly small on-chain transactions can signal significant strategic moves. The potential collaboration between StakeStone and USD1 could be a notable development in the ongoing effort to build robust, cross-chain liquidity infrastructure and expand the utility of stablecoins. This piece of crypto news underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data and analyst insights to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of digital assets. The coming weeks and months should reveal whether this test transfer blossoms into a full-fledged partnership that reshapes the landscape for both StakeStone and the USD1 stablecoin. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Future DeFi Collaboration The recent 10,000 USD1 test transfer from World Liberty Financial’s official custody address to StakeStone’s deployer is more than just a transaction; it’s a potential signal of a significant upcoming DeFi integration . With StakeStone’s focus on omnichain liquidity infrastructure and USD1’s ambition as a stablecoin, a partnership could unlock new levels of utility and accessibility for both. While speculation currently drives the narrative, the on-chain evidence suggests that StakeStone may indeed be positioning itself as a key partner for the USD1 stablecoin , potentially becoming its first DeFi minting service provider. This is a developing story in the world of crypto news that warrants close observation as the DeFi ecosystem continues to build and connect across chains.

The cryptocurrency launched earlier this year quickly drew public attention for its soaring valuation and close ties to Trump-affiliated organizations. Speaking during a recent interview with NBC News, Trump distanced himself from the meme coin’s financial performance, insisting he has not been actively involved in monitoring the project. “I’m not profiting from anything,” Trump said. “I started this long before the election. I haven’t even looked at it.” Notably, the TRUMP token was launched on January 18, just two days before Trump’s inauguration for his new term, as an “official” meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Within 24 hours of launch, its value surged to $77, pushing its fully diluted valuation (FDV) to an eye-watering $62 billion. However, the coin has since dropped nearly 85% from its all-time high. Trump’s comments came in response to questions regarding the ethical implications of a sitting president backing a cryptocurrency, particularly one bearing his name and tied to organizations he is connected to. In April, a public announcement inviting the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token to a gala dinner featuring Trump himself triggered a 60% price rally in the coin and a burst of on-chain activity. Further pressed on the timing and impact of such announcements, Trump said, “ I didn’t even know what it surged to. I have no idea. You’d have to tell me.” He also emphasized the broader importance of crypto, stating, “I want crypto. I think crypto is important because if we don’t do it, China is going to.” Despite his dismissals, blockchain data shows that CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight control 80% of the TRUMP token’s total supply, all entities with ties to the Trump Organization. Meanwhile, reports by The New York Times and Financial Times suggest that the project has generated substantial income for these entities. As of March, total revenue from fees and commissions linked to the token had reached $350 million. Meanwhile, investor losses by mid-February were estimated at $2 billion. That said, critics have argued that Trump’s involvement, even indirectly, could blur the line between public service and private gain. Recall that in February, consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a complaint with the Department of Justice, alleging that Trump’s promotion of the TRUMP meme coin violated federal laws prohibiting gift solicitation by public officials. Earlier in January, Senator Elizabeth Warren had called for investigations into the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins.",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-06 11:56:45

The company confirmed on May 5 that it plans to raise $500 million through its Nasdaq listing, with 10 million shares expected to be priced between $46 and $50 apiece. eToro’s IPO will include 5 million shares offered directly by the company, and another 5 million coming from early backers and insiders—among them co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia, his brother and executive director Ronen Assia, and prominent venture capital firms including Spark Capital and BRM Group. The firm intends to list under the ticker symbol “ETOR” on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, putting it in direct competition with trading app Robinhood, which has recently seen its own stock rise despite a crypto trading slowdown. Crypto Still Central, But Regulatory Pressure Looms In a clear vote of confidence, some BlackRock-managed funds have indicated an interest in snapping up $100 million worth of shares. eToro also set aside 500,000 shares for a directed share program, often designed to reward employees and company affiliates. Though eToro offers access to stocks, ETFs, and commodities, crypto remains a significant part of its business. In 2024, the firm pulled in $12.1 billion in crypto revenue—a stark rise from $3.4 billion the previous year. While the company expects a dip in crypto’s share of trading commissions—from 43% in Q1 2024 to 37% in Q1 2025—it’s still clearly leaning into digital assets as a growth pillar. Yet, eToro isn’t shy about the challenges ahead. In its SEC filing, the company flagged risks such as negative media coverage of crypto, potential user churn, and increased compliance costs from expanding regulatory frameworks. U.S. state-level rules and Europe’s MiCA legislation were singled out as particular stressors that could hamper operations or drive up overheads. IPO Market Eyes Rebound eToro’s IPO momentum follows a temporary delay blamed on market instability sparked by former President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff proposals on April 2. That announcement spooked global investors and put the brakes on several IPOs—including eToro’s. Now, with public markets recovering, crypto firms are inching forward again. Stablecoin issuer Circle filed in April , and crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly prepping its own listing for 2026. eToro’s offering, led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS, and Citigroup, could serve as a bellwether for the renewed appetite in crypto-native public listings.

Casper 2.0 bridges crypto-native innovation with enterprise-grade infrastructure, advancing a vision where blockchain doesn’t exist in isolation, but powers real economies and everyday applications, not just itself. With this upgrade, Casper moves beyond siloed ecosystems, offering a developer- and business-friendly environment ready to support the next wave of tokenized assets, on-chain finance, and real-world adoption. “Casper 2.0 is more than a milestone, it’s a launchpad for real-world blockchain adoption,” said Matt Schaffnit, CEO & Board Director of the Casper Association. “With instant, deterministic finality, native upgradability, and built-in access control, we’re enabling a new generation of applications that secure identity, ownership, and value across industries. I’m especially excited by the growing momentum around real-world use cases now possible on Casper 2.0.” The next wave of industry expansion depends on real-world utility with systems that secure ownership, support compliance, and integrate with economies beyond Web3. Casper 2.0 delivers on that promise with foundational improvements that make it one of the most complete and adaptable blockchains for tokenizing, transacting, and governing real-world assets and processes on-chain: Zug Consensus A new deterministic consensus protocol, Zug brings instant finality to Casper, ensuring that ownership transitions for assets such as real estate, commodities, and tokenized instruments are not only immediate and irreversible, but also leave a clear, tamper–proof audit trail. Natively Secured Upgradable Smart Contracts Real-world systems demand precise control, accountability, and compliance. Casper 2.0 delivers. With natively upgradable contracts, built-in multi-signature support and fine-grained permissions , developers can design workflows that are both auditable and compliant by default. Every party in an asset transaction, from buyer, and seller to broker, escrow agent, and auditor, is restricted to only the specific functionality they’re authorized to access, mirroring the security and role-based access controls of traditional systems. Developer Accessibility Casper 2.0 meets builders where they are, empowering millions of software developers to build on-chain using familiar languages and modern design patterns, without the steep learning curves and constraints typical of Web3 development. Beyond its core innovations, Casper 2.0 introduces critical infrastructure enhancements , including support for multiple virtual machines, expanding the network’s capacity to support complex, real-world applications. Casper 2.0 also unlocks a powerful set of capabilities that redefine and expand what developers can build and what users can expect on-chain. Smart contracts can now integrate rewards and yield directly into their logic through natively secured liquid staking, leverage zero-knowledge hashing algorithms to enable privacy-preserving identity and compliance solutions, and utilize a native token burning mechanism to implement new supply-control strategies. “Casper 2.0 is the result of a simple and powerful idea: that blockchain should support the same kinds of assets, rules, and processes that exist in the real world,” said Michael Steuer, CTO & President of the Board of the Casper Association. “By design, Casper 2.0 enables real-world asset transactions to settle instantly, businesses to implement access controls that mirror reality, and applications to seamlessly upgrade as regulations evolve. Casper 2.0 allows developers to focus on building applications, not engineering around limitations.” Additionally, the Casper 2.0 upgrade underwent a rigorous, independent audit by Halborn Security, ensuring its codebase aligns with top-tier industry standards and reinforcing trust in its secure, enterprise-ready foundation.

Whopping $1.8 Billion Scooped Up By ETFs The total inflow for the U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs for the past five trading days was around $1.81 billion. Thursday and Friday were particularly successful for the funds, with the two days registering $423 million and $675 million, respectively, according to Farside Investors data. Last week’s accumulation followed a jump in BTC spot prices in early May when the asset gained 4% to hit a six-week high of nearly $98,000 on May 2. However, the asset has since retreated to the $94,000 zone, which is the same price it traded at this time seven days ago. With spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining huge traction in the recent past, prestigious universities are also rushing to get a piece of the BTC pie. Brown University, for instance, recently reported holding roughly $5 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF. IBIT, currently the largest spot Bitcoin fund with nearly $60 billion in assets under management, saw $675 million in net inflows on Friday, pushing its cumulative inflows to $43 billion. BTC ETF Flows ‘Are Back In A Big Way’ Meanwhile, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, has suggested that Bitcoin ETF inflows “are back in a big way.” Speaking in a panel discussion at Token2049 Dubai last week, Mitchnick noted that institutions and advisory firms are accounting for an increasingly big share of total BTC ETF flows, whilst retail customers, including high-net-worth individuals were active when the investment products first debuted. “At the outset, it certainly was predominantly retail,” he said. “But then you also have the two other segments that are really important here, which is wealth advisory and institutional.” The exec also suggested that the attraction of Bitcoin ETFs was tied to how BTC has been increasingly behaving like a safe haven, or a hedge that’s not tied to the monetary risks of any particular country.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-06 12:04:46

According to his assessment, the relatively modest market price of XRP, which currently sits around $2, does not reflect its full utility. He believes that financial institutions have yet to meaningfully adopt the token, adding that this lack of large-scale integration is why the asset has not yet appreciated substantially. This claim has reignited debate among investors and analysts over whether the digital asset could experience explosive growth if banks start using it at scale. BarriC suggests that the asset could reach $100, $500, and even $1,000 once banks fully integrate the token into global cross-border payment infrastructure. When banks start using $XRP We will know because of the insane price per $XRP We will see prices like $100, $500, $1,000 Per #XRP The fact that we can still accumulate $XRP at approx $2 means that banks aren’t utilising $XRP …. YET Once that day comes Once banks and… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 3, 2025 The Push For Mass Institutional Adoption BarriC’s predictions are based on the assumption that global banking institutions will eventually adopt XRP for liquidity management and transaction settlement. He argues that the market will respond with sharp price increases once these institutions shift from testing Ripple’s technology to implementing XRP in active, large-volume use cases. Many community members share BarriC’s outlook, believing XRP can lead a cross-border payment revolution . They view the market as a unique entry point for investors seeking long-term returns. BarriC asserts that the asset may not be available at low prices once institutional demand accelerates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Hit $1,000? While BarriC is convinced that the digital asset can reach this level, not all market participants agree. A token price in the $500 to $1,000 range would necessitate a market capitalization surpassing the world’s largest corporations. Critics argue that such a valuation is unrealistic , as it would require both massive daily liquidity and institutional dependence on the digital asset, neither of which exists at this stage. Will Institutions Adopt XRP? While Ripple has developed software designed for improving cross-border financial transactions, using its network does not require XRP. Many of Ripple’s institutional partners utilize its payment system without integrating the token into their operations. Despite this, examples such as Tranglo and SBI Japan demonstrate that XRP can be part of Ripple’s broader infrastructure, making adoption optional. Additionally, Ripple’s payment solutions are compatible with other digital assets, including stablecoins like RLUSD. This flexibility limits XRP’s exclusivity in Ripple’s ecosystem. However, many community members are convinced these institutions will embrace XRP as crypto adoption becomes more mainstream. A recent Coinbase report showed reasons why XRP is attractive to institutions , and as its popularity grows, the chances of hitting BarriC’s lofty targets increase.

One Squid Game-branded token (SQUID) has surged by over 5% hours after the trailer featured on YouTube late Monday. Netflix confirmed that Squid Game Season 3 will premiere globally on June 27, 2025. Within 24 hours of the teaser’s release, the SQUID token jumped by 6%, reaching a trading price of $0.006102. Plot teaser reignites crypto interest The new season will continue with the twisted survival competition story that made the series a global phenomenon. According to the official synopsis, the story resumes with protagonist Gi-hun, also known as Player 456, seeking to dismantle the deadly games from within. Haunted by the loss of his closest ally, Jung-bae (Player 390), Gi-hun could face off against the Front Man, who has reportedly infiltrated their resistance under the disguise of Player 001. According to TradingView, the SQUID token price witnessed a 4.77% increase in the week building up to the teaser, but has shed over 64% of its value since the second season of the show was released. The SQUID token is not officially affiliated with the streaming giant or the production team, but in the eyes of traders, it is closely tied to the show’s branding. The Squid Game franchise continues to be one of Netflix’s best-performing shows. Season 2, which launched in December 2024, broke records within days of its debut to become the most viewed title during a premiere week. It also entered Netflix’s Most Popular Non-English TV list in just three days. The show currently holds the #2 position with 192.6 million views, second only to Season 1’s staggering 265.2 million. Season 2 has also climbed to become the third most-watched season on Netflix across all categories. Beyond the core storyline, Netflix has announced plans to expand the Squid Game universe with additional media content. The mobile game Squid Game: Unleashed debuted last year, and reports have surfaced about a potential spin-off series directed by acclaimed filmmaker David Fincher, although Netflix has not confirmed production timelines. SQUID indicators spell short-term price growth Technical analysis of SQUID shows a moderately bullish trend, although many indicators are neutral. Momentum-based metrics, such as the 10-day momentum reading of 0.000486 and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level at 0.000051, could give investors reason to buy the token. The Stochastic RSI Fast, at 59.495506, is on the higher end of the neutral spectrum. SQUID/Tether price chart. Source: TradingView Regulatory authorities and experienced analysts warn investors against such memecoins because they are susceptible to pump-and-dump cycles, especially when driven by media events. Several Squid Game-related tokens have been launched since 2021, which mostly soared in the first few days and then nosedived in a matter of minutes. On December 27, a day after Squid Game Season 2 was released, blockchain security firm PeckShield told crypto investors about several scam tokens falsely linked to the show. The firm said unaffiliated Squid Game-themed tokens are “circulating in the wild.” PeckShield identified at least one suspicious token on the Base network, noting that the wallet address responsible for deploying the token also holds the largest supply. Since its release, the token has plummeted by 99%, which is a price pattern seen in pump-and-dump schemes. #PeckShieldAlert Beware of scam #SquidGame tokens circulating in the wild.

As cryptocurrencies gain traction, regulators worldwide are grappling with how to integrate these novel instruments into existing frameworks without stifling innovation. A key area of focus has become Stablecoin Regulation , particularly for jurisdictions concerned about potential risks to financial stability and capital controls. This issue is front and center in South Korea, where the central bank chief is sounding the alarm. Why is the Bank of Korea Concerned About Stablecoins? According to reports from Yonhap, the Governor of the Bank of Korea , Rhee Chang-yong, has issued a strong call for the swift implementation of regulations targeting stablecoins, specifically mentioning tokens like USDT. Speaking during a press event in Italy, Governor Rhee articulated concerns that stablecoins possess the potential to circumvent South Korea’s established financial regulations. These regulations are crucial for managing everything from capital flows to foreign exchange transactions, vital components of national economic stability. The Governor’s primary worry stems from the nature of stablecoins themselves. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the Korean won or the U.S. dollar. This stability makes them function, in many ways, as alternatives to traditional fiat currencies for payments, transfers, and value storage. Because they can mimic the function of money, Governor Rhee believes they should be scrutinized under existing foreign exchange laws. Understanding the Challenge: Stablecoins and South Korea’s Financial System The Governor’s remarks highlight a critical challenge for regulators globally: how to supervise assets that bridge the gap between decentralized digital technology and centralized fiat systems. In South Korea Crypto adoption is significant, making the need for clear rules even more pressing. Stablecoins, by offering stability, can potentially facilitate cross-border transactions that bypass traditional banking channels, making it harder for authorities to monitor capital movements or enforce currency controls. Key concerns raised by the Bank of Korea include: Capital Flight: The ease with which large sums could potentially be moved in and out of the country using stablecoins, bypassing reporting requirements. Foreign Exchange Control: Stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies could complicate the central bank’s ability to manage the won’s value or intervene in currency markets. Financial Stability: A run on a large stablecoin could have ripple effects on the broader financial system, especially if linked to domestic institutions. Consumer Protection: Lack of clear regulation leaves users vulnerable to risks associated with stablecoin reserves or issuer solvency. Governor Rhee specifically noted the necessity for regulators to first make a fundamental decision: whether won-backed stablecoins should even be permitted within the South Korean financial ecosystem. This suggests a cautious approach, potentially prioritizing oversight before widespread adoption. The Role of CBDC vs. Stablecoins in South Korea This isn’t the first time Governor Rhee has voiced concerns about stablecoins. During a national audit in October, he previously highlighted their reliance on fiat currencies and advocated for the introduction of a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ). The BOK has been actively researching and piloting a wholesale CBDC , exploring its potential benefits for interbank settlements and potentially wider use cases in the future. The debate between stablecoins and CBDC is ongoing globally. Proponents of stablecoins argue they can foster innovation, provide efficient payment rails, and offer competition to traditional finance. Central banks, on the other hand, often see CBDC s as a way to maintain control over monetary policy, ensure financial stability, and provide a safe, state-backed form of digital cash in the digital age. From the Bank of Korea ‘s perspective, a CBDC might be viewed as a more controllable alternative to private stablecoins, allowing the central bank to dictate its design, issuance, and usage rules, thereby addressing many of the concerns raised about private Digital Assets bypassing existing laws. What Does This Mean for South Korea Crypto? The BOK Governor’s strong stance signals that Stablecoin Regulation is likely to become a major focus for policymakers in South Korea Crypto markets. While the specific details of future regulations remain to be seen, the emphasis on examining stablecoins under existing foreign exchange laws suggests that authorities may seek to apply traditional financial rules where possible, rather than creating an entirely new framework from scratch. This could involve requirements for stablecoin issuers regarding reserves, transparency, licensing, and potentially restrictions on how they can be used or traded, particularly for those pegged to the Korean won. For businesses and users involved with Digital Assets in South Korea, this underscores the increasing need to monitor regulatory developments closely. Looking Ahead: The Future of Digital Assets in South Korea The call for swift Stablecoin Regulation by the head of the Bank of Korea is a clear indication that South Korean authorities are taking the potential impact of Digital Assets very seriously. While the country has a vibrant South Korea Crypto market, regulators are prioritizing financial stability and control. The ongoing exploration of a CBDC further highlights the central bank’s desire to maintain relevance and oversight in a rapidly digitizing financial world. The path forward will likely involve complex discussions between regulators, industry participants, and lawmakers. The balance between fostering innovation and ensuring financial stability will be key. What is certain is that the era of unregulated stablecoins in South Korea appears to be drawing to a close, ushering in a new phase where clarity and compliance will be paramount for all involved with these increasingly important Digital Assets .

According to the official press release sent to crypto.news, the EVM -based autoscaling network recently launched its mainnet after a month-long delay. Its testnet phase generated more than 171,000 physically-run public validator nodes, the highest number of validator nodes ever recorded on a Layer 1 testnet. The protocol’s mainnet is designed to solve the “scalability trilemma,” which essentially allows global users and developers to maintain decentralization, scalability , and affordability without sacrificing a single aspect in favor of another. The network is equipped with a unique ability to breakdown its workload into smaller parts, known as “shards,” which enables the project to ensure transaction validation run in parallel. Initially, the mainnet genesis will begin with 256 validators combining together to form two shards. Due to its shard-like approach, the mainnet offers a number of features including the ability to run nodes in under one minute through a single-command install, without requiring participators to employ heavy hardware or a large stake. Moreover, Shardeum’s approach keeps gas fees as a minimum, remaining as low as $0.01, even when network congestion is high. Upon launch, the mainnet will be support by a number of industry players including treasury operations firm PrimeVault, validator and operator service Mintair and airdrop and token vesting manager Tokensoft. The network is launching with more than 60 open-repositories along with an innovative validator accountability system that involves automatic rotation of consistently under-performing nodes. You might also like: Shardeum to debut its new mainnet on April 15 after token airdrop Shardeum’s token distribution Shardeum’s native token, SHM, will also be launched alongside its mainnet, with a total circulating supply of 249 million tokens. According to the project’s tokenomics , around 36.72% will go to the community token sale while 30.6% of the tokens will be allocated to the team. Both token distributions come with a 3-month cliff period and a two-year daily linear vesting timeline. Meanwhile, 22.44% of tokens will go to the project’s foundation and will be unlocked during the token generation event. The same applies for 10.23% of tokens allocated to the ecosystem and airdrop distribution. The protocol’s token will be used for various on-chain functions, including governance, staking, and gas payments. So far, SHM is set to be listed on major crypto exchanges including BitMart, CoinW and MEXC . On the other hand, the mainnet will be integrated into EVM-supporting wallets, such as MetaMask , OKX Wallet, and Trust Wallet . Chief Technology Officer of Shardeum, Srini Parthasarathy said the launch of the project’s mainnet is not just a technical milestone, it is also proof that it is possible to solve what many deemed as the “blockchain trilemma,” which often resulted in a trade-off. “Launching mainnet with a record-size grassroots validator set is exactly the kind of milestone that convinces us Shardeum will be the foundation for the next wave of Web3 applications,” said Parthasarathy. In the later half of 2025, Shardeum expects developers to start testing smart-contract functionality, followed by stable dApp deployments soon after. As previously reported by crypto.news, Shardeum’s mainnet launch was originally slotted for April 15. However, it was eventually delayed to May due to unfavorable market conditions.

The world of South Korea Crypto is buzzing following major pledges from a leading presidential candidate. Lee Jae-myung, representing the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), has laid out ambitious plans that could reshape how Koreans interact with digital assets, aiming for greater accessibility and a safer trading environment. What Did Lee Jae-myung Pledge for Crypto? Lee Jae-myung’s recent announcement, shared via his Facebook account and reported by local media like News1, outlined a three-pronged approach to digital asset policy: Introduction of Spot Cryptocurrency ETFs: This is a major point, potentially opening doors for broader institutional and retail investment through traditional financial instruments. Reduction of Digital Asset Trading Fees: Aiming to make trading more affordable and accessible for everyday investors. Implementation of a Comprehensive Monitoring System: Focused on creating a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem. These pledges highlight a growing recognition among political figures of the importance and potential of the digital asset market, particularly within the context of Lee Jae-myung Crypto policy proposals. The Promise of Crypto ETF South Korea The commitment to introducing spot cryptocurrency ETFs is arguably the most groundbreaking part of Lee’s proposal. So, what exactly is a spot crypto ETF, and why is this development so significant for Crypto ETF South Korea ? A spot crypto ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment fund that directly holds the underlying cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than futures contracts. This means investors can gain exposure to the price movements of cryptocurrencies through a regulated, traditional investment vehicle traded on stock exchanges. This eliminates the need for investors to directly buy, store, and secure cryptocurrencies themselves, which can be a barrier for many. The introduction of such ETFs in South Korea could lead to: Increased Institutional Participation: Traditional financial institutions, wealth managers, and pension funds often face regulatory or logistical hurdles in directly holding cryptocurrencies. ETFs provide a regulated and familiar pathway. Enhanced Retail Accessibility: Everyday investors can buy and sell crypto exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, simplifying the process and potentially lowering costs compared to some direct exchange purchases. Improved Market Liquidity and Price Discovery: As more capital flows into the market via ETFs, it can lead to deeper liquidity and more efficient price formation. Greater Legitimacy: Regulatory approval for spot ETFs lends further credibility to the cryptocurrency market in the eyes of traditional finance and the general public. While the US recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, regulatory landscapes differ globally. Lee’s pledge signals a potential willingness within the South Korean government to navigate the complexities required to bring this type of product to market, potentially positioning South Korea Crypto as a leader in accessible digital asset investments in Asia. Why Lower Crypto Fees Matter For anyone who has traded cryptocurrencies, transaction fees are a constant consideration. These fees, charged by exchanges for executing trades, can eat into profits, especially for frequent traders or those dealing with smaller amounts. Lee Jae-myung’s pledge to advocate for Lower Crypto Fees directly addresses a pain point for many market participants. Reducing trading fees could have several positive impacts on the South Korean crypto market: Boosted Trading Volume: Lower costs can incentivize more frequent trading, leading to increased market activity and liquidity on exchanges. Greater Profitability for Traders: Traders keep a larger percentage of their gains when fees are reduced. Increased Retail Participation: Lower barriers to entry, including reduced costs, can make trading more attractive to new or smaller retail investors. Competitive Advantage: South Korean exchanges offering lower fees could become more attractive compared to international platforms. Implementing this pledge might involve working with exchanges, potentially through regulatory incentives or guidelines, to encourage a reduction in fee structures. This focus on affordability underscores a desire to make the South Korea Crypto market more inclusive and dynamic. Navigating South Korea Crypto Regulation and Safety Alongside fostering growth and accessibility through ETFs and lower fees, Lee Jae-myung’s plan also emphasizes safety. The intention to implement a comprehensive monitoring system is crucial for building trust and ensuring the long-term health of the market under evolving South Korea Crypto Regulation . Effective regulation and monitoring are essential to: Protect Investors: Guarding against fraud, market manipulation, and illicit activities is paramount. Enhance Market Integrity: Ensuring fair and transparent trading practices builds confidence. Prevent Money Laundering and Illicit Finance: Robust monitoring systems are vital for complying with global financial standards and preventing the use of crypto for illegal purposes. Foster Innovation Responsibly: A clear regulatory framework provides certainty for businesses and encourages innovation within defined boundaries. While the specifics of the proposed monitoring system are yet to be detailed, the commitment signals an understanding that market growth must go hand-in-hand with robust oversight. Balancing innovation with investor protection is a key challenge for regulators worldwide, and South Korea Crypto Regulation is continually adapting to the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Potential Benefits and Challenges Ahead Lee Jae-myung’s pledges, while promising, come with potential benefits and challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased capital inflow into the South Korean crypto market. Enhanced accessibility and ease of investment for retail and institutional players. Improved market liquidity and efficiency. Stronger investor protection through enhanced monitoring. Potential boost to South Korea’s position as a regional crypto hub. Potential Challenges: Navigating the complex regulatory approval process for spot ETFs. Implementing an effective and non-burdensome monitoring system. Political opposition or differing views on crypto policy from other parties. Ensuring that lower fees do not compromise the financial stability of exchanges or lead to unintended consequences. Keeping pace with the rapid technological changes in the crypto space. What This Means for the Market These pledges, if enacted, could significantly impact the South Korea Crypto market. For investors, it could mean more accessible and potentially cheaper ways to invest in digital assets. For exchanges and crypto businesses, it presents opportunities but also requires adapting to new regulatory requirements and potentially different fee structures. Globally, South Korea’s approach could serve as a model or provide insights for other nations grappling with how to integrate digital assets into traditional finance while ensuring market integrity and investor safety. Summary: A Potential Turning Point for South Korea Crypto Lee Jae-myung’s commitment to introducing spot crypto ETFs, lowering trading fees, and enhancing monitoring represents a significant moment for the South Korea Crypto landscape. These proposals aim to simultaneously boost market accessibility, reduce costs for participants, and strengthen the regulatory framework for investor protection. While challenges remain in implementation, the pledges signal a forward-looking approach from a major political figure, potentially paving the way for a more mature, accessible, and secure digital asset market in South Korea. The focus on Crypto ETF South Korea , Lower Crypto Fees , and robust South Korea Crypto Regulation highlights a comprehensive vision for integrating digital assets into the nation’s financial future, making the Lee Jae-myung Crypto platform a key point of interest for the industry.

What Does It Take For The Price To Rise? Analysis Company Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-did-bitcoins-rise-stop-what-does-it-take-for-the-price-to-rise-analysis-company-explained/,"Bitcoin, which experienced sharp declines due to many factors such as the US-China trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump and economic uncertainty, fell to the level of $74,000 at the beginning of April. However, BTC, which subsequently experienced a major recovery, has increased by 25% in the last month. As this upward momentum has weakened in recent days, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen evaluated the latest situation in Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin has risen by 25% in the last month, supported by aggressive ETF inflows and institutional spot buying, Thielen said that emerging signals such as the decline in the Coinbase premium and weak funding rates indicate that this momentum is waning. “The Bitcoin rally is showing signs of fatigue as the market awaits a new catalyst,” Thielen said. “While the options market skew (reflecting the implied volatility difference between call and put options) suggests further upside potential, rising macroeconomic uncertainties and macro pressures are weighing on investor sentiment. These include the Federal Reserve's neutral policy stance ahead of its May 7 meeting, increased market volatility, and growing concerns about tariffs.” According to the analyst, BTC is in a consolidation phase near the $95,000 level as investors wait for a new market catalyst. The analyst concluded by stating that this is not the time to blindly take risks in Bitcoin, but rather to act tactically against well-defined risks. *This is not investment advice.

A British Columbia firm that produces capsules and tablets for the drug industry is now looking for partners in Asia, while a steel component maker that has supplied U.S. buyers for 35 years is warning clients to brace for higher bills. Another company that sews mascot costumes for school and sports events has cut its prices in a bid to keep American orders from slipping away, as reported by Reuters. These moves mark an abrupt shift in long‑standing practices built on easy access to the world’s largest consumer market. Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberal Party won last month after campaigning to “stand up to Trump,” will meet the president at the White House on Tuesday. Carney has told voters the old trade relationship is finished, and the firms are treating that warning as a guide. Even if Ottawa and Washington step into a fresh agreement, executives say Trump’s unpredictable style means uncertainty will linger. “If you are a smart, savvy business person, you are not going to jump right back into another arrangement where you are totally reliant on a U.S. partner,” said Mike Chisholm, who advises exporters. “Owners want stability, banks want stability, private equity funds want stability. They are just going to be very, very careful.” Canada has long relied on the United States for about 75 % of its exports and was among the first nations hit when Trump raised the tariff wall. In March, the White House set a 25 % duty on all steel and aluminum entering the United States. Cars and parts that do not meet North American free‑trade rules face the same surcharge. Government figures show the manufacturing sector ships 42 % of its output to the United States, and roughly 1.7 million Canadian jobs depend on that flow. White House spokesman Kush Desai bluntly said, “Canadian companies won’t have to worry at all about tariffs when Canada becomes our cherished 51st state.” Canadian businesses are forced to pivot to other markets PNP Pharmaceuticals, a contract producer in Richmond, British Columbia, has responded by scouting Asian markets. “We are now venturing into other markets as we see that we need to pivot,” said Alan Urmeneta, the firm’s partnership sourcing manager. He did not name specific countries. LabelPak Printing Inc., also in British Columbia, buys packaging from Asia and resells it. The company now considers focusing solely on Canada and gradually trimming 15 % of its sales that come from the United States. “If he gets mad … and decides to throw a 50 percent tariff on Canadian goods, it’s going to really put us out of the market,” founder Ken Gallie said. “We are going to put more emphasis on the Canadian business.” Still, firms that built their businesses around U.S. demand cannot replace it overnight, especially the smaller players. Canada’s economy is less than one‑tenth the size of its neighbor’s, and sending goods across oceans costs more than trucking them over a border. Chisholm says several of his clients are opening offices or hiring agents in Europe and Asia to dilute their U.S. exposure. “There are markets all over the world that we have free‑trade agreements with,” he said. “Where can I do business is what many are thinking.” The tariff landscape is forcing hard talks with long‑time customers “We are talking to these businesses and telling them, unfortunately, their government has chosen to have them pay more,” said James White, chief executive of Wellmaster, which makes steel parts for the energy and water‑supply sectors. For Natalie Gaudreault, who runs Fusion TG in Montreal, the squeeze came from two sides. Her firm imports about 70% of its tool steel from China, machines it, and ships a fifth of the output to U.S. buyers. Ottawa imposed a 25 % duty on Chinese steel in October. Trump added his own 25 % charge soon after. Once other taxes are counted, Gaudreault says her product cost in the United States will more than double. “I am not going to absorb the cost. I have to charge it to them,” she said, adding that first‑quarter sales fell one‑third. Some suppliers are even reopening contracts to include tariff‑sharing clauses, a step that can harm trust, said Clifford Sosnow, partner at law firm Fasken. “It’s a hot knife through butter,” he warned. “It doesn’t work without creating damage.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The performance of major fiat currencies, especially the US Dollar , and the decisions made by central banks like the Federal Reserve , significantly influence global liquidity and investor sentiment, which in turn impacts the crypto market. Currently, the US Dollar is showing signs of retreat, a move closely watched by traders worldwide as a crucial Fed meeting approaches. Why is the US Dollar Retreating? The recent pullback in the value of the US Dollar can be attributed to several factors. Market participants are positioning themselves cautiously ahead of the anticipated announcements from the Federal Reserve. There’s speculation regarding the future path of interest rates , and any perceived dovishness or uncertainty from the Fed can lead to a weakening dollar. Key points contributing to the dollar’s current stance: Anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook. Recent economic data releases influencing rate hike expectations. Positioning by major players in the Forex market . The Significance of the Upcoming Federal Reserve Meeting The Federal Reserve , often referred to as the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Its monetary policy decisions have a profound impact on the global financial system. The upcoming Fed meeting is particularly important because it will provide updated guidance on inflation, economic growth, and most critically, the future trajectory of interest rates . What makes this meeting stand out? The market is looking for clear signals: Will the Fed continue its aggressive stance on inflation, suggesting higher rates for longer? Or will recent economic data prompt a more cautious approach, potentially signaling a pause or even future cuts? The language used in the official statement and during the subsequent press conference will be dissected by analysts and traders, setting the tone for market movements across various asset classes, including the Forex market and potentially risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Interest Rates: The Fed’s Primary Tool and Market Focus One of the most powerful tools at the Federal Reserve ‘s disposal is its ability to set and influence short-term interest rates . Higher interest rates generally make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors, increasing demand for the US Dollar . Conversely, expectations of lower rates can decrease the dollar’s appeal. The current market focus is intensely on whether the Fed will signal peak rates or indicate that more tightening is needed. This decision directly impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, influences inflation, and dictates capital flows globally. Any shift in the expected path of interest rates can trigger significant volatility in currency pairs within the Forex market . Trader Caution in the Forex Market Given the uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve ‘s next steps, traders in the Forex market are exercising considerable caution. This leads to reduced trading volumes, tighter ranges for currency pairs involving the US Dollar , and a reluctance to take large directional bets ahead of the meeting outcome. This cautious sentiment is a direct response to the potential for sharp price swings once the Fed’s decisions are announced. Traders are waiting for clarity on interest rates and the overall economic outlook before committing significant capital. This period of ‘wait and see’ is typical before major central bank events. Challenges and What to Watch The main challenge for traders and investors right now is navigating the uncertainty. Predicting the exact outcome of a Fed meeting and its immediate market reaction is difficult. The Fed’s communication style and the nuances in their language can be as impactful as the decision on interest rates itself. What should you watch for? The official statement: Pay attention to any changes in language describing the economic outlook or inflation. The ‘dot plot’ (if released): This shows Fed members’ projections for future interest rates. The press conference: Listen to the Fed Chair’s commentary for additional context and forward guidance. These elements will provide clues about the future path of the US Dollar and its implications for the broader financial landscape, including the Forex market and related asset classes. Summary The US Dollar ‘s recent retreat reflects widespread anticipation and caution ahead of the critical Federal Reserve meeting. The market is on high alert for signals regarding the future direction of interest rates , which will significantly influence the dynamics of the Forex market and global capital flows. Traders are currently taking a defensive stance, waiting for the Fed to provide clarity before making significant moves. The outcome of this meeting will likely set the tone for financial markets in the coming weeks.

During the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit in London, Emma Reynolds from the UK Treasury confirmed that the country will not copy the U.S. or the EU when it comes to creating a bitcoin reserve. Let’s dive in detail! No Plans to Hold Bitcoin as a Reserve While the U.S. is thinking about holding Bitcoin as part of its reserves , with a neutral budget strategy, the UK has no plans to do the same. UK Treasury, Reynolds said, “We don’t think that’s right for our market.” Instead of focusing on Bitcoin as a reserve, the UK is exploring new ways to use blockchain. One idea is to issue government debt using blockchain technology . A process is already underway to find a supplier for this, with results expected by late summer. Despite rejecting the U.S. model of holding Bitcoin, the UK still values cooperation with American regulators. Reynolds mentioned a new joint working group between UK and U.S. officials focused on crypto oversight. She said both sides agree that global collaboration is key in this fast-moving space. No Copying the EU’s Crypto Rules Reynolds also made it clear that the UK doesn’t want to copy the EU’s special crypto rules , known as MiCA. Reynolds said the UK has its way of making laws, which is more focused on outcomes rather than strict rules. She explained that the UK plans to treat crypto companies like regular financial firms if they take on the same risks. This means, “Same risk, same rules. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Kevin O’Leary Slams U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Push: “It Will Never Happen” , Some Crypto Things Are Hard to Control Reynolds also admitted that some parts of crypto, like Bitcoin, are very hard for governments to control because they are fully decentralized. “There’s only so much we can do,” she said. In short, the UK is choosing a balanced and practical way to manage crypto, fitting it into old rules, not creating brand-new ones. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

44235422,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157594,1746538207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price: Impending Volatility Looms Amidst Surging Open Interest,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-volatility/,"The world of cryptocurrency trading is a dynamic and often unpredictable space, where market signals can shift rapidly. Recently, the focus has been squarely on the Bitcoin price , which has seen a significant rally. However, a fascinating observation from institutional crypto services provider Matrixport suggests that this upward movement might be reaching a critical juncture, potentially setting the stage for a much larger move in the crypto market . According to Matrixport’s May 6 Chart of the Day shared on X, Bitcoin has enjoyed a nearly 25% rally. This price appreciation has been accompanied by a substantial increase in futures open interest , climbing from $22 billion to a significant $29 billion. Normally, a strong rally coupled with rising open interest would suggest that traders are aggressively opening new long positions, betting on further price increases. However, the Matrixport analysis highlights a peculiar detail: the funding rate has remained relatively flat during this period. Understanding the Key Indicators: Open Interest and Funding Rate To fully grasp the implications of Matrixport’s observation, it’s essential to understand the two key metrics they highlight: open interest and the funding rate . What is Open Interest and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin Price? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. It represents the total number of positions (both long and short) that are currently open in the market. Think of it as a measure of market participation and liquidity for a specific asset like Bitcoin in the derivatives market. Rising Open Interest: Generally indicates increasing market activity and new money flowing into the market for that specific asset. It can suggest strengthening conviction among traders, whether they are opening new long or short positions. Falling Open Interest: Suggests positions are being closed, which can happen during price consolidation or trend reversals as traders exit their positions. When the Bitcoin price is rallying, a significant increase in open interest typically implies that new long positions are being opened, adding fuel to the upward trend. However, the story becomes more complex when you factor in the funding rate . Decoding the Funding Rate: Sentiment in Bitcoin Trading The funding rate is a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts (a type of futures contract without an expiry date, common in Bitcoin trading ) to keep the contract price close to the spot price of the underlying asset. It involves periodic payments between traders holding long and short positions. Positive Funding Rate: Long position holders pay short position holders. This happens when the perpetual contract price is trading above the spot price, indicating that longs are dominant and willing to pay a premium to maintain their positions. It reflects bullish sentiment. Negative Funding Rate: Short position holders pay long position holders. This occurs when the perpetual contract price is trading below the spot price, indicating that shorts are dominant and willing to pay to maintain their positions. It reflects bearish sentiment. Flat or Near-Zero Funding Rate: Suggests a relatively balanced market sentiment between longs and shorts, or that new positions being opened are offsetting each other in terms of bias. In a strong rally, you would typically expect the funding rate to turn positive and potentially increase significantly, as longs become aggressive and dominate the market. The fact that the funding rate remained flat despite the 25% rally and surging open interest is the key anomaly pointed out by Matrixport. Matrixport’s Analysis: The Peculiar Signal According to Matrixport analyst Markus Thielen, the combination of a strong Bitcoin price rally, surging open interest , and a flat funding rate paints an intriguing picture. This setup suggests that while overall market participation is increasing (shown by rising OI), the *bias* of these new positions isn’t overwhelmingly long. Instead, the flat funding rate implies that a significant portion of the newly opened positions are actually short positions. Why would traders open short positions during a rally? Several reasons are possible: Hedging: Traders holding spot Bitcoin might be opening short futures positions to hedge against a potential pullback. Anticipating Resistance: Traders might see the current price level as strong resistance and are betting on a reversal. Arbitrage Strategies: Complex trading strategies might involve simultaneously opening long and short positions across different markets or instruments. Regardless of the exact reason, the implication, according to Matrixport, is that a large amount of capital is being deployed on the short side even as the price rises. This creates a market structure ripe for a potentially large move. Impending Volatility: What Could Happen Next? The scenario described by Matrixport sets up a classic tension in the market. With a significant amount of open interest represented by short positions near a resistance level, two primary outcomes become more likely, each leading to substantial volatility for the Bitcoin price : Scenario 1: The Short Squeeze (Potential Upside) If the Bitcoin price manages to break decisively above the current resistance level, these newly opened short positions will start to incur losses. As losses mount, short sellers may be forced to buy Bitcoin in the market to close their positions and limit their losses. This forced buying pressure, in turn, pushes the price up further, triggering more short sellers to cover, creating a cascading effect known as a ‘short squeeze’. A short squeeze can lead to rapid and aggressive upward price movements, potentially accelerating the existing rally. The large volume of trapped short positions provides significant potential fuel for such a move. Scenario 2: The Pullback (Potential Downside) Alternatively, if the resistance holds and the Bitcoin price fails to break higher, or if negative news or broader market sentiment shifts, the price could start to pull back. In this scenario, the short positions that were opened near the top of the rally would become profitable. As the price declines, these short sellers may add to their positions or simply hold them, reinforcing the downward pressure. A pullback would validate the bearish bets made by these short sellers and could lead to a more significant correction in the crypto market , potentially unwinding some of the recent gains. Matrixport’s analysis, therefore, points not necessarily to a guaranteed direction, but to the high probability of a sharp move occurring soon, as the market resolves the tension between the rising price and the accumulation of short positions. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Trading This market setup presents both opportunities and challenges for those involved in Bitcoin trading and the broader crypto market . Challenges: Uncertainty: Predicting which scenario (short squeeze or pullback) will unfold is impossible. The market could go either way quickly. Speed: Crypto markets, especially during periods of high leverage and open interest, can move very rapidly, making it difficult to react in time. Liquidation Risks: For traders using leverage, being on the wrong side of a large move can lead to swift liquidations. Actionable Insights (Not Financial Advice): Given the potential for increased volatility, traders and investors might consider the following: Risk Management is Crucial: Ensure any positions are appropriately sized relative to your overall portfolio. Avoid excessive leverage. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: If you have open positions, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market moves against you. Consider Both Scenarios: Have a plan for what you will do if the price breaks significantly higher (e.g., take profit, trail stops) and what you will do if it pulls back sharply (e.g., look for entry points, manage existing positions). Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, sentiment, and on-chain data that could influence the next move. Understand Your Strategy: Whether you are a long-term investor or a short-term trader, this period of potential volatility requires adherence to your pre-defined strategy rather than making impulsive decisions. The flat funding rate amidst rising open interest is a contrarian signal during a rally, suggesting that caution and preparedness are warranted for anyone participating in Bitcoin trading . Looking Ahead: What This Means for the Crypto Market Bitcoin’s movements often set the tone for the entire crypto market . A significant move in either direction for Bitcoin price is likely to have ripple effects across altcoins and other digital assets. If a short squeeze occurs, we could see renewed bullish momentum spread throughout the market. Conversely, a sharp pullback in Bitcoin could trigger declines across the board. This period highlights the importance of analyzing not just price charts but also underlying market data like open interest and funding rates to gain a more complete picture of market positioning and potential future moves. Conclusion: Brace for Impact Matrixport’s analysis provides a compelling insight into the current state of the Bitcoin trading landscape. The juxtaposition of a strong rally and surging open interest with a stagnant funding rate suggests that a significant number of traders are betting against the rally at current levels by opening short positions. This creates a volatile environment where the market is poised for a potentially sharp move. Whether this tension is resolved by a powerful short squeeze pushing the Bitcoin price significantly higher or a decisive pullback that validates the short sellers’ bets remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the conditions are in place for increased volatility. Traders and investors should exercise caution, prioritize risk management, and stay vigilant as the market navigates this critical phase.

To read full editions, subscribe . M&A szn’s still going strong — and this morning’s announcement that Trident and IntoTheBlock are merging is yet another sign of the consolidation we’re seeing. If you’re not familiar with the two, IntoTheBlock is a financial services platform designed for institutional DeFi investors, and Trident Digital offers services from lending to advisory. The firms will now become Sentora, and the goal of the new joint entity is to cater to funds, treasuries, and other institutional investors in DeFi. Basically, they want to create an ecosystem focused on the needs of institutions to push into DeFi. Trident’s Anthony DeMartino will take the helm of Sentora. (If he sounds familiar to you, he was also former head of risk strategies at Coinbase.) “Through our strategic partnerships with industry leaders, we are developing a suite of products that address the key blockers preventing institutional adoption of DeFi,” DeMartino said. “The future of finance is decentralized — but not disorganized,” he added. And, honestly, what a fun way to put it. Meanwhile, IntoTheBlock’s CEO Jesús Rodríguez will take the helm as CTO. But the merger isn’t the only news they announced. They also raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by New Form Capital, with Joint Effects and Tribe Capital. Ripple was noted as a strategic ecosystem investor. “Institutional capital won’t move into DeFi without strong risk management and compliance frameworks. Sentora provides both — without sacrificing performance,” New Form’s Alex Marinier noted. So let’s zoom out. We’re seeing a rise in these types of M&A deals, in which crypto firms are looking to create a platform that can cater to multiple needs for clients, like institutional investors. We’re also just plain seeing an uptick in M&A activity. That’s a trend I wouldn’t expect to go away anytime soon. Let’s take a look at some ( brand-spanking-new ) data from Blockworks Research, shall we? No, literally. This is fresh out the oven as of yesterday afternoon. Yay. You can see above that finance is one of the top sectors to consolidate. This makes sense because we’re going to see a lot more competition as this space heats up and institutional investors look to find a platform that can meet most of their needs. Who wants to have multiple platforms when you can find one that fulfills your needs, right? It simplifies it, and projects will cater to what the market’s looking for (see the deal above). As you can see, crypto deal activity is starting to pick up. Just remember: we’re likely going to stay a ways off from those crazy 2021 levels for a while. Get the news in your inbox.

Institutional appetite remains firm, with spot Bitcoin ETFs drawing over 4.5 billion in net inflows between April 22 and May 2. Such sustained inflows, particularly during a consolidation period, often indicate an upcoming directional move. Futures markets echo that sentiment. Open interest has climbed to 669,090 BTC, according to CoinGlass—marking a 21% increase since March 5. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange alone now hosts over 13.5 billion in BTC futures contracts. Institutional demand—whether for risk exposure or hedging—continues to build confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term allocation. Key institutional signals: Spot ETF inflows: 4.5 billion in just 10 days Open interest up 21% since March CME futures top 13.5 billion Policy Delays and Market Sentiment; Bitcoin Supported? Investor sentiment remains cautious after enthusiasm surrounding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill faded. Since its March 6 announcement, no follow-up disclosures have materialized, leaving markets in the dark on potential government accumulation. Similarly, Bitcoin-related legislation at the state level, including in Arizona, has failed to gain traction. Despite the political uncertainty, institutional positioning hasn’t stalled. On May 5, Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, added 1,895 BTC —shortly after announcing an 84 billion capital expansion plan. This move reinforces long-term conviction in Bitcoin, even after a 5% decline over the past three months.

Gold rose 16% during the same window, while the S&P 500 fell 6.5%, putting pressure on Bitcoin’s status as a non-correlated asset. Geopolitical friction, particularly between the U.S. and China, has further prompted investors to seek safety in cash and fixed income. Still, Bitcoin dominance is rising. It now represents 70% of the total crypto market cap—its highest share since January 2021—reflecting increased investor preference for lower-risk digital assets. Bitcoin Technical Picture: Breakout or Breakdown? Bitcoin is currently trading just below a descending trendline from May 2, with the 50-period EMA at 94,972 acting as overhead resistance. The MACD remains in negative territory, signaling fading momentum. Immediate support is located at 92,922, followed by deeper levels at 91,895 and 90,999. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Trade Setup: Sell below 92,900 → Target: 91,900 | Stop: 94,300 Buy above 95,000 → Target: 96,500 | Stop: 94,000 Traders should wait for a confirmed breakout or breakdown before entering positions. The current compression suggests that any move outside this range could be significant. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.36M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.34 million in funds raised as it nears its $6.07 million presale cap. Priced at $0.002495, the token has positioned itself as more than just a meme coin—offering real utility through flexible, high-yield staking. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards.

44235836,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157593,1746538810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Forex Alert: UBS Issues Critical Update to EUR/USD and EUR/PLN Forecasts,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ubs-forex-forecast-update/,"For anyone tracking global markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrency, understanding currency movements is fundamental. Major shifts in key pairs like EUR USD and EUR PLN can ripple through international trade, investment, and even sentiment towards risk assets. That’s why updates from leading financial institutions like UBS are closely watched. UBS has recently released revised UBS forecasts for these two significant currency pairs, suggesting potential shifts on the horizon. Let’s dive into what these changes mean and the factors driving them. Why UBS Forex Forecasts Matter in Currency Predictions In the complex landscape of foreign exchange, accurate currency predictions are gold. Institutions like UBS employ vast teams of economists and analysts to model future currency movements based on a multitude of factors. Their forecasts aren’t just academic exercises; they inform trading strategies for institutional clients, guide investment decisions, and provide a benchmark for market expectations. When a major player like UBS adjusts its outlook, it signals that underlying economic or policy conditions may be shifting, potentially impacting everything from import costs to investment returns. Understanding these forecasts helps market participants anticipate trends and manage risk. For those in the crypto space, recognizing these macro currency shifts can offer valuable context for global liquidity and investor behavior. UBS’s Revised EUR/USD Outlook: What Changed? The EUR USD pair is arguably the most traded currency pair globally, making any significant forecast revision highly impactful. UBS’s latest update includes notable adjustments to their projections for this pair over the coming months and quarters. Previously, UBS may have held a certain view based on prevailing economic data and central bank stances. The new UBS forecasts reflect a reassessment of these factors. While specific target levels and timeframes would be detailed in the full UBS report, the general direction of the revision is what captures market attention. For instance, has UBS become more bullish (expecting EUR to strengthen against USD) or more bearish (expecting EUR to weaken)? The rationale provided by UBS typically centers on comparative economic growth outlooks between the Eurozone and the United States, divergent monetary policy paths of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), and geopolitical risks. Key changes often highlighted include: Adjustments to near-term (e.g., 3-month) targets. Revisions to medium-term (e.g., 6-month or 12-month) projections. Changes in the expected trajectory or pace of movement. These changes signal UBS’s updated conviction on which economy is likely to outperform, which central bank is likely to hike or cut rates faster, or how global risk sentiment might impact safe-haven flows into or out of the US Dollar. Diving into the EUR/PLN Currency Predictions While perhaps less globally prominent than EUR/USD, the EUR PLN pair is crucial for investors and businesses operating within or with exposure to Poland and the Eurozone. The relationship between the Euro and the Polish Zloty is influenced by distinct factors, including Poland’s domestic economic performance, the policies of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), and political developments within Poland and the EU, in addition to broader Eurozone dynamics. UBS’s revised Forex forecast for EUR PLN indicates their updated view on the relative strength of the Zloty against the Euro. Factors influencing this could include: Poland’s inflation outlook and the NBP’s stance on interest rates. Poland’s economic growth trajectory compared to the Eurozone average. Capital flows into or out of Poland. Political stability and EU relations. A revision in the EUR/PLN forecast could imply UBS sees a change in the fundamental factors supporting or weakening the Polish Zloty relative to the Euro. This is particularly important for investors considering investments in Polish assets or companies with significant Eurozone trade exposure. Key Drivers Behind UBS’s Forecast Updates What prompts a major institution like UBS to change its currency predictions ? It’s rarely a single factor but rather a confluence of evolving economic indicators, policy shifts, and global events. The primary drivers behind the latest UBS forecasts likely include: 1. Evolving Monetary Policy Expectations: Central banks like the Fed, ECB, and NBP are constantly recalibrating their approaches based on inflation, employment, and growth data. Changes in expected interest rate paths are powerful drivers of currency values. If UBS now expects the Fed to cut rates sooner or later than previously thought, it directly impacts their EUR USD forecast. Similarly, shifts in the NBP’s policy outlook affect EUR PLN . 2. Changes in Economic Growth Outlooks: Relative economic performance is key. If UBS revises down its growth forecast for the Eurozone while maintaining or upgrading the US outlook, it typically weighs on EUR/USD. Conversely, a stronger outlook for Poland relative to the Eurozone could support the PLN against the EUR. 3. Inflation Dynamics: Persistent high inflation or a rapid disinflation trend can force central banks to act, influencing currency values. UBS’s updated view on inflation in the US, Eurozone, and Poland is a critical input. 4. Geopolitical and Political Factors: Global events, trade tensions, political stability, and elections can introduce uncertainty and impact investor sentiment, leading to currency volatility and shifts in perceived risk. 5. Capital Flows: Investment trends, whether into equity markets, bond markets, or direct foreign investment, influence demand for currencies. UBS’s view on potential capital movements is integrated into their models. These factors are interconnected, and UBS’s analysts synthesize this complex information to arrive at their updated Forex forecast . Implications for Traders and Investors UBS’s revised currency predictions have practical implications for various market participants: Forex Traders: These forecasts can serve as a guide for developing trading strategies, identifying potential entry or exit points, and managing risk exposure in EUR/USD and EUR/PLN pairs. While not guaranteed outcomes, they represent a significant institutional view. Portfolio Managers: Investors with exposure to European or Polish assets need to consider the potential impact of currency movements on their returns. A weaker PLN, for example, would reduce the Euro value of Polish investments for a Eurozone investor. Businesses: Companies involved in international trade with the Eurozone, the US, or Poland can use these forecasts to inform hedging strategies and manage foreign exchange risk on transactions. Crypto Investors: While seemingly separate, macro currency dynamics influence global liquidity and risk appetite. A strong USD, for instance, can sometimes correlate with pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Understanding these shifts provides broader market context. It’s important to remember that forecasts are just that – predictions based on current information and models. The market can and often does move in unexpected ways due to unforeseen events. Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Market with UBS Forecasts UBS’s updated UBS forecasts for EUR USD and EUR PLN provide valuable insights into how a major financial institution views the path forward for these key currency pairs. The revisions are driven by a careful analysis of economic data, central bank policies, and global events. While these currency predictions should be considered alongside other analyses and independent research, they offer a critical perspective for anyone involved in the Forex market or navigating the broader global financial landscape. Staying informed about such institutional forecasts is a key part of developing a robust understanding of market dynamics and making more informed decisions, whether you’re trading Forex, investing in international markets, or simply keeping an eye on the macro environment that influences assets like cryptocurrencies.

Here's Why….",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/shocking-statements-from-us-billionaire-investor-bitcoin-btc-reserve-will-never-be-realized-heres-why/,"Amid US President Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin reserve moves, some notable statements came from Shark Tank host Kevin O’Leary. At this point, Kevin O’Leary stated that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal will not come to life despite strong advocacy from industry leaders such as Michael Saylor. Famous name Kevin O'Leary discussed the BTC reserve issue in a program with SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci. While two famous names expressed opposing views on the Bitcoin reserve, they were asked whether the Bitcoin reserve would benefit the US economy. While Scaramucci supports the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, Kevin O'Leary stated that the reserve idea will not happen. Kevin O'Leary has categorically rejected the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, stating that the bill would not receive bipartisan support. The famous name, who also criticized Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, claimed that Saylor's aggressive Bitcoin strategy was selfish. “Michael Saylor talks about his own book,” O'Leary said. O’Leary also emphasized that Strategy sold stock, preferred stock, and debt to buy Bitcoin, noting that its shares were trading at twice the value of the company’s underlying Bitcoin holdings. The famous name also argued that such a BTC model lacked long-term viability. Instead, O’Leary emphasized that the likely regulatory focus in the near term is stablecoin regulation. According to him, a U.S. stablecoin law seems more likely than a BTC reserve. Anthony Scaramucci, however, disagreed with O'Leary, saying the bill would benefit the economy. MicroStrategy President Michael Saylor, on the other hand, states that the US could potentially earn $106 trillion by gradually purchasing Bitcoin within the reserve. *This is not investment advice.

Bridging Resource Gaps in Education The initiative, unveiled on May 5 during Teacher Appreciation Week, aims to address longstanding resource shortages and growing public dissatisfaction across American K-12 education through partnerships with DonorsChoose and Teach For America. A 2024 Gallup survey highlighted that 55% of U.S. parents and adults are unhappy with the quality of schooling nationwide, underscoring persistent concerns about funding gaps and access to classroom essentials. Ripple’s initiative seeks to directly tackle these challenges by supplying critical resources to teachers, students, and school staff. Ripple stated, “In a first-of-its-kind initiative, DonorsChoose and Teach For America will accept the majority of the $25 million grant in Ripple USD (RLUSD), Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin.” This unique approach not only provides immediate support to classrooms but also introduces crypto-enabled payments into the nonprofit sector on a significant scale. Expanding the Use of Stablecoins in Philanthropy Stablecoins have rapidly become a preferred medium for on-chain transactions, accounting for more than 50% of blockchain transaction volumes, according to recent data from Chainalysis. The adoption of RLUSD by major education-focused nonprofits signals increasing institutional confidence in stablecoins as reliable and efficient instruments for charitable funding. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, emphasized the strategic alignment of the initiative with the company’s broader mission, saying, “Ripple has always championed financial and educational access for all, and we’re partnering with some of the most impactful organizations – Donorschoose and Teach For America – to benefit thousands of classrooms across the U.S.” Supporting Nationwide Educational Programs The $25 million commitment will be distributed primarily during Teacher Appreciation Week and will fund several targeted initiatives. These include supporting classroom projects, launching a nationwide STEM Innovation Challenge, and scaling up tutoring services and teacher training programs. Additionally, Teach For America plans to utilize the funds to expand its Reinvention Lab and offer financial support to incoming corps members. A Broader Call to Action Ripple’s donation underscores its commitment to education and economic empowerment through blockchain technology. The initiative also encourages broader participation within the crypto community. The company noted, “Those interested in fueling the future of teachers and K-12 classrooms can donate RLUSD, XRP and other cryptocurrencies via The Giving Block.” As crypto-enabled payments continue to gain traction, Ripple’s education initiative stands as a demonstration of how stablecoins can be harnessed for social impact, offering a model for future philanthropic efforts in underserved sectors.

The memecoin mania that broke out over the Solana network has kept the trading activity elevated. Besides, Axiom exchange surpasses Pumpfun to become the top revenue-generating protocol on Solana over the past 7 days. Moreover, Solana DApps accumulated more than $162 million in revenue in April, hinting towards a growing ecosystem. In the times when Solana has been outperforming every other chain in revenue generation for Q1 2025, will SOL price outpace the top tokens and demonstrate a mammoth price action in Q2 2025? Regardless of the short-term hindrances, the Solana price has been maintaining a strong bullish trend in the long term and flashing massive bullish signals. The price is trying hard to recover and enter the rising parallel channel that it had lost during the recent bearish action. Meanwhile, the weekly CMF, which dropped below 0 for the first time since 2023, has triggered a bullish divergence and is working hard to rise within the bullish range. On the other hand, the MACD is also supporting a bullish narrative, with the indicator showing a drop in the selling pressure and the levels heading towards a bullish crossover. Therefore, the Solana price is expected to consolidate around $145 for a while as the weekly volume has dropped significantly. Once the volume breaks out, the Solana price is expected to revive a strong upswing and enter the channel that may further help in achieving higher targets, probably at $200.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 13:44:31

MyDoge, the development team behind DogeOS – the leading application layer for the Dogecoin ecosystem – has announced the successful capital raise of $6.9 million to expand the DogeOS ecosystem. The latest funding round was led by Polychain Capital, a premier investment firm focused on Web 3 projects. According to the team, the investment is expected to fuel the expansion of DogeOS, empowering developers to build the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Dogecoin blockchain. Over the past few years, Dogecoin has been mainly viewed as a memecoin, only useful for trading, speculation, and tipping. DogeOS aims to change the narrative, bringing real-world solutions to the network, allowing developers to build a wide range of consumer apps, from gaming to artificial intelligence and finance. In his statements following the investment, Luke Pearson, Partner at Polychain Capital, recognized the potential of DogeOS as a “game-changing platform” for the eighth-largest crypto ecosystem. Notwithstanding, Pearson believes DogeOS will strengthen the network, advancing $DOGE as the people’s currency. “Its ability to support a diverse range of applications, from gaming to AI, positions it as a critical layer for the future of decentralized innovation,” he added. “We’re excited to support DogeOS in building a network that truly belongs to its community.” Transforming Dogecoin Into A Fully-Fledged Ecosystem Since its launch nearly a decade ago, Doge has grown into the largest memecoin, garnering support from Web 3 leaders and Elon Musk. However, development on the blockchain has remained rather stagnant despite the community boasting 10 million+ holders. With the growth of DogeOS, users will gain the ability to utilize the blockchain through the “most user-friendly and consumer-facing application layer”. The capital infusion will help DogeOS redefine how communities engage with Dogecoin. The $6.9 million raised will be allocated to launching the DogeOS platform, expanding developer tools, and forging partnerships to drive adoption. The investment will help launch key initiatives across DogeOS ecosystem, including the launch of X-native applications and integrations to support next-generation AI and DeFi. Moreover, the application layer will extend the real-world solutions that $DOGE offers, creating a fun, inclusive and revolutionary digital economy. “Dogecoin has always been about community and culture – DogeOS is bridging the gap between Dogecoin’s massive consumer community and real on-chain innovation,” said Jordan Jefferson, CEO of MyDoge, the team behind DogeOS. Unlocking Next-Gen Apps For Dogecoin DogeOS is designed to expand Dogecoin’s use cases, creating a platform where “community, culture, and liquidity come together to power the next generation of consumer apps”, its website reads. As a pioneer in the Dogecoin ecosystem, DogeOS will enable the development of a Dogecoin-based DeFi ecosystem and introduce yield-bearing opportunities on the blockchain. This will allow $DOGE holders to engage in decentralized finance directly with their Dogecoin and earn rewards. “With over half a million users trusting MyDoge as their preferred wallet, we’ve seen firsthand the community’s demand for native Dogecoin experiences,” Jefferson added. “DogeOS delivers on that demand – unlocking new use cases, more creativity, and a future where DOGE is built into everything.” By building an application layer, DogeOS provides a vibrant platform for games, apps, and innovative DeFi strategies, all built on Dogecoin’s blockchain. This App Layer transforms DOGE into a dynamic asset, offering seamless access to yield farming, stablecoin integration, and other cutting-edge financial tools.

While continuing its core business of Bitcoin mining , the company has strategically reduced its Crypto holdings to fortify its financial position and venture into the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. What Did DMG Blockchain Announce in April? According to a press release issued on May 5th via GlobeNewswire, DMG Blockchain mined 30 Bitcoin (BTC) in April 2024. This figure represents a slight decrease compared to the 32 BTC mined in March. More significantly, the report highlighted a substantial reduction in the company’s Crypto holdings . DMG’s total BTC reserves declined from 458 BTC to 351 BTC during the period. This decrease wasn’t primarily due to mining less, but rather a deliberate decision involving the partial liquidation of its digital assets. Why Did DMG’s Crypto Holdings Decrease So Much? The primary driver behind the reduction in Crypto holdings was a strategic financial maneuver. The proceeds generated from selling a portion of their Bitcoin reserves were allocated to two key areas: Loan Repayment: A significant portion was used to repay a $20 million loan from Sygnum Bank. Eliminating this debt strengthens the company’s balance sheet and reduces financial leverage. AI Infrastructure Investment: Funds were also directed towards acquiring 2 megawatts (MW) of prefabricated AI infrastructure designed for data centers. This investment signals DMG’s intent to diversify its business beyond traditional Bitcoin mining . This dual-purpose use of liquidated assets underscores a strategic pivot aimed at enhancing financial stability while simultaneously investing in future growth opportunities outside its historical core business. Navigating the Pivot: From Bitcoin Mining to AI Infrastructure For years, DMG Blockchain has been primarily known as a Bitcoin mining operator. The industry is capital-intensive and heavily reliant on the price of Bitcoin and energy costs. By investing in AI infrastructure , DMG is aiming to tap into a different, rapidly growing market: providing high-performance computing power for AI applications. This strategic pivot presents both opportunities and challenges: Potential Benefits: Diversification: Reduces reliance solely on Bitcoin’s volatility. High-Growth Market: The demand for AI compute is exploding, offering potential for new revenue streams. Leveraging Existing Expertise: Managing large-scale data centers for mining provides relevant experience for AI infrastructure. Improved Financial Health: The loan repayment significantly de-risks the company. Potential Challenges: Competition: The AI infrastructure market is competitive, involving tech giants and specialized providers. Execution Risk: Successfully building and operating AI data centers requires different expertise than just Bitcoin mining . Capital Requirements: While this initial investment is funded, scaling AI operations will require substantial capital. Timing of Crypto Sales: Selling Crypto holdings means missing out on potential future price appreciation of Bitcoin. Why Repay the Loan Now? The decision to fully repay the $20 million Sygnum Bank loan is a strong indicator of DMG’s focus on financial prudence. Eliminating debt improves key financial ratios, potentially makes the company more attractive to investors, and provides greater flexibility for future initiatives. It also removes interest payment obligations, freeing up cash flow. What Does This Mean for DMG’s Future? The April report paints a picture of a company actively transforming itself. While still committed to Bitcoin mining , the significant investment in AI infrastructure signals a clear intention to evolve into a more diversified technology company. The reduction in Crypto holdings is a necessary step to fund this transition and strengthen the balance sheet through loan repayment . Investors and market observers will be watching closely to see how successfully DMG executes its AI strategy and how this new venture integrates with its existing Bitcoin mining operations. This move positions DMG Blockchain at the intersection of two of the most dynamic technological fields today: blockchain and artificial intelligence. In Conclusion DMG Blockchain ‘s April report highlights a strategic and decisive period for the company. By partially liquidating Crypto holdings , the firm successfully completed a major loan repayment and funded its entry into the promising AI infrastructure market. This pivot signifies a deliberate effort to diversify revenue streams and enhance financial stability beyond its core Bitcoin mining activities. While the transition comes with its own set of challenges, the move positions DMG to potentially capitalize on the explosive growth in AI compute demand, marking a significant evolution in its business model.

As highlighted by All Things XRP , Ripple’s initiatives in the region are not merely regional advancements but represent a comprehensive strategy to integrate blockchain technology into mainstream financial systems. Establishing a Stronghold in Dubai In 2020, Ripple established its Middle East and North Africa (MENA) headquarters in Dubai’s Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), attracted by the region’s progressive regulatory environment and its status as a global financial hub. This move laid the foundation for Ripple’s expansive operations in the Middle East. RIPPLE JUST PULLED OFF THE BIGGEST POWER MOVE IN CRYPTO—INSIDE A $400B TRADE HUB. Here’s your 1-MINUTE UPDATE on Ripple’s full-scale takeover across the UAE. Ripple’s MENA HQ has been in Dubai’s DIFC since 2020—now it's turning into a crypto command center. By… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 5, 2025 Pioneering Regulatory Milestones By March 2025, Ripple achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first blockchain-enabled payments provider to obtain a license from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This license authorizes Ripple to offer fully regulated cross-border crypto payments within the UAE, tapping into the country’s $40 billion remittance market. Strategic Partnerships and Infrastructure Development Ripple’s collaboration with a leading Abu Dhabi bank in February 2025 marked the launch of an XRP-powered remittance corridor, enhancing the efficiency of cross-border payments in one of the world’s most lucrative remittance markets. Additionally, Ripple’s partnership with the DIFC Innovation Hub in August 2024 aims to foster blockchain innovation by supporting startups building on the XRP Ledger.

Furthermore, Ripple is investing $10 million into tokenized real-world asset projects, positioning the UAE as a launchpad for these initiatives. Global Licensing and Regulatory Clarity With over 60 global licenses, Ripple’s UAE operations serve as a model for integrating cryptocurrency into regulated financial systems. CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized the significance of regulatory clarity in driving unprecedented growth, stating, “We’re entering an unprecedented period of growth driven by regulatory clarity.” Ripple’s comprehensive strategy in the UAE underscores the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize global finance. By establishing a strong regulatory foundation, forming strategic partnerships, and investing in innovation and education, Ripple is not only enhancing its presence in the Middle East but also setting a precedent for global cryptocurrency adoption.

The global cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.4% over the past 24 hours, currently standing at $3.01 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $72.1 billion, still trending downwards. All top 10 coins are red today. Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP recorded the highest decreases. They are down 3% and 2.3% to the prices of $0.1657 and $2.1, respectively. The smallest decrease is 0.1% by Binance Coin (BNB) , meaning it’s unchanged, now trading at $594. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 0.5%, currently trading at $93,813, while Ethereum (ETH) fell 1.9%, now changing hands at $1,770. Looking at the top 100 coins per market cap, we find 12 green today. The day’s best performer is Monero (XMR) , having increased by 3.2% to $286.

This integration enables $150 million worth of institutional-grade assets to become composable in DeFi for the first time, the teams claim. RWAs surged over 500% in the past year, exceeding $20 billion. Yet, they’ve been missing scalable, secure, and composable price feeds. However, as the official oracle partner for Securitize, RedStone says it provides secure, gas-optimized price feeds for all of their tokenized assets, live across any chain.

""BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of bitcoin and ether since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,"" wrote Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research. Kendrick expects this relationship to hold and BNB to increase from its current price of around $600 to $2,775 by the end of 2028. As long as Binance remains one of the largest centralized exchanges (CEX), ""BNB's value drivers are unlikely to change anytime soon,"" Kendrick said, and this means the token could potentially serve as a benchmark for digital assets. BNB Chain is used almost entirely for decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending protocols and for liquid staking, he noted, meaning it is a ""more concentrated and ‘old-fashioned’ smart contract platform than rivals such as Ethereum and Avalanche."".

From Brazil to Spain to Latin America, Meerkat is proving that meme culture, when combined with real utility, can build something far greater than just price speculation. A Miniapp That’s Driving Viral Adoption One of the biggest drivers of Meerkat’s international success is the launch of its Telegram Miniapp , a game-like application where users can play, earn, complete quests, refer friends, and climb the leaderboard to unlock daily $MERK rewards. This lightweight platform is fully integrated with Telegram and has already become a gateway for thousands of new users entering the ecosystem. The Tap-to-Earn format and referral system are helping Meerkat grow organically, especially in countries where Telegram usage is high. Brazil, Spain, LATAM: Community Taking Over Meerkat’s presence is growing rapidly across multiple regions, with local content creators and influencers helping spread the word. In Brazil, several crypto YouTubers have begun posting reviews and walkthroughs of the Miniapp and staking features. In Spain and Latin America, Meerkat has built an active Spanish-speaking community on Telegram and X, with daily updates, memes, and engagement challenges. The multilingual Miniapp experience and low barrier to entry make Meerkat accessible to non-technical users around the world. This combination of real interaction + easy onboarding is what sets Meerkat apart from other meme projects. Press, Audits, and Ecosystem Momentum Meerkat has also been featured in top-tier crypto media outlets, including: Bitcoin.com WalletInvestor Crypto.ro Blockonomi Meanwhile, $MERK has passed security audits with Certik and Cyberscope, adding a layer of trust that supports international adoption. Listings on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, AscendEX, and P2B are further signs of growing reach. A Global Movement Backed by Real Incentives With a verified APR over 3000%, more than 33 million tokens staked, and a rapidly growing presale that spans multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Base), Meerkat isn’t just attracting attention, it’s building long-term believers. The project’s updated 2025 roadmap includes: DAO governance Meme AI content via The Burrow NFT/DeFi integrations Global marketing campaigns More gamified features In short, Meerkat is not just a memecoin, it’s a global, community-powered Web3 platform. 🔗 Website: https://meerkat.wtf Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

44236376,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=395467,1746539966,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/44236376.jpeg,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Surpasses Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in This Key Metric: Details,https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-surpasses-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-in-this-key-metric-details/,"TL;DR Shiba Inu boasts a strong holder base, with a big chunk of its 1.5 million+ investors holding the asset for over a year. Despite a 9% weekly dip, SHIB may be primed for a rebound, fueled by a spike in token burns, the advancement of Shibarium, and rising exchange outflows. SHIB is Ahead on This Front Shiba Inu (SHIB) was launched in the summer of 2020 as a meme coin with a dubious utility and largely driven by community hype. In the past few years, though, the project evolved into a more ambitious ecosystem with serious development goals. This could be among the reasons why the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with the number of its holders recently exceeding 1.5 million. A thorough look at IntoTheBlock’s data shows that around 78% of those investors have hopped on the bandwagon more than a year ago. 20% have done so in the last 12 months, whereas only 2% have entered the ecosystem in the last 30 days. In comparison, around 75% of Bitcoin (BTC ) holders have held their assets for over a year – a figure that’s nearly identical for Ethereum (ETH) investors. The large share of long-term Shiba Inu holders signals a committed investor base, which is typically considered less likely to sell impulsively during turbulent times. It’s worth noting that a significant portion of these investors could have entered the market in 2021 when SHIB skyrocketed to prominence amid its explosive price surge. With the token now trading well below those peak levels, many of them may be currently sitting at unrealized losses. According to IntoTheBlock’s data, almost 60% of all Shiba Inu investors remain underwater. 37% are in the green, while 4% are breaking even. SHIB Holders in Profit, Source: ITB Time for a Pump? While SHIB’s price has suffered a 9% weekly decline, certain elements hint at an upcoming resurgence. One example is the burn rate, which has increased by over 350% in the last seven days. The total amount of scorched tokens since adopting the program in 2022 is more than 410 trillion, meaning there are around 584.4 trillion in circulation, according to this SHIB tracker . Reducing the overall supply makes the asset more scarce and could make it more valuable. However, this needs to be combined with a non-declining demand. Other factors suggesting a possible revival are the development of Shibarium and the recent SHIB exchange netflow. The layer-2 blockchain solution has recently passed numerous major milestones, with some industry participants predicting a significant price jump for the meme coin in the event of further advancement. For its part, SHIB exchange outflows have dominated inflows in the past several days, signaling a shift toward self-custody methods and reduced selling pressure.

SEC case update: May 6, 2025",https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-case-update-may-6-2025/,"Summary ⚈ Ripple claims the SEC officially withdrew its appeal, though the SEC remains silent. ⚈ XRP is trading at $2.09, down 2.54% daily but up 0.65% YTD. ⚈ Despite resistance at $2.20, long bets rise, and whales continue accumulating XRP. The latest news regarding the Ripple v. SEC case has come from Ripple Labs, and it has caused a bit of a stir in the cryptocurrency market. On May 5, Ripple Labs published its Q1 2025 XRP markets report . Under “Key Highlights”, the report states the following: “The SEC officially withdrew its appeal, closing the chapter on a multi-year legal saga that tested the limits of regulatory overreach and the war on crypto.” As noted by cryptocurrency lawyer Bill Morgan in a May 6 X post , this is the first statement made by Ripple — not Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse, which details the lawsuit as withdrawn. “Odd though that the report states the SEC has officially withdrawn its appeal when the SEC commissioners, as far as we know have not voted yet on the matters.” Odd though that the report states the SEC has officially withdrawn its appeal when the SEC commissioners as far as we know have not voted yet on the matters /2 pic.twitter.com/npxaFX4WWF — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 6, 2025 Indeed, as of the time of writing, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not made any public statements regarding the matter — and even Ripple’s report cites Garlinghouse’s March 19 X post by way of which the news was broken. Will the latest Ripple v. SEC case update have an effect on XRP prices? While the discrepancy between Ripple Labs’ statement and the way that the SEC is handling affairs is notable, it is most likely not a cause for concern. The odds of Garlinghouse having made a false statement to the public, particularly at the beginning of a pro-crypto administration in the White House, are minuscule. The likeliest explanation is that a deal has been reached regarding the Ripple v. SEC case — but that the commission is holding off on making the final decision public until it is in a better position to introduce regulatory clarity. In addition, as outlined by crypto lawyer James Farrell, a former SEC employee, the procedural steps involved in bringing the matter to a close, legally speaking, will most likely see the case drag on until October — and that’s in the best case scenario. As of press time on May 6, XRP was trading at $2.09, having marked a 2.54% loss on the daily chart which has brought year-to-date (YTD) returns to 0.65%. XRP price 1-day and year-to-date (YTD) chart.

44236455,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=744696,1746540015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/44236455.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Predicts How High XRP Could Soar If Bitcoin Hits $250,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/how-high-xrp-could-soar-if-bitcoin-hits-250000/,"In a post on X, crypto analyst Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) laid out a detailed road map for the XRP/BTC pair that hinges on both the thickness of the monthly Ichimoku cloud and Bitcoin’s eventual trajectory toward six-figure territory. The analyst’s working target is a test of 5,200 satoshis by June—a level that “must fight three obstacles at the same time: the quarterly Kijun Sen, a bearish TK cross with a decent gap between Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen, and the Chikou Span resistance,” he wrote. As a result, he assigns “around 90 percent” odds that the first assault on that level will fail to close a quarterly candle above the Kijun, noting that on a three-month chart “a few candles/tries” implies a time horizon “= a year and more.” How High Can XRP Price Go? The accompanying monthly chart, shows a fat kumo acting as near-term ceiling and forming “a close confluence to the 3M Kijun Sen.” One annotation highlights “one more resistance hard to break,” while another points out that by the fourth quarter the kumo is forecast to thin dramatically, giving any later attempt “more strength due to [a] widening TK gap.” Dr Cat sees two pathways once May trading is underway. If momentum carries through and the 5,200-satoshi zone is pierced during May–June, “we attack in May and June and get $4.5-$6 then reject at least initially (but it might be also rejecting for good).” That dollar translation, he clarified, assumes Bitcoin fluctuating between $90,000 and $120,000: “If BTC is at $90K this is roughly $4.5 and if it is at $120k this is roughly $6.” Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says XRP To $10 Is Just The Start The second scenario involves the weekly chart slipping into range-bound behavior, triggering either “a complete flop” or “long consolidation (think months).” Prolonged coiling would shrink the gap between Tenkan and Kijun, erode the thickness of the monthly cloud and, crucially, dull the influence of the quarterly Kijun. “In this case,” he argued, “the chance for the moon target of 12K satoshi significantly increases.” Pushed on what that would mean in dollar terms, Dr Cat replied: “30 $ is the same, assuming BTC explodes much higher much later to $250K (probably even $270K), multiply this by 12K satoshi and you get $30.” The implication is that XRP’s upside ceiling is bound to Bitcoin’s own expansion. A parabolic run in BTC to a quarter-million dollars would effectively scale Dr Cat’s sats-denominated target into a $30 spot price for XRP—roughly a 5,000 percent rally from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Debunks $100,000 XRP ‘Dark Pool’ Theory While the analyst’s framework leans heavily on traditional Ichimoku mechanics—cloud thickness, TK gaps and Chikou Span interaction—he repeatedly cautions that quarterly resistance levels do not yield easily. Even a successful penetration this summer would likely be followed by pullbacks before a sustainable break. Conversely, the comfort of an extended base-building phase could allow XRP to confront those same resistances “significantly easier” later in the year, when the cloud is paper-thin. For traders, the message is that timing and context may matter more than the raw number. Whether XRP first taps the $4-$6 window and retreats or spends months coiling below resistance, the analyst argues that the ultimate escape velocity to double-digit prices is conditional on Bitcoin’s march past its all-time high and toward the $250,000–$270,000 band. At press time, XRP traded at $2.10.

44236520,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157648,1746540056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bitcoin Price: Crucial Warning Signs Emerge for BTC Rally, Says 10x Research",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-rally-fatigue-warning/,"Are you tracking the latest movements in the crypto market? After an impressive surge, the recent BTC rally that saw Bitcoin climb around 25% over the past month might be running out of steam. This is according to a crucial new assessment from crypto market research firm 10x Research, whose latest 10x Research report suggests traders should exercise caution. The rally was largely fueled by significant Bitcoin ETF inflows and strong institutional buying pressure, pushing the Bitcoin price higher. However, the report highlights several weakening indicators that could signal a shift in momentum, potentially leading to a period of consolidation. What Indicators Point to BTC Rally Fatigue? 10x Research points to specific on-chain and market data points that suggest the bullish momentum is softening. Understanding these indicators is key to grasping the current crypto market outlook . Narrowing Coinbase Premium: The Coinbase premium refers to the price difference between Bitcoin on the Coinbase exchange (often used by U.S. institutions) and other global exchanges. A significant positive premium often indicates strong institutional buying pressure from the U.S. The 10x Research report notes this premium is narrowing, suggesting that this specific source of demand might be decreasing or stabilizing. Declining Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts, indicating bullish sentiment and leverage. Declining or neutral funding rates suggest that bullish leverage is decreasing, and traders are less willing to pay a premium to hold long positions. This removes a potential tailwind for the BTC rally . While these indicators suggest potential fatigue, the report also touches on the options market. The options market skew, which measures the implied volatility difference between call (bullish) and put (bearish) options, still indicates some potential for upside movement. However, this bullish signal from options appears to be currently outweighed by other factors. How Are Macroeconomic Factors Influencing the Crypto Market Outlook? Beyond crypto-specific indicators, broader macroeconomic conditions are casting a shadow over market sentiment and potentially impacting the Bitcoin price . The 10x Research report specifically mentions several key areas of concern: U.S. Federal Reserve Policy: The Fed’s neutral stance ahead of its upcoming May 7th meeting is creating uncertainty. Markets are waiting for clarity on future interest rate decisions, which significantly impact risk assets like Bitcoin. A cautious stance from the Fed can dampen enthusiasm. Rising Market Volatility: Increased volatility across traditional financial markets often spills over into the crypto space. Global economic uncertainties, geopolitical events, and shifting investor sentiment contribute to this heightened volatility, making traders more cautious. Growing Concerns Over Tariffs: Trade tensions and the potential imposition of new tariffs can disrupt global supply chains and economic growth forecasts. Such concerns tend to lead investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. These external pressures combine with the internal market signals to create a complex environment for the BTC rally . What’s Next for Bitcoin Price? Consolidation Ahead? Given the confluence of weakening internal indicators and mounting external uncertainties, the 10x Research report suggests that Bitcoin may be entering a phase of consolidation. According to the report, this consolidation could occur near the $95,000 level as traders pause and await a fresh catalyst to dictate the next major move. Consolidation typically involves price trading within a relatively narrow range after a significant move. This period allows the market to digest recent gains, for supply and demand dynamics to rebalance, and for traders to look for new information or events that could trigger the next trend. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook For traders and investors, this potential shift towards consolidation and fatigue in the BTC rally presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are some takeaways: Monitor Key Indicators: Keep a close eye on metrics like the Coinbase premium, funding rates, and exchange flows. Changes in these can provide early signals of market shifts. Understand Macro Risks: Pay attention to global economic news, central bank decisions, and geopolitical developments. These factors have a real impact on crypto asset performance. Prepare for Volatility: Consolidation periods can sometimes precede increased volatility as the market builds energy for a breakout. Manage risk accordingly. Identify Potential Catalysts: What could spark the next move? This could be positive regulatory news, further institutional adoption announcements, significant technological developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, or a shift in the macroeconomic landscape. Consider Strategy: In a consolidation phase, range trading strategies might become relevant, while those waiting for a clear trend may choose to remain on the sidelines. The key challenge is the current uncertainty. Traders are essentially in a waiting game, looking for the next piece of information that will provide a clear direction for the Bitcoin price . Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Fatigue The impressive recent BTC rally was a welcome sight for many in the market, driven significantly by Bitcoin ETF inflows . However, the latest assessment from the 10x Research report serves as a crucial reminder that upward trends are rarely linear. Weakening internal market indicators, coupled with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, suggest that the immediate momentum may be fading, potentially leading to a period of consolidation as the market seeks its next direction. Staying informed about both on-chain signals and global economic factors is essential for navigating this potentially uncertain phase in the crypto market outlook .

As traditional DeFi giants like Solana (SOL) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) continue to struggle, Coldware (COLD) has caught the attention of crypto whales and investors alike. Coldware’s presale momentum is undeniable, with the token quickly rising as a viable alternative to existing DeFi players, including Solana and Pepe Coin. Coldware: The Rising Star in DeFi Coldware (COLD) is quickly positioning itself as the top alternative for DeFi investors looking to shift away from the volatility of Solana and Pepe Coin. Coldware’s presale has been making waves, with the project already securing impressive pledges. As these DeFi giants like Solana and Pepe Coin see their market positions erode, Coldware is attracting significant attention. It’s no surprise that Solana and Pepe Coin holders are diversifying their portfolios, with many choosing to move 5% of their holdings into Coldware (COLD). The reasons for Coldware’s growing popularity are clear. Unlike Solana, which is facing network issues, Coldware is focusing on solid fundamentals, including enhanced security, scalability, and decentralized finance solutions. Coldwareis quickly becoming a safe haven for those seeking stability in the DeFi sector, positioning itself as a Layer-1 blockchain solution with an ecosystem that goes beyond speculative investments. The DeFi Landscape: Solana and Pepe Coin Struggling In recent months, Solana and Pepe Coin have been facing difficulties in maintaining their stronghold in the DeFi market. Solana (SOL), which once boasted impressive scalability and speed, has been under pressure from both internal network issues and external market conditions. Although Solana has seen a bit of a recovery, the Solana price has not been able to reclaim its previous all-time highs. Pepe Coin (PEPE), the meme-inspired token, has been on a similar downtrend. The price of Pepe Coin has experienced significant losses, leading to a growing sense of skepticism around its long-term viability in the market. The declines in these tokens are not simply due to a bearish market but also due to internal issues. Solana, for example, has faced problems such as network outages and decreased institutional support. Pepe Coin is caught in the cyclical hype of meme coin fever, which often leads to sharp rises followed by equally significant crashes. As both of these tokens face increasing pressure, many investors are looking for more secure alternatives in the DeFi space. Coldware’s Key Advantages Over Solana and Pepe Coin One of the main reasons for Coldware (COLD) ’s rise is its ability to solve many of the issues plaguing other DeFi tokens like Solana and Pepe Coin. Coldware offers practical, real-world applications by integrating real-world assets (RWA)into its ecosystem. This integration creates greater value stability, a key aspect that Solana and Pepe Coin are lacking. Another critical factor driving the success of Coldware is its focus on decentralization and security. The Coldware blockchain has been designed with an advanced consensus mechanism that ensures a highly secure and transparent ecosystem for users. This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking a reliable and scalable alternative to Solana, which has faced numerous issues with decentralization and reliability in recent months. Whales Pledge Significant Support The Stage 2 presale of Coldware has already raised a remarkable amount, signaling strong institutional interest. As whales move their funds from Solana and Pepe Coin into Coldware, the token's momentum continues to grow. Whales play a crucial role in the early stages of crypto presales, and their backing is often a strong indicator of future success. Coldware has already captured their attention, with some whales pledging up to 5% of their holdings in the token. As Coldware moves closer to its official launch, this growing support from institutional and retail investors is helping it establish itself as one of the most promising DeFi projects of 2025. Conclusion: Coldware’s Future in the DeFi Market With Solana and Pepe Coin facing significant challenges, Coldware (COLD) is primed to capture the attention of DeFi investors. The success of Coldware’s presale is indicative of the growing shift toward more secure, scalable, and innovative DeFi platforms. As Solana and Pepe Coin continue to dilute their holdings, Coldware is proving to be a viable alternative for investors looking for long-term stability. As Coldware approaches its official launch, it is clear that the token is on the verge of becoming a major player in the DeFi sector, potentially surpassing the likes of Solana and Pepe Coin as the market seeks more reliable and practical crypto solutions.

Leading this potential shift are Ethereum , Bitcoin , Solana , and the emerging early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE . While top-tier assets strengthen their positions, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly building traction and may be one of the few projects still offering early-phase entry for serious long-term upside. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Transitioning Into Visible Growth Mode Every successful crypto project moves from early groundwork to mainstream traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is now entering that crucial phase. Wallet adoption is rising. Community engagement is growing organically. Development milestones are being met consistently. These are the clear indicators of a project moving from silent build-up to broad investor recognition. Those entering now are acting on real-time progress, not speculation. Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana Maintain Market Leadership Bitcoin (BTC) remains the central asset in digital finance. With increasing institutional access via ETFs and global adoption trends, its role as a macro safe-haven is secure. Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate smart contract deployment, scaling innovation, and enterprise blockchain activity, with strong momentum from Layer-2 adoption and tokenization use cases. Solana (SOL) is gaining traction with developers and users for its low fees, fast transaction speed, and increasing relevance in decentralized applications and digital marketplaces. These projects are well-established. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, offers an opportunity to enter during the growth phase—before broad market saturation. Additional Movers Supporting Market Expansion Uniswap leads the decentralized exchange space with high liquidity and a wide user base. Polkadot continues to develop scalable, interoperable blockchain environments through its parachain architecture. Litecoin remains a trusted peer-to-peer transaction asset with consistent speed and low transaction fees. These projects contribute to a strong market foundation—but MAGACOINFINANCE remains in an early discovery window where exponential returns are still possible. Final Insight May may mark a turning point in momentum. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are reinforcing their dominance—while MAGACOINFINANCE signals that it’s preparing for a significant move upward.

Tools for Humanity’s ‘World orb’ is an initiative by the OpenAI founder that offers people $WLD in exchange for scanning their eyes. The project aims to develop $WLD as a blockchain-based global ID, which will help identify humans online. Whenever someone scans their eye using a World Orb, the system stores that information on the blockchain to verify an individual’s online identity. It’ll also help distinguish between what’s real and what’s artificially generated. Read on as we spill more information about this innovative initiative. We’ll also cover another revolutionary AI-crypto project ( SUBBD Token ) promising sizable gains. What in the $WLD? $WLD is the native token of the Worldcoin project used to reward people for participating, among other things. People who scan their eyes with a World Orb will get 16 $WLD, while those who have already downloaded and registered on the World app will receive 150 $WLD as a ‘pioneer grant.’ The project plans to install more than 7,500 scanning orbs across the US by the end of this year. The team says its orbs have already verified 12 million humans from over 100 countries on its World Chain. In time for the US launch, the orb design has been revamped; it’s now more compact and looks like a smartphone instead of the earlier ‘ball-like’ form factor. Tools for Humanity is also in talks with VISA about launching a debit card linked to the $WLD cryptocurrency. Users can use the card to directly pay at merchant stores for automatic fiat currency conversions. Cardholders will also receive rewards for subscribing to AI services like ChatGPT. Besides this, you can use the World Wallet app to send and receive $WLD and other cryptocurrencies through private chat. What’s more, ID integration with Stripe, Match Group, and Razor will also soon be introduced on the app. Without a doubt, Worldcoin is an excellent example of how Web3 technology can be integrated into real-world applications. As the global cryptocurrency adoption increases with supportive government regulations, we’ll see more exciting applications. One such is the SUBBD Token ($SUBBD ), pegged as the next potential crypto to explode , thanks to its AI solutions for the $85B digital content industry. What Is SUBBD Token ($SUBBD)? ‘The #1 AI agent creator platform’, SUBBD offers a never-before-seen mix of social media influencers, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency, revolutionizing how online content creators and their fans interact. Currently, creators must put up with exorbitant fees and lackluster platforms that don’t help them improve or monetize their content offerings. SUBBD, however, comes with tons of AI-powered tools, such as image, voice, video, and profile generators, to help creators upscale and automate their content production process. Moreover, creators will also be able to set up various monetization routes, such as subscriptions, pay-per-view (PPV), NFT sales, and tipping. $SUBBD Token Holders Get Significant Benefits $SUBBD also has something for the fans. Using $SUBBD, the native currency of the SUBBD platform, fans can access their favorite creators’ exclusive work. $SUBBD holders will also get exclusive discounts on content and subscriptions, as well as early access to beta features, new creator tools, launchpads, and more. Holding $SUBBD tokens also gives holders governance rights. That means they all have a say in decisions, such as creator onboarding, themes, and communities. Even $SUBBD’s staking rewards come with on-platform benefits. Stake your tokens to receive access to exclusive creator livestreams, daily BTS drops, in-house content from SUBBD’s top talents, and a fixed 20% APY from the staking pool. SUBBD Token Is Currently in Presale Considering $SUBBD’s unique positioning, it’s no wonder our SUBBD Token price prediction suggests it could reach $0.668 by the end of 2026 – a gain of over 1,200%.

Key Support levels: $3.2, $3 Key Resistance levels: $3.4, $4.1 1. Buyers Face Key Resistance After an impressive rally, SUI made a local top of around $3.9. Since then, the price entered a correction which sent it under the key resistance at $3.4. This level used to act as support, but over the weekend, SUI lost it and turned into a resistance. Chart by TradingView 2. Short-Term Pullback In late April, SUI almost doubled in less than a week. This made a pullback likely in May, which has transpired in the past few days with a 7% drop. This corrective move may last for some time, considering the recent pump. SUI has key support at $3.2 and $3, where buyers could put a stop to the downtrend and retake the initiative. Chart by TradingView 3. Volume Makes Higher Highs The good news, despite the current price action, is that SUI’s volume is making higher highs. This is bullish, and there is a good chance this cryptocurrency may go higher after this pullback is over. If so, SUI will aim to reclaim $3.4 as support and then target $3.9 and $4.1 next.

As pointed out by Jungle Inc Crypto News on X, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) includes a provision that may redefine how insider holdings are assessed, with major implications for XRP’s legal classification. Big Win for Ripple if Passed FIT21 bill explicitly excludes tokens held in contractually locked or escrowed accounts from the insider holdings calculation. Under the bill’s Section 102, which covers digital asset issuer disclosure obligations, a digital asset is presumed to… https://t.co/ho737hXBuy — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) May 5, 2025 FIT21 and the Decentralization Standard FIT21, one of the most comprehensive crypto bills ever proposed in the United States, introduces a structured framework for digital asset regulation, particularly focusing on asset classification and issuer responsibilities. Among the most consequential sections is Section 102, which outlines the criteria for assessing whether a digital asset can be considered decentralized. Under this section, if no affiliated party controls 20% or more of the asset’s circulating supply, the token is presumed decentralized, placing it outside the scope of securities law. Crucially, the bill includes language that could ease regulatory burdens for projects like Ripple. It explicitly states that assets held in contractual restrictions, such as escrow or vesting schedules, are to be excluded from the 20% insider holdings calculation. The text reads: “The number of digital asset units owned by affiliated persons does not include digital assets that are subject to contractual restrictions, including those in escrow or subject to vesting schedules.” Why This Matters for Ripple and XRP Ripple currently holds over 40 billion XRP in time-locked escrow accounts—a central talking point in past legal and regulatory discussions regarding the company’s influence over the token. Critics have frequently argued that this large holding undermines XRP’s decentralization and keeps Ripple in control of the asset’s supply. However, under FIT21’s revised methodology, those escrowed tokens would not count toward Ripple’s insider ownership. This exclusion would drop Ripple’s effective stake well below the 20% threshold, bolstering XRP’s case to be treated as a decentralized commodity rather than a security. That distinction is critical. If XRP qualifies as a decentralized asset, it may fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such a classification would offer much-needed regulatory clarity and could effectively neutralize several of the claims still lingering from the years-long SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Path to Legal Clarity and Market Confidence For Ripple, the passage of FIT21 would not just validate its ongoing legal strategy—it could cement XRP’s status as a compliant, tradable asset under U.S. law. It would also reinforce Ripple’s argument that the escrowed XRP has always been responsibly managed and transparently disclosed. Investors and market participants are watching this development closely. With bipartisan momentum building behind comprehensive crypto legislation and growing recognition of blockchain’s role in the future of finance, the timing for FIT21 could be pivotal. If passed, this bill would not only set a precedent for token decentralization criteria but could also unleash a wave of institutional interest in XRP and similar assets. As Jungle Inc Crypto News notes, the FIT21 bill offers more than just regulatory reform—it offers a lifeline to Ripple and XRP amid years of legal uncertainty. By excluding escrowed tokens from insider calculations, lawmakers are acknowledging the structural safeguards that responsible crypto projects have put in place. For Ripple, it could mark the beginning of a new chapter—one driven by compliance, clarity, and confident market participation.

Binance Alpha, a dedicated feature within the popular Binance Wallet, has recently added MYX Finance (MYX) to its curated list. This move, first reported by BWEnews on X, shines a spotlight on MYX as a promising early stage crypto project gaining traction. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Crypto Projects? Before diving into the specifics of the MYX token addition, let’s understand what Binance Alpha is. Think of it as a specialized radar within the Binance Wallet ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to identify and showcase emerging, early stage crypto projects that are showing significant community engagement, innovative technology, or strong market trends among early adopters. The inclusion in Binance Alpha isn’t a full exchange listing, which is a crucial distinction. Instead, it serves as an initial signal to users of the Binance Wallet that a particular project is on Binance’s radar and is deemed noteworthy enough for this early-stage highlight. For crypto projects like MYX Finance, this exposure within the vast Binance ecosystem can be invaluable, potentially driving awareness and attracting early community members and investors. How Does Binance Alpha Select Early Stage Crypto? Binance Alpha employs specific criteria to identify which projects make it onto its list. While the exact algorithm isn’t public, key factors are known to include: Community Engagement: How active and vibrant is the project’s community across social media, forums, and developer channels? Market Trends: Is the project aligning with current positive trends in the broader crypto market or within its specific niche (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, gaming)? Innovation & Technology: Does the project offer a novel solution or utilize technology in an interesting way? Early Adoption Signals: Are there signs of growing usage or interest from early adopters? The addition of MYX token suggests it has met some or all of these internal benchmarks, indicating it’s a project worth monitoring in the early stage crypto landscape. Spotlight On: What is MYX Finance (MYX Token)? MYX Finance is the project behind the MYX token now featured on Binance Alpha. While the Binance Alpha listing itself is the news, it’s important for potential explorers to do their own research into what MYX Finance is building. Typically, projects highlighted here are decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, innovative Layer 2 solutions, or other cutting-edge blockchain applications. Understanding MYX Finance’s whitepaper, team, technology, and use case is paramount before considering any interaction or investment. What Does This Mean for the MYX Token and Its Community? For MYX Finance, being featured on Binance Alpha is a significant milestone. It provides: Increased Visibility: Direct exposure to a large user base within the Binance Wallet. Credibility Boost: While not a listing guarantee, it signals that Binance is paying attention, which can enhance a project’s standing. Potential for Growth: The increased awareness can attract new community members, users, and potentially liquidity providers or investors to the MYX ecosystem. However, it’s crucial to manage expectations. As Binance Alpha explicitly states, inclusion does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange. This is a common point of confusion, and users should understand this distinction clearly. Actionable Insights for Exploring Crypto Projects on Binance Alpha For users of Binance Wallet interested in discovering new crypto projects, the Binance Alpha feature is a valuable tool. Here’s how to approach it: Locate Binance Alpha: Access the feature directly within your Binance Wallet interface. Explore Featured Projects: Browse the list of highlighted early stage crypto projects, including the newly added MYX token. Conduct Due Diligence: Use the inclusion as a starting point for your own research. Don’t invest based solely on the Binance Alpha listing. Look into the project’s fundamentals, team, technology, tokenomics, and community. Understand the Risk: Early-stage projects carry higher risk. Be prepared for volatility and the possibility of project failure. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Updated: Follow the project’s official channels and announcements to track its development. This feature provides a curated list, but the responsibility for research and investment decisions lies entirely with the individual user exploring these crypto projects. Risks and Considerations: The Nuances of Binance Alpha Highlights While the exposure is beneficial, it’s vital to reiterate the risks associated with early-stage crypto projects. These include: High Volatility: Prices can fluctuate dramatically. Execution Risk: The project might fail to deliver on its promises. Liquidity Issues: Trading the token might be difficult if it’s not widely listed. No Listing Guarantee: The project may never be listed on the main Binance exchange or other major platforms. The Binance Alpha highlight is a signal for potential, not a stamp of approval for investment. It’s an invitation to explore, not a recommendation to buy. Conclusion: A New Opportunity to Discover with Binance Alpha The addition of MYX token to Binance Alpha underscores the platform’s ongoing effort to highlight promising early stage crypto projects within its ecosystem. For MYX Finance, it’s a moment of increased visibility. For Binance Wallet users, it represents a curated opportunity to discover emerging projects that have met certain criteria recognized by Binance. Remember, this is a starting point for your own research journey. Explore MYX Finance and other highlighted crypto projects with caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and understand that inclusion in Binance Alpha is a spotlight on potential, not a guarantee of future success or exchange listing.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech-savvy investors, understanding these shifts is crucial, as they often signal broader market trends and innovation drivers. One such significant development comes from the maritime sector, where Autonomous Shipping is rapidly moving from concept to reality, attracting substantial investment. Understanding the Autonomous Shipping Market The market for ships that can navigate themselves using AI is experiencing strong growth. Projections indicate this sector could reach over $11 billion by 2028. This expansion is driven by the clear benefits autonomous systems offer: reduced fuel consumption, time savings on voyages, and enhanced safety through collision avoidance. Companies operating in this space find a receptive market ready for innovation. Several players are active in developing these technologies. Notable examples include Avikus, a subsidiary of Hyundai HD, and Sea Machines. These companies are working on various aspects of autonomous and semi-autonomous maritime operations. Orca AI Secures Significant Funding The latest company making waves in this market is Orca AI . The London-based firm recently closed a Series B funding round, securing $72.5 million. This round was led by Brighton Park Capital, with participation from existing investors Ankona Capital and Hyperlink Ventures. This latest investment brings Orca AI’s total funding raised to over $111 million, building on a $23 million round from the previous year. Founded in 2018 by CEO Yarden Gross and CTO Dor Raviv, Orca AI focuses on applying AI to improve maritime navigation and decision-making. Their platform is built on a vast marine visual dataset, covering more than 80 million nautical miles, which informs the AI’s capabilities. How AI Navigation is Transforming Seas Orca AI’s core offering lies in its AI-powered navigation system. By providing ships with advanced decision-making tools and autonomous capabilities, the technology aims to significantly reduce the risk of collisions. This allows human crews to shift their focus to other essential tasks onboard, improving overall operational efficiency and safety. The company reports tangible benefits from its system. A 2024 analysis of Orca AI’s alert system demonstrated a 54% reduction in close encounter events. This improved safety translates directly into economic advantages, with the company claiming an average saving of $100,000 in fuel per vessel annually due to more efficient navigation and fewer incidents. Expanding Horizons: Orca AI and Defense Tech While the primary focus remains on the commercial shipping sector, Orca AI is also seeing increasing opportunities in the Defense Tech space. Navies around the world are exploring autonomous solutions for their vessels. The goal is to deploy more cost-effective assets that can operate efficiently with less human intervention in certain scenarios. CEO Yarden Gross confirmed that while commercial shipping is the main business, there are significant opportunities emerging from global navies interested in autonomy. Orca AI has already signed its first contract in the defense field and has deployed its technology on a navy ship, signaling a promising new avenue for growth and application of their platform. Starlink’s Role in Enhanced Maritime Operations Another key factor contributing to Orca AI’s recent growth and capabilities is the expanding reach of Starlink . The satellite internet service enables reliable, real-time data transmission from ships, even in remote maritime environments. This connectivity is vital for Orca AI’s platform, allowing continuous data collection, route mapping, traffic monitoring, and the sharing of critical information between the ship and shore systems. Yarden Gross highlighted the importance of this connectivity, stating that Starlink allows the company to collect data at scale directly from ship sensors. This real-time data flow is crucial for refining the AI models, providing up-to-the-minute navigation insights, and ensuring the autonomous systems operate effectively across vast distances. Summary Orca AI’s successful $72.5 million funding round underscores the significant potential and growing demand for autonomous navigation solutions in the maritime industry. Boosted by increasing interest from the defense sector and enabled by enhanced connectivity through services like Starlink, the company is well-positioned to expand its AI-powered platform. By delivering tangible benefits such as reduced collisions and fuel savings, Orca AI is helping to shape the future of safer, more efficient shipping globally.

Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit in London, Emma Reynolds, the Economic Secretary for the Treasury, said on record that the UK won’t be copying the United States government’s crypto hoarding. “We don’t think that’s appropriate for our market,” Emma said . “We understand that’s what the U.S. is going for, but that’s not the plan for us.” The United States, now under President Donald Trump, has taken a very different turn on crypto policy. Emma pointed out that Washington has made “a big change from the previous administration” and is now moving aggressively toward storing Bitcoin at the national level. But the UK isn’t buying into that logic. Emma said the country has other priorities and doesn’t see a reserve as fitting into its financial framework. UK wants to work on regulation but not allocation Instead of stockpiling Bitcoin, the UK wants to work closely with the U.S. on broader crypto regulation. Emma emphasized that cooperation still matters. “We think it’s really important to have that collaboration and cooperation,” Emma said. Emma also confirmed that Chancellor of the Exchequer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have already met, and a formal working group has been formed. The “senior official level working group” will meet this June to discuss how both governments can tackle crypto oversight together. The idea isn’t to follow the same path but to coordinate where it makes sense. The UK wants to stay in sync with Washington in areas like regulation but without mimicking the U.S. playbook line-for-line. When it comes to launching a Bitcoin reserve, Emma made it clear there’s no interest. The UK’s focus is elsewhere. One of those focus areas is government bonds. Emma said the Treasury is currently looking into issuing sovereign debt using distributed ledger technology. She said the procurement process is already moving forward, and a tech supplier could be selected by late summer. This doesn’t mean the UK is avoiding crypto tech—it just means the government is only interested in areas where it fits its goals. Emma also shut down the idea that the UK will adopt the European Union’s strict approach to crypto. She dismissed the MiCA regime as too rigid. “We decided not to go down that particular road,” she said. Unlike the EU, which favors a tightly structured system, Emma said the UK is more focused on outcomes than legal templates. She said the UK’s legal style is “much less like that of the EU.” The UK government wants crypto regulation to fall inside existing rules used for regular finance. Emma said, “Same risk, same regulatory approach.” She explained that crypto firms should be treated the same as traditional financial service companies when it comes to oversight. But Emma didn’t pretend the government can control everything. She admitted that some parts of the crypto world are out of reach. Bitcoin was her example. Its decentralized structure makes it hard for any government to pin down. “There’s only so much the government can do in that regard,” she said. “We understand that some of this stuff is a little bit amorphous, and the decentralized stuff is particularly difficult.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-06 15:20:46

The $BCAP feed represents a key milestone in the rapid growth of RWAs, a sector that has grown over 500% in the last year and now exceeds $20 billion in value, according to a company note shared with crypto.news. Despite this growth, tokenized assets have remained largely siloed from DeFi due to a lack of secure, real-time price feeds needed for lending, collateralization, and other use cases. RedStone ( RED ), the official oracle provider for Securitize , addresses this gap with gas-efficient, multi-chain price feeds. The BCAP integration on ZKsync follows similar support for tokenized assets like BlackRock’s BUIDL fund . According to RedStone Co-Founder Marcin Kazmierczak, the collaboration paves the way for onchain strategies involving tokenized venture assets and other institutional-grade products.

Specifically, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, the fifth richest man in Mexico, gave first-hand expert investment advice on his X handle on Monday. In the post , he suggested that he finds buying Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a more astute venture over real estate.Real Estate Is Bad Investment: PliegoOwing to his affluence, the billionaire has had his fair share of investment ventures. Pliego founded Grupo Salinas, a conglomerate with its toes in media and telecommunications. He also runs the Grupo Elektra, a business he inherited from his family.Yet with his wealth of investment experience, Pliego finds Bitcoin a more rewarding acquisition than real estate. Interestingly, he called owning a house “expensive,” stressing that, contrary to popular opinion, it is not an investment.While the billionaire investor admires the concept of buying a property, he explicitly states that those who own them as investments are doing the wrong thing. He insisted that stacking Bitcoin was a more lucrative venture than real estate.Meanwhile, Pliego’s portfolio is a testament to his staunch belief in the nascent digital asset. In a recent disclosure , he revealed that he holds a staggering 70% of his wealth in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related vehicles. With his net worth exceeding $5.8 billion, his stash of the premier asset would surely amount to a lot.Bitcoin vs. Real Estate DebateNotably, the real estate market has its lure as the go-to sector for legacy investments. While it offers stable and modest returns, Bitcoin has outperformed it outright in the last few years.For perspective, real estate returned 36.9% between 2017 and 2024, while Bitcoin appreciated nearly 2,000% in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, a recent report from JP Morgan highlighted that US housing prices could increase by a mere 3% in 2025.

Reynolds made the disclosure during a fireside chat at the Financial Times Digital Asset Summit hosted in London. During the event, Reynolds stressed that stockpiling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is unsuitable for the U.K. market. Since President Donald Trump announced plans to establish a crypto reserve in the U.S., there have been debates about whether other nations will adopt the strategy. As previously reported , Japan dismissed the idea of holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, noting that cryptocurrencies are not foreign currency reserves. The U.K. has followed suit, as it does not consider stockpiling assets like Bitcoin an appropriate strategy for its market. Close Relationship with the US on Digital Assets Regulation Even though the U.K. will not mirror the U.S. Bitcoin reserve model, Reynolds stressed the need for collaboration between the countries on crypto regulation. She highlighted key progress regarding this transatlantic cooperation. This includes the creation of a senior-level working group on digital assets and the meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the U.K.’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves. According to Reynolds, the regulatory forum will meet next month to discuss cooperation on digital assets. Per Reynolds, this cooperation is imperative given the remarkable shift in the United States’ stance on digital assets under Trump. Plans to Leverage DLT to Issue Sovereign Debts Meanwhile, the Economic Secretary to the U.K.’s Treasury also revealed ongoing plans to use distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to issue sovereign debt. According to her, the procurement process has already commenced, and the government hopes to appoint a supplier by the end of the summer of 2025. UK Won’t Copy EU’s MiCA Framework Further, she disclosed that the U.K. is not considering copying the EU’s MiCA framework for digital assets. Instead, it aims to ensure digital assets operate within the United Kingdom’s existing financial services regulation. Reynolds suggested that existing financial regulations should also apply to digital assets since they carry the same risks. Meanwhile, Reynolds conceded that some aspects of cryptos, particularly Bitcoin's decentralized nature, are beyond governments’ regulatory ability. In her view, crypto's decentralized nature poses a major regulatory challenge; hence, the government can only do so much.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-06 15:29:14

The crypto market cap is marginally down at $2.92 trillion as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other altcoins lost momentum at key levels. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, introduced several changes to token pricing, which increases every two days until the target is met or the tokens sell out. State Of The Market The crypto market has registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours, falling to $2.92 trillion as BTC, ETH, and other altcoins fell below key levels. BTC lost momentum over the weekend after rising to an intraday high of $98,000 on Friday. As a result, BTC fell 0.98% on Saturday and 1.66% on Sunday, slipping below $95,000 and settling at $94,390. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading at $94,245. Meanwhile, ETH is down over 2%, slipping below $1,800 and trading at $1,765. Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Sui (SUI), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT), also registered notable declines. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action Dogecoin (DOGE) registered a substantial increase on Thursday, rising nearly 5% to $0.180. The rally lost momentum on Friday, but DOGE registered a marginal increase and settled at $0.181. Price action turned bearish over the weekend as DOGE fell over 3% on Saturday and 2.62% on Sunday to settle at $0.170. The price experienced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline. The current session sees DOGE down nearly 3%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and trading at $0.165. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Action Shiba Inu (SHIB) started the weekend in the red, registering a marginal decline on Friday and settling at $0.0000134. Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as the price fell nearly 4% to $0.0000129. SHIB continued to decline on Sunday, dropping over 2%, slipping below the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $0.126. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday but finds itself back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 2%, trading at $0.0000128. Husky Inu (HINU) Closes In On $750,000 Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, with the token price at $0.00015000. Since then, the token has registered several price increases, thanks to the introduction of a dynamic pricing system. The latest price increase has taken the token price to $0.00017175. The pre-launch phase has been a resounding success, allowing the project to raise $748,708. Surging interest in the project has seen investors continue to purchase the HINU token despite price increases.

To read full editions, subscribe . Painters paint, sculptors sculpt and cryptographers code. For millennia, creators have fought to express themselves through their chosen media. Around the year 430 BC, Greek sculptor Phidias is famously said to have died in prison after being charged with impiety due to his art (with a side of treacherous politics). Phidias had sculpted himself and statesman Pericles onto the shield of Athena on the Athena Parthenos, an unforgivable act of hubris in front of the gods. Nearly two and a half thousand years later, cryptographer Daniel Bernstein fought the US government over his constitutional right to express himself through code — and won. On This Day: Code Is Speech Twenty-six years ago today, Judge Marilyn Patel ruled that computer code should be considered speech and thus protected under the First Amendment, even if that code represented powerful encryption technology. Bernstein had sued the US State Department and subsequently the Department of Commerce in what Judge Patel later described as “part political expression.” As we touched on in a retrospective last week , the US government at the time classed cryptographic tools with a key size larger than 40 bits as weapons. This meant anyone seeking to publish or otherwise make cryptography software available outside the US had to register as an arms dealer — including doctoral candidates studying mathematics at UC Berkeley, like Bernstein. So, when Bernstein approached the State Department about publishing the source code, instructions and academic paper describing a new encryption method called Snuffle, authorities labeled the work a “munition” under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. But the imposition of any licensing regime on code — the medium through which cryptographers express their ideas, thoughts and theories — was unconstitutional, in Bernstein’s view. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) then sponsored his lawsuit, in what was its second major case after the Steve Jackson Games in the early ‘90s. Long before Bitcoin, Adam Back protested the US government’s classification of RSA encryption as munition with this cool shirt. Courts sided with Bernstein and the EFF in a landmark decision about a year later, ruling that the government must protect cryptographers’ freedom to code. It’s their language. The case paved the way for strong encryption to be readily applied to e-commerce and all manner of private enterprise, thanks in no small part to the forward-thinking Judge Patel. Patel wrote: “By utilizing source code, a cryptographer can express algorithmic ideas with precision and methodological rigor that is otherwise difficult to achieve… The need for precisely articulated hypotheses and formal empirical testing, of course, is not unique to the science of cryptography; it appears, however, that in this field, source code is the preferred means to these ends.” It’s clear that without the Bernstein ruling, the development and release of Bitcoin might have been seriously slowed. After all, Satoshi (if they were in the US) would’ve needed to acquire a license to share Bitcoin source code, immediately doxxing them with the government. How convenient!

This staggering figure, cited by Fortune Crypto based on data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, sheds light on the lucrative potential hidden within decentralized finance mechanisms, even for assets driven primarily by internet culture and political affiliation. The news underscores the significant financial flows that can occur within the memecoin ecosystem, a corner of the crypto market known for its volatility and community-driven pumps and dumps. While many focus on the price speculation of memecoins, this report shifts attention to how the infrastructure supporting these tokens – specifically decentralized exchanges and their liquidity pools – can generate substantial passive income for those who set them up. What is the TRUMP Memecoin Phenomenon? The TRUMP memecoin is one of several cryptocurrency tokens created around political figures, particularly former U.S. President Donald Trump. These tokens often gain traction among supporters or those looking to speculate on political events. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which aim to solve specific technical or financial problems, memecoins like TRUMP are primarily driven by community hype, social media trends, and speculative trading. Their value is highly volatile and can react sharply to news, endorsements, or even unrelated market sentiment. The existence and success (in terms of market cap and trading volume) of tokens like TRUMP illustrate the extent to which cultural and political narratives can intersect with the decentralized world of crypto. How Did the Memecoin Developer Earn Such High Crypto Fees? The primary mechanism cited for the developer’s substantial earnings is through liquidity pool fees on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Here’s a breakdown of how this works: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): Unlike centralized exchanges (like Coinbase or Binance), DEXs allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without an intermediary holding their funds. Liquidity Pools: DEXs rely on liquidity pools, which are pools of two or more tokens locked in a smart contract. Users (liquidity providers) deposit pairs of tokens into these pools (e.g., TRUMP and ETH). Facilitating Trades: When someone wants to trade TRUMP for ETH on the DEX, they interact with the TRUMP/ETH liquidity pool. The trade is executed against the tokens available in the pool. Transaction Fees: DEXs charge a small fee for each trade that uses a liquidity pool. These fees are typically a percentage of the trade value (e.g., 0.3%). Fee Distribution: The transaction fees collected by the liquidity pool are distributed proportionally among the liquidity providers. In the case of the TRUMP memecoin developer , it’s reported they provided significant liquidity to the trading pools for their token on various DEXs. By supplying a large amount of TRUMP and the paired asset (like ETH or USDC) to these pools, they became major liquidity providers. As trading activity occurred, they earned a significant portion of the collected transaction fees. The Impact of Crypto Trading Volume on Developer Earnings The report specifically mentions a surge in crypto trading volume for TRUMP following news of a dinner event involving top holders. This highlights a critical point: developer earnings from liquidity pools are directly proportional to the trading volume. The higher the volume of trades going through the pools where the developer provides liquidity, the more fees they collect. Consider this simplified example: Scenario Daily Trading Volume DEX Fee Rate Total Daily Fees Generated Developer’s Liquidity Share Developer’s Daily Earnings Low Volume Day $1,000,000 0.3% $3,000 10% $300 High Volume Day (e.g., after news) $100,000,000 0.3% $300,000 50% $150,000 This table illustrates how a significant share of liquidity combined with high trading volume can lead to substantial daily, weekly, and ultimately, cumulative earnings like the reported $320M+ in crypto fees . Benefits and Opportunities (Primarily for the Developer) For the memecoin developer , the benefits are clear and substantial: Massive Income Stream: Earning hundreds of millions from transaction fees is an extraordinary financial outcome. Volume-Based Profit: Unlike holding the token and hoping its price goes up, earning fees from liquidity pools profits from *activity*, regardless of whether the price is rising or falling (though volume often increases during price swings). Leveraging Project Success: By creating a popular (or at least highly traded) token, the developer directly benefits from the ecosystem they built. Challenges and Risks (Primarily for Investors) While the developer benefits, the memecoin market, and specifically investing in tokens like TRUMP, comes with significant challenges and risks for participants: Extreme Volatility: Memecoin prices can plummet as quickly as they rise, often based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. Lack of Intrinsic Value: Many memecoins have no underlying technology, product, or use case beyond speculation. Liquidity Pool Risks: While providing liquidity can earn fees, it also carries risks like impermanent loss, where the value of your deposited assets changes unfavorably compared to simply holding them. Potential for Manipulation: High concentration of tokens or liquidity by developers or large holders can pose risks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory status of memecoins and even aspects of DeFi like liquidity provision is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Ethical Concerns: Profiting immensely from a highly speculative asset, particularly one tied to a political figure, raises ethical questions about leveraging public interest for personal gain. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Memecoin Space The story of the TRUMP memecoin developer’s earnings offers several lessons for anyone involved in or considering the crypto market, especially the memecoin segment: Understand the Mechanism: Recognize that developers can profit not just from holding tokens but also from the trading infrastructure (like earning liquidity pool fees ). Assess Trading Volume: High volume can indicate potential for fee generation but also points to intense speculation. Look Beyond Price: Analyze the tokenomics and distribution – who holds the tokens? Who provides the liquidity? This can reveal potential points of centralization or significant beneficiaries. Due Diligence is Crucial: Research the project, the team (if identifiable), and the underlying technology (or lack thereof). Don’t invest based purely on hype or social media trends. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Memecoins are inherently high-risk assets. Be Skeptical of Hype: News like a dinner with holders driving volume should be seen as a red flag for speculative pumping rather than a signal of fundamental value. The fact that a memecoin developer could earn such substantial crypto fees underscores the unique financial dynamics at play in the decentralized world. It highlights how different participants can benefit from various layers of the ecosystem, from token creation to trading infrastructure. Summary: A Glimpse into Memecoin Economics The report of the TRUMP memecoin developer earning over $320 million in crypto fees serves as a striking example of the potential profitability derived from providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges, especially for tokens with high crypto trading volume . While the figure is extraordinary and likely tied to the unique political nature and resulting speculation around the TRUMP token, it illustrates the powerful fee-generating engine that liquidity pools can be for those with significant capital and a popular token. It’s a stark reminder that in the memecoin world, profits aren’t solely about price appreciation; they can also be deeply embedded in the very mechanisms that facilitate trading, offering a different perspective on how value flows within this highly speculative corner of the crypto market.

The profile of deals is also shifting, with more private rounds. VC funding for crypto startups is slowing down, both in terms of value and the number of deals. April’s results reflected a shift in funding, where a handful of large-scale deals replaced the previous landscape of varied deals and a multitude of startups. In April, Cryptorank counted 94 funding deals valued at $2.37B. The previous month saw a bumper crop of projects, with 140 deals valued at over $5B. The number of deals is comparable to some of the slow months of the 2022-2023 bear market. In April 2024, the market saw a total of 170 deals, though only valued at $1.7B. For the past month, the undisclosed round of Dao5 was among the most prominent deals, valued at $222M. Strategic and late-stage rounds became more common. VC backers abandoned hot topics like AI and Web3, moving into developer tools and infrastructure. VC funding decouples from crypto market trends In previous market cycles, VC funding has been an indicator of the overall investor hype. During bull markets, it is much easier for startups to gain funding, with the expectation of a liquid market and a rapidly appreciating token. The path of VC funding was met with more skepticism as the available liquidity for tokens diminished. Insider selling also kept investors away from VC-backed projects. Additionally, securing listings is becoming more difficult due to an oversupply of tokens. Some projects also choose the path of creating a meme token, doing away with the complexities of security law. Meme tokens also do not oblige the project to provide utility, staking, or other use cases. VC funding shifts to global rounds In the past year, undisclosed international funding rounds challenged the leading position of the US market. Despite the reportedly improved US crypto regulations, fundraising shifted to other locations. In the first four months of 2025, undisclosed location rounds gathered $4.99B, followed by $2B in rounds located in Malta. The USA was in third place with $1.85B in new fundraising. VC funds are becoming more selective, choosing projects with more advanced products. Some also choose a tokenless approach, avoiding the trap of increasing fully diluted value and token inflation. Animoca Brands lost its leading position, instead leaving Coinbase Ventures with the biggest number of rounds in the year to date.

44239660,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157679,1746546045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Code Editor Cursor Achieves Stunning $9 Billion Valuation After Massive Funding Round,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cursor-ai-funding-valuation/,"In a move that underscores the explosive growth and investor confidence in the artificial intelligence sector, the AI code editor , Cursor, has reportedly completed a significant funding round. This development isn’t just big news for the tech world; it also carries a fascinating, albeit bittersweet, connection back to the cryptocurrency space and the fallout from the FTX exchange. What is Cursor AI and Why the Hype? Before diving into the financial details, let’s quickly touch on what Cursor AI is. It’s designed to be a next-generation code editor built with AI assistance at its core. Think of it as your coding environment supercharged with capabilities like generating code snippets, explaining complex functions, debugging, and refactoring, all powered by artificial intelligence. In an era where developer productivity is paramount, tools that promise significant efficiency gains are highly sought after. Cursor aims to leverage large language models (LLMs) to make the coding process faster, smarter, and more intuitive. Decoding the Massive Tech Startup Funding Round According to reports, including those cited by Wu Blockchain on X based on the Financial Times, Cursor has successfully raised a staggering $900 million in its latest funding round. This is a monumental figure for a privately held company, especially in the current venture capital climate, which has seen some cooling compared to the peaks of 2021-2022. This influx of capital provides Cursor with immense resources for research and development, hiring top AI talent, scaling its operations, and potentially expanding its feature set significantly. Such a large funding round signals strong investor belief not just in Cursor’s specific product but in the broader potential of AI to revolutionize software development workflows. Understanding the Sky-High Startup Valuation Perhaps even more striking than the funding amount is the reported valuation attached to Cursor after this round: $9 billion. A startup valuation of this magnitude places Cursor firmly among the ranks of elite, rapidly growing tech companies globally. Valuations are often a reflection of perceived future growth potential, market size, competitive advantage, and the overall investor sentiment towards the sector the company operates in. For Cursor, this $9 billion valuation likely factors in several elements: The AI Boom: The insatiable demand and excitement surrounding AI technologies across all industries. Developer Tooling Market: The large and constantly evolving market for software development tools. Product-Market Fit: Early signs that developers are adopting and finding value in AI-assisted coding. Talent and Technology: The strength of the team and the underlying AI technology powering the editor. While impressive, a high valuation also brings pressure to perform and grow into that valuation over time. The company will need to execute flawlessly to meet these high expectations. The Curious Case of the FTX Alameda Investment Here’s where the story takes an interesting turn for those in the crypto space. The Financial Times report, as highlighted by Wu Blockchain, notes a previous connection between Cursor and the now-defunct crypto trading firm Alameda Research, part of the FTX empire. Back in 2022, Alameda had reportedly invested a modest $200,000 in Cursor’s seed funding round. Seed rounds are the earliest stage of formal investment in a startup, typically involving smaller amounts to help the company get off the ground. Following the collapse of FTX and Alameda, liquidators were tasked with recovering assets to repay creditors. As part of this process, the FTX Alameda investment stake in Cursor was sold off. What’s particularly notable is that the stake was reportedly sold by the liquidators for the same amount Alameda originally invested: $200,000. The irony, or perhaps tragedy depending on your perspective, is highlighted by the Financial Times’ estimate that this same investment stake could now be worth around $500 million given Cursor’s new $9 billion valuation. This stark contrast between the sale price and the potential current value underscores the challenges faced by the FTX liquidators in valuing and offloading diverse, early-stage startup investments amidst a crisis, and represents a significant missed opportunity for FTX creditors who are awaiting repayment. This situation serves as a potent reminder of how intertwined the tech and crypto investment worlds had become during the bull market, and the complex aftermath faced by entities like FTX as they navigate bankruptcy proceedings. The Broader Picture: AI, Tech Funding, and Crypto Connections Cursor’s massive funding round and valuation are indicative of the broader trends in the technology sector, particularly the intense focus on AI. Companies leveraging AI to improve fundamental processes, like software development, are attracting significant capital. This event also subtly reminds us of the diverse investment portfolios built by large crypto firms like Alameda during their operational peak. Their participation in early-stage tech startup funding across various sectors, not just crypto-native projects, shows a broader investment strategy. While some of these investments, like the one in Cursor, have potentially grown exponentially, others may not have fared so well. The story of the FTX Alameda investment in Cursor is a high-profile example of the valuable assets the liquidators are dealing with, and the complexities of maximizing returns for creditors from a portfolio of venture capital stakes. What Does This Mean for Developers and the Future of Coding? For developers, the success of companies like Cursor suggests that AI-assisted coding tools are here to stay and will likely become increasingly sophisticated. While concerns about AI potentially replacing developers exist, the current focus is on AI as a co-pilot – a tool to augment human capabilities, handle repetitive tasks, and allow developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving and creativity. The significant funding means Cursor has the resources to potentially lead innovation in this space, offering more powerful and integrated AI features directly within the coding environment. This could lead to significant shifts in how software is built in the coming years. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the impressive numbers, challenges remain. The startup valuation of $9 billion sets a very high bar for performance. Cursor will need to demonstrate sustained growth, build a strong moat against competitors (both other AI coding tools and established code editor providers), and navigate the evolving landscape of AI ethics and responsible development. Competition in the AI developer tools space is also heating up, with major tech companies and other startups vying for market share. Cursor’s ability to innovate rapidly and build a loyal user base will be critical. A Compelling Conclusion The story of AI code editor Cursor’s $900 million funding round and $9 billion valuation is a powerful narrative about the current tech landscape. It highlights the immense capital flowing into AI, the perceived value of tools that enhance human productivity, and the rapid pace of innovation in software development. The connection to the FTX Alameda investment adds a layer of intrigue, serving as a stark illustration of both the potential gains and the complex realities left behind by the crypto market’s recent upheavals. As Cursor moves forward with its massive new resources, it will be fascinating to watch how it shapes the future of coding and whether it lives up to the extraordinary valuation it has achieved.

These hurdles have been tough to overcome in recent trading sessions. The market seems to be at a crossroads. Investors are keenly watching for any signs of a potential breakout. Are these digital assets finally ready to push higher and deliver gains? Chainlink: Steady Gains Amid Short-Term Volatility LINK past movements show a modest monthly recovery with a 5.91% increase and an 11.62% gain over the past six months. Prices shifted within a wide band, reflecting a balance of upward drift and periodic pullbacks. The changes over these periods hint at cautious optimism as intermittent declines gave way to accumulating strength over half a year. Current levels find Chainlink trading between $11.15 and $16.41 with key support around $8.00 and nearest resistance near $18.52. Bears appear influential with a negative momentum indicator and lower moving average signals while bulls maintain minor control within the key levels. Traders might consider consolidating positions until a clear breakout is confirmed. Litecoin Shows Steady Growth While Trading Within a Range Over the last month, Litecoin showed a mild gain of 0.61%, while a six‐month increase of 16.99% marks a notable upward move. A weekly slip of 2.94% hints at some short-term hesitance against a backdrop of longer-term growth. Price moves have paced steadily with moderate volatility as the market absorbed shifts without dramatic swings. Currently, Litecoin trades between $68.24 and $93.62, with a key resistance at $103.74 and support near $52.98. The indicators point to a neutral stance, with the RSI at 48.60 and summary and moving average suggestions leaning slightly bearish. Traders may explore positions within these levels, awaiting a decisive breakout or breakdown for clearer direction. Conclusion Chainlink (LINK) and Litecoin (LTC) are currently facing significant resistance levels. Their ability to break through these barriers remains uncertain. The market's response in the coming days will be crucial in determining their next course. Monitoring price movements closely will provide insights into potential breakouts. Whether they succeed or not, these resistance zones will play a key role in their short-term performance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company also said that it expects to lose billions in this war. However, it has maintained a positive stance and keeps taking risks, like maintaining the price for its vehicles if not going lower. The biggest teams in the war on tariffs are China and the US. Recently, investors have remained uncertain about their next moves. Trump has no plans to talk to Xi Jinping of China. However, he did say in a TV interview that his administration is open to lowering the high 145% tariffs it puts on Chinese goods. On the other hand, Beijing said it looked at different ways in which US officials wanted to start talks about tariffs. This made people hopeful that the trade war between the US and China would not worsen. In addition, China is said to have made a list of US goods that won’t be subject to its 125% tariffs to ease trade tensions without giving in to public pressure. However, Trump supported the 145% tariffs on Chinese goods by saying that China “deserves it” and would probably pay for it. And the back and forth continues. Still, Ford and Jim Farley will not hit rock bottom. According to Barron, the company builds 80% of its domestically sold vehicles in the US. This is why they have the leisure of maintaining their prices. Therefore, the expectation of tariffs remaining for 3 years would do the company some good as it competes with the other auto companies in the US. Ford suspended automotive exports to China The automaker stopped automotive exports to China. However, it still imports vehicles like its Lincoln Nautilus from the country. Ford executives said the tariffs will add $2.5 billion to the company’s overall yearly expenses. Most of this money will go toward importing cars from Mexico and China. Ford is suspending its 2025 guidance and expects a $2.5 billion hit from tariffs this year CEO Jim Farley, back in February: pic.twitter.com/lpfHxE2o6y — Morning Brew ☕️ (@MorningBrew) May 5, 2025 Executives from the company said that it has been able to cut that cost by about $1 billion by doing different things, such as using bond carriers to move cars from Mexico to Canada so that they don’t have to pay US tariffs. Ford’s sales dropped 5% to $40.7 billion in the quarter, which was more than the $36 billion that was expected. Some figures say that Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars will cost US automakers more than $100 billion this year. Earnings went up because people rushed to buy cars because they feared that tariffs would cause prices to rise. Many people were buying cars at once, and Ford was one of the companies that offered deals to get a piece of the market. Barclays analysts wrote in a note that investors have chosen Ford over GM because 79% of Ford’s US sales are built in the US, compared to 53% of GM’s. Ford’s EV could lose up to $5.5 billion Ford is dealing with Trump’s taxes, but its electric cars are costing it a lot of money. The car company said that its software and electric vehicle (EV) businesses could lose up to $5.5 billion this year. According to reports, Ford stopped an expensive project to build FNV4, a next-generation electrical design for its cars, because delays and rising costs were making it impossible to complete. When asked about the report, Farley said that the move was “a very significant save for capital efficiency.” Ford Pro, the company’s commercial vehicle division, made $15.2 billion in sales in the first quarter, 16% less than last year. Ford’s gasoline-engine business made $21 billion in sales in the third quarter.

44239945,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157680,1746546648,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Future of Finance Revealed: Why Crypto and Fiat Will Peacefully Coexist,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fiat-future-finance/,"For years, the debate has raged: will cryptocurrency eventually replace traditional fiat currencies? While some maximalists envision a world entirely free from government-backed money, others remain skeptical. However, a more nuanced perspective is gaining traction among industry leaders. According to Petr Kozyakov, CEO of the crypto payments platform Mercuryo, the future isn’t about one form of money winning over the other. Instead, it’s about Crypto and Fiat finding a way to coexist. Understanding the Coexistence of Crypto and Fiat In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Kozyakov laid out a vision for the financial landscape where cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies operate side-by-side. He firmly believes that the notion of a “winner-takes-all” outcome is unlikely. The complexity and varied needs of global finance simply don’t support such a binary future. Instead, Kozyakov posits that we are heading towards a hybrid system. This means individuals and businesses will have the flexibility to choose between digital assets and traditional money based on what makes the most sense for a given transaction or situation. This isn’t a temporary phase; it’s the likely long-term structure of global finance. The key takeaway here is functionality. Users will increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies not just for investment or speculation, but for practical, everyday purposes. This shift underscores the growing utility and integration of digital assets into the real economy. The Future of Finance: A Hybrid Landscape What does this hybrid Future of Finance look like in practice? Imagine a world where receiving your salary in Bitcoin is as straightforward as receiving it in dollars or euros. Picture making a large deposit into a savings account using a stablecoin for its stability and lower fees, while still using your local currency for groceries. Envision sending money across borders instantly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing traditional remittance channels. This is the core of the hybrid model Kozyakov describes. Both forms of money will continue to exist and serve different, sometimes overlapping, purposes. The choice will be driven by efficiency, cost, speed, and specific use case requirements. Flexibility: Users can switch between crypto and fiat as needed. Efficiency: Leveraging crypto for specific tasks like cross-border payments. Stability: Relying on fiat for everyday stability and regulatory clarity. Innovation: Encouraging innovation in both traditional and digital finance sectors. Digital Currency vs. Traditional Currency: Strengths and Use Cases To understand why coexistence is the likely path, it helps to look at the inherent strengths of both Digital Currency (like cryptocurrencies) and Traditional Currency (fiat). Neither is perfect for every single scenario, which is precisely why a hybrid approach is practical. Strengths of Digital Currency: Decentralization: Reduced reliance on central authorities (for many cryptocurrencies). Speed & Cost: Often faster and cheaper for cross-border transactions. Programmability: Potential for smart contracts and automated transactions. Accessibility: Easier access to financial services for the unbanked. Strengths of Traditional Currency: Stability: Less volatile for everyday transactions (generally). Regulation: Established legal frameworks and consumer protection. Widespread Acceptance: Universally accepted for goods and services. Physical Form: Still necessary and preferred for many interactions. Here’s a simple comparison table illustrating how they might complement each other: Feature Digital Currency (Crypto) Traditional Currency (Fiat) Hybrid Use Case Cross-Border Payments Fast, Low Fee Slower, Higher Fee Use crypto for remittance, convert to fiat upon arrival. Everyday Spending Volatility risk, Acceptance varies Stable, Universally accepted Hold crypto, convert small amounts to fiat for daily purchases. Savings/Large Deposits Potential for yield, Stablecoins offer stability Insured (in many regions), Predictable Use stablecoins for digital savings, traditional banks for insured deposits. Salaries Growing option, appeals to tech-savvy Standard, Predictable Receive salary partially in crypto, partially in fiat. The Rise of Practical Crypto Payments Mercuryo, the company Kozyakov leads, is at the forefront of enabling practical Crypto Payments . Their platform facilitates the conversion and transfer of value between crypto and fiat, bridging the gap between the two worlds. This infrastructure is crucial for realizing the hybrid future. Kozyakov specifically highlighted several functional purposes where crypto is already gaining traction: Salary Payments: Companies are beginning to offer employees the option to receive part or all of their salary in cryptocurrency, particularly in the tech and blockchain sectors. Deposits: Using crypto, including stablecoins, for making deposits into various accounts or platforms, leveraging the speed and lower costs. Cross-Border Remittances: Sending money internationally using crypto is often significantly cheaper and faster than traditional money transfer services, benefiting migrant workers and global families. Beyond these, we see crypto payments being explored in retail, B2B transactions, and even real estate. As the infrastructure improves and regulatory clarity emerges, the use cases for crypto in everyday transactions will only expand. Navigating the Hybrid Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the vision of coexistence is compelling, realizing the hybrid Future of Finance isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle in many jurisdictions. User education is also key; many people are still unfamiliar or uncomfortable with using digital currencies. However, these challenges also present opportunities. Companies like Mercuryo are working to simplify the user experience and build the necessary infrastructure. Governments are slowly but surely developing regulatory frameworks. As adoption grows and technology evolves, the transition to a hybrid system will become smoother. For individuals, the opportunity lies in gaining financial flexibility and accessing more efficient services. For businesses, it’s about reaching new markets, reducing transaction costs, and staying ahead in a rapidly evolving financial world. Actionable Insights for the Hybrid Future What can you do to prepare for or thrive in this hybrid financial future? Educate Yourself: Learn the basics of how digital currency works and its potential use cases. Explore Practical Applications: Look into using crypto for specific needs like remittances or online payments where it offers clear advantages. Use Reputable Platforms: If you engage with crypto, use established and regulated platforms that facilitate secure interactions between crypto and fiat. Stay Informed on Regulations: Keep an eye on how your local government is approaching digital assets. The transition won’t happen overnight, but the direction is clear: integration, not replacement. Conclusion: A Future of Choice Petr Kozyakov’s perspective offers a grounded and realistic view of the financial future. The world is unlikely to simply swap fiat for crypto. Instead, we are moving towards a sophisticated hybrid system where Crypto and Fiat currencies operate in tandem, each leveraged for its unique strengths. This approach offers greater flexibility, efficiency, and choice for individuals and businesses alike. As infrastructure develops and understanding grows, the practical applications of Digital Currency will become increasingly common, complementing the stability and widespread acceptance of Traditional Currency and transforming the overall Future of Finance , driven by the growing utility of Crypto Payments .

The BNB/USD value has deteriorated to $595.2 in the past 24 hours. From an overall analysis, the currency has lost up to 0.08% of its value during the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to showcase a bearish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,696.64 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours towards the support at $585.3. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems unstable because the Bulls secured the level in the earlier week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,696.64 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, a level it continues to maintain in May.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-06 15:52:00

Maxine Waters walked out in protest over President Donald Trump’s involvement in crypto. The joint hearing — organized by the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees — was meant to discuss a new draft of market structure legislation that would divide oversight of digital assets between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But, for a moment, the debate on regulatory frameworks was interrupted and marked by political tension. Waters, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, formally objected to the hearing at its outset. “I object to this joint hearing because of the corruption of the President of the United States and his ownership of crypto and his oversight of all the agencies,” she said during the session, before exiting with other Democratic members. During a heated exchange, Waters kept “insisting on the objection,” citing dubious ties between Trump and the crypto industry. You might also like: 21Shares launches ETP giving exposure to Crypto.com’s CRO Partisan concerns over crypto The walkout followed Waters’ earlier warning to Committee Chair French Hill that she would oppose the session unless Republican lawmakers agreed to include language addressing Trump’s financial ties to crypto. Those ties have come under increased scrutiny in recent months, with Trump and his wife, Melania, launching their own memecoins, and a pro-Trump financial group, World Liberty Financial, unveiling a stablecoin. Trump also held a crypto fundraising dinner Monday night, with prices reportedly reaching $1.5 million per plate. Hill responded by defending the bipartisan nature of the legislative efforts, saying the new draft “places universal requirements on issuers of all stripes” and should not be derailed by political disputes, according to Politico.

Over the weekend, several Democratic senators, including Mark Warner and Raphael Warnock, flagged issues such as the need for stronger anti-money laundering rules and stricter oversight of foreign issuers. Waters is reportedly planning a separate “shadow hearing” to highlight what she sees as conflicts of interest surrounding Trump’s crypto activities.

Investors who previously expected ADA to reach $1 prices now invest in MUTM due to the popularity of its whale-powered DeFi project which has received $7.6 million from presale contributors and sold 443 million tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains widespread interest through its lending model while running structured tokenomics while Cardano faces decreasing price movements. The crypto market seems to be turning its attention to MUTM while ADA experiences decreased audience engagement which leads to the question of whether ADA’s time has passed. Direction can be found through comprehensive examination of the projects’ historical and present courses. Cardano’s Fading Momentum The market presence of Cardano slows down. Since ADA reached a short-lived peak of $0.80 in February the currency has moved into an unexciting price stabilizing period which keeps the price above $0.65. Transaction fees in the network demonstrate a significant decline of 52% which reduced them to $8.1k while usage has been substantially reduced. The current levels of active network addresses and transaction volumes reached multi-month lows because adoption has decreased. The Relative Strength Index demonstrates rare occurrences of overbought zones which indicate short-lived speculative events without establishing strong market demand. The lack of a factor to boost excitement makes the $1 ADA price target seem unattainable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as one of the preferred investment choices for market participants who are seeking new opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale of phase 4 continues to attract investors as its tokens are priced at $0.025 and over 57% of them are being purchased. More than 9,500 people have participated in the presale period that has accumulated $7.6 million in funds. The price of MUTM tokens will increase by 20% during phase 5 when investors can buy them at $0.03 per token. This price rise provides existing investors with a 20% gain. Analysts predict the tokenomics for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide a 140% return on investment starting at $0.06 listing price and lead to a future valuation of $2.50 which equates to a total 9,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) created a leader-board display that shows the top 50 holders and gives bonus tokens as a reward system for maintaining their position thus producing additional FOMO effects. The fast pace of sellout during this presale period reflects the strong appeal which whales have toward the tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Security Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains trust as one of its core priorities so the team has commenced a smart contract audit process under Certik’s assessment. The completed milestone will receive social channel broadcasts which will help strengthen investor trust. MUTM token demand remains stable because of the buy-and-distribute model together with this strategic redistribution mechanism. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives users actual utility through its decentralized lending platform which brings passive revenue possibilities to investors. The approaching conclusion of phase 4 reduces the opportunity to purchase tokens at this price level allowing investors to seize the remaining window for purchase. Whales Bet on MUTM’s Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues rising while Cardano registers limited progress in the market. The inability of ADA to surpass the $1 mark and the weak network performance allows MUTM to advance through its presales phase. The crypto market demonstrates a shift toward projects which deliver instant functionality and planned development through the growing distribution of holders and fundraising amount of 7.6 million dollars. A brief window exists in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 to acquire at $0.025 before the rise generates a 140% increase and later yields a staggering 9,900% return on investment. The next big move can be found through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its present presale phase just before it jumps to phase 5.

Related Reading: TRUMP Token Bloodbath: Whales Lose Big In $8.58 Million Sell-Off That’s what researchers at Bernstein, an asset manager that monitors corporate appetite for Bitcoin, say in a new report. Their estimates hinge on the assumption that additional firms will follow in the footsteps of Strategy’s tactics of retaining Bitcoin as a central component of their balance sheets. Strategy Sets The Tone MicroStrategy, now doing business under the name Strategy, has already made waves with its aggressive Bitcoin buys. The firm now sits with 555,450 BTC. That inventory has cost them approximately $38 billion, with an average of $68,550 per coin. Recently, they purchased another 1,895 BTC for $180 million. Bernstein projects that corporate treasury investments in #Bitcoin could reach $330 billion by 2029, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) potentially contributing $124 billion of that total. This forecast underscores the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a treasury… — Naeem Aslam (@NaeemAslam23) May 5, 2025 Bernstein believes that this strategy gains traction. Its report states companies with sluggish growth and plenty of excess cash could be attracted to Bitcoin as an alternative destination to invest their cash. Between 2025 and 2030, listed firms alone could steer some $205 billion toward Bitcoin. Adding to that is another $124 billion which could be made by companies following Strategy’s systematic blueprint to investment in the top crypto. Treasuries Could Fuel Demand In Bernstein’s words, some movement, no matter how little, would lead to a great impact. This gigantic flow would amount to $190 billion if just 20% of related firms were to transfer 25% of their treasury balance into an investment in Bitcoin. These firms have very low growth and few compelling investment opportunities. That could make Bitcoin simply look good for capital investment for them. Currently, public companies already possess approximately 720,898 BTC, which is valued at almost $68 billion. That’s a significant increase from the 1.3% of the total supply of Bitcoin that they had in late 2023. Today, it’s 3.4%. Private companies are not far behind, possessing approximately 398,323 BTC, valued at a little over $37 billion. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges Increasing Interest And Limited Supply The surge in corporate Bitcoin ownership is occurring alongside evolving regulation and accounting practices. These changes might be facilitating more ease of access for companies to look into Bitcoin with less bureaucratic red tape. Additionally, with fewer coins on the market and easier access to capital, businesses might become the force behind increased demand—and possibly even prices. Bernstein cites Strategy’s work in this revolution. The company has developed systems and tools that enable it to continue purchasing Bitcoin, even through challenging market periods. Not every company can follow suit, but the framework exists for others to attempt it.

Investors watching current market movements are focusing on MAGACOINFINANCE , XRP , Ethereum , and Bitcoin —three names that reflect both long-term strength and emerging potential. With fundamentals aligning and institutional interest expanding, these assets are becoming central to discussions about the next phase of growth in the crypto market. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Establishing Real Traction at the Early Stage Unlike projects that rely on short-term speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining attention for the right reasons: structure, execution, and growth. The project has already raised over $7.8 million , reflecting growing confidence among early investors. Wallet numbers are increasing. Developer milestones are being met. And community engagement is building steadily across multiple regions. This is the kind of momentum that often precedes widespread market recognition. For those looking to enter at a critical point in a project’s trajectory, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out. Market Foundations: Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Leading Protocols Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized innovation. With rapid Layer-2 scaling and increasing real-world integrations, its ecosystem continues to expand across finance, gaming, and enterprise use. Bitcoin (BTC) holds its role as a digital store of value. Its acceptance among institutional investors, along with new ETF vehicles, reinforces its long-term position in the global financial landscape. Together, these assets provide a level of stability and scale that’s essential for overall market growth—but the outsized return potential lies in identifying earlier-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE. Ecosystem Builders to Watch: Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Polygon continues to serve as a key infrastructure layer for Ethereum scalability and real-world adoption. Tron leads in transaction volume across many regions, especially for high-throughput, cost-effective use cases. Arbitrum is the frontrunner in Ethereum Layer-2 development, driving innovation across decentralized applications and financial protocols. While these protocols support broad adoption, MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare chance to participate in an early-stage project before mass exposure. Final Insight Can an investment today grow toward $1.3 million ? In digital markets, timing and conviction remain the key drivers of transformative outcomes. Ethereum and Bitcoin are solidifying leadership—but MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one quietly building toward that kind of exceptional return. With $7.8 million raised and growing visibility, the project is no longer a secret—yet the full upside may still be ahead.

XOCIETY and adidas have a mutual focus on digital identity and creativity at the intersection of on-chain gaming and immersive, playable worlds,” the video game company noted. Team Sui commented on the Adidas and XOCIETY partnership as being more than a collaboration. Per a post on X , the layer 1 blockchain noted this as a “statement.” “Web3 gaming isn’t coming.

This regulatory move will prohibit exchanges from listing privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), effectively limiting the use of these coins within the EU. However, the EU will still allow self-custody of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, meaning individuals can legally hold their own assets on hardware wallets such as Ledger. Peer-to-peer transactions, where cryptocurrencies are sent directly between users without intermediaries, will also remain permissible. France has already implemented a ban on mixers and privacy coins, and the EU's forthcoming ban extends these restrictions across member states. The European Data Protection Board has additionally recommended that blockchain data be deleted to comply with privacy regulations. Observers have noted that other countries, including Canada, may follow the EU's lead in regulating privacy coins and anonymous wallets.

Bitcoin (BTC) strengthened its dominance even as crypto markets are recovering. On Tuesday, May 6, Binance Research released a report on the state of the crypto markets in April. The report points out that the markets have recovered, gaining 9.9% over the month, largely thanks to pauses on tariffs. Despite the broader recovery, Bitcoin’s dominance has continued its steady rise, a trend ongoing since 2022. Currently, Bitcoin accounts for 63% of the total crypto market cap, the highest share since 2021. According to Binance Research, the growing discussion around a Bitcoin strategic reserve and the digital gold narrative has increased its appeal to investors.

The current bull market is gaining strength, but it’s not just the usual players like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the spotlight. As major cryptos reclaim their previous peaks, another rising trend is taking shape quietly. Privacy Coins and privacy-focused platforms are starting to catch serious attention. With traditional financial institutions entering the space via Bitcoin ETFs and regulations tightening on open blockchain networks, it’s becoming clear to many that privacy could soon be one of the most valuable features in Web3. One project that stands out in this growing trend is Cold Wallet . It’s a next-gen privacy-enabled wallet built from the ground up with user control and anonymity in mind. Currently, its presale price sits at just $0.00714 in stage 2, opening the door for early backers to enter what could be a major breakout category of the 2025 crypto surge. Here’s what’s driving interest in Privacy Coins and why Cold Wallet could be a strategic early play. The New Bull Run Won’t Be Like the Last: Privacy Could Be the Game-Change New all-time highs for Bitcoin, a rush of institutional capital, and growing public interest are defining this bull run with a different energy from the 2021 rally. This cycle is seeing stronger institutional participation. CoinShares reports that over $13 billion has flowed into digital asset products so far this year, led by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF growth. However, this influx also brings tighter monitoring, identity checks, and visibility into every wallet move. Privacy, once an option, is now becoming essential for those who want to use crypto while keeping personal data protected. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) led the privacy-first path in earlier years, but the market now seeks more advanced, usable tools. Cold Wallet rises as a unique infrastructure project, providing a wallet experience centered on privacy across chains like Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. In a space where wallet activity is becoming easier to trace, tools that encrypt interactions by default could become critical elements in Web3’s future. Cold Wallet’s Advantage: Zero-Knowledge Privacy and Fast Access Cold Wallet’s standout feature is its use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), letting users send, receive, and engage with apps on-chain without exposing transaction details or wallet addresses. This is the same core tech behind leading privacy upgrades like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync, giving users the ability to stay anonymous without giving up DeFi participation. Unlike platforms that rely on centralized storage, Cold Wallet is entirely non-custodial. It generates and holds keys locally with device-level encryption, making mass data breaches nearly impossible, unlike what happened with Ledger’s leak. Cold Wallet goes beyond just security, it’s designed to perform. It lets users trade, use DeFi, and explore dApps across multiple chains while staying hidden from trackers and third-party data tools. This blend of privacy and functionality makes it a more viable everyday solution compared to traditional cold storage or common hot wallets. Why Getting Into Privacy Coins Early Can Be a Smart Move Acting early often makes the difference in crypto, and right now, the privacy sector isn’t being talked about loudly, but it’s moving. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the news cycle, privacy-focused assets are showing strong movement beneath the surface. Zcash (ZEC) has risen more than 50% this year, and Monero (XMR) continues to see steady growth even with external pressure. But these are long-running projects, so they offer less upside from current prices. Cold Wallet’s crypto presale , priced at $0.00714 in stage 2, gives a unique chance to enter before the listing price of $0.3517. That’s a path to a projected 4,900% ROI, if the project delivers on its roadmap and the trend toward privacy-based tools accelerates like many analysts believe. It’s backed by strong potential: The Global Crypto Wallet Market is forecasted to increase from $8.42 billion today to more than $48 billion by 2032. Even with restrictions, tools like Tornado Cash show the demand for untraceable financial movement remains. Cold Wallet finds the middle ground, designed to meet future compliance needs while offering full privacy. This could match exactly what the next generation of crypto users will need. Long Story Short! Cold Wallet isn’t chasing trends like memes or NFTs. It’s building essential infrastructure for a scalable, private crypto future. Its roadmap plans include integration with Solana apps, Ethereum L2 networks, and major decentralized identity platforms, positioning it at the core of several fast-expanding Web3 areas. Presales with this level of clarity and timing are rare. Privacy won’t be optional in 2025, it will be necessary for anyone seeking secure interaction with blockchain ecosystems. Cold Wallet is still early in its rollout, and with the bull market gaining speed, this may be one of the last moments to enter before it draws wider attention.

Figment CEO and co-founder Lorien Gabel said in an interview that the company is eyeing deals in the $100 million to $200 million range. The firm is particularly interested in projects with a strong foothold in specific regions like Asia or South America or that dominate key blockchain ecosystems such as Cosmos and Solana. “We have term sheets out and we’re actively looking to acquire smaller providers,” Gabel said, pointing to a surge in opportunities amid growing regulatory clarity in the U.S. M&A Push Comes Amid Growing Regulatory Clarity The M&A push comes as the digital asset space experiences heightened deal activity. Ripple recently acquired prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, while Kraken purchased trading platform NinjaTrader in a $1.5 billion deal. Coinbase is also reportedly in advanced talks to acquire crypto derivatives exchange Deribi t. Based in Canada, Figment specializes in helping institutions stake their crypto holdings—a process that secures blockchain networks and generates yield. The firm manages approximately $15 billion in staked assets and employs around 150 people. Gabel also sees upside if U.S. regulators approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Ether that allow staking. Best Funding Rounds Of April There were 93 funding rounds in April, totaling $2.37B. Here are the main ones: @Auradine_Inc – $153M @LayerZero_Core – $55M @AlpacaHQ – $52M @NousResearch – $50M @blackbird_xyz – $50M @wunder_social – $50M @meanwhilelife – $40M @symbioticfi – $29M… pic.twitter.com/mkN7ex2ry8 — Fundraising Digest (@CryptoRank_VCs) May 3, 2025 Such ETFs already manage about $6.3 billion in assets, and staking support could unlock further demand. Despite its growth trajectory, Figment has no plans to raise additional capital or sell the company. Its last funding round in 2021 raised $110 million and was led by private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which holds a board seat. “I really don’t want to sell,” Gabel said. “This is my fourth startup. I’d rather go to zero than sort of have a single or double, to use a baseball metaphor. So I really just want to see how far we can take it at this point.” Crypto Venture Funding Surges to $4.9B in Q1 2025 Venture capital investment in the crypto industry soared to $4.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, marking the sector’s most active fundraising period since late 2022, according to a recent report from Galaxy. The surge represents a 40% increase from the previous quarter, with 446 deals closed — a 7% uptick in deal volume. While the topline figure signals renewed investor confidence in digital assets, a single transaction played an outsized role: MGX’s $2 billion investment into Binance accounted for over 40% of all capital raised during the quarter. Without that deal, total funding would have been $2.8 billion, revealing a 20% decline compared to Q4 2024. Nevertheless, the Binance transaction reshaped the funding landscape. It propelled the Trading, Exchange, Lending, and Investing category to the top of the sector rankings, with $2.55 billion in total raised — a 47.9% jump. Excluding Binance, DeFi would have led the quarter with $763 million in funding.

Whales have been making bold moves, scooping up almost one billion tokens in a month, as there are rising expectations that a spot XRP ETF could see the light of day in the US this year. Time to Buy? Ripple’s XRP recorded explosive price growth towards the end of 2024, rising from approximately $0.55 to over $2 in a matter of weeks. The positive performance continued at the start of the new year, with the price almost matching its all-time high of $3.40 on January 16. This coincided with the overall bull run of the crypto market witnessed around Donald Trump’s inauguration as America’s 47th President. In the following months, though, XRP lost some steam. It experienced enhanced volatility and eventually settled at the current $2.10 (per CoinGecko’s data). Despite the downtrend, some popular analysts remain unfazed and see the ongoing condition as a buying opportunity. One example is the X user Captain Faibik, who thinks that XRP at $2 “is an absolute gift.” They also presented a potential bullish scenario in which the price could surge to nearly $5 in the near future. Meanwhile, Crypto Tony told their over 520,000 followers on X that they “remain long above $2,” hoping for the bulls to reverse the recent slump. Dark Defender and John Squire also chipped in. The former set short-term targets of $4.40 and $6.30 but warned that investors should keep an eye on the important $2 level. For his part, Squire argued that XRP “is not dead” but “loading,” describing the asset as “the biggest sleeping giant in crypto.” The Return of the Whales Recently, large investors went on a massive buying spree, accumulating around 900 million XRP in the span of a month. The USD equivalent of the stash is just south of $2 billion. Additionally, the number of addresses holding more than 10,000 XRP peaked at a record of above 300,000. X user Amonyx labeled this as “insanely bullish” as it serves as “absolute proof of surging investor confidence.” After recent developments, the official end of the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC seems only a formality, and the event is unlikely to cause any price fluctuations for XRP. As such, investors have shifted their focus toward the potential launch of a spot XRP ETF in America, which could drive further interest in the asset and push its price up. Those curious to explore what has happened on that front can take a look at our dedicated article here . Polymarket estimates that the approval odds before the end of 2025 stand at around 77%.

Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302 into law, stating on X, “New Hampshire is once again first in the nation,” celebrating the move to permit investments in both cryptocurrency and precious metals.

To qualify, digital assets must exceed a $500 billion market capitalization, effectively limiting current eligibility to Bitcoin ( BTC ). The bill includes provisions for secure custody via state management, regulated custodians, or exchange-traded products.

Republican Rep. Jordan Ulery praised its potential to generate significant returns for the state, while Democratic Rep. Terry Spahr warned of risks to financial security. HB302 passed narrowly in the House and received strong support in Senate committee votes before reaching Governor Ayotte’s desk.

Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said the crypto industry is in for a tough summer if the U.S. Congress fails to regulate cryptocurrencies. Matt Hougan has become increasingly concerned that the U.S. Congress will be slow and unsuccessful in enacting crypto regulations, The Block reported, warning that the industry will be in for a tough summer if regulatory efforts fail. “To advance the cryptocurrency industry, Congress needs to pass legislation that legislates the advancement of crypto. “Congress passing at least one crypto bill would show that Democrats and Republicans can see eye to eye on crypto, making it even harder for future regimes to undo progress.” Hougan stated that there is uncertainty about the stablecoin law known as the GENIUS Act, that Democrats are under pressure due to Trump's activities regarding digital assets, and that there are concerns that the passage of some laws may be blocked, and that despite all these concerns, he thinks the stablecoin law will eventually pass. Despite this warning, the Bitwise CIO also stated that he believes Bitcoin will rise above $200,000 in 2025 and most altcoins will reach new ATHs. *This is not investment advice.

While the price is holding relatively stable, the momentum is weakening. Open interest and funding data point to cautious optimism, but upside continuation depends on the buyers defending key short-term levels. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Following the aforementioned rejection at the supply zone, ETH has stalled in a consolidation area with diminishing momentum. The price is still trapped below both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which continue to slope downward, signaling bearish macro structure. The recent rally from $1,500 was strong but lacked follow-through, and the price failed to close above the $1,900 zone. If ETH loses the $1,700 pivot, the next major support sits around $1,500K, which acted as the base of the prior reversal. The 4-Hour Chart The local structure has evolved into an ascending channel, with price currently dropping toward its lower boundary after failing to break the $1,800 resistance zone. The rejection from the upper bound of the channel and the false breakout above resistance triggered a sharp pullback, suggesting buyer exhaustion. Now, ETH is retesting previous demand around $1,740, and if that breaks, a rapid decline toward the $1,500 level could be expected. Sentiment Analysis Funding rates remain mostly neutral, with a slight positive bias across exchanges. This reflects a lack of aggressive long exposure, which is healthy for future rallies but doesn’t signal immediate bullish conviction. Open interest has picked up slightly over the last few days, suggesting renewed participation, but it’s still far from euphoric levels. As long as open interest builds while price compresses, there’s a higher risk of a liquidation event unless buyers step in with force. On the other hand, ETH’s current funding rate structure suggests that most participants are still waiting on the sidelines. The absence of heavily skewed long or short positioning indicates the market is in balance, but vulnerable to rapid sentiment shifts. If the asset continues to hover under resistance, aggressive traders may begin fading long setups, leading to downward pressure. However, any sudden upside breakout above the $1,900 area could catch the market off guard, triggering a wave of short covering. Until then, sentiment remains cautiously neutral with a slight bearish tilt in the short term.

Pi Coin ( PI ), a popular cryptocurrency, was trading at $0.57 on Tuesday, down by 80% from its highest point this year. This decline has coincided with significantly lower demand, with a 24-hour volume of $47.5 million. There are signs that the Pi Network price will go parabolic in the coming weeks. On Monday, crypto.news pointed to the Wyckoff Method , a 90-year-old theory identifying the phases that assets move over time. The article noted that the coin is currently in the accumulation phase, which is characterized by low volume and sideways movement. This is typically followed by the markup phase, where a minor or major news event triggers increased demand from investors.

Pi Network price chart | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, a popular trend indicator known as Bollinger Bands is signaling the potential for a strong move in the near term. This indicator comprises three lines: a simple moving average (the middle band) and upper and lower bands that represent standard deviations. The Bollinger Bands for Pi Coin have narrowed to their tightest range since the mainnet launch. Historically, such compression often precedes a bullish or bearish breakout. In Pi Network’s case, there are signs that it will make a bullish breakout since it has also formed a bullish divergence pattern. The Awesome Oscillator, an indicator that compares the recent market momentum by comparing two moving averages has been forming higher highs and is about to cross the zero line. A bullish breakout could push Pi Network’s price to the psychological level of $1, representing a 74% gain from current levels.

The SFC has authorized licensed virtual asset trading platforms to offer staking services, introducing stringent compliance measures to safeguard investor interests. These initiatives are part of Hong Kong’s broader strategy to position itself as a leading hub for regulated digital finance. Hong Kong ’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) strengthened its international outreach with a visit to the United Arab Emirates last week, meeting with key financial regulators in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to exchange views on virtual asset supervision. According to a May 6 release , Executive Director Christopher Yip and fintech head Elizabeth Wong held talks with representatives from the Securities and Commodities Authority, the Financial Services Regulatory Authority, and the Dubai Financial Services Authority, among others. Hong Kong Advances Cross-Border Cooperation The meetings focused on regulatory models for virtual assets and shared challenges in overseeing companies in the sector. The visit is part of the SFC’s ASPIRe initiative, which outlines Hong Kong’s regulatory approach to digital assets and fintech. The delegation also met with local Web3 companies, where discussions emphasized the role of clear and consistent regulation in reducing systemic risk. “The SFC will continue to lead in the regulation of virtual assets,” said Yip. He cited international collaboration and policy development as central to Hong Kong’s strategy for financial innovation. The visit comes amid broader efforts by Hong Kong authorities to strengthen ties with global partners and position the city as a key jurisdiction for regulated digital finance. Hong Kong has secured its position as the world’s second-most crypto-friendly city, according to the latest Crypto Report 2025. #HongKong #Crypto https://t.co/fvPdL6KDX4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 SFC Lifts Staking Ban The SFC expanded its digital asset framework in April by authorizing licensed crypto platforms to offer staking services , marking a shift from previous restrictions imposed in mid-2023. The announcement was made during the Web3 Festival, where the regulator released a detailed circular outlining compliance standards for staking operations. The new rules require that virtual asset trading platforms maintain full control over staked client assets, barring the use of third-party custodians. Operators must disclose information such as lock-up periods, fees, and potential risks—including validator penalties, hacking, and protocol-level bugs. Platforms must also implement safeguards to manage these risks and ensure users understand how losses would be handled. Additionally, staking through third parties will be allowed only if platforms complete strict due diligence and monitoring. For SFC-authorized virtual asset funds, staking is restricted to partnerships with licensed platforms and approved custodians, and is subject to prior regulatory approval and exposure caps. The SFC’s recent actions suggest a deliberate effort to synchronize with jurisdictions actively shaping the next phase of global crypto governance. As more economies introduce formal frameworks for digital assets, regulatory compatibility may become a competitive advantage, particularly for cities positioning themselves as hubs for institutional-grade crypto activity.

To read full editions, subscribe . Adidas is dressing up in-game characters with a collection of NFT skins for Xociety, an upcoming third-person crypto shooter game with RPG elements. 2,600 Adidas mystery box NFTs can be opened to reveal in-game skins, including black hoodies, neon Adidas tracksuits, and other looks emblazoned with the Adidas logo. Like Xociety itself, these NFTs will use the Sui L1 chain. Each box consists of a specific number of full clothing sets. Each box will offer one of four rarity tiers: Uncommon, Rare, Epic and First. Uncommon will have three sets, Rare will have four, and Epic and First will come with eight sets of apparel. The boxes will mint on Tradeport on May 16 at 9 am ET. To me, these avatars look a lot like Nike’s RTFKT CloneX NFTs. Xociety’s deal with Adidas is a revenue share deal through which players will receive rewards “for spend by other players,” the team said, calling it a powerful way to “access real rewards across the life of Xociety.” Xociety’s audience is primarily in Asia, with South America and Europe also making up large contingents of its playerbase. So far, the game is playable via limited-time playtests. Xociety said more than 12,000 players competed in their most recent playtest across 64 different countries. The team has plans to “deliver more into the North American market” soon. Xociety will be available to play on the SuiPlay 0x1 handheld, too. Adidas has launched over a dozen different NFT collections since its first foray into the space in 2021. Its first collection, a metaverse drop with the Bored Ape Yacht Club and others, generated $23 million in revenue. But Adidas may have only kept about $6.2 million because of the other partners in the deal, research firm Ledger Insights reported. Get the news in your inbox.

However, its upcoming Pectra upgrade may be the catalyst it needs. Ethereum’s (ETH) Pectra upgrade, scheduled for this week, has been on traders’ radar for some time. On Tuesday, May 6, Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, shared her insights with crypto.news on the upgrade’s potential. Notably, Jin believes Ethereum has a unique opportunity to shift market sentiment. “Bitcoin’s dominance currently sits at a year-high of 63,9% while altcoins continue to struggle to capture any sustained market momentum outside trend-based and speculative movements. With investor sentiment cautious and capital concentration increasing around Bitcoin, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade offers a rare opportunity to flip the script in favour of altcoins,” Tracy Jin, MEXC According to Jin, the upgrade will enable the next generation of Web3 innovations. This could help renew institutional interest and revitalize Ethereum’s ecosystem. With developer activity potentially increasing, Ethereum may be able to regain its dominant position in the altcoin market.

This could even pave the way for a broader altcoin season. However, there are also risks, particularly if technical issues or delays arise. “However, if the upgrade encounters technical issues or delays like previous rollouts, Ethereum risks losing further market ground to fast-rising ecosystems like Solana, and continuing its underwhelming market performance, potentially pushing the price below the $1,300 support zone,” Tracy Jin. What will Pectra change for Ethereum? Pectra is a combination of two upgrades, Prague and Electra, which introduce significant changes to Ethereum’s validator system. Notably, the upgrade will raise the effective validator stake from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This will make it easier for large validators to spin up nodes, though it introduces some centralization risks.

This was announced by Emma Reynolds, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, at the FT Digital Asset Summit. According to her, the UK is not going to adopt the US experience. The official noted that such an approach is not suitable for the country's market. At the same time, Reynolds emphasized the importance of cooperation with the States on digital assets. A special working group of high-ranking officials from the two countries has been set up for this purpose. A forum on the regulation of digital assets is due to be held in June, Reynolds added. She said the country is exploring ”the possibility of issuing sovereign debt using distributed ledger technology.” According to Reynolds, the procurement process is already underway and the government hopes to appoint a supplier ”by the end of the summer.” Britain has no plans to fully borrow the European model for digital assets MiCa. The country intends to evaluate regulation on outcomes rather than rigid rules, focusing on the traditional financial sector, the official explained. She noted that it is impossible to establish full control over some decentralized assets, especially bitcoin. According to her, the possibilities of the state in this matter are limited by the very nature of the technology. UK unveiled draft rules for crypto industry The UK government published consultation papers on draft legislation for the crypto industry. They would provide a regulatory environment for activities such as exchanges and the issuance of stablecoins. The authorities also planned to set new admission and disclosure requirements for the digital asset market. The bill built on the Financial Markets Act of 2023, which expanded the Treasury's powers. Unlike EU countries, where MiCA regulations are in place, the UK was still just forming rules for the industry. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said the new regulations are aimed at attracting investment and developing the digital sector. She emphasized that the country will work with the US to support the responsible growth of the crypto market. The discussion of the document was open until May 25. The government had promised to publish separate rules related to market abuse and disclosure later. Osborne Clarke lawyer Nick Price, in comments to Reuters , called the bill ”simple and straightforward”. He said it would provide greater certainty, stability and consumer protection.

The state beat a number of others to the punch this year as what had started as a surge in state lawmaker momentum had run into roadblocks over recent weeks. As the first to authorize its treasurer to set up such a reserve, New Hampshire could very well beat the U.S. government in forming a stockpile, too. ""New Hampshire is once again first in the Nation,"" New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte, a Republican who's in her first year in office, posted on social media site X . The New Hampshire bill allows the investment of up to 5% of public funds in a digital asset that has at least $500 billion in market capitalization, currently leaving bitcoin ( BTC ) as the only qualifying asset. ""We're incredibly excited about the win that has occurred in New Hampshire,"" said Dennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Action Fund that's been pushing state lawmakers to pursue reserves. He told CoinDesk in an interview that he's hoping other state's will follow suit. ""The first one's the hardest, by far,"" Porter said. ""Having a state that's already gotten it done, it'll really increase the political momentum."" State House Republicans in New Hampshire also posted on X Tuesday, boasting that their state is ""OFFICIALLY the first state to lay the groundwork for a strategic bitcoin reserve."" ""The Live Free or Die state is leading the way in forging the future of commerce and digital assets,"" they wrote. Arizona had been the first state to get a similar measure to its governor's desk, but the legislation was vetoed , though other bills are still awaiting the governor's consideration there. Florida has also withdrawn its own effort , joining a number of other states where the reserve push has fizzled. But North Carolina remains a strong contender, because its effort is being championed by a prominent lawmaker. President Donald Trump had called for his administration to set up its own bitcoin reserve and a separate crypto stockpile, though the Treasury Department is still examining what the federal government has on hand that can be redirected into those eventual funds.

SOL price is well positioned to rally above $170 if Bitcoin price reclaims $100k soon. SOL Strategies Inc. (CSE: HODL), a Canadian company dedicated to the growth and development of the Solana blockchain, announced the purchase of 122,524 SOL worth about $18,250,730 at an average price of about $148.98 per coin. At the beginning of this month, SOL Strategies announced the closing of the initial $20 million of its $500 million convertible note facility. “These purchases directly strengthen our three-pillar strategy of enterprise-grade validators, strategic SOL holdings, and Solana technology innovation,” Leah Wald, Chief Executive Officer of SOL Strategies, noted . Major Factors Fueling Solana Network Growth According to a recent report by VanEck, the meteoric growth of memecoins on the Solana network is the major driver of on-chain revenues. Furthermore, memecoin trading on the Solana network accounted for 44 percent and 35 percent of all decentralized exchanges (DEX) trading in January and April 2025 respectively. “If we exclude stablecoins, SOL, and SOL liquid staking tokens, often on the other side of trades, memecoins represent 99% of Solana trading activity in January and 95% in April. While some question the sustainability of this trend, Solana has proven its unmatched ability to process large volumes of decentralized trading,” the report noted . Meanwhile, market data analysis from Nansen shows that the top five Solana DeFi products – including Raydium, Fluxbeam, Pump.fun, and Jupiter – recorded over 239 million users in the past 30 days. Midterm Expectations for SOL Price After recording a palpable growth in April, Solana price has been trapped in a correction phase in the past two weeks. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $85 billion and a total value locked of around $7.6 billion, dropped around 2 per in the past 24 hours to trade around $142 on Tuesday, May 6, during the mid-North American session.

Cardano, meanwhile, keeps building its systematic growth strategy and scalability, but it’s a favorite among investors craving stability. However, a fresh player has also entered the fray in the name of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With the DeFi landscape getting more heated up, MUTM is attracting the attention of investors who see gigantic development potential in its groundbreaking platform. At $0.025 in its Phase 4 presale, Mutuum Finance has already enrolled over 9,500 investors and has raked in $7.6 million. With more than half of this round already gone, a 20% price hike to $0.03 is just around the corner as Phase 5 looms. Phase 4 investors can now stand to gain as much as 140% once the token goes live at its projected $0.06 opening price. Although ADA may have the advantage now, MUTM’s rocket ship path can potentially make it the one to watch in the years to come. Presale Momentum and Launch Day Valuation Confirmation Mutuum Finance is in presale at $0.025 and thus a very sought-after token among investors. Phase 4 token holders will be rewarded with a 20% increase in value when the token hits Phase 5. Although the starting price when the token will go live will be $0.06, there are certain crypto experts who are predicting a stunning spike, by as much as $3, in the near future when the token goes on sale. This vicious price prediction compared to current presale value is the reason why MUTM continues to stir passionate debate among low-cap DeFi project supporters. Driving DeFi Innovation with a Next-Gen Lending System Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in the DeFi arena through its two-model lending approach. Through its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) architecture, users can lend stablecoins to smart contract pools for returns. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option permits borrowers and lenders to communicate with one another without intermediaries, generating a more agile lending platform. This twin mechanism offers an effortless and decentralized experience for users who want stability and returns. A full Certik audit is ongoing to further verify Mutuum Finance’s smart contract design. Along with its open-source status, the audit should increase transparency and improve confidence as the platform grows. Encouraging Community Development through Strategic Incentives To promote long-term engagement, Mutuum Finance is launching several reward schemes. A continuous $100,000 giveaway rewards ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. There is also a referral scheme that promotes community expansion by rewarding users who invite others to the platform. Early adopters also get access to feature updates and platform enhancements, promoting long-term user engagement and loyalty. Mutuum Finance also seeks to mitigate the volatility associated with algorithmic stablecoins by launching a fully USD-backed, over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin will provide more predictability and a stable base for lending and borrowing operations on the platform. Smart Tokenomics With Long-Term Focus One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance aims to be a serious contender in the DeFi space, having raised over $7.6 million and having over 9,500 investors already committed in its Phase 4 presale. As the token will jump 20% when Phase 5 goes live, and with projections showing a leap to $0.06 at launch, phase 4 investors can expect to earn 140% profit. Invest now before Phase 4 is sold out, now’s your chance to own a piece of the next DeFi innovation. Don’t let it get away from you.

According to the press release shared with Cryptonews , the developer incentive program follows the release of Mini Apps 1.2 . This was a significant upgrade to the World App ecosystem that enabled developers to build, test, and ship “lightweight, onchain apps to millions of users.” What's the #1 challenge for onchain apps? USERS The solution? Build a Mini App on World App with us and get real users. The @Worldcoin ecosystem connects you directly to 12M+ verified/unique humans. No bots. No manipulation. Just real people ready to use what you… — Alchemy (@Alchemy) May 6, 2025 Now, the new initiative provides developers with up to four months of free access to Alchemy’s infrastructure, compute credits, engineering support, and market. This includes co-marketing, in-person events, and “partner amplification.” The campaign is available specifically to developers building human-first Mini Apps for the network of 26 million users. Additionally, separately, World’s Mini App developer rewards program still offers up to $25,000 per week in WLD token incentives. Per the team, these are reserved for the high-performing projects that bring utility to the World App ecosystem. Meanwhile, the team notes that World ranks among the top ten most-used rollups worldwide. It has processed over 350 million transactions from 26 million users. Alchemy’s infrastructure powers this performance, as well as the expanding access to US residents.

Developers in this country can leverage the same infrastructure powering Circle , Optimism , Polymarket , and World. This is across core services such as node infrastructure, data indexing, account abstraction, and more, the announcement says. Per Jonathan Kau, Head of Rollups at Alchemy, “World is already seeing real traction in the US, and this is just the beginning.” Meanwhile, Mini Apps are modular applications built on World App and secured by World ID. The latter solution allows users to anonymously and securely verify that each is a real and unique human. Therefore, Mini Apps allow developers to build use cases for these verified humans, including payments, DeFi, games, social platforms, and more. At the time of writing, the WLD token trades at $0.8858, unchanged over the past day. It has decreased by 20% in a week and by 85.5% in a year. The coin has appreciated by 26% in a month. The coin hit its all-time high of $11.74 in March 2024, falling 92.4% since.

The fork may bring more dynamics to the otherwise stagnant token price. The long-awaited Ethereum Pectra upgrade is coming on May 7, bringing changes to end-user experience, as well as network scalability. The upgrade is expected at block height 364032, with no signs of arriving later or earlier than scheduled. The biggest changes will be the introduction of smart wallets, increasing blob capacity, and the expansion of staking from 32 ETH to a maximum of 2,048 ETH. Pectra lands in under 24 hours – it's lowkey an underrated Ethereum hardfork 1️⃣7702: All 0x wallets become smart contact wallets 2️⃣7691: Blob capacity 2xs, from 3→6 3️⃣7251: Validators stake can range between 32-2,048 ETH They're are more, but EIP7702 is the huge unlock👇 — David Hoffman (@TrustlessState) May 6, 2025 The upgrade arrives at a time when Ethereum blobs are seeing increased usage, burning between 84 and 100 ETH in 24 hours. Blob usage is currently the leading activity on Ethereum based on fee burns. The upgrade will further bring down the costs of L2 chains while also boosting native Ethereum-based activities. The upgrade will target both large-scale holders and end users with smart wallets, batch transactions, and smart sessions, pointed out Pedro Gomes , builder of WalletConnect. The upgrade opens the doors to personal smart wallets and cheaper usage of Web3 services with sponsored gas. The upgrade will cause temporary delays in ETH deposits and withdrawals for some services. Crypto.com will support the upgrade and will shut down deposits and withdrawals around the predetermined block height to ensure network stability. The upgrade comes at a time when Ethereum active addresses have fallen as low as 326K in 24 hours, lagging behind Solana and L2 chains. Previously, Pectra was expected as late as June, but the readiness of nodes pushed the upgrade earlier. Pectra is part of the effort to make Ethereum more scalable and not as reliant on L2 chains. The end goal is to return on-chain activity to Ethereum while retaining the capabilities of L2 chains. ETH slumps before Pectra launch Pectra has been widely considered a potential trigger for the price of ETH. However, ETH has rarely rallied after upgrades, and the news kept failing to cause a rally. Just as Pectra was announced, ETH sank again under $1,800. ETH traded at $1,770.13, with open interest under $10B. ETH is at a crossroads, with a mix of accumulation and panic-selling for a loss. The token is seen as risky for another correction, preventing traders from risking leveraged positions. The Pectra upgrade is one of the factors behind the most optimistic predictions for an ETH rally . Ethereum DeFi users signal expectations of a deep price drop, while Pectra is seen as a bullish factor for the ETH market price. | Source: DeFi Llama The potential downside of ETH is also pushing DeFi protocols, where loans are starting at a lower liquidation price in the $1,400 range. Liquidation levels in DeFi go as low as $863, signaling relatively low confidence in the ability of ETH to hold a reliable price range. The overall sentiment on Ethereum means Pectra may not move the price based on the most bullish predictions. However, the upgrade is seen as one of the potential factors to stop the five-month slide of ETH. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Analyst Weighs In,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-about-to-explode-analyst-weighs-in/,"As XRP continues to hover near the $2 mark, market watchers are increasingly debating whether the asset has already peaked or is simply building momentum for its next leg up. One voice reigniting that conversation is XRP-focused analyst “J4b1,” who recently offered a compelling rationale for why buying XRP at $2.20 is far from being too late—in fact, it might just be the beginning. In a detailed breakdown shared with the XRP community, J4b1 argued that current price levels could be seen as a setup rather than a climax, citing historical evolution, strategic liquidity practices by Ripple, and long-term institutional forecasts to support his view. Is XRP about to explode or already overpriced? Is buying at $2.20 smart or is it too late? Let’s break it down with data, historical context, and Ripple’s price control strategy. pic.twitter.com/UHvbYD4GJl — J4b1 (@XRPJ4b1) May 4, 2025 XRP’s Early Days and Evolution into a Cross-Border Contender J4b1’s commentary began with a historical overview, recalling XRP’s launch in 2012, when it traded for fractions of a cent. At that time, Ripple was just starting to pitch its real-time settlement technology to financial institutions. As banks and payment providers began testing the benefits—fast cross-border transactions, reduced capital costs, and frictionless liquidity—the market gradually responded. XRP would go on to surge to $3.84 during the 2017 bull market, proving its viability as a scalable payment asset. However, XRP’s trajectory hit turbulence due to mounting regulatory pressures. A civil enforcement action by FinCEN in 2015 and, more significantly, the SEC’s lawsuit filed in December 2020, introduced long-term uncertainty that muted investor enthusiasm and delayed broader institutional adoption. Despite these headwinds, Ripple forged ahead, expanding its global presence, acquiring custody firm Metaco, and building enterprise infrastructure designed to support large-scale tokenized payments. A Strategic Price Point? Understanding Ripple’s Approach to XRP Supply The analyst also examined how Ripple handles its XRP holdings through a monthly escrow schedule. Each month, one billion XRP is released, though only a portion enters circulation, mainly through over-the-counter channels designed to prevent market shocks. The unused portion is returned to escrow, creating a dynamic supply mechanism that both preserves liquidity and reduces the risk of excessive volatility. J4b1 suggested this practice may help Ripple maintain XRP around functional price points needed to process large financial transactions. For instance, if the firm requires $200 million in transactional liquidity and plans to use 100 million XRP, the token would need to hold a value of at least $2. While not confirmed officially, this theoretical framework raises the possibility that Ripple prefers XRP to remain within a specific price band, at least until wider adoption removes the need for internal price targeting. Institutional Catalysts and Utility-Based Growth While XRP’s price has shown resilience, J4b1 believes its biggest movement could still be ahead. He points to upcoming developments that could serve as catalysts for a breakout. These include the potential approval of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , more widespread tokenization of real-world assets on the XRP Ledger, and renewed institutional engagement following the anticipated return of a pro-crypto U.S. administration. Perhaps most compelling is the idea of a “supply shock.” If institutional players begin accumulating XRP at a pace that exceeds Ripple’s controlled release strategy, upward price pressure could mount rapidly. The current period, according to J4b1, may represent a rare accumulation window before such a shift takes place. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reviving a Forgotten Forecast: The $6 to $30 Range J4b1 also revisited an intriguing piece of XRP lore: an alleged internal report from BlackRock dating back to 2018. The document reportedly projected that XRP could reach anywhere from $6.37 to $30 in bullish conditions, based on utility and institutional interest. While such figures were sidelined during the SEC litigation, the analyst believes that the market may be entering a phase where those numbers regain relevance. He emphasized that these aren’t sensational price targets pulled from thin air—they stem from models that analyze Ripple’s business trajectory, global regulatory progress, and increasing enterprise use cases. Even a moderate realization of XRP’s potential as a bridge currency for global payments, he argues, would validate today’s prices as a strategic entry point rather than a late one. Too Late or Just in Time? The underlying message from J4b1’s analysis is clear: XRP’s current valuation may be far closer to the starting line than the finish line. Institutional interest, combined with Ripple’s deliberate ecosystem management and the resolution of regulatory uncertainty, could propel XRP far beyond its current range. While short-term traders may focus on price resistance levels, long-term investors may want to consider the broader narrative taking shape. For those wondering whether they’ve missed the train by looking at XRP at $2.20, the answer, according to this analyst, is a resounding no. Instead, it might just be the on-ramp to a larger journey fueled by utility, infrastructure, and global financial transformation.

A recent Deloitte report predicts that the tokenized real estate market could reach $4 trillion by 2035. While the number is quite largee, it remains a drop in the bucket relative to the $658 trillion size of the global real estate industry. The thesis for tokenizing real estate is simple: blockchain can modernize how ownership is tracked, assets are accessed, and capital flows across markets. Real estate is about as “real world” as it gets, and seeing tokenization reshape the world’s largest asset class speaks volumes. To understand what it takes to actually support this transformation, I spoke with Teddy Pornprinya, co-founder of Plume Network. Plume is working on the infrastructure layer that could help make tokenized real estate, and other real-world assets, scalable, compliant, and accessible. In our conversation, Pornprinya discusses the challenges of cross-chain interoperability, regulatory complexity, and user trust, while explaining how Plume is building for both institutional adoption and retail access. Here’s our full Q&A. crypto.news: Deloitte’s report predicts $4 trillion of real estate will be tokenized by 2035 which is just 10 years away. Is Plume’s infrastructure prepared to scale for that level of asset tokenization? Can you comment on some of the technical hurdles (i.e latency, network capacity, throughput) you face and how it will be addressed to become an institutional-grade platform at such volumes? Teddy Pornprinya: This scale of tokenization falls under our Plume Arc initiative. To support such volumes, we’ve built compliance-first infrastructure that integrates directly with licensed partners for compliance and on/off-chain workflows. These integrations give us jurisdictional flexibility, so whether the asset originates in the U.S. or overseas, we ensure it’s onboarded in a compliant way. The tokenization process itself is managed through a workflow engine that simplifies asset onboarding for teams unfamiliar with on-chain mechanics. On the infrastructure side, we’ve already onboarded institutional-grade products like BlackRock, Blackstone, Pimco REITs through our Nest application. We’re also actively collaborating with institutional partners in New York, including Apollo. Our infrastructure is already supporting tokenized institutional assets, and we are confident it can scale as demand accelerates. CN: Deloitte breaks down the tokenized real estate market into three segments: private real estate funds, tokenized loans/securitizations, and tokenized undeveloped projects. Which of these areas is Plume Networks focusing on first, and how does that choice shape your product roadmap for the next few years? Do you plan to eventually cover all these segments (or even expand to other asset classes), and if so, how will you sequence those expansions? TP: Yes, we’re built to support a wide spectrum of real-world assets, including private real estate funds, tokenized loans, securitizations, and more speculative or underdeveloped assets. The flexibility of our system allows us to work with projects at any stage—from inception to full market readiness. For example, we helped a private equity fund in Texas tokenize its mineral assets, a traditionally offline segment. For more developed players, we focus on scaling distribution. Our model is end-to-end: we support token creation, compliance, and access to liquidity and market presence. CN: As more real-world assets are tokenized, Deloitte notes the need to “achieve interoperability across protocols. How will Plume Networks enable cross-chain interoperability for tokenized assets, and do you intend your platform to be blockchain-agnostic so that tokens can freely move and trade across different networks? TP: Yes, our approach is to make Plume blockchain-agnostic. Our Skylink product built in collaboration with LayerZero enables us to originate yield and assets on Plume and create representations of those assets on other chains like Solana, Sui, and Injective. With Skylink, end users on other blockchains don’t need to interact directly with Plume or use complicated bridges. They can simply deposit stablecoins into local vaults, and we handle the backend processes bridging funds to Plume, managing tokenization, and eventually redeeming back to the user’s chain. This creates a seamless omnichain RWA experience, unlocking new possibilities across fragmented blockchain ecosystems. CN: I have been reading about new on-chain structures like real estate trust deeds that hold property in a neutral third-party trust until a debt is repaid, effectively embedding legal contracts into blockchain tokens. How is Plume Networks incorporating real-time compliance and legal enforcement into its platform design. For example, can your smart contracts automatically enforce KYC/AML checks, investor accreditation limits, and jurisdiction-specific regulations as each transaction occurs? TP: Absolutely. Real-time compliance is core to our institutional approach. We’ve integrated compliance mechanisms directly into our smart contracts and token standards. Depending on the asset type and regulatory requirements, we support both ERC-20 and ERC-3643 token standards. This ensures compliance is enforced not just at the onboarding level but continuously across every transaction or transfer—providing the level of security and auditability that institutions require. CN: What is Plume Networks’ strategy to differentiate itself in this burgeoning market, and how will you compete against both crypto-native platforms and traditional asset managers who are also looking to tokenize assets? TP: Rather than competing with them, we often act as an enabler. Traditional asset managers and crypto-native protocols come to us for distribution and infrastructure. We offer a full stack: compliant onboarding, asset issuance, liquidity sourcing, and access to our network of users. Where we really stand out is in our ability to combine on-chain execution with institutional-grade compliance and go-to-market capabilities. We help bring assets on-chain and help them find a market through community engagement, token design, and narrative-building something neither incumbents nor DeFi-native protocols typically do well. CN: While tokenization promises to democratize investment, retail participation in real estate has historically been limited. What do you see as the main friction points preventing everyday investors from embracing tokenized assets (for example, knowledge gaps, regulatory onboarding hurdles, or user experience issues)? How is Plume Networks working to mitigate these frictions for retail investors while simultaneously meeting the needs of large institutional participants? TP: Education remains the largest barrier. Many retail investors don’t fully understand what they’re investing in, especially when it comes to real-world assets, which are more complex than typical crypto tokens. As speculative trading cools and more users shift toward fundamental-based investments, the appetite for RWA exposure is growing. We’ve also incubated a product called Nest that helps solve the KYC hurdle for non-U.S. retail users. Nest allows users to deposit into a vault managed by a KYB-compliant entity registered in the Marshall Islands. This entity acquires institutional assets and issues tokens representing their economic interest. It’s akin to how DAI abstracts collateral management. This structure allows retail users to gain exposure to RWAs without violating jurisdictional constraints. CN: With potentially trillions of dollars in assets being tokenized over the coming decade, secure custody is a critical concern. One solution would be holding property in neutral third-party trusts until obligations are met, underscoring the importance of investor protections. How is Plume addressing custody and security for tokenized assets on your network? Do you need to partner with established custodians or can you develop in-house solutions to ensure that both institutional and retail investors feel their digital assets are safe? TP: Yes, we are partnering with Anchorage, with Fireblocks with the idea that you definitely need to have institutional grade custody partners for some of these assets because it is about safety of the funds, the assets. So yes, we are working with a bunch of these institutional partners and a lot of them are investors as well.",Interviews|asset tokenization|real estate,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-05-06 17:35:46

According to a new report from Standard Chartered, a central international bank, BNB could rise from its current price of around $600 to $2,775 by the end of 2028. The report explained why BNB is likely to grow steadily and become even more critical in digital assets. Analysts Reveal BNB Follows Bitcoin and Ethereum’s Market Path According to Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, BNB has moved in line with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) since May 2021. This means BNB’s price and volatility have matched the market movement of these two top cryptocurrencies. Kendrick believes this pattern will continue, possibly helping BNB grow in value over the next four years. Binance Gives BNB Price a Strong Support System Analysts at Standard Chartered highlighted that one of the main reasons BNB is so valuable is its strong connection to Binance, one of the world’s biggest centralized exchanges. The trading company uses BNB for many things on its platform, such as trading discounts, paying fees, and more. As long as Binance stays popular and trusted, BNB will continue to have strong demand. Kendrick believes that BNB’s main value drivers, such as its use on Binance, will not change anytime soon. This stability could help BNB grow steadily and become a reliable crypto asset for investors. Kendrick even suggests that BNB could become a benchmark for digital assets, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum are often used to measure the crypto market. BNB Chain Is Simple, Yet Focused BNB Chain, which recently completed its Lorentz Hard Fork , is the blockchain that supports the BNB token. It is a layer-1 smart contract platform, just like Ethereum and Avalanche. However, Kendrick pointed out that BNB Chain is more focused and “old-fashioned.” It is mainly used for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and liquid staking. Unlike Ethereum, which supports a wide range of apps, from Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to games, BNB Chain sticks to what it knows best. This might seem like a weakness, but it can actually be a strength. By focusing on a few key uses, BNB Chain avoids being too complicated, which could help the BNB price maintain steady growth. With a strong connection to major cryptos and the backing of Binance, BNB has a good chance of rising to $2,775 by 2028. While it may not be the most popular token in the market, its solid foundation could make it one of the more reliable options for long-term investors.

The revival of these “Satoshi-era” wallets has caught the attention of analysts and traders, with questions on market timing and long-term holder activity. 10-Year Inactivity Ends With Massive Transfers The first of those wallets transferred 2,343 BTC—approximately $222.2 million at the time of transfer—after lying dormant for over 10.5 years. It originally bought those in July 2013 for $185,850, or approximately $85 per coin. The second wallet, inactive for more than 11 years, moved 1,079 BTC valued at $102.5 million. These coins were also bought in 2013 for around $91,713. Such legacy holdings reappearing usually suggest recovered private keys, estate settlements, or intentional liquidation. Fed Rate Decision Looms Large The timing of the whales matters. The Federal Reserve will announce its interest rate decision on May 7, and the majority of economists expect the central bank to stand pat at 4.25%–4.50%. With the markets still seeing uncertainty, like the recent threat of new U.S. tariffs, the whales’ behavior might be preparing for the possibility of a volatile event. Bitcoin Consolidates, Eyes Profit-Taking Bitcoin has fluctuated between $94,000 and $95,000 following a drop from $97,700 on May 2. On-chain data from Glassnode shows that about 88% of BTC supply is in profit, with Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio reverting to all-time average at 1.74. The Realized Profit/Loss Ratio (RPLR) has crossed over 1.0, typically suggesting a wave of profit realization. That can be a source of near-term selling pressure, but perhaps evidence of a sound reset and regained investor confidence. Outlook: Strategic Moves or Caution Ahead? At the time of this writing, Bitcoin stood at $94,175. Whether these whale movements signify profit-taking or anticipation of macroeconomic adjustments is unknown—but they reflect the growing tension between conviction in the long term and prudence in the short term.",Bitcoin|Regulation|Whale,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-06 17:43:00

In doing so, it acquired 122,524 SOL at an average price of $148.96, a strategic maneuver designed to expand its SOL holdings and fortify its validator infrastructure. The announcement came via an X post on May 6 that summed up the milestone in a single sentence: “Building the institutional backbone of @solana, one block at a time.” SOL Strategies has acquired 122,524 $SOL at an average price of $148.96, deploying the full $20M initial tranche from our recently closed ATW facility. Building the institutional backbone of @solana , one block at a time. $HODL $CYFRF Read more: https://t.co/5ChdbDfTNY pic.twitter.com/s7RfrIPbP2 — SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL | OTCQX: CYFRF) (@solstrategies_) May 6, 2025 Behind that statement lies a sweeping institutional strategy unlike any seen in the Solana ecosystem so far. The purchase was executed using a uniquely structured financing vehicle to integrate deep capital deployment, validator expansion, and ecosystem alignment. The facility, arranged with ATW Partners, provides capital and a link between return on investment and staking yield, a first in crypto finance. “With the closing of our initial $20 million tranche from the ATW facility, we’re executing exactly as promised—strategically acquiring SOL to expand our validator operations and ecosystem position,” said CEO Leah Wald. “These purchases directly strengthen our three-pillar strategy of enterprise-grade validators, strategic SOL holdings, and Solana technology innovation,” she added. The company spent $18.25 million of the $20 million tranche on its 122,524 SOL buy. Unlike passive crypto treasury strategies adopted by other public companies, SOL Strategies is staking all acquired tokens, activating an income-generating loop from day one. The Yield-Driven Structure Behind the Acquisition The $500 million convertible note facility with ATW Partners is no ordinary funding mechanism. @solstrategies_ secures $500M convertible note facility to boost SOL purchases and validator growth, leveraging staking yields in a landmark institutional move. #Solana #Staking https://t.co/MwGFIciCcw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2025 The interest on the notes will be paid in SOL, capped at 85% of the staking yield generated by the tokens acquired through the facility. This approach effectively transforms passive token ownership into an active yield machine, where every dollar deployed enhances both treasury and validator income. “This is the largest financing facility of its kind in the Solana ecosystem—and the first ever directly tied to staking yield,” Wald explained. The facility also includes an optional equity conversion feature, allowing ATW Partners to convert Notes into common shares at prevailing market prices. This provides potential upside while aligning long-term incentives. Cohen & Company Capital Markets, the placement agent, will receive a 4% finder’s fee. While other firms like MicroStrategy and GameStop have ventured into crypto with large treasury buys of BTC, SOL Strategies is setting a new precedent by merging asset acquisition with active validator participation. The staking component and yield reinvestment could make this strategy bold and sustainable. Validator Acquisitions, Network Governance, and the Bigger Picture The SOL purchases are just the latest piece of an expansive strategy. In March 2025, SOL Strategies completed a $24 million acquisition of three major Solana validators , including the highly respected Laine and the validator analytics platform Stakewiz.com. The transaction, funded through a mix of cash, equity, and warrants, doubled the company’s SOL stake to over 3.35 million tokens, valued at around $388 million at the time. SOL Strategies ( @solstrategies_ ) finalized a $24M acquisition of Laine and Stakewiz in March, increasing its SOL stake to over 3.3 million. It also voted for the SIMD-228 proposal. #Solana #Web3 https://t.co/u56Ja92Vi2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 8, 2025 As of March 2025, SOL Strategies reported the following allocations: over 1.5 million SOL on the Laine validator, 690,571 SOL on the Cogent Crypto validator, 682,488 SOL on Orangefin Ventures, and 473,159 SOL on its proprietary validator. Of the latter, 264,275 SOL is self-delegated. The company paid $24.5 million for the acquisition, split into $3.5 million in cash, 10 million shares (5 million at close and 5 million on the first anniversary), and 4.5 million share purchase warrants. All shares and warrants are subject to a four-month lock-up period to ensure market stability. With its $500 million facility now partially activated, the remaining $480 million represents ample dry powder for additional token purchases, validator deployments, or strategic partnerships.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holds phase 4 of its presale as its investors contribute $7.7 million throughout the sale of 445 million tokens to 9,500 holders. The token currently holds the price point of $0.025 while attracting investors through its sale of 60% of phase 4 tokens. Investors hasten before phase 5 of the presale because they expect MUTM to advance to $0.03 from its current $0.025 position. Future investors show intense interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to its carefully designed tokenomics which assures a 140% return beginning from its upcoming $0.06 exchange price point. The DeFi project attempts to reach greater heights than Cardano’s gradual ascent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites FOMO The cryptocurrency market is currently focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The presale tokens for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are available during phase 4 at a price of $0.025 and the sale continues rapidly. The recent token selling phase has reached 60% consumption before its completion which indicates high market demand. The transition to phase 5 worth $0.03 will provide investors with a 20% profit on their investment from phase 4. Investors who purchase during the MUTM presale have the possibility to receive a remarkable 140% return upon listing at $0.06, yet market speculations point toward a steep price increase to $3, which yields an astonishing 11,900% profit. The investors join the frenzy because of this methodically crafted structure which contains no unproven speculative components. Phase 4 is rapidly coming to an end while the clock continues to tick. Innovative features drive demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) depends only on its quality features rather than the excitement surrounding its presale phase. A CertiK audit of the smart contract continues at present and the team will soon reveal findings on social media platforms to enhance trust. The project introduced new features that display the top 50 token holders who would get bonus tokens if they manage to stay within the ranking group. Network members retain their funds because of the engaging reward system which creates extended stay behavior. Mutuum Finance enables users to secure loans through a dual platform of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems which provides borrowing and passive income earning capability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides practical DeFi solutions that help users prevent the fluctuation of meme coins. Cardano’s steady path lags behind ADA keeps its position as an established crypto asset because of its blockchain which relies on thorough research. Investors who desire rapid price appreciation become annoyed by the methodical nature of its growth. Cardano’s development of scalability and smart contracts does not match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in terms of potential price growth. The specific presale format along with automatic purchase drivers within Mutuum Finance systems surpasses Cardano’s market trend method of evaluation. The crypto community is now watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its defined growth plan and quick profit opportunities. The $2 price ascent projected for Cardano in 2025 will not match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which continues to pull ahead of competition toward reaching $5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight Token holders in Cardano should note the significance of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to its market potential. Its phase 4 presale at $0.025 offers a rare entry point before the imminent price hike to $0.03. Numerous indicators point to strong momentum because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has collected $7.7 million while acquiring 9,500 holders. Users searching for lucrative opportunities in decentralized finance should notice Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because it offers both 140% listing profit potential and a $3 price projection upon launch. Active participation in the presale during phase 4 is essential because phase 5 will trigger both price increases and lower profit potential.

In a recent article, Hougan said the recent decision of nine Democrat senators to oppose the Stablecoin Act could affect the Bill’s progress. According to Hougan , the decision of these Senators, most of whom supported the Bill when it passed in the Senate Banking Committee in March, is not a good sign. The senators claimed their opposition was because the proposed law did not have sufficient anti-money laundering provisions and said they would support the Bill once these concerns were addressed. However, Hougan believes this is not the true reason for the change in tune and is mostly due to politics. He said: “The change in tune reflects the shifting political environment in Washington. The amended version of the Bill is stronger on AML/KYC and other items than the version passed out of the Banking Committee.” Instead, the Bitwise executive believes that President Trump’s approval rating, which has been falling, and the concerns about conflict of interest due to Trump’s family affiliations with crypto businesses might be major reasons Democrats are holding back. Nevertheless, Hougan believes the Stablecoin bill will still pass despite the current setbacks, noting that it is crucial enough to the US overall interest for politicians to look beyond partisan interests. Stablecoin bill failure could hurt crypto Meanwhile, the crypto executive warned that the continued growth of the crypto industry in 2025 depends on the passing of the Stablecoin bill. According to him, the industry now needs legislation to cement all the progress it has made during Trump’s administration, and the best chance currently is the Stablecoin bill. Since Trump became President, the crypto sector has seen a flurry of positive developments, with the President fulfilling most of his campaign promises to industry. However, Hougan noted that almost all pro-crypto efforts have come from the White House, meaning another administration can reverse the gains. In order to prevent this, Congress must pass a law that shows the progress of crypto. Hougan identifies stablecoin as a bi-partisan issue that should garner the support of everyone regardless of political affiliations. He said: “To move crypto forward, we need Congress to pass legislation enshrining crypto’s progress in law. Congress passing at least one crypto bill would show that Democrats and Republicans can align on crypto, making it more difficult for future regimes to undo progress.” With uncertainties now surrounding the future of the legislation, the Bitwise executive stated that its failure could mark a rough summer for the crypto industry. However, he added that passing the Bill could also spur the bull market to a new level. Interestingly, the Bitwise CIO believes current efforts on the Market Structure Bill could impact the success of the Stablecoin legislation. A draft of the Bill was introduced in the US House of Representatives on May 5, with many considering it a positive development. However, Hougan believes all crypto lobbying efforts should focus on the Stablecoin bill until it is passed. House Democrats boycott joint hearing on crypto Meanwhile, the opposition to the digital assets regulations among Democrats in the Senate appears to have spilled over to the House of Representatives. Democrats in the House recently walked out of a scheduled hearing to discuss crypto industry regulation. Members of House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees were meant to hold a joint hearing titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: A Blueprint for the 21st Century” on May 6 with witnesses including Coinbase executive Greg Tusar and ex-chair of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Rostim Benham. However, Rep Maxine Waters, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee, objected to the hearing, citing President Trump’s corruption due to his affiliation with the crypto industry. The objection meant there was no unanimous consent, which is necessary for the joint hearing. Instead, the lawmakers have opted for an informal roundtable, with several Democrats leaving the roundtable to hold another hearing on Trump’s conflict of interest with the crypto industry.

This provides a bullish outlook for the altcoin, considering it could break out from its current range following this accumulation phase. XRP Whales On The Rise In an X post, crypto analyst Kyle revealed that over 300,000 addresses now hold 10,000 XRP, a development which he noted screams rising confidence from whales and large holders. The analyst added that a strategic accumulation looks to be back and raised the possibility of the big players trying to front-run a major move in the XRP ecosystem. Related Reading: Over $700 Million In XRP Moved In April, What Are Crypto Whales Up To? This major move could be the launch of an XRP ETF or the conclusion of the Ripple SEC lawsuit. An XRP ETF has a 90% chance of approval by the SEC this year. The launch of this fund could spark a surge in the token’s price, considering how it would drive more capital into its ecosystem. Meanwhile, the conclusion of the Ripple SEC lawsuit would also be a major development in the XRP ecosystem, as both parties have already reached an agreement. However, the court still needs to rule on the agreement before the lawsuit can be considered done and dusted. The end of the lawsuit would provide clarity and could spark a significant surge in price. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also confirmed the accumulation trend among these whales. In an X post, he revealed that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP have bought around 900 million XRP over the past month. Amid this accumulation trend, traders are also leaning bullish towards the asset. In another post, he stated that 71.54% of traders on Binance futures with open XRP positions are leaning bullish. What’s Next For The Altcoin? In an X post, crypto analyst Dark Defender discussed the current XRP price action and provided insights into what is next for the altcoin. He noted that XRP found resistance between $2.2 and $2.36 and dropped to $2.13 again. In line with this, the analyst remarked that the altcoin is getting ready to finish the correction and is on to the last bit. Related Reading: XRP Mega Candle On The Horizon? Analyst Reiterates $27 Target The analyst projects an incoming surge with five waves. He predicts that the initial wave will send the XRP towards $3, and then the altcoin will reach $4.4 and $6.3 on Waves 3 and 5, respectively. A rally to $4.4 would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the token. Meanwhile, Dark Defender stated that $1.88 is the support level to keep an eye on. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.12, down 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Amid this backdrop of innovation, Ruvi AI emerges as a prominent project that marries artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, offering a unique suite of solutions for businesses and individuals alike. Ruvi AI – Merging the Power of Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is more than just another blockchain platform. It represents a shift in technological possibilities by seamlessly integrating AI’s analytical capabilities with blockchain’s inherent transparency and security. The platform is designed to bring advanced, data-driven solutions to industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. By leveraging blockchain, Ruvi AI ensures data integrity and decentralization, allowing users to securely store and access sensitive information. At the same time, its AI tools provide predictive insights, helping organizations streamline operations and make more informed decisions. Importantly, Ruvi AI focuses on democratizing these technologies, ensuring that they’re accessible to businesses of all sizes, not just conglomerates with vast resources. This approach makes Ruvi AI stand out in its drive to serve diverse sectors while empowering everyday users with tools that were once out of reach due to complexity or cost. A Triumphant Presale Launch Ruvi AI’s presale launch has been met with resounding enthusiasm. Within mere days of its Phase 1 kickoff, the project raised over $100,000 while selling more than 10 million tokens. This remarkable achievement underscores the confidence that early investors have in Ruvi AI’s vision. Currently, Ruvi AI tokens are priced at $0.01 during Phase 1, presenting an exceptional value for early adopters. However, this opportunity will quickly dissipate as the project transitions to Phase 2 of the presale. A 50% price increase will raise tokens to $0.015, marking a crucial step in the project’s well-structured roadmap. To reinforce investor confidence, Ruvi AI plans to launch its beta version shortly after the presale concludes. This phase will give users access to the platform’s capabilities and further cement Ruvi AI’s commitment to consistent progress and transparency. VIP Opportunity for Early Contributors Understanding the importance of incentivizing early adoption, Ruvi AI offers exclusive VIP tiers that reward supporters with significant benefits. These tailored tiers ensure investors of all scales can maximize their returns. VIP Tier 3 For a $1,000 investment, VIP Tier 3 participants receive 100,000 tokens plus a 60% bonus, totaling 160,000 tokens. At the listed price of $0.07, this translates to $11,200. However, should Ruvi AI tokens achieve the ambitious $1 valuation, this investment could yield a staggering $160,000, offering an impressive return for mid-range investors. VIP Tier 5 Ruvi AI’s most lucrative VIP tier, Tier 5, is designed for larger-scale contributors. A $5,000 investment secures 500,000 tokens, complemented by a 100% bonus to make up a sum of 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price, this allocation is valued at $70,000. Should the $1 valuation be reached, VIP Tier 5 investors stand to earn a remarkable $1,000,000, making this tier a testament to the platform’s commitment to rewarding loyal and visionary investors. Leaderboard Rewards Ruvi AI goes a step further by implementing a leaderboard rewards system, recognizing and incentivizing its most engaged contributors. The system is designed to be inclusive, ensuring that contributors across varying investment levels have access to lucrative opportunities: Top 10 contributors earn 500,000 tokens, valued at $35,000 at $0.07 and $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors earn 250,000 tokens each, worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors secure 100,000 tokens each, valued at $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. Top 200 contributors gain 75,000 tokens each, equivalent to $5,250 at $0.07 and $75,000 at $1. Top 500 contributors receive 40,000 tokens each, amounting to $2,800 at $0.07 and $40,000 at $1. Top 1,000 contributors are rewarded with 20,000 tokens each, equal to $1,400 at $0.07 or $20,000 at $1. This dynamic rewards model fosters an engaged investor community, one that benefits from the project’s ongoing success. A Vision for the Future Ruvi AI is poised to redefine the relationship between blockchain and artificial intelligence, making it an industry leader in technological innovation. Its seamless fusion of decentralized and predictive technologies ensures both robust functionality and broad accessibility, appealing to industries and individual users alike. By demonstrating a strong commitment to its roadmap, fostering investor confidence through VIP opportunities, and incentivizing active participation with leaderboard rewards, Ruvi AI is carving out a unique position in the blockchain ecosystem. For investors and tech enthusiasts eager to partake in a groundbreaking project with a proven track record, Ruvi AI offers an opportunity not to be missed. Together, the community and the platform are building a future where blockchain and AI reshape industries, empower users, and set new benchmarks for innovation.

PEPE Coin has confirmed a breakout with 20% gains and bullish price action, while Stellar is approaching a key resistance zone, with analysts watching for a breakout above $0.40. Both projects are benefiting from renewed market sentiment, but while their next moves rely on confirmation or follow-through, BlockDAG is offering something more immediate, defined ROI, and timed rewards. With a limited-time $0.0019 entry price valid until May 13, a projected $0.05 launch value, and a 2520% ROI opportunity, BlockDAG is currently the top-performing presale project. Its $226.5 million raise and daily 25 million BDAG Buyer Battles system have made it a standout choice for investors looking for returns now, not later. PEPE Coin Builds on Breakout Momentum PEPE Coin has recently confirmed a bullish breakout, climbing 20% and entering an ascending price channel. With growing volume and steady momentum, the token has cleared key resistance zones. Technical projections suggest PEPE could rally another 226% and hit $0.00002886 by the end of May. Its recent price behavior coincides with broader positive market sentiment, especially as Bitcoin’s rally fuels renewed altcoin activity. As a meme coin, PEPE is heavily sentiment-driven, and its current technicals indicate traders are positioning for another leg up. However, with PEPE’s moves historically prone to sharp corrections, it remains a high-risk trade. The short-term chart favors bulls, but gains will likely depend on sustained market volume and breakout confirmation beyond its recent highs. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout Above $0.40 Stellar (XLM) is currently approaching the $0.40 resistance level, with bullish momentum building around its price structure. If this level is breached, analysts are pointing to mid-term targets at $0.50, $0.68, and a longer-term goal of $1.29. The renewed optimism around Stellar isn’t just technical. Major institutional backing has emerged, including Franklin Templeton’s move to use Stellar’s blockchain for managing over $1.7 trillion in assets. That validation has helped solidify XLM’s reputation as an enterprise-grade chain with tangible use cases. Still, Stellar’s price action remains stuck just below its breakout level. Until $0.40 is decisively cleared, it remains a watchlist candidate rather than a confirmed breakout. BlockDAG: $0.0019 Entry, $226.5M Raised, and 2520% ROI Potential While PEPE and Stellar await confirmation, BlockDAG is offering defined reward structures and high-entry ROI for those acting now. The current price of $0.0019, available only until May 13, offers early buyers the chance to earn 2520% returns if the coin lists at its projected $0.05 price. Unlike tokens that rely purely on speculation, BlockDAG adds daily engagement to its model through its Buyer Battles initiative. Every 24 hours, 25 million BDAG coins are distributed among presale participants. If the full allocation isn’t sold, the remaining balance goes to the day’s top buyer. This gamified mechanic fuels competition, encourages repeat participation, and aligns with BlockDAG’s broader community-building approach. The crypto presale has now raised $226.5 million, and investor interest continues to climb as the price deadline approaches. With limited time to buy at $0.0019 and daily chances to win more coins through Buyer Battles, BlockDAG is not just a presale, it’s a live ecosystem in motion. It’s also one of the only active projects offering both reward structure and transparent delivery. The clear 2520% ROI, paired with daily incentives, has made BlockDAG the most attractive and strategic crypto opportunity heading into the next bull run. To Sum it Up.. PEPE and Stellar both offer potential upside as market sentiment turns bullish. PEPE is gaining traction with meme coin traders, while Stellar is building institutional trust and nearing a key resistance breakout. However, both require confirmation, either through price action or market follow-through. BlockDAG offers no such ambiguity. With a locked $0.0019 price valid until May 13, a $226.5 million presale already in the books, and a 2520% ROI opportunity, BlockDAG provides clarity, structure, and high-return access. Add in the 25 million daily BDAG Buyer Battles, and it’s easy to see why this project is outperforming speculative plays.

Neither wallet had made any transactions since 2014. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was well below $1,000, so the transfers were remarkable in terms of both quantity and timing. The identity of the wallet owners and the reason for the transfers are currently unknown, and it is also unclear whether the two wallets belong to the same person or whether they are related in any way.

The other transfer took place from a wallet named “1PiEK” that has been dormant for 11.75 years, and transferred 1,079 BTC (about $102.5 million). This unusual whale movement also coincides with the recent increase in general whale activity. According to research published by CryptoQuant in April 2025, a total of 62,800 BTC older than seven years were transferred in the first three months of 2025. This figure is 110% more than the same period in 2024. *This is not investment advice.

Today, smart investors are evaluating MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , and Ethereum as assets that could turn a small position into something significant over time. With traction building and the market gaining broader momentum, early-stage engagement in the right projects remains one of the most effective paths to scaling returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Groundwork for Strategic Expansion The strongest digital asset trends typically begin with fundamentals—not fanfare. That’s precisely the path MAGACOINFINANCE is following. Wallet adoption is increasing steadily. Product development is progressing on schedule. Community activity is growing across key channels—and notably, without reliance on promotional hype. This level of organic traction signals a maturing project. For investors seeking early exposure to a structured and scalable asset, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a candidate worthy of close attention. Established Ecosystem Drivers: Ethereum and Bitcoin Remain Key Ethereum (ETH) continues to serve as the backbone of decentralized innovation. With scaling solutions accelerating adoption and enterprise interest expanding, its long-term viability remains strong. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its role as a digital macro asset. Institutional adoption is rising, and global sentiment is increasingly shifting toward BTC as a foundational component of diversified portfolios. While these two assets represent market leadership, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the type of entry-stage opportunity that has historically delivered the most dramatic percentage returns. Additional Assets Gaining Momentum: Polkadot and Sei Polkadot is advancing multi-chain connectivity through its parachain model, supporting a wide range of use cases in the growing Web3 ecosystem. Sei is optimizing blockchain architecture for speed and trading functionality, attracting developers building next-generation financial tools. Both are strong in their own categories, but MAGACOINFINANCE stands out for its early-phase potential and the room it offers for meaningful price discovery. Conclusion A $190 investment might seem small—but placed early in the right project, it can produce results far beyond expectations. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide long-term value, but MAGACOINFINANCE represents something rarer: a structured, early-stage asset entering its growth phase with strong fundamentals. Those watching closely now may be positioning ahead of broader recognition.

In an appearance before a House committee Tuesday morning focused on the White House’s 2026 budget requests, Bessent was asked by Congressman Chuck Edwards what it would look like if the US government’s debt levels became “unsustainable.” Says Bessent, “It would look like a sudden stop in the economy as the credit would disappear as markets would lose confidence. I’m committed to that not happening, and again, a tipping point in sustainability is very difficult to pinpoint, but what is not difficult to pinpoint is a trajectory, and the trajectory is unsustainable. When and if the markets were to rebel against is very difficult to know. I think just as I talked about the warning track for the X-date, I think that it’s very important not to go on the warning track, and we got to get to the other side of this and start reducing the debt. And the debt numbers are indeed scary, but Secretary Yellen and I both agree that it is the debt-to-GDP that is the important number so we are trying to both control the absolute level of debt, pay it down, but also grow the GDP.” As of the end of 2024, the US’s debt-to-GDP ratio was 124%. In the hearing, Bessent, a former partner at Soros Fund Management, also confirmed that he would not be in favor of the Federal Reserve introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). “We believe that digital assets belong in the private sector, and my personal view is that having a CBDC is a sign of weakness, not strength. Because really, the reason, if there is a reserve manager, or a foreign central bank holds US dollars, then there is a wide variety of US assets they can invest in. You would create a CBDC just for ease of use because there are no good choices for underlying assets.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As 2025 approaches, certain digital assets are showing signs of robust growth and stability. Readers will discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant appreciation and why these coins may represent wise investment choices. Explore the most promising candidates set to excel amidst market evolution. Arbitrum Price Trends: Past Review and Key Levels Update Over the past month, ARB showed a modest gain of 0.71%, although the week dipped by 7.41%. In a six-month view, the token lost 43.28%, which reflects a volatile history marked by mixed momentum and inconsistent trends. Currently, ARB trades in a narrow band between $0.26 and $0.38. The coin faces its first resistance at $0.43 and support at $0.19, with secondary peaks at $0.55 and lows at $0.07. Bearish signals dominate with negative momentum and moving average cues. Traders may look for a breakout above $0.43 or a drop below $0.19 to define a clearer trend. Kaspa Price Movements: Sharp Spike and 6-Month Adjustment Last month saw a near 47% surge with Kaspa , while a 21% dip over six months highlights its volatility. The coin has traded within a range of approximately $0.0586 to $0.1150, punctuated by a slight 1.69% decline noted over the past week. These movements indicate periods of strong upward bursts followed by notable pullbacks, keeping traders on alert. Current trading is between support near $0.0274 and resistance at about $0.1403. Bulls seem to maintain a strong position near support, while the lack of a clear trend suggests a cautious approach. Traders might explore short-term opportunities within these levels, with potential for testing the next resistance at about $0.1967. Stacks Price Volatility and Key Levels STX last month witnessed a strong rebound with a 30.25% increase while the past six months brought a sharp decline of 54.68%. A one-week drop of 8.12% adds to the volatile history. The coin showed mixed performance over different timeframes, highlighting its erratic market sentiment and trading potential. Current price action trades between $0.55 and $1.00, facing resistance at about $1.20 and a second hurdle near $1.65, with support spotted at $0.29. Indicator readings include a neutral RSI around 55 and slight bearish momentum, suggesting no clear trend and a balance between bulls and bears. Trading ideas include monitoring price action within these levels and waiting for more decisive movement before entering positions. Conclusion ARB , KAS , STX all exhibit strong potential for 2025. ARB focuses on enhancing transaction speeds. KAS offers innovative mining rewards. STX brings fresh possibilities to developers. Each coin presents unique benefits. These options stand out for long-term gains. Investing in them could yield substantial returns. Their growth trends show promising signals. Being informed and making smart choices is key.

The US placed a 25% tariff on all steel, aluminum, and cars from Europe, plus a 10% tariff for almost all European goods , which could rise to 20% once President Trump’s 90-day pause ends on July 8. The European Union vows to reject unfair trade deals with the U.S. On Tuesday, the European Union clarified that they will not bow down to pressures and accept an unfair tariff agreement with the United States. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic argued that the commission is not “weak” and thus will not agree to any unfair deal. He added that they plan to use the pause period to come up with more rebalancing measures. He also insisted that the US needs to show that it’s prepared to come to an objective deal. He commented, “All options remain on the table here . While the EU’s clear preference was to negotiate a solution with the United States, he said Washington now needed to show its readiness to make progress towards a fair and balanced agreement.” Nonetheless, he agrees that US import levies are unwarranted and will only cause economic harm to both sides of the Atlantic. The European Union clarified that current US tariffs affect 70% of its exports to the United States and believes it could easily increase to 97%, roughly €549 billion, after further US investigations into pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and other products. EU to share retaliatory measures with member states by Wednesday The European Union is considering imposing additional tariffs of about €100 billion, or about $113 billion, if negotiations with the US fail. The bloc had made it clear that it does not want tit-for-tat tariffs, but if talks yield no results, it aims to maximize the pain for the US with new levies while ensuring their supply chains are least affected. According to people familiar with the matter, the commission should disclose the proposed retaliatory measures to member states as early as Wednesday, followed by a month-long consultation period before final approval. The European Commission, the agency’s executive branch dealing with trade, is also set to share a paper with the US to try to start negotiations, which some have precluded to detail reduced trade and non-tariff barriers and increased investments in the US. The EU had previously extended an offer to scrap all duties on industrial goods, such as cars, but the U.S. rejected it. Additionally, the European Union proposed increasing imports of American liquefied natural gas and soybeans—measures that had helped calm trade disputes during Trump’s first term. However, the US seems more interested in the EU’s taxes on tech companies and its value-added tax rather than engaging with the bloc’s proposals. The agency has so far declined to discuss its tech levies and even claimed that its VAT is a fair and non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods. Earlier, in its first list of retaliatory measures, the EU had targeted politically sensitive constituencies in the US and included goods such as soybeans from Louisiana. The European Union could still include some of those measures in its new list. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Stocks are down as traders brace for the key Fed decision on interest rates, as tariff fears reemerge. On Tuesday, May 6, DOW Jones lost 404 points, or 0.98%, trading at 40,814, while the S&P 500 was down 0.84% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.00%. Traders were concerned after U.S. President Donald Trump made several remarks that suggested that tariff relief is unlikely. Over the weekend, Trump announced a 100% tariff on foreign movies and stated that there were no plans to talk to China’s President Xi Jinping this week. You might also like: Dow, S&P 500 slip amid ongoing market uncertainty What is more, Trump hinted at a new tariff on pharmaceuticals , which will be announced over the next two weeks. He added that he would balance the cost for consumers by reducing the regulatory burden on U.S. pharmaceutical producers. Among the biggest losers today Tesla, which registered a 2.46% decline, thanks to ongoing troubles in Europe . In the UK, consumers registered only 512 new Tesla cars in March, down 62% from a year earlier. These figures reflect similar declines in Germany, France, Sweden, and more. Tariffs cause record-high U.S. trade deficit Recent figures also showed that the U.S. trade deficit hit a record high in March, reaching $140.5 billion. The figure doubled over the last year, which stood at $68.6 billion in March 2024. The deficit was a reaction to the tariffs, as companies rushed to import as much as possible before higher rates took place. According to a report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday, the U.S. imported a record amount of goods from 10 countries. These included Mexico and Vietnam, but not China . Notably, imports from China were the lowest in five years and will probably drop further due to the continued 145% tariff rate.

The token has been forming consecutive lower highs and lows after the rejection from the pivotal range at $22. In a wider perspective, the bears seem to have held a strong grip over the rally, but the AVAX price is flashing a hidden bullish divergence that may clear the path above the local threshold. The AVAX price underwent its second successful rejection from the neckline zone, which has flashed a huge opportunity to take short positions. With the markets bleeding, there is a huge possibility that the price could take a dip towards the lower target that could complete a massive double top pattern, which could further harm the AVAX price rally in the long term. Meanwhile, the technicals do not seem to be in favor of a massive pullback, while a tight accumulation could prevail for some time. The bears have restricted the rally below $22 since the major pullback in March, which seems to have drained the strength of the bulls. Besides, the Bollinger bands have begun to squeeze as the volume drops, hinting towards a drop in the volatility. Meanwhile, the CMF or the Chaikin Money Flow, has triggered a bullish rebound from the levels not visited since July 2024. Each time the weekly CMF rebounds from the lows below -0.15, a huge upswing follows with nearly a 200% price rise. Hence, the AVAX price could trigger a strong rebound if the levels close above $20 and sustain for a day or two. With this, a rise above $22 could be validated that may further push the price above $25 and validate a rise above the bearish captivity. Failing to do so may keep the Avalanche price consolidated below $22 until a huge bullish volume creates massive buying pressure over the crypto.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 18:13:25

The energy storage and management firm said it has spent approximately $69 million acquiring Bitcoin ( BTC ) at an average price of $96,342 per BTC. The latest investment follows KULR’s December 2024 announcement that it would allocate up to 90% of its surplus cash to Bitcoin. At the time, the company held around $12 million in cash reserves and cited financial resilience and global Bitcoin adoption as core drivers behind the strategy.

This news comes as New Hampshire became the first U.S. state to authorize its treasurer to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill allowing up to 10% of state funds to be allocated to assets like Bitcoin, provided they meet strict criteria including a $500 billion market cap threshold.

Crypto whales are shifting from hype to tokens with real utility-like XRP and Remittix-fueling rapid growth forecasts. Table of Contents Remittix introduces transformational PayFi protocol, soars 400% XRP price on the verge of a major breakout The bottom line Savvy crypto investors are moving on from hype to tokens with real world utility. Coins like Ripple (XRP) and Remittix (RTX) are like this, offering valuable financial services to both retail and institutional entities. Crypto whales are already taking positions in them already as they are poised for explosive growth in the coming weeks. You might also like: Investors rush to Remittix presale, Dogecoin and Solana could fall up to 30% in April Remittix introduces transformational PayFi protocol, soars 400% Remittix concerns itself with solving the core problems plaguing cross-border payments, high fees, slow transaction times and lack of transparency. Its PayFi protocol connects global payment networks with numerous blockchains. This allows anyone to send crypto as fiat to any bank account in the world. These transactions are near-instantaneous. The associated fees are much cheaper than available alternatives like Western Union and the process is more efficient as well. This specific utility could transform the $800 billion cross-border market and that’s what Remittix aims to achieve. As a result, crypto experts are expecting big things from Remittix. If it successfully captures even a small fraction of the global remittance market, demand for RTX would go through the roof. Investors are always drawn to small projects like this with huge potential. This explains Remittix’s 400% price surge since its debut. Savvy investors, including whales, are hopping on its presale, which is the only way to join its revolution. It is available at a price of $0.0757, with room to skyrocket 10x to 25x in the coming months. XRP price on the verge of a major breakout The change in leadership at the SEC has seen chances of an XRP spot ETF approval jump above 80%. Crypto experts are now predicting new all-time highs for XRP price, with a $64 million XRP whale movement adding fuel to the momentum. At the moment, the XRP price holds firmly to confluence support levels at $2.20, established by the 50- and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). There was pivotal movement around this level in the past week, but that hasn’t deterred XRP price. Ripple continues to show signs of an upward trend towards $3.00. There’s also a buy signal in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and it reinforces this bullish momentum. In early April, the MACD line (blue) crossed above the signal line (red), indicating that demand is surging for XRP. Possible drawbacks could happen at $2.5 and $2.8 as XRP holders take profit. But with positive sentiments enveloping Ripple, these drawbacks, if they happen, aren’t likely to slow down XRP’s momentum. The bottom line Remi ttix and XRP represent contrasting bets for crypto investors. While XRP is a legacy asset with brand recognition and a massive market cap, Remittix is a nimble game-changer solving a specific global problem. Both benefit from surging whale interest, but their risk-reward profiles differ sharply. XRP’s breakout potential is real, yet its upside may be tempered by its saturated popularity, lingering regulatory risks and slower adoption curves. Remittix, on the other hand, is a disruptor that operates in a market that is seriously calling out for innovation. As a result, XRP could see steady 50-100% gains. Remittix is well-poised for a 10x surge in the coming months. This highlights its edge for aggressive investors who want to maximize their profits this year.

The collaboration, revealed at the Point Zero Forum in Switzerland, seeks to address longstanding inefficiencies in the private market ecosystem for both issuers and investors. Citi and SDX are teaming up to tokenize late-stage private shares, aiming to bring efficiency and access to the private markets sector pic.twitter.com/S2DCh85e0t — Cam (@CryptoNews_eth) May 6, 2025 Under the agreement, Citi will serve as both a digital custodian and tokenization agent on SDX’s regulated digital Central Securities Depository (CSD) platform. Together, the firms are developing a scalable, compliant solution set, scheduled to launch in the third quarter of 2025. The offering will initially focus on tokenizing late-stage pre-IPO equity, making these otherwise illiquid assets more accessible to institutional and eligible investors across the globe. For issuers, the initiative provides a compliant and efficient mechanism to enhance liquidity for early backers and employees, while preserving control over their cap tables. For investors, it marks a step forward in the democratization of access to high-growth, venture-backed private companies—traditionally out of reach due to high barriers to entry and opaque processes. The partnership will combine Citi’s global securities services expertise and client reach with SDX’s regulatory-grade digital infrastructure. “We are excited to welcome Citi to the SDX platform,” said David Newns, Head of SDX. “This project stands out by leveraging our regulated blockchain technology to bring efficient access to private shares, meeting strong investor demand for high-quality private assets.” Tokenization Continues to Gain Traction Marni McManus, Citi’s Country Officer for Switzerland , emphasized the unique opportunity made possible by Swiss regulation and SDX’s technology: “We’re helping modernize a traditionally manual, paper-heavy industry by offering digitized, scalable solutions to issuers and investors.” Ryan Marsh, Head of Innovation & Strategic Partnerships for Citi’s Investor Services and Issuer Services, added, “As tokenization gains traction, we’re ensuring our clients can participate in the evolving digital asset landscape. “Working with SDX supports our broader innovation agenda and reinforces our commitment to unlocking new opportunities.” World of Tokenized Everything? In an interview with CryptoNews, Dea Markova, Policy Director at Fireblocks, said, looking ahead, the team is focused on scaling infrastructure to handle the growing diversity of its client base, particularly in payments. However, in the long term, the company is betting big on tokenization beyond finance. “We’re imagining a world of tokenized everything. We’re already working with Sony in Japan —think supply chains, gaming, non-financial processes.” This latest initiative with Citi and SDX also supports the broader development of the Swiss digital asset ecosystem. Sygnum and SBI Digital Markets will play a key role by extending access to tokenized pre-IPO equities for clients across Europe and Asia.

While these projections have reignited interest in the digital asset, they have also highlighted a common concern, which is that many investors may lack a clear plan for exiting their positions when the price rises significantly. XRP Price Forecasts Inspire Renewed Interest Several analysts have shared their views on XRP’s potential, offering a range of long- and short-term expectations. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget, projected that XRP could reach $10 by 2030. Offering a more ambitious timeline, market analyst XForceGlobal believes this $10 price point could be achieved within the current cycle. Other figures in the community have issued even higher forecasts. “The Modern Investor” recently suggested XRP may hit $15, while analyst Steph pointed to a potential rise to $30, citing a double bottom chart pattern, often interpreted as a sign of a coming bullish reversal. While these predictions generate excitement, they also introduce the risk of emotionally driven decisions. Investors who do not plan their exits in advance could either sell too early and miss greater profits, or hold on too long and watch gains evaporate. Exit Strategy Proposed by XRP Community Figure To address this challenge, an XRP community analyst known as “XRP Investing” presented a phased approach designed to help investors gradually secure profits while managing risk as the price increases. The strategy is based on a simulated $10,000 investment at $2.20 per token, which equals 4,545 XRP. IF XRP STARTS FLYING TOWARD $10, $15… EVEN $30—MOST HOLDERS WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. No plan = missed profits or panic selling. Here’s one example of a staged exit strategy to help you start thinking. pic.twitter.com/vQ7ytMEFPv — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 4, 2025 The first suggested price target is between $3.50 and $4.00, where selling 20% of the holdings could yield a return of approximately $3,636. This range reflects historical resistance and could be reached following favorable regulatory developments or increased speculation over XRP-related ETFs.

Selling 25% of the holdings at this stage could bring in around $6,248, particularly if momentum is driven by institutional adoption or further ETF-related progress. As the price climbs to the $10.00 to $12.00 range, the analyst recommends selling 30% of the holdings. This level may coincide with broader market hype and mass adoption, potentially leading to returns of about $14,993. For prices exceeding $20.00, the final phase involves selling the remaining 15% to 20% of the portfolio. Should XRP reach this speculative high, investors could realize a profit of roughly $13,640, especially if the token solidifies its role in global payments. In total, this phased strategy could deliver profits of about $38,500 while retaining 455 XRP for possible future gains. Tailoring Strategy to Individual Needs Although the proposed model provides a structured guideline, XRP Investing emphasized that it is meant to serve as a reference rather than a fixed formula. He encouraged investors to develop personalized strategies that align with their financial objectives, time horizons, and risk appetite. The key, he noted, is to avoid impulsive decisions during volatile market movements by having a clear, pre-established plan.
