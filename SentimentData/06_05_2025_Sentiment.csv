Stepping away from the helm of Binance, Changpeng Zhao faced legal consequences that led to a significant period of incarceration. His reflections offer a rare glimpse into the personal impact of such an event on one of the most influential figures in the crypto news landscape. What Was CZ Binance’s Prison Experience Like? Speaking with Rug Radio, CZ described his time incarcerated as both “scary” and “extremely hard.” This period marked a stark contrast to his previously relentless schedule building and running Binance. While physically confined, the experience seems to have initiated a significant internal shift. Key takeaways from his description include: Initial Fear and Difficulty: Acknowledging the inherent fear and hardship associated with imprisonment. Mental Challenges: Emphasizing the significant mental toll the experience took. Finding Connection: Developing unexpected friendships with fellow inmates, highlighting the human element within the system. How Did the Experience Change Changpeng Zhao’s Priorities? Perhaps the most impactful revelation from CZ’s interview is the fundamental shift in his priorities. He stated unequivocally that the prison experience strengthened his focus on personal well-being and family, moving these aspects ahead of his previous singular dedication to work. This change is a powerful testament to the transformative potential, even within challenging circumstances. For a figure synonymous with the non-stop world of cryptocurrency, this re-evaluation of life’s most important aspects provides valuable perspective. Why is Accountability Important, According to the Binance Founder? Despite the personal hardship, CZ touched upon the broader theme of accountability. According to reports, he noted that while he wouldn’t wish imprisonment on anyone, he believes it’s important for individuals to be held accountable for their actions, particularly in instances of bad behavior. This viewpoint aligns with the ongoing efforts within the crypto space and regulatory bodies to establish clearer rules and consequences. What’s Next for the Binance Founder? Looking ahead, Changpeng Zhao plans to delve deeper into his experiences. He revealed intentions to detail his time in prison and the lessons learned in an upcoming book. This offers the public a potential opportunity to gain further insight into the mindset of one of crypto’s pioneers after undergoing such a significant life event. The interview provides a brief but impactful look into the personal journey of CZ Binance post-incarceration.

When SUI launched last year, it went from low-key to trending in what felt like a blink. Those who spotted it early turned modest allocations into serious profits. But most people didn’t. They were either late, skeptical, or still stuck debating whether it was worth the risk. And just like that, it was gone—another missed opportunity that blew up without them. If that sounds like your story, you’re not the only one riding the regret wave. Now comes a chance to flip the script. Qubetics is gaining traction as a popular crypto coin to buy before the next big surge—and this time, you’re early enough to act. With its developer-first approach, real-world asset tokenization tools, and a ticking presale clock, Qubetics is doing more than just launching a token. It’s building infrastructure. And here’s the kicker: while the project has already crossed major milestones, it’s still within reach. That window won’t stay open long, and missing out again might be a move your future self won’t forgive. Qubetics Might Just Be the Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Before It Gets Too Expensive Those who slept on Qubetics in its earliest stages are already counting what could’ve been. Back in September 2024, early whitelist participants grabbed $TICS at just $0.01—and they didn’t even need to pay upfront. Since then, multiple stages have passed, each offering lower entry points than today. But even now, Qubetics is still priced at a point that screams potential. The platform has locked in a spot as a popular crypto coin to buy , and with its Stage 33 presale currently active at $0.2302, it’s far from overpriced. Over 511 million tokens have already been sold, 25,800+ holders are in, and more than $16.7 million has been raised so far. With every stage lasting just seven days and introducing a 10% price increase, this is a fast-moving train—and it hasn’t left the station yet. Just to make it real: if you drop $2,000 into Qubetics at the current price, you’ll receive 8,684 tokens. Let’s say $TICS reaches $10 after mainnet launch. That single $2,000 investment becomes $86,840—over 4,243% ROI. If it hits $15, you’re looking at $130,260, a massive 6,414.9% return. This isn’t theoretical—it’s based on real-time, on-chain data from the Qubetics presale. That’s why it’s being widely talked about as the best crypto presale this year. What truly sets Qubetics apart is its real-world utility—especially its tokenization marketplace, which isn’t just hype, but a fully integrated tool for transforming physical and digital assets into secure, tradable tokens. It’s one of the main reasons Qubetics is quickly becoming a popular crypto coin to buy in 2025. A small art gallery in New York could tokenize its entire collection, allowing global collectors to buy fractional ownership in prized artworks. A local farm in India could tokenize its future crop yield, giving early supporters returns once the produce sells. Or an independent game developer could tokenize early access to future game updates and assets, giving community members a stake in the project’s success. It’s an ecosystem that goes way beyond DeFi—it’s practical, scalable, and tailored for real adoption. SUI Was Slept On—But It Delivered When It Mattered Most SUI wasn’t the flashiest name in crypto when it launched, but those who knew where to look saw a winner forming early. Its ICO price hovered around $0.03 in 2023, and while skeptics questioned the network’s vision, those who backed it watched SUI explode past $1.50 at its peak. That’s a 50x return if you had the conviction—and the timing. But for many, it was another case of too little, too late. It came quietly, gathered steam, and rewarded those who took action early on. Since then, SUI has evolved into one of the more respected Layer 1 chains on the market. Its tech stack drew in developers, its user base grew steadily, and it maintained relevance even during market dips. Those past missed gains are now sealed history, and while SUI still holds value today, the window to 50x it? That’s already closed. It’s still a top performer, but the chance to multiply returns exponentially has passed. And that’s exactly why the crypto crowd is now searching for the next big entry—and Qubetics is quickly filling that gap. You Still Have Time—Don’t Let Another Popular Crypto Coin to Buy Slip Away If you’ve ever sat on the sidelines watching others post their wins from coins you almost bought, you know how brutal it feels. But here’s the honest truth: the next breakout doesn’t always come with fanfare—it comes with solid fundamentals, community backing, and smart tech. That’s what makes Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy right now. It’s still under $0.25, it’s built for real-world use, and it’s got momentum that’s impossible to ignore. If you missed the SUI wave, this might be your bounce-back move. The current stage is still open, but it won’t be for long. Every week, the price ticks up by 10%, and each stage only lasts seven days. The Qubetics mainnet is launching in Q2 2025, and when that day hits, prices are expected to rise—fast. You can still join this best crypto presale while it’s affordable, or sit back and read stories about it later, just like SUI. The difference is, this time, you’ve been warned.

44209711,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157419,1746487207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase Issues Urgent Update on ETH Transactions for Ethereum Pectra Upgrade,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-eth-suspension-update/,"Are you an Ethereum user on Coinbase? Pay close attention, because a significant, albeit temporary, change is coming. Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced it will be pausing certain ETH transactions in anticipation of the upcoming Ethereum Pectra upgrade . What Exactly is Being Paused on Coinbase for the Upgrade? According to recent announcements, Coinbase is taking proactive steps to ensure a smooth transition during Ethereum’s scheduled network enhancement. Here’s a breakdown of the specific services that will be temporarily unavailable: Ethereum (ETH) Deposits: You will not be able to deposit ETH into your Coinbase account during the specified window. Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals: Similarly, withdrawing ETH from Coinbase will be paused. New ETH Staking Requests: If you planned to stake new ETH via Coinbase, this process will be paused. It’s crucial to note the timing for this temporary halt. Coinbase states these services will be suspended from 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7 . This is a relatively short window, designed to cover the critical phase of the upgrade’s deployment. Understanding the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Why it Matters You might be wondering, what is the Ethereum Pectra upgrade , and why does it necessitate a pause in services on a major platform like Coinbase? Pectra is the next significant hard fork planned for the Ethereum network. The name ‘Pectra’ is a combination of ‘Prague’ (the execution layer upgrade) and ‘Electra’ (the consensus layer upgrade), indicating it will bring changes to both fundamental components of Ethereum. While the full scope of Pectra is still being finalized and includes several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), some key areas of focus are expected to include: Staking Enhancements: Improvements related to staking, potentially including changes to validator maximum effective balances (EIP-7251). Account Abstraction Improvements: Further steps towards making Ethereum accounts more flexible and user-friendly, possibly building on EIP-3074. Overall Network Efficiency: Various technical improvements aimed at optimizing network performance and stability. Major network upgrades like Pectra are complex technical events. They involve coordinating changes across the entire network of nodes. For exchanges and service providers like Coinbase, pausing deposits and withdrawals is a standard safety measure during such critical periods. It helps prevent potential issues that could arise from transactions being initiated during the brief window when the network is transitioning, ensuring the safety and integrity of user funds. How Does This Coinbase ETH Suspension Impact You? For most users, this temporary Coinbase ETH suspension is a minor inconvenience. The pause window is short, less than an hour. However, if you absolutely need to deposit or withdraw ETH from Coinbase during that specific time frame on May 7th, you will need to adjust your plans. Existing ETH staking positions held through Coinbase will remain unaffected; the pause only applies to initiating *new* staking requests during the window. This is important Crypto news for anyone actively trading or moving ETH on Coinbase around the upgrade date. Being aware allows you to plan your activities accordingly and avoid any frustration from attempted transactions failing during the suspension period. Actionable Steps: Navigating the May 7th Pause Here’s what you should do: Check the Time: Note the specific Pacific Time (PT) window: 2:50 a.m. to 3:45 a.m. PT on May 7. Convert this to your local time zone. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw ETH on Coinbase, do so well before or wait until after this specific window. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Coinbase for any potential updates or changes to the schedule. Looking Ahead: The Benefits of Ethereum’s Evolution While a temporary pause might seem disruptive, it’s a necessary step in the ongoing evolution of the Ethereum network. Upgrades like Pectra are vital for improving Ethereum’s scalability, security, and functionality, ultimately benefiting all users in the long run. The smooth execution of these upgrades is crucial for the health and growth of the entire crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Growth In summary, Coinbase’s temporary suspension of certain ETH transactions and new staking requests on May 7th is a standard procedure to ensure a safe and seamless transition during the important Ethereum Pectra upgrade . While brief, this pause highlights the ongoing development of the Ethereum network and the steps platforms like Coinbase take to support its evolution.

The digital RUB had been slated to launch on July 1, 2025. But earlier this year, the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely,” giving no alternative launch timeline. Digital Ruble Rollout: Russians to Wait Until 2027 for CBDC? Per the state-owned Russian newspaper RIA Novosti , Alexey Voylukov, an MBA professor of business practice in digital finance at the Presidential Academy in Moscow, said that the Central Bank will need to provide incentives if it wants people to use its coin. The blackouts across Spain and Portugal are bad news for central bank digital currencies and stablecoins… but good news for cash #CBDCs #DigitalEuro https://t.co/MTlXFb7fwm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 29, 2025 Voylukov also said that in the most optimistic of scenarios, ordinary Russians will be able to start paying in stores with the digital ruble in the second half of 2026. However, he said that a national rollout in 2027 was “a more realistic scenario.” Voylukov’s comments came after claims to the contrary last month from the finance ministry. The ministry said the digital RUB was “almost ready” for a nationwide launch. Earlier, Interfax reported that Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said that the digital ruble would launch next year. The minister said: “Last year and the year before, we carried out several transactions, including budgetary transactions, using the digital ruble. The digital ruble is 100% reliable.” Siluanov said that Moscow would focus on the token’s use in the commercial banking sector for the remainder of 2025. Some 15 major banks, including Sberbank and T-Bank (formerly Tinkoff Bank), are currently testing the token. However, while Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has continued to champion the CBDC, the banking sector has expressed grave doubts . Russian ruble prices versus the USD over the past 12 months. (Source: Google Finance) Russians Still Unsure About Digital RUB Citizens have also expressed their misgivings about the coin, leading the Central Bank to respond with assurances that “nobody will be forced” to use the CBDC. But the digital ruble’s future was thrown into doubt in late February when Nabiullina announced a “delay.” Voylukov also opined that most Russians are still very wary about the CBDC. He said: “Firstly, the digital ruble does not provide any tangible advantages compared to existing means of payment. Secondly, it uses QR codes. This kind of technology requires stable cellular networks and internet connections. This makes payment less convenient and slower compared to regular bank cards.” The Presidential Academy in Moscow, Russia. (Source: WL959 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Connectivity Problems? Around 88% of Russian households have internet access, per 2023 data. However, while that figure is much higher in urban areas, some think that it may be as low as 83% in rural parts of the country. The central People’s Bank of China has attempted to get around similar connectivity issues by launching offline digital yuan wallets . The European Union will on Tuesday announce a roadmap to phase out the bloc's remaining gas ties with Moscow, but in the absence of sanctions it will be difficult for buyers to exit gas contracts using legal options such as force majeure https://t.co/PIanL3c5yp — Reuters (@Reuters) May 5, 2025 Russia is yet to pilot similar solutions, but may look to Beijing for inspiration as both nations look for more ways to collaborate in the financial sphere. Voylukov concluded that it was “most likely” that the digital ruble would “be of interest to people who are already accustomed” to using QR codes and similar solutions to make payments. He said: “Mass adoption success or failure will depend on what advantages the Central Bank and the commercial banks working with the digital RUB will be able to offer people.” The post Russian Economist: Digital Ruble Rollout May Be Pushed Back to 2027 appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|CBDC|Russia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-05 23:30:00

For readers tracking companies with significant funding and market potential, news from firms like 11x is highly relevant. A major shift has just occurred at the top of AI sales automation startup 11x, co-founded by Hasan Sukkar, who has announced he is stepping down from the CEO role. Leadership Transition at 11x: Prabhav Jain Takes the Helm Effective immediately, Hasan Sukkar is transitioning from Chief Executive Officer to a Non-Executive Chairman position at 11x. The announcement came directly from Sukkar via a LinkedIn post this morning. Stepping into the CEO role is Prabhav Jain, previously the company’s Chief Technology Officer. Sukkar explained his decision, stating a preference for building companies from the ground up and recognizing that leading an ‘enduring enterprise grade scale-up’ requires different skills. He emphasized his deep love for 11x and belief in its mission, framing the move as knowing ‘when to pass the CEO baton for the next leg of the race.’ In his new chairman role, Sukkar intends to support Jain on strategic direction, product vision, industry relationships, and market expansion, continuing to assist 11x ‘into the future’. Prabhav Jain is described by an 11x spokesperson as a former Brex executive and a three-time founder, bringing a wealth of experience to the CEO position. The company spokesperson framed the change as a strategic move aligned with 11x’s growth trajectory, evolving from a single-product company to a platform serving ‘hundreds of the world’s leading GTM teams’. Past Challenges and Strong Investor Backing This leadership change comes after a period where 11x faced scrutiny. As reported by Bitcoin World in March, the company was previously showing customer logos on its website from companies that were not active clients, leading to potential legal threats from one. Sources also indicated that the 11x product experienced issues and that the company struggled with customer retention. Furthermore, some employees described the startup’s work environment as particularly demanding. Despite these reported challenges, 11x has attracted substantial Venture Capital funding, raising over $70 million to date. This includes a $24 million Series A round led by Sarah Tavel, a general partner at Benchmark, and a significant $50 million Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Both key investors publicly defended the company and its leadership when the previous reports surfaced. Investor Confidence and the Road Ahead for 11x Joe Schmidt, the a16z partner involved in the 11x deal, publicly reiterated his support for the company and Hasan Sukkar on X in March, calling the team, product, and metrics ‘world class.’ Sarah Tavel of Benchmark also posted on X, stating her conviction in the team and the opportunity was ‘stronger than ever’ based on her view as a board member. It’s worth noting that Tavel recently announced she would be transitioning to a more limited role as a venture partner at Benchmark. The transition to Prabhav Jain as CEO signals a new phase for 11x. While the company spokesperson highlights strategic growth and platform evolution as the drivers, the move also occurs in the wake of past operational and customer-related challenges. The continued support from major venture capital firms like Benchmark and a16z underscores the potential they still see in the company and its new leadership team. The future trajectory of 11x under Jain’s leadership will be closely watched, particularly how the company addresses scaling, product development, and customer relationships while leveraging the substantial funding it has secured.

This was the case when, according to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated his belief that Canada’s Mark Carney would be seeking a significant deal during his visit on Tuesday. This simple statement opens up a multitude of questions, particularly concerning the potential implications for global economic relations and, by extension, the increasingly interconnected world of cryptocurrency. Understanding the Players: Trump, Mark Carney, and the US Canada Dynamic To fully grasp the potential weight of Trump’s comment, it’s essential to understand the key figures involved and the context of US Canada relations . Donald Trump, as a former U.S. President and a likely future contender, has a distinctive approach to international negotiations, often favoring bilateral deals and expressing clear expectations publicly. His past interactions with Canada, particularly regarding trade agreements like the USMCA (formerly NAFTA), have demonstrated a willingness to push for terms he perceives as favorable to the United States. On the other side is Mark Carney. A highly respected figure in international finance, Carney has served as the Governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. He has also held significant global roles, including Chair of the Financial Stability Board and currently serves as the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Carney’s expertise spans monetary policy, financial stability, and increasingly, the intersection of finance and global challenges like climate change. His perspective is rooted in multilateralism and systemic risk management, contrasting sharply at times with Trump’s more transactional approach. The relationship between the United States and Canada is one of the closest and most complex in the world, marked by deep economic ties, shared borders, and intertwined political interests. While generally strong, the relationship has seen periods of tension, particularly during Trump’s previous presidency, often centered on trade disputes. A high-profile visit from a figure like Mark Carney, coupled with Trump’s explicit expectation of a ‘deal,’ suggests discussions of significant substance are anticipated. What Kind of US Canada Deal Could Be On the Table? Trump’s comment was notably brief, offering no specifics about the nature of the expected deal. This lack of detail fuels speculation across various potential areas: Trade Adjustments: Despite the USMCA being in place, specific sector-by-sector trade issues (like dairy, timber, or critical minerals) often remain points of negotiation between the two countries. Regulatory Alignment: Given Carney’s background, discussions could involve aligning financial regulations, approaches to digital currencies, or frameworks for managing economic risks. Energy and Climate Finance: As UN Special Envoy, Carney is deeply involved in climate finance. Discussions could touch upon cross-border energy infrastructure, carbon pricing, or investment in green technologies. Global Economic Strategy: The visit could be a platform to discuss coordinated approaches to global economic challenges, supply chain resilience, or responses to international financial shifts. Digital Assets and CBDCs: While less likely to be the primary focus, given Carney’s and global central banks’ interest in digital currencies and stablecoins, discussions around the future of finance could touch upon these topics, potentially exploring cross-border implications or regulatory stances. The context of Trump expecting a deal implies a negotiation where concessions or agreements are sought by one or both sides. The exact nature of this potential US Canada deal remains the central mystery. Trump’s Evolving Stance: Is Trump Crypto’s Unexpected Ally? Interestingly, Donald Trump’s public stance on cryptocurrency has seen a notable evolution. Previously skeptical, even critical, he has recently expressed more openness, particularly as crypto has become a significant factor in campaign finance and voter interest. This shift is relevant because any major economic or financial deal discussed during Carney’s visit could indirectly or directly impact the regulatory or economic environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. While it’s highly improbable that a deal between Trump and Carney would be solely focused on Bitcoin or Ethereum, discussions around financial innovation, cross-border payments, regulatory frameworks for digital assets, or even the future role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could feature, especially given Carney’s background in central banking and financial stability. Trump’s recent pivot suggests he is more aware of the crypto landscape, potentially making it a subtle consideration in broader financial discussions. Mark Carney’s Perspective: Stability, Sustainability, and the Future of Finance Mark Carney’s involvement signals a focus on systemic issues. His work has consistently emphasized financial stability, the transition to a sustainable economy, and the need for international cooperation to address global challenges. His views on digital currencies have typically been cautious, highlighting potential risks to financial stability and the need for robust regulation, particularly for stablecoins. However, he has also acknowledged the potential for innovation in payments and finance. A meeting involving Mark Carney Canada representing potentially Canada’s interests (or acting in a broader advisory capacity given his international roles) and Trump could involve discussions on how to integrate new financial technologies safely into the existing system, or how cross-border financial flows might be affected by regulatory changes or the emergence of digital assets. His presence suggests the ‘deal’ could have significant implications for the financial architecture shared by the two nations and potentially influence global norms. Potential Implications for Global Finance and Cryptocurrency While the specifics of the expected deal are unknown, any significant agreement between the US and Canada, particularly one touching upon finance, trade, or regulation, could have ripple effects. For the cryptocurrency market, these implications could manifest in several ways: Regulatory Clarity or Uncertainty: Discussions on financial regulation could signal future approaches to crypto, either leading to more clarity or highlighting divergent paths between the US and Canada. Economic Stability: Deals that enhance US-Canada economic stability or address potential risks could positively influence overall market sentiment, including for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Cross-Border Payments: While speculative, discussions on modernizing financial infrastructure could, in the long term, open doors for new payment technologies, potentially including those leveraging blockchain. Investor Confidence: High-level discussions between key economic partners can influence investor confidence in the North American market, which has significant ties to the global crypto ecosystem. The fact that Trump Mark Carney are potentially engaging in high-stakes discussions underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. Crypto, as a nascent but growing part of this system, is sensitive to shifts in regulatory postures, economic stability, and international cooperation (or lack thereof). Challenges and Opportunities on the Path to a Deal Negotiating any significant deal between two sovereign nations presents challenges. Historical points of friction, differing domestic priorities, and the complex web of existing agreements must be navigated. The personalities and negotiating styles of the individuals involved also play a significant role. However, the opportunity exists for a deal that could strengthen the economic ties between the US and Canada, potentially setting precedents for international cooperation on emerging financial issues or trade challenges. A successful negotiation could bolster confidence in North America’s economic future, which could have positive spillover effects, including potentially creating a more favorable environment for innovation in sectors relevant to crypto. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Watch For? While waiting for details on the expected deal, those interested in cryptocurrency should pay attention to any official readouts or leaks regarding the topics discussed during Carney’s visit. Specific mentions of financial regulation, digital currencies, cross-border payments, or trade policies impacting technology sectors would be particularly relevant. Observing the market’s reaction to any news emerging from the visit could also provide insights into how investors perceive the implications of potential agreements between these two major economies. A Compelling Summary: Anticipating the Outcome President Trump’s assertion that Mark Carney will seek a deal during his visit has set the stage for potentially significant discussions between the United States and Canada. While the exact nature of this anticipated US Canada deal remains under wraps, the involvement of figures like Trump and Carney suggests topics of considerable economic and financial weight are on the agenda. For the cryptocurrency world, these high-level talks, though not directly centered on digital assets, are a reminder that the broader macroeconomic and regulatory environment is constantly evolving. Any agreements reached could influence the landscape for finance, trade, and potentially the future integration of new technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies into the traditional system. All eyes will be on the outcomes of this visit to see what deal, if any, materializes and what its implications might be.

If so, you’ve likely noticed the increasing attention regulators are paying to the cryptocurrency space. A recent report highlights just how significant this focus has become, with SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ reaching an all-time high. Why Are SEC Filings So Important for Cryptocurrency? Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch upon what SEC filings are and why their content matters. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to file various documents, providing transparency to investors and the public. These filings, such as 10-K (annual reports) and 10-Q (quarterly reports), disclose crucial information about a company’s financial health, risks, and business operations. When a company starts mentioning cryptocurrency or digital assets in these formal documents, it signals a few key things: Formal Engagement: Companies are actively involved with crypto, either directly through holdings, services, or indirectly through exposure. Risk Disclosure: They perceive crypto-related factors (like market volatility or regulatory uncertainty) as material risks to their business that must be disclosed to investors. Strategic Direction: Mentions can indicate a company’s strategic plans or investments in the crypto sector. Therefore, tracking the frequency of crypto mentions in SEC filings provides a valuable pulse on both institutional adoption and regulatory focus. Breaking Down the Record-Breaking Numbers According to data cited by The Block, April 2025 marked a significant milestone: Total Mentions: SEC filings mentioning ‘cryptocurrency’ hit a record 786 . Month-over-Month Growth: This represented a substantial 38% increase compared to March 2025. Year-over-Year Growth: The numbers were also up by 8% compared to April 2024. This isn’t just a small uptick; a 38% jump in a single month is quite dramatic and suggests a rapid acceleration in companies feeling the need (or being required) to acknowledge their connection to the crypto world in their formal disclosures. Stablecoins Take Center Stage: A Double in Mentions The report also highlighted another crucial trend: mentions of stablecoins have more than doubled in recent months. Why the sudden surge in stablecoin focus? Stablecoins , digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset (like the US dollar), have attracted significant regulatory attention globally. The increased mentions in SEC filings likely reflect: Systemic Risk Concerns: Regulators worry about the potential impact of large, widely used stablecoins on financial stability if they were to fail or lose their peg. Reserve Standards: There’s intense scrutiny on what assets back stablecoins and whether these reserves are sufficient and transparent. Consumer Protection: Ensuring users understand the risks associated with stablecoins and that issuers operate responsibly is a key regulatory goal. Companies involved with issuing, holding, or facilitating transactions with stablecoins are clearly taking these concerns seriously and disclosing them in their official documents. What Does This Surge in SEC Filings Tell Us? The dramatic rise in crypto and stablecoin mentions in SEC filings paints a clear picture of the current state of the digital assets market’s interaction with traditional finance and regulation. It primarily signals: Growing Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC is clearly paying close attention to how companies interact with crypto. This could precede or coincide with increased enforcement actions or new regulations. Increased Institutional Engagement: More companies, beyond just native crypto firms, are getting involved with cryptocurrency and need to disclose this. This could include banks, payment processors, tech companies, and even non-financial corporations exploring crypto for treasury management or services. Maturation of the Asset Class: As digital assets become more integrated into the broader financial system, they naturally become a more frequent topic in formal financial disclosures. Navigating the Evolving Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities This heightened visibility in SEC filings presents both challenges and opportunities for the crypto industry and traditional businesses engaging with it. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The increase in mentions reflects, in part, the ongoing lack of clear, comprehensive crypto regulation in many jurisdictions, forcing companies to disclose potential risks broadly. Compliance Burden: Companies must invest significant resources in understanding and complying with evolving disclosure requirements related to digital assets . Potential for Negative Sentiment: Disclosing risks, while necessary, can sometimes be interpreted negatively by investors unfamiliar with the asset class. Opportunities: Increased Clarity (Eventually): The focus from regulators, while sometimes challenging, is a necessary step towards establishing clear rules of the road, which could ultimately foster greater confidence and adoption. Legitimization: The fact that major companies are discussing cryptocurrency and stablecoins in formal SEC filings lends legitimacy to the asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and investors. Informed Investment: Greater disclosure allows investors to make more informed decisions about companies with crypto exposure. What Should Investors and Businesses Do? Actionable Insights Given this trend, what are the practical takeaways? For Investors: Pay attention to SEC filings of companies you invest in or are considering investing in. Search for terms like ‘cryptocurrency’, ‘digital assets’, ‘stablecoins’, and ‘blockchain’ to understand their exposure and disclosed risks. For Crypto Businesses: Ensure robust internal controls and legal counsel are in place to navigate potential future crypto regulation and disclosure requirements. Transparency is key. For Traditional Businesses Engaging with Crypto: Work closely with legal and compliance teams to accurately assess and disclose material risks and involvements with digital assets in your formal filings. Conclusion: A Clear Signal of Mainstream Integration The record number of mentions of cryptocurrency and stablecoins in SEC filings is far more than just a statistical anomaly. It’s a powerful indicator of how deeply digital assets are becoming integrated into the considerations of publicly traded companies and, by extension, the traditional financial system. While increased regulatory focus can bring challenges, this surge in formal disclosure ultimately represents a step towards greater transparency and, potentially, clearer crypto regulation in the future. It signals that crypto is no longer on the fringes; it’s a topic requiring serious attention from boardrooms to regulatory bodies.

44210920,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157445,1746489625,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial SEC Delay Hits Canary Spot Litecoin ETF Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-litecoin-etf/,"The world of cryptocurrency investments is constantly evolving, with the prospect of regulated financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being a major focus. Investors keen on gaining exposure to digital assets through traditional brokerage accounts have been closely watching regulatory bodies, particularly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A recent development has introduced a new layer of anticipation: the SEC delay on a significant filing. What is the Latest on the Litecoin ETF ? According to reports, specifically from Solid Intel on X, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has postponed its ruling on the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF. This particular filing seeks approval for an ETF that would directly hold Litecoin (LTC), mirroring the structure of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. The delay means that the SEC requires more time to review the proposal before making a final determination – whether to approve, disapprove, or potentially delay it further. This is a standard part of the regulatory process for complex financial products like cryptocurrency-based ETFs, but each delay adds to the market’s anticipation and, at times, uncertainty. Why Does an SEC Decision Matter for a Spot ETF ? The SEC’s role is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. When considering a Spot ETF for an asset like Litecoin, the commission evaluates several factors: Market Surveillance: Can the market for the underlying asset (Litecoin) be adequately monitored to prevent manipulation? Investor Protection: Are there sufficient safeguards in place to protect retail investors? Product Structure: Is the ETF’s design sound and compliant with existing securities laws? Liquidity and Valuation: Is there reliable pricing data and sufficient liquidity for the underlying asset? An approval from the SEC is seen as a significant step towards mainstream acceptance for a cryptocurrency. It provides a regulated, accessible investment vehicle that bypasses the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or navigating exchanges. This is why the outcome of any SEC decision regarding a crypto Spot ETF is closely watched by investors and the industry alike. How Does This SEC Delay Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The path to getting a crypto Spot ETF approved in the U.S. has been lengthy and marked by numerous delays and rejections. Bitcoin spot ETFs faced years of setbacks before finally receiving approval in January 2024. Ethereum spot ETFs are currently undergoing a similar process, with deadlines approaching and the potential for delays or even rejections still high. The delay on the Canary Litecoin ETF decision follows this established pattern. It underscores the SEC’s cautious approach to digital assets beyond Bitcoin, where they have expressed concerns about market size, surveillance capabilities, and potential manipulation. Key Considerations Following the Delay: Increased Review Time: The SEC is using the maximum allotted time under its rules to thoroughly examine the filing. Potential for Further Delays: Depending on the filing’s specifics and the SEC’s ongoing evaluation, additional delays are possible before a final decision is reached. Market Impact: While perhaps not as impactful as Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF news, a delay on a Litecoin filing can still contribute to broader market sentiment regarding regulatory progress for altcoins. Focus on Regulatory Clarity: This event highlights the continued need for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the United States. What’s Next for the Proposed Canary Litecoin ETF ? Following this delay, the SEC will continue its review. There will be new deadlines established for the next steps in the process. These deadlines are statutory, meaning they are set by law, but the SEC has the power to extend them up to a certain point if they deem it necessary for a complete review. Market participants interested in the prospect of a Litecoin ETF will need to monitor official SEC announcements closely for updates on the new review timeline and the eventual decision. The outcome for this specific filing could also potentially influence the regulatory path for other smaller-cap altcoins seeking ETF approval in the future. Benefits and Challenges of a Crypto ETF Like Litecoin’s Potential Benefits: Accessibility: Easier access for traditional investors via brokerage accounts. Convenience: Eliminates the need for self-custody of crypto. Liquidity: ETFs typically trade on major exchanges, offering liquidity. Regulatory Oversight: Operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more investor protection than unregulated exchanges. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: As seen with this delay, getting approval is a significant challenge. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the underlying asset’s price due to fees and operational factors. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can impact overall returns compared to direct ownership. Limited Control: Investors don’t directly own the underlying Litecoin, limiting options like staking or using it in DeFi protocols. Actionable Insight: Staying Informed For investors tracking the potential of a Litecoin ETF or other crypto investment products, the key action is to stay informed directly from official sources. Rely on announcements from the SEC and the ETF filers themselves rather than unverified reports for critical timeline information and decisions. Understanding the regulatory process provides valuable context for interpreting delays and potential outcomes. Summary: The Waiting Game Continues The U.S. SEC’s decision to delay the proposed Canary Spot Litecoin ETF decision is a reminder that the regulatory journey for cryptocurrency investment products, particularly those tracking assets other than Bitcoin, remains ongoing and complex. While the delay is not a rejection, it signifies that the commission is taking its time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal.

Unstaked, a new crypto to invest in, is drawing interest not because of market swings but because of structure. Its AI agent-based platform provides a clear approach to on-chain interaction, linking rewards to actual performance instead of price moves. With its focus on use-case delivery, clear token design, and a presale that’s gaining speed, Unstaked brings a different kind of value. It may be the most under-the-radar project with the biggest potential right now. Ethereum (ETH) Activity Slows as Whales Wait at Technical Crossroads Ethereum (ETH) whales are stepping back as the asset nears a critical technical point. The volume of large ETH transactions between $1 million and $10 million has fallen recently, showing that major players are hesitant. This trend extends to mid-sized moves too, with activity in the $100,000 to $1 million range also decreasing, which points to rising caution. Traders are paying attention to an ascending triangle pattern forming on the four-hour chart. A move above $1,840 could open the door for further gains. However, if the price slips below $1,690, the tone may shift toward selling pressure. Despite the quiet spell, Ethereum is still holding above the 200 EMA, a long-term support level for many technical watchers. With volumes tapering off and investors becoming more selective, ETH whales might be waiting for a stronger signal. The coming trading days may offer more clarity on which direction Ethereum will take next. Sui (SUI) Price Gains Point to $4.40 as Bullish Setup Builds Sui (SUI) is drawing a wave of attention with its latest price increase, and traders are now watching for a possible push toward $4.40. The token has already passed its $3.45 resistance level, and this move is backed by higher volume and positive signals from the RSI. The near-term test lies at $3.80, where another breakout could confirm further strength. This suggests a 26% upside from current prices, reinforcing positive market sentiment. The MACD also supports this view, showing growing interest from buyers and a potential continuation of the trend. As long as support near $3.20 holds, the setup looks ready for another upward push. Analysts believe $4.40 is within reach if momentum remains steady. With these indicators lining up, the recent Sui price surge is shaping up to be one of the more important developments this week. Could Unstaked Be the Next 27x Token? Unstaked is emerging as a new crypto to invest in, with early signs suggesting that a 27x return might not be out of reach. The platform brings together two of the most talked-about trends in blockchain AI and Web3 into one token-powered system. Its network is designed around autonomous agents that support real community growth. At its core is a “Proof of Intelligence” model that links each agent’s actions to on-chain data, offering rewards based on verified outcomes. This setup ties the token’s value to engagement rather than speculation. Now in stage 2 of its ai crypto presale and priced at $0.006695, Unstaked has raised nearly $1 million in just a few days. The expected launch price is $0.1819. If the AI and Web3 momentum continues, early participants could potentially see the price reach $0.67 to $0.70, pointing to a possible 27x return. What separates Unstaked from others is its focus on use, not just price. Its AI agents are expected to go live once the token launches, giving users the ability to earn $UNSD by deploying agents across platforms like X and Telegram. Along with a plan for decentralized governance and a public-first release, this adds utility to the token’s base. As interest in AI-linked platforms grows, Unstaked shows signs of being an early project with clear function and open metrics, making it one to watch for anyone seeking a real breakout opportunity. Why Unstaked May Outshine Popular Market Names Market trends often catch attention, but long-term value depends on use. Ethereum’s whale slowdown and Sui’s price moves show short-term momentum, but that alone may not bring lasting growth. Unstaked takes a different approach. It is building a space where performance earns rewards and AI agents support on-chain activity in a meaningful way. With its ai crypto presale still early and core features set for release at launch, the project is aiming to deliver more than a temporary jump. For those searching for a new crypto to invest in , Unstaked offers a model driven by structure, purpose, and early traction. That makes it stand out in a market where real action matters more than noise.

In a new report, Santiment says that memecoin mindshare is making a comeback despite the recent high-profile collapses of several assets in the sector. Santiment says that the rise in memecoin-centered discussions on social media suggests an increase in speculation and short-term investing mentality. “Memecoins, in particular, are once again gaining considerable attention. Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a ‘gamble’ mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach. Notice how social volume has been creeping up for top market cap meme coins, and declining for layer-1s and layer-2s. This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains.” Source: Santiment Santiment says that currently, the rise in online discussions about altcoins, altseasons and bull markets suggests that the crypto market will likely witness a correction. “Historically, the best times to invest in altcoins have been when crowd interest is between low and practically nonexistent. But at this current stage, with buzzwords like ‘altcoin,’ ‘altseason’ and ‘bull cycle’ trending, caution is advised, with retailers looking for any opportunity to buy minor dips. Markets move opposite to crowd expectations, so when the crowd’s excitement peaks, it often signals that prices are nearing exhaustion.” Source: Santiment Read the full Santiment report here .

While well-known names like Bittensor (TAO), Render (RNDR), and NEAR Protocol (NEAR) are gaining traction, a rising project called BlockDAG is quickly becoming a standout. With solid foundations and strong presale performance, it’s drawing attention from across the crypto world. These projects are doing more than just gaining short-term attention. They are showcasing long-term use cases, from artificial intelligence to decentralized computing and scalable smart contracts. The stage is now set for a major move in crypto, and this shortlist captures the top trending crypto performers to follow closely. Bittensor (TAO): Technical Setup Looks Strong Bittensor (TAO) continues to hold its spot among the top trending crypto names this month. With a current price near $362.19 and a 7.72% daily jump, TAO has outpaced Bitcoin. The formation of a bullish pennant suggests a likely breakout, possibly taking the coin up to $451.07. That’s a projected 30% jump in the short term. Longer-term views are even more promising, with estimates ranging from $365 to $1,718 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential return of over 370%. Despite a neutral overall sentiment, price activity suggests growing market trust. As an AI-driven blockchain, TAO offers a unique angle. Its blend of deep learning and decentralized networks keeps it in the spotlight as one of the top trending crypto contenders in 2025. Render (RNDR): Fueling Decentralized Creativity Render (RNDR) has emerged as a key player in creative tech and decentralized GPU rendering. Its current price of $4.47 and a 12% rise over the past week puts it high on the list of top trending crypto projects. A sharp rise in trading volume by 79% shows increasing interest. The technical chart reveals a bullish reversal, with swing targets at $5.22, $6.21, and even beyond $7. Analysts expect RNDR to potentially reach $10.13 this year, delivering returns close to 50%. The project also shows a double-bottom pattern, which adds weight to its upward momentum. Render’s practical use in graphics, AI, and cloud computing gives it staying power in the 2025 crypto landscape. It’s one to watch as a top trending crypto with real-world purpose. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Bullish Pattern in Play NEAR Protocol has re-entered the top trending crypto charts thanks to a rebound from long-term support. At a current price of $2.38, the coin is forming an ascending triangle, suggesting an upcoming breakout if it crosses the $2.69 resistance line. Short-term price targets are set between $7 and $8, while the most bullish projections aim for $13. The RSI indicates a possible overbought condition, so short-term caution is advised. Still, exchange outflows and activity between $2.20 and $2.50 hint at rising demand. NEAR’s edge comes from its strong developer tools and efforts to boost scalability. As DeFi and cross-chain applications grow, NEAR could turn into a dark horse among top trending crypto choices in the coming months. BlockDAG Presale Surges Past $226M With Limited-Time Offer While other top trending crypto projects ride market waves, BlockDAG is building solid ground. Its presale has now raised over $226 million, with more than 19.7 billion coins sold. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, reflecting a profit of 2,520% from its start. A limited-time entry price of $0.0019 is available until May 13, before the launch price hits $0.05. BlockDAG ’s network offers full EVM support, letting Ethereum-based dApps migrate seamlessly. It uses DAG-based architecture to improve speed and scalability. More than 17,310 mining rigs have already been sold, and miner sales have topped $6.9 million. The project’s user base is also growing rapidly, with over 1 million X1 app users. Strategic tech partnerships with HackerEarth and SpaceDev strengthen its developer resources. It has secured listings on 10 centralized exchanges, creating a ready launchpad for mass adoption. BlockDAG isn’t chasing trends, it’s setting them. Its early infrastructure, massive user base, and unique offer price make it a standout in the current market. Among all top trending crypto projects, this one is building the strongest case for long-term relevance. Final Thoughts: Who Leads the Top Trending Crypto Race? As 2025 unfolds, coins like Bittensor, Render, and NEAR show why they remain top trending crypto players. Each has carved out a strong niche backed by real-world applications and solid technical charts. But BlockDAG is making a case of its own. With over $226 million raised and powerful features ready to go, it could leap ahead of more established names. It blends early access with real tech, giving it a strong shot at leading this year’s crypto race.

One remarkable project taking cues from Avalanche’s brilliance is Ruvi AI, which aims to redefine blockchain’s potential by integrating it seamlessly with artificial intelligence (AI). Promising to reshape industries and provide unparalleled opportunities, Ruvi AI is a platform to watch. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI brings a revolutionary approach to blockchain by marrying its transparency and security with the problem-solving power of AI. This unique blend creates a platform capable of addressing real-world problems, from enhancing supply chain efficiency to fraud detection and beyond. With blockchain ensuring immutable, safe, and transparent transactions, Ruvi AI adds value by harnessing AI to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and predict outcomes. Industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare can benefit greatly from Ruvi AI’s efficient solutions, which streamline operations and improve decision-making. Unlike many blockchain-centered projects, Ruvi AI focuses on being user-friendly. It offers tools that allow businesses to integrate its technology smoothly without disrupting their existing workflows. By prioritizing usability and practical outcomes, Ruvi AI stands out as more than just another innovation in the blockchain field. Historic Presale Achievements The excitement around Ruvi AI’s potential is already evident in its presale performance. Within days, the platform sold over 10 million tokens, raising more than $100,000. This achievement reflects investor confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision. Currently, Ruvi tokens are priced at just $0.01 in Phase 1. Early adopters enjoy access at this highly competitive rate, but time is of the essence. Phase 2 will see a 50% price increase, boosting token value to $0.015. This structured growth strategy mirrors Ruvi AI’s anticipated rise in popularity and demand. Adding credibility to its impressive presale progress, Ruvi AI has launched a beta version of its platform. By offering this early access, Ruvi AI demonstrates transparency and a commitment to its roadmap. The beta allows users to experience firsthand how blockchain and AI integrate seamlessly to solve challenges. VIP Tiers for Every Investor Ruvi AI further distinguishes itself through its rewarding VIP-tier program, designed to accommodate a diverse range of investors while offering substantial bonuses. Two notable tiers, VIP Tier 3 and VIP Tier 5, showcase the platform’s commitment to maximizing investor incentives. VIP Tier 2 Ideal for entry level investors, VIP Tier 2 requires holders to accumulate at least 50,000 RUVI tokens, which amounts to a $500 investment during Phase 1’s pricing of $0.01 per token. Participants in this tier earn a 40% bonus, adding 20,000 additional tokens to their holdings. This brings the total to 70,000 RUVI tokens. At the listing price of $0.07, the investment would be worth $4,900, and when Ruvi AI achieves its projected $1 valuation, the total value could soar to an eye-popping $70,000. VIP Tier 5 For committed investors seeking maximum rewards, VIP Tier 5 offers an unmatched opportunity. A minimum investment of 500,000 RUVI tokens, or $5,000, qualifies users for this tier during Phase 1. What sets VIP Tier 5 apart is its 100% bonus, doubling the investor’s holdings to 1,000,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, this amounts to $70,000. Should Ruvi AI’s valuation reach $1 per token, this investment could yield an extraordinary $1,000,000, showcasing the immense potential of deep engagement with Ruvi AI. Leaderboard Benefits for Early Adopters Ruvi AI’s presale doesn’t stop at boosting token holders directly. The platform has introduced a leaderboard rewards system to incentivize and recognize its top contributors. The Top10 contributors during the presale phase will each receive 500,000 RUVI tokens. At the conservative listing price of $0.07, this amount is worth $35,000. If Ruvi AI achieves its $1 valuation projection, this becomes a life-changing $500,000 reward. Similarly, the Top 50 contributors are awarded 250,000 RUVI tokens each. At $0.07, this reward equals $17,500, which would rise to $250,000 when the $1 valuation is met. Even those who secure a position in the Top 1000 receive 20,000 tokens, valued at $20,000 post listing.With such exciting incentives, Ruvi AI not only drives participation but also creates a strong sense of community and shared success. Pioneering the Future of Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is more than an innovative project; it is a bold leap toward a future where blockchain meets AI in ways that enhance productivity and transparency. Its seamless integration of these two disruptive technologies promises to redefine how industries function and how investors benefit. Whether it’s through its record-breaking presale, the accessible beta platform, or its lucrative reward tiers, Ruvi AI offers a unique opportunity at the cutting edge of technology and finance. For early investors and forward-thinking businesses, joining Ruvi AI’s movement represents a chance not just to adopt but to lead in this groundbreaking space.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $850 to $880K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space.

44211222,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157447,1746490222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Walkout: House Democrats Boycott Key Congressional Hearing on Crypto Regulation Over Trump Ties,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/democrats-boycott-crypto-hearing/,"A political storm is brewing on Capitol Hill, set to impact the future of crypto regulation in the United United States. In a dramatic move, House Democrats are reportedly planning a walkout from a crucial congressional hearing focused on digital asset legislation. This unprecedented action highlights the deep political divisions currently shaping the debate around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Why the Planned Walkout by House Democrats? The planned walkout by House Democrats stems from significant concerns regarding former President Donald Trump’s increasing involvement and influence in the digital asset space. Led by figures like Rep. Maxine Waters, Democrats are voicing apprehension that the legislative process could be unduly influenced by interests tied to Mr. Trump. According to reports confirmed by a Democratic source, the intention is not merely to abstain but to stage a counter-hearing. This suggests a desire to control the narrative and present their own perspective on how crypto regulation should proceed, separate from the main committee proceedings they view with suspicion. The core of the Democrats’ concern appears to be the potential for the regulatory framework to be shaped in a way that benefits specific individuals or entities connected to the former president, rather than establishing clear, fair rules for the entire industry and protecting consumers. Navigating the Political Divide in a Congressional Hearing The scheduled congressional hearing is hosted by the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by Republican French Hill. Chairman Hill has publicly urged his Democratic colleagues to participate, emphasizing that bipartisan discussions on crypto legislation have been ongoing. However, the Democrats’ planned boycott signals that, despite some areas of agreement, fundamental distrust and political maneuvering are overriding collaborative efforts. The committee’s work is critical as it involves reviewing a draft bill aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. This clash underscores the challenges inherent in legislating a complex and rapidly evolving technology like cryptocurrency within a highly polarized political environment. Reaching consensus on issues ranging from consumer protection and market integrity to innovation and national security is proving difficult. Examining the Draft Crypto Regulation Bill and Stablecoin Legislation The congressional hearing is specifically set to review a draft bill. While details of this particular draft are central to the hearing, it’s important to view it within the broader context of ongoing legislative efforts. For instance, recent attempts to pass dedicated stablecoin legislation have also faced significant hurdles and criticism, particularly from Democrats. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. However, concerns persist regarding their reserves, potential for systemic risk, and the appropriate regulatory oversight. The criticism directed at past stablecoin legislation attempts by Democrats indicates a pattern of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulatory approaches coming from across the aisle. This adds another layer of complexity to the already fraught landscape of digital asset policy. The Trump Crypto Factor: What’s the Connection? The direct link between the planned walkout and Trump crypto involvement is the stated reason by the Democratic source. While the exact nature of Mr. Trump’s current digital asset holdings or specific industry ties prompting this concern are not fully detailed in the initial report, his recent public statements and embrace of cryptocurrencies represent a shift. Having previously expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Mr. Trump has recently adopted a more favorable stance, even launching NFTs and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. This pivot, combined with his significant political influence, appears to have fueled Democratic fears about potential conflicts of interest or attempts to shape legislation to favor certain factions within the crypto space aligned with his interests. Understanding the perceived influence of Trump crypto activities is crucial to grasping the intensity of the political opposition now impacting legislative processes. Implications for Crypto Regulation and the Industry This political standoff and the potential boycott of a key congressional hearing carry significant implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Uncertainty surrounding regulation remains one of the biggest impediments to mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the U.S. Challenges Highlighted by the Standoff: Delayed Clarity: Political gridlock slows down the creation of clear rules for digital assets, leaving businesses and investors in limbo. Fragmented Approach: A lack of bipartisan consensus could lead to piecemeal or ineffective regulation. Increased Political Risk: The industry becomes more susceptible to partisan battles and shifts in political winds. Perception Issues: Public perception of crypto can be negatively affected by association with intense political conflict. While the benefits of effective crypto regulation include greater consumer protection, market stability, and fostering innovation within clear boundaries, achieving this goal appears increasingly difficult amidst the current political climate. The planned walkout is a stark reminder that the path to comprehensive digital asset legislation in the U.S. is fraught with political peril. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for US Crypto Policy The planned walkout by House Democrats from a vital congressional hearing on crypto regulation , explicitly linked to concerns over Trump crypto ties and set against the backdrop of ongoing debates like stablecoin legislation , marks a critical and potentially damaging moment for the future of digital asset policy in the United States. It underscores the deep political rifts that threaten to delay or derail efforts to create a clear and effective regulatory framework. As the crypto industry continues to grow, the need for regulatory clarity is paramount, yet this latest development suggests that political considerations may, for now, overshadow the collaborative effort required to achieve it. The coming days will reveal whether dialogue prevails or if this dramatic protest further entrenches the partisan divide, leaving the crypto landscape in the U.S. more uncertain than ever.

For those tracking the convergence of AI and blockchain, understanding the landscape of foundational AI models and the companies building them is crucial. This is where Mistral AI steps in, a French startup making significant waves. What is Mistral AI and Why Does it Matter? Founded in 2023, Mistral AI quickly positioned itself as a significant European tech contender. It’s often regarded as potentially the only European company capable of competing directly with OpenAI. Despite a valuation reported around $6 billion, its global market share is still developing. However, Mistral AI gained notable attention, particularly in France, with the launch of its AI assistant, Le Chat, on mobile app stores. French President Emmanuel Macron even publicly endorsed Le Chat, encouraging its use over competitors like ChatGPT. Mistral AI’s stated ambition is to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone,” emphasizing a commitment to openness in AI development. This stance offers an alternative perspective compared to some of the more closed approaches in the industry. The company faces the dual challenge of scaling to compete globally while upholding its self-defined goal of being a leading independent and environmentally conscious AI lab. Exploring Mistral AI’s Range of AI Models A core part of Mistral AI’s strategy is its diverse portfolio of AI models , catering to various needs. These models form the foundation of their offerings, including the Le Chat assistant. Here’s a look at some key models: Mistral Large 2: The company’s flagship large language model, replacing its predecessor. Pixtral Large: Introduced in 2024, this model is part of the multimodal Pixtral family, capable of processing more than just text. Codestral: A specialized Generative AI model designed specifically for generating and assisting with code. Les Ministraux: A family of smaller models optimized for deployment on edge devices like smartphones. Mistral Saba: A model specifically focused on the Arabic language. Mistral OCR: Launched in March 2025, this API converts PDFs into text files, aiding AI models in data ingestion. This range shows Mistral AI’s effort to cover different applications, from large-scale language processing to device-specific and specialized tasks. Is Mistral AI an OpenAI Competitor? The comparison to OpenAI is frequent and intentional. Mistral AI is actively building products and models that serve similar markets. Their chat assistant, Le Chat , is a direct alternative to ChatGPT. It saw rapid adoption after its mobile launch, reaching 1 million downloads in two weeks and topping app store charts in France. While OpenAI has a significant head start and market dominance, Mistral AI’s rapid development, strong funding, and political backing in Europe position it as a credible challenger. The competition isn’t just on features but also on philosophy, with Mistral AI advocating for greater openness in AI technology. Funding and Partnerships Driving Mistral AI’s Growth Mistral AI has demonstrated remarkable success in attracting investment since its founding. As of February 2025, the company had raised approximately €1 billion (around $1.04 billion). This includes: A record $112 million seed round in June 2023, valuing the one-month-old startup at $260 million. A Series A round of €385 million ($415 million) in December 2023, at a reported $2 billion valuation. A €600 million mix of equity and debt ($640 million) in June 2024, led by General Catalyst, valuing the company at $6 billion. These funding rounds, attracting major global investors like Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Nvidia, and Microsoft, underscore the market’s belief in Mistral AI’s potential. Strategic partnerships are also key to its growth and distribution. A significant deal in 2024 with Microsoft included a €15 million investment and distribution of Mistral AI’s models via the Azure platform. Other notable partnerships include agreements with Agence France-Presse (AFP), France’s army and job agency, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis. These collaborations help expand Mistral AI’s reach and integrate its technology into various sectors. The People Behind Mistral AI Mistral AI was founded by individuals with deep roots in AI research at major U.S. tech companies. The co-founders are: Arthur Mensch: CEO, previously worked at Google’s DeepMind. Timothée Lacroix: CTO, a former Meta staffer. Guillaume Lample: Chief Scientist Officer, also a former Meta staffer. Their background provides the technical expertise necessary to build frontier AI models . The founding team also includes notable advisers from the French tech and political scene, adding valuable strategic insight and connections. Mistral AI’s Open Source Approach Mistral AI adopts a mixed approach to open source. While some of its premier models are proprietary, with weights not available for commercial use, the company also offers free models with weights accessible under the Apache 2.0 license. An example is Mistral NeMo, a research model built and open-sourced in collaboration with Nvidia in July 2024. This dual strategy balances the need for proprietary models to generate revenue with a commitment to contributing to the open AI ecosystem. Monetization and Future Outlook Mistral AI generates revenue through several channels. While many initial offerings were free, monetization includes paid tiers for its Le Chat assistant, introduced in February 2025 with a Pro plan priced at $14.99 a month. For businesses, Mistral AI offers API access to its premier models with usage-based pricing and enterprise licensing options. Strategic partnerships also contribute significantly to revenue. Despite rapid growth and high valuation, reports suggest Mistral AI’s revenue is still in the eight-digit range, highlighting the challenge of translating valuation into revenue at this stage. Regarding the future, CEO Arthur Mensch stated in January 2025 that Mistral AI is “not for sale” and that an IPO is the plan. Given the substantial capital raised and the desire for European sovereignty in AI, an IPO appears to be the most likely path forward. However, realizing a valuation near $6 billion through an IPO will require substantial revenue growth in the coming years. The journey for Mistral AI is just beginning, and its progress will be closely watched as it navigates the competitive global AI landscape.

44211897,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=157450,1746491419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase PAXG Addition: Major Opportunity for Tokenized Gold,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-paxg-roadmap-addition/,"Get ready for potentially exciting developments in the world of tokenized assets! Major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced a significant addition to its asset roadmap: PAX Gold (PAXG). This move has sparked considerable interest within the crypto community, hinting at the possibility of expanded access to gold-backed digital assets for millions of users. Understanding PAX Gold (PAXG): More Than Just a Crypto Before diving into the implications of the Coinbase roadmap inclusion, let’s clarify what PAX Gold (PAXG) actually is. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that are native digital creations, PAXG is a unique ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain that represents ownership of physical gold. Here’s a quick breakdown: Backed by Physical Gold: Each PAXG token is directly backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in secure, Brink’s vaults. Ownership Rights: Holding PAXG means you own the underlying physical gold. Token holders can even redeem their tokens for physical gold bars (though this typically involves minimums and logistical considerations). ERC-20 Token: It operates as a standard token on the Ethereum network, allowing for easy transfer and storage using compatible wallets. Think of PAXG as a digital wrapper around a physical asset, bringing the stability and historical value of gold into the modern, digital economy. This concept of tokenized gold is gaining traction as investors seek ways to diversify their portfolios within the crypto space. The Significance of the Coinbase Roadmap When Coinbase adds an asset to its roadmap, it’s a strong signal that the asset is under consideration for a potential future listing on the exchange. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate or even eventual listing, it indicates that the asset has passed initial reviews and meets certain criteria for further evaluation. For Coinbase , adding PAXG aligns with a broader trend of exchanges exploring and listing assets that bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized assets, particularly those backed by stable, real-world commodities like gold, offer a new avenue for user engagement and investment. What does this mean for PAXG specifically? Increased Visibility: Being on the Coinbase roadmap instantly puts PAXG in front of a massive global audience of crypto investors. Enhanced Legitimacy: Consideration by a regulated and prominent exchange like Coinbase adds a layer of credibility to PAXG and the broader tokenized gold concept. Potential Liquidity Boost: A future PAX Gold listing on Coinbase could dramatically increase trading volume and liquidity for the token. This move highlights Coinbase’s continued effort to expand its offerings beyond native cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, potentially paving the way for more real-world assets (RWAs) to be tokenized and traded on their platform. PAX Gold Listing: What to Expect Next? The inclusion on the Coinbase roadmap is just one step in a multi-stage process. There is no set timeline for when, or if, PAXG will move from the roadmap to an official listing announcement. Coinbase has a rigorous review process that considers various factors, including legal, compliance, technical, and market-related aspects. Investors and interested parties should keep a close watch on official announcements from both Coinbase and Paxos (the issuer of PAXG). Speculation around potential listing dates can be rampant, but reliable information will only come directly from the involved parties. Should a PAX Gold listing occur, here are some potential impacts: Easier Access: Millions of Coinbase users would gain direct access to buying, selling, and holding PAXG alongside their Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets. Price Impact: Increased demand and liquidity from a major exchange listing often lead to price appreciation, though this is not guaranteed and depends on overall market conditions. Integration into Coinbase Ecosystem: If listed, PAXG could potentially be integrated into other Coinbase services, such as Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Card, or institutional offerings. Exploring PAXG Crypto: Benefits and Risks for Investors For investors considering adding PAXG to their portfolio, the potential accessibility via Coinbase makes exploring PAXG crypto a timely exercise. Investing in PAXG offers a unique blend of traditional asset exposure with crypto-native advantages. Potential Benefits: Gold Exposure: Gain direct exposure to the price movements of physical gold without the hassle of storage or insurance. Fractional Ownership: Unlike buying physical gold bars, you can buy fractions of a PAXG token, making gold investment accessible at lower price points. Liquidity: As a token on major exchanges, PAXG can potentially be bought and sold more easily than physical gold or certain gold investment vehicles. Portability & Transfer: Transferring PAXG is as simple as sending a crypto transaction, much easier than moving physical gold. Potential Hedge: Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, offering potential portfolio diversification benefits. Potential Risks & Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving and could impact PAXG. Smart Contract Risk: As an ERC-20 token, PAXG is subject to potential risks associated with the underlying blockchain technology and smart contracts. Counterparty Risk: While Paxos is a regulated trust company, there is still a degree of reliance on the issuer to manage the physical gold reserves and token mechanics. Market Volatility: While backed by gold, PAXG’s price can still experience volatility influenced by both gold market dynamics and overall crypto market sentiment. Fees: Be aware of potential network transaction fees (gas fees on Ethereum) and any exchange-specific trading or withdrawal fees. The Rise of Tokenized Gold and Real-World Assets The addition of PAXG to the Coinbase roadmap isn’t an isolated event; it’s part of a larger trend towards the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). This involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space, such as real estate, art, commodities, or even equities. Why is tokenized gold , and RWAs in general, gaining traction? Increased Accessibility: Tokenization can break down large, illiquid assets into smaller, more accessible units. Improved Liquidity: Bringing assets onto a blockchain can facilitate easier trading on digital exchanges. Transparency: Ownership and transaction history can be recorded on a public ledger. Efficiency: Streamlining processes like transfer of ownership and settlement. PAXG is a leading example in the tokenized commodity space. A successful listing and adoption on a platform like Coinbase could significantly boost confidence in the RWA sector and encourage the tokenization of other asset classes. Actionable Insights for the Reader Given this development, what steps should you consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand exactly how PAXG works, its backing mechanism, and the reputation of its issuer, Paxos. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep an eye on Coinbase’s official channels for any updates regarding a potential PAXG listing. Assess Your Portfolio: Consider whether exposure to gold, via a tokenized asset like PAXG, aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the potential challenges and risks associated with both crypto investments and tokenized assets. The roadmap addition is a positive signal, but it’s crucial to approach any potential investment with caution and a thorough understanding of the asset. Compelling Summary Coinbase’s decision to add PAX Gold (PAXG) to its asset roadmap is a noteworthy development for both the token itself and the broader tokenized gold market. It signals potential future accessibility for millions of users on one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, offering a new avenue for investors seeking exposure to gold within the digital asset space. While not a guarantee of listing, this step underscores the growing importance of tokenized real-world assets in the crypto ecosystem. As the process unfolds, staying informed and conducting diligent research will be key for anyone interested in this exciting convergence of traditional commodities and blockchain technology.

Crypto Market Has Enjoyed Net Capital Inflows Over The Past Month In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the capital inflows for cryptocurrencies. In the digital asset sector, capital mainly flows in and out through three asset classes: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the stablecoins. The altcoins usually only see a secondary rotation of capital from these coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sandwiched Between Major Support & Resistance Levels—Can Bulls Win Out? As such, the netflows related to the three of BTC, ETH and the stables can provide a sufficient-enough estimation for the situation of the entire cryptocurrency market. For calculating the capital inflows/outflows related to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the “Realized Cap” indicator can be used. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that finds the total value of any asset’s supply by assuming the value of each individual token as the same as its last transaction price. This is different from the usual Market Cap, which just sums up the supply at the current spot price. In short, what the Realized Cap reflects is the amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole have put into it. Changes related to the metric, therefore, reflect the inflow or outflow of capital. In the case of the stablecoins, the change in the Market Cap is enough to gauge the capital netflow. This is down to the fact that the Realized Cap is no different from the Market Cap for them, as a result of their price never varying from the fiat currency that they are pegged to. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day aggregate cryptocurrency market netflow based on these indicators over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the combined 30-day Bitcoin and Ethereum Realized Cap change is currently at a positive $12.58 billion. This means that these two cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a notable net capital inflow during the past month. Similarly, the stablecoins have seen a net inflow of $6.19 billion in the same period. Thus, it seems the digital asset sector as a whole has witnessed the incoming of $18.77 billion in capital. Related Reading: Bitcoin HODLer Selling Expected Around This Level, Report Says While this trend has occurred, Bitcoin and the other assets have gone through their price recovery runs, so it’s possible that as long as these inflows keep up, the rallies could be sustainable. It only remains to be seen how the investors will behave in the coming days, however, as it often doesn’t take much for sentiment to shift in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $94,200, down 1% in the last seven days.

Here are the key figures: Direct XRP Holdings: Ripple reported holding 4.56 billion XRP tokens. This represents the amount of XRP directly controlled by the company, outside of its escrow accounts. Quarter-over-Quarter Change: Compared to the end of Q4 2024, these direct holdings saw a modest increase of 1.7%. While seemingly small, any change in a holding of this magnitude is noteworthy. XRP in Escrow: The report also detailed the amount of XRP held in cryptographic escrow accounts. These accounts are designed to release a set amount of XRP back to Ripple on a predetermined schedule, adding predictability to the supply. As of the end of Q1 2025, escrow holdings stood at 37.1 billion XRP. This figure decreased from the previous quarter as tokens were released from escrow. Understanding both direct holdings and escrow is essential to grasp Ripple’s overall potential influence on the XRP supply and market dynamics. The escrow mechanism is a key feature of the XRP Ledger designed to manage the release of the total XRP supply over time. How Do We Calculate the XRP Market Value of Ripple’s Holdings? Putting a dollar value on digital asset holdings requires using the prevailing market price at a specific point in time. According to the report, the XRP market value used for calculation was based on the price of $2.15 per token as of March 31, 2025. Using this price, the value of Ripple’s direct holdings of 4.56 billion XRP comes out to approximately $98.6 billion. This nearly $99 billion valuation underscores the immense financial stake Ripple has in the success and value of the XRP ecosystem. It’s important to remember that market prices for cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and this valuation is a snapshot in time. The actual dollar value fluctuates constantly with the market. While the direct holdings value is substantial, the vast amount of XRP still locked in escrow represents a much larger potential future value for the company as those tokens are released over time, assuming the price of XRP remains stable or increases. Beyond Holdings: What Else Did the Ripple Q1 2025 Report Highlight? The Q1 2025 report wasn’t just about token counts and valuations. It also shed light on Ripple’s strategic corporate moves, indicating a proactive approach to expanding its business lines and market reach. These Ripple business updates are critical for understanding the company’s long-term vision. Two significant points highlighted in the report, as noted by sources like U.Today, were: Acquisition of Hidden Road: Ripple successfully completed the acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm. This move is significant as it expands Ripple’s institutional offerings and capabilities, particularly in the areas of trading, financing, and prime brokerage services for digital assets. Acquiring established financial infrastructure can accelerate Ripple’s push into serving larger institutional clients. Ongoing Interest in Acquiring Circle: The report also reiterated Ripple’s continued interest in acquiring Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. While not a completed deal, expressing this interest publicly (or having it reported) signals Ripple’s ambition to play a major role in the stablecoin market and potentially integrate USDC into its payment solutions. An acquisition of Circle would be transformative for Ripple, significantly broadening its product suite and regulatory footprint. These strategic acquisitions and potential acquisitions demonstrate Ripple’s focus on building a comprehensive suite of financial services built around digital assets, extending beyond just cross-border payments facilitated by XRP. Why Should Investors Pay Attention to This Crypto Investment News? For anyone involved in the digital asset space, especially those holding or considering XRP, this crypto investment news from Ripple’s Q1 2025 report offers several key takeaways: Transparency: Ripple continues to provide quarterly reports detailing its XRP holdings and sales, which is a level of transparency welcomed by many in the crypto community. This helps manage expectations regarding potential supply increases from the company. Company Strength: A nearly $99 billion valuation of direct XRP holdings (at the time of the report) indicates significant underlying value for the company itself, separate from its operational revenue. This financial strength can fuel further investment, development, and strategic acquisitions. Strategic Expansion: The acquisitions of firms like Hidden Road and the pursuit of others like Circle show a clear strategy to diversify and strengthen Ripple’s position in the broader digital finance ecosystem. These moves could potentially increase the utility and adoption of Ripple’s technologies, which proponents argue could positively impact XRP in the long run. Market Influence: While Ripple has reduced its programmatic sales of XRP over time, the sheer volume of their holdings means their actions regarding these assets are always relevant to market participants. However, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. The release of XRP from escrow, while scheduled, adds a predictable supply increase that the market must absorb. Furthermore, the success of Ripple’s new ventures and acquisitions will depend on execution and market adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ripple and XRP? The Q1 2025 report paints a picture of a company actively leveraging its resources (including its XRP holdings) to grow and diversify. The focus on institutional services through acquisitions like Hidden Road, and the ambition shown by targeting a major stablecoin player like Circle, suggests Ripple is aiming to be a central figure in the future of digital finance, not just cross-border payments. The value of Ripple XRP holdings is intrinsically linked to the market performance of XRP. While Ripple’s business success doesn’t directly guarantee an increase in XRP’s price (as price is driven by many factors including speculation, utility adoption, and macro trends), a strong and expanding Ripple ecosystem could potentially contribute to increased demand and utility for the digital asset over time. Investors and market watchers will be closely watching how these acquisitions integrate into Ripple’s existing business and what further strategic moves the company makes. The regulatory environment also remains a significant factor influencing both Ripple’s operations and the perception of XRP. In Conclusion: Ripple’s Q1 2025 report demonstrates the company’s robust financial position, highlighted by the substantial value of its XRP holdings, and signals aggressive strategic expansion through key acquisitions. While the nearly $99 billion valuation is impressive, it’s the underlying business growth and diversification efforts that truly underscore Ripple’s ambitions in the evolving digital finance landscape.

Many people are exploring AI tools, specifically AI Chatbots, for quick health information, especially with long waits for traditional care. However, a recent study highlights significant challenges users face when seeking useful health advice from these systems. Why is Getting Health Advice from AI Chatbots Difficult? According to a study led by Oxford researchers, there’s a “two-way communication breakdown” when people use AI Chatbots for health advice. Users struggle to provide the right information, and the chatbots often give answers that are hard to understand or contain a mix of good and bad recommendations. This means people using chatbots didn’t make better decisions about potential health issues compared to those using traditional online searches or their own knowledge. What Did the Chatbot Study Involve? The Chatbot Study included about 1,300 participants in the UK. They were given medical scenarios written by doctors and asked to identify possible conditions and actions using chatbots and other methods. The study tested popular models like GPT-4o, Cohere’s Command R+, and Meta’s Llama 3. The findings were concerning: Participants were less likely to identify relevant health conditions when using chatbots. They were more likely to underestimate the severity of conditions they did identify. Users often left out key details when querying the chatbots. Chatbot responses frequently blended helpful information with poor suggestions. The Push for Medical AI in Healthcare Despite these challenges, major tech companies continue to develop Medical AI applications for healthcare. Apple is reportedly working on tools for exercise, diet, and sleep advice. Amazon is exploring AI to analyze medical data for social health factors. Microsoft is assisting in building AI to manage patient messages for care providers. However, the medical community and AI companies themselves express caution. The American Medical Association advises against doctors using chatbots for clinical decisions, and companies like OpenAI warn against using their chatbots for diagnoses. Risks of Relying on AI Healthcare Tools for Self-Diagnosis The study underscores the risks of relying on current AI Healthcare tools for self-diagnosis. Misidentifying conditions or underestimating their seriousness can lead to delayed or incorrect treatment, potentially worsening health outcomes. Experts recommend using trusted sources for health decisions. Moving Forward with AI in Health Experts suggest that, like new medications, AI systems intended for healthcare use should undergo thorough testing in real-world settings before widespread deployment. Current evaluation methods don’t fully capture the complexity of human interaction with these tools. Conclusion While the potential for AI in healthcare is significant, this Chatbot Study highlights the current limitations of AI Chatbots for providing reliable Health Advice. Users face difficulties in interacting effectively with these tools, leading to potentially dangerous outcomes when seeking Medical AI for self-diagnosis within AI Healthcare systems. Caution and reliance on professional medical guidance remain essential.

From crushing it in the market to finally closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, Ripple’s start to the year has been exciting. SEC Case Closed: Ripple Walks Away a Winner In one of the biggest stories of the year for crypto, the SEC officially dropped its appeal against Ripple, bringing their multi-year legal fight to an end. The regulator also agreed to lower the proposed penalty from $125 million to $50 million and asked the court to cancel the injunction against Ripple. And it’s not just Ripple catching a break. The new U.S. government has already rolled back some of the old restrictions on crypto. A $1.25 Billion Power Move The company bought Hidden Road, a global prime broker, for a whopping $1.25 billion. The deal gives Ripple new tools to expand its institutional services. Hidden Road will start using Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as collateral and will rely on the XRP Ledger for faster and cheaper post-trade operations in foreign exchange, swaps, and repo markets. Ripple’s XRP Holdings on the Rise By the end of March 2025, Ripple held 4.56 billion XRP, up from 4.48 billion at the start of the year. Another 37.13 billion XRP remains locked in escrow, gradually releasing over the next 42 months. XRPL Activity Cools, but DeFi Stays Strong After a big spike in late 2024, on-chain activity on the XRP Ledger settled down a bit. Transaction numbers and new wallet creations both dropped about 30–40%, which tracks with what’s been happening across the broader crypto market. But one bright spot stood out — DeFi activity held up better than most blockchains. Trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) only dipped by 16%, while other major chains saw much steeper drops. Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin also gained ground, crossing a $90 million market cap with over $300 million traded on DEXs. XRP Outperforms the Market While Bitcoin and Ethereum struggled for gains in Q1, XRP stole the spotlight. It jumped nearly 50% in early February and held steady while other big names dropped. Even with market ups and downs, XRP proved to be one of the strongest-performing assets in the space. The numbers tell the story. XRP-based investment products saw $37.7 million in inflows in just three months, pushing its 2025 total to $214 million — now just $1 million away from surpassing Ethereum’s global funds. But there’s one big change — after eight years of publishing these detailed reports, Ripple announced this will be the final one in its current format. The company says it’s time to evolve how it communicates with the market. “After careful consideration, Ripple has made the decision to sunset the report in its current form starting in Q2 2025,” the report read.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 00:54:15

This comes after the agency delayed several other applications for spot crypto ETFs last week, including XRP, Hedera, and Dogecoin but hadn’t done so for the Canary Litecoin ETF, sparking hopes that the regulator might have different plans for this fund. But on Monday, the official deadline, the regulator announced the delay and asked for public comments regarding the proposal’s compliance with regulatory requirements. ""In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,"" the agency wrote in a filing . Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. LTC, which stands at a $6.6 billion market cap, is the native cryptocurrency of Litecoin, an open-source blockchain project whose code is copied from Bitcoin’s (BTC).

History shows that many of the biggest gains came not from chasing hype, but from recognizing fundamentals before the crowd. Cardano (ADA) was once that quiet opportunity, trading below $0.05 back in early 2020 — before going on a multi-year rally that surprised even seasoned traders. Today, some analysts are pointing to another early-stage token following a similar path: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently available at $0.025 through its presale, MUTM is drawing serious attention from investors who believe it shares ADA’s early DNA — not in branding or community culture, but in development-first focus, real utility, and a token model built for long-term traction. And if forecasts are accurate, MUTM could hit the $1 mark much faster than ADA ever did. Why MUTM’s Position Resembles Early ADA Cardano’s breakout wasn’t overnight. It came after years of consistent network upgrades, peer-reviewed research, and increasing utility. The reason ADA saw such strong growth was because it transitioned from speculation to actual ecosystem adoption. Mutuum Finance is at a similar crossroads. Though still in development, its foundations are already attracting serious participants in the decentralized finance space. Mutuum Finance is fundamentally a non-custodial protocol designed for lending and borrowing, with a clear focus on ease of use, transparent operations, and generating passive income for participants. Instead of just issuing a token and promising returns, the team has built a structure where utility is baked into the user experience. Participants can deposit assets into the platform, receive mtTokens in return, and earn interest over time. These mtTokens act as a user’s share of the liquidity pool, passively tracking interest as long as they hold them. Unlike many early-stage cryptocurrencies, Mutuum isn’t designed around speculation. It’s engineered to offer practical tools to users — allowing access to on-chain liquidity without giving up asset ownership. Whether for passive income or capital deployment, the platform gives investors ways to stay flexible while putting their assets to work. Momentum behind MUTM is growing quickly. The presale has already raised over $7.5 million, with more than 9,300 holders now on board and over 440 million tokens sold. MUTM is currently priced at $0.025, though the upcoming presale stage will increase it to $0.03, with the official launch price already set at $0.06. That means early participants are locking in a 2.4x return even before listings go live. But many believe that’s just the start. The $1 forecast isn’t built on empty projections — it’s based on a blend of platform potential and investor behavior. Once the token hits exchanges and the beta version of the Mutuum platform launches, user adoption is expected to grow quickly. As more participants engage with the system, interest from borrowers generates yield for depositors, and revenue for the protocol increases. This revenue isn’t left idle either. A portion of it is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the market, which are then distributed to active users — creating a feedback loop that supports demand while rewarding long-term engagement. It’s a practical, scalable system that closely mirrors what successful DeFi cryptos have done — but in a cleaner, more streamlined way. When MUTM climbs from its current $0.025 price to $1, that would mark a 3,900% surge in value. For example, a $1,250 investment today would secure around 50,000 MUTM tokens. At $1, that’s $50,000 — a transformation that resembles ADA’s early returns and explains why so many are keeping a close eye on this token. Another key point working in MUTM’s favor is its upcoming stablecoin — an overcollateralized asset minted from supplied collateral. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this one will be fully decentralized and algorithmically backed by on-chain assets. All interest from stablecoin borrowing will feed into Mutuum’s treasury, reinforcing platform health and sustainability. The protocol is also undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the most trusted names in smart contract verification. This move adds an additional layer of credibility and is a clear signal that the team is focused on long-term viability and user trust. ADA’s journey to the top was built on strong fundamentals. Today, MUTM stands at a similar moment. It has the product vision, the early community, and the groundwork to build something meaningful in DeFi. And with the token still priced at just $0.025, many believe this could be one of the best cryptocurrency investments to make before the next market wave hits. With analysts already forecasting a potential move to $1, and platform infrastructure set to go live around launch, the opportunity here isn’t just early — it’s ticking.

The latest Chainlink (LINK) price update shows promise, but it’s stuck just below $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has pulled it to $1,780, shaking market confidence. These two might recover, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is locking in wins. It just passed its CertiK audit, proving top-tier security, and has already sold over 19.6 billion coins. Unlike LINK and ETH, BlockDAG is not waiting for charts to turn it’s already delivering. With a 2520% ROI and a $0.0019 entry open until May 13, it is ranked as the top crypto to buy right now. Chainlink (LINK) Price Update: Will the $15.30 Barrier Finally Break? Chainlink (LINK) price update shows bullish momentum after weeks of sideways trading. Currently at $15.02, LINK is testing the key $15.30 resistance. A breakout here could send the price toward $17. The technical setup includes an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and an EMA crossover, both hinting at rising buying pressure. However, the breakout needs confirmation with a strong move above $15.30. If that fails, Chainlink might stay between $14.50 and $15.30. On the data side, exchange reserves dropped 1.03%, a positive sign, but a 37.46% spike in netflows hints at possible short-term selling. For now, the Chainlink (LINK) price update stays cautiously optimistic. Traders are watching the next Chainlink (LINK) price update. Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Follows Sharp 2.59% Daily Decline Ethereum (ETH) price drop hit hard on April 30, 2025, falling 2.59% to $1,780.25. This happened during a low-volume trading day with rising market uncertainty. Ethereum (ETH) price drop also pulled its market cap down by 2.70%, landing at $214.93 billion. Volume dropped nearly 10%, showing a slowdown in trader activity. RSI now shows neutrality, with traders watching for the next move. ETH’s supply stayed stable at 120.73 million tokens, signalling no inflation pressure. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair bounced back from its monthly low of 0.0180 BTC and now holds steady above 0.0185 BTC. This level is key. If it holds, Ethereum could aim for higher resistance areas, but rising volatility keeps things uncertain. CertiK Verified: BlockDAG Locks in Top-Tier Smart Contract Security BlockDAG has officially cleared the CertiK audit – a major milestone that highlights its serious commitment to blockchain security. As one of the most trusted names in blockchain verification, CertiK’s involvement brings confidence and credibility to the project. This isn’t just a rubber stamp. It’s the final stage of BlockDAG’s rigorous three-tier security strategy designed to protect its treasury and vesting smart contracts. The project doesn’t stop at technical checks; it extends protection through strict internal controls, organizational safeguards, and an ongoing partnership with CertiK for deeper code review and continuous monitoring. Security is the backbone of BlockDAG’s architecture. With its frequent audits, and strict listing protocols, BlockDAG is building a network where trust isn’t just promised, it’s enforced. This level of readiness, especially before launch, puts BlockDAG in a different league. The numbers back it up. BDAG has already crossed 19.6 billion coins sold. ROI from Batch 1 to Batch 28 stands at 2520%. With the launch price set at $0.05, the current limited-time entry point of $0.0019 (available until May 13) is turning heads. All signs point to BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy right now. Crypto Moves That Deserve Attention The Chainlink (LINK) price update reflects cautious optimism, but the $15.30 resistance still holds firm. Ethereum (ETH) price drop has slowed its momentum, with no clear signal of recovery yet. While these two remain uncertain, BlockDAG continues to deliver results. It has successfully completed its CertiK audit, reinforcing strong smart contract security. With over 19.6 billion coins sold and a 2520% ROI from early batches, the numbers show steady growth. The current $0.0019 entry price is available until May 13, offering one last window before listings begin. All signs point to BlockDAG being the top crypto to buy right now—based on real progress, not speculation.

According to information inadvertently published on their website and a blog post that briefly appeared, the evolution of their design language is moving from “Material 3” to something called “Material Design 3 Expressive.” The core idea behind this update is to create interfaces that are not only functional but also emotionally resonant and delightful to use. While the full details are still under wraps until the official reveal at Google I/O , the leaked information points to key characteristics: Bold Use of Shape and Color: Expect interfaces that are visually striking and use these elements to guide the user and create memorable interactions. Emotional Connection: The goal is to move beyond purely functional design to interfaces that users feel a positive connection with. Improved Usability: The design aims to draw attention to key elements and actions, potentially making apps easier and faster to navigate. This evolution impacts app developers directly, influencing how they build and customize experiences, and ultimately affecting the overall User Experience for everyone using an Android device. Tracing the Evolution: From Material Design to Material You To understand Material 3 Expressive, it helps to look back at Google’s design history. The journey began in 2014 with the introduction of Material Design . This open-source system provided a comprehensive guide for developers on creating user interfaces across Android, covering visual style, motion, and interaction patterns. The system received a significant update in May 2021 with the reveal of “Material You,” also known as Material You (or Material 3). This version introduced a new level of personalization. A prime example is the dynamic color feature, where the entire Android interface could adapt its color scheme based on the user’s chosen wallpaper. This made the device feel more personal and unique to the individual. Material 3 Expressive appears to be an iteration building upon the foundation of Material You , pushing the boundaries further into the realm of emotional and visually engaging design rather than being a complete overhaul. Why Focus on Expressive User Experience? The leaked blog post offered insights into the research behind this design shift. Studies indicated that people often prefer a more expressive design style because it actually improves usability. By using bold shapes and colors, the design can effectively highlight important elements and user actions. Google noted that this approach leads to “significant gains in performance” because users can more quickly identify and interact with what they need. Interestingly, Google also highlighted that this type of expressive design can make using apps easier for older adults. By making key elements more prominent and visually distinct, it helps level the playing field, ensuring that the User Experience is accessible and intuitive for people of all ages. However, Google did caution that expressive design isn’t a universal solution. Developers still need to adhere to established design patterns and standards while incorporating these new expressive elements. It requires a thoughtful approach to ensure the design is both expressive and functional. What to Expect at Google I/O? The accidental blog post, initially spotted by 9to5Google and saved via the Wayback Machine, has since been removed. However, the presence of a session titled “Build next-level UX with Material 3 Expressive” in the official Google I/O schedule confirms the upcoming reveal. Developers attending this session will learn how to leverage these “new emotional design patterns” to enhance engagement, usability, and the overall appeal of their products. Google plans to release files and alpha code during the conference, allowing developers to start experimenting with Material 3 Expressive ahead of its wider public release. This early access is crucial for the ecosystem to adapt and begin implementing the new Android Design principles. Conclusion: A More Emotional Android Future? The leak of Material 3 Expressive details gives us an exciting glimpse into the future of Android Design . Moving beyond pure function, Google is pushing towards interfaces that connect with users emotionally, using bold visuals and thoughtful design to create delightful and highly usable experiences. This focus on expressive User Experience promises benefits for users of all ages and presents developers with powerful new tools to build engaging apps. The full picture will emerge at Google I/O , but the direction is clear: Android is aiming for a richer, more personal, and more emotional visual identity.

In a May 5 letter to a Manhattan federal court, lawyers for Samourai co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill said prosecutors disclosed that the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) representatives told them six months before they charged the pair “that under FinCEN’s guidance, the Samourai Wallet app would not qualify as a ‘Money Services Business’ requiring a FinCEN license.” “Shockingly, six months later, the same prosecutors criminally charged Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill with operating just such a business without a FinCEN license,” the lawyers added. The letter claimed that prosecutors were required to share their discussions with FinCEN over Samourai two weeks after they unsealed charges, making the deadline May 8 last year, but instead “suppressed this information for over a year, disclosing it only on April 1, 2025.” Prosecutors charged Samourai CEO Rodriguez and its technology chief Hill with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and money laundering conspiracy in February 2024, unsealing the charges and arresting the pair in April that year. Samourai’s mixing service took crypto from multiple users and blended it together to hide its origins. The government alleged the platform helped with over $2 billion in illegal transactions and facilitated over $100 million worth of money laundering transactions from online black markets and scammers. Rodriguez and Hill both pleaded not guilty. In the letter, their lawyers said prosecutors shared details of a call with Kevin O’Connor, chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente. According to an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the call, FinCEN said that “because Samourai does not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].” An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListener The email said O’Connor and Valente agreed that the government could try to argue that Samourai functionally controlled the crypto, “but that has never been addressed in the guidance, and so it could be a difficult argument” for prosecutors. Samourai’s lawyers asked the court for a hearing “to determine the circumstances surrounding the Government’s late disclosure” and to administer a remedy. Samourai to renew dismissal bid if case goes on Rodriguez and Hill’s lawyers said that, using this latest information, they would again ask for the charges to be dismissed, arguing they lacked fair notice and “understood they were acting lawfully.” Related: US Treasury’s OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions, judge rules Prosecutors and Samourai asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider potentially dismissing the case after the Justice Department rolled back its crypto enforcement. Rodriguez and Hill bid to dismiss the case in early April, arguing it should be dropped as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an April 7 memo that the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In the latest letter, their lawyers said if the government “were to resist the Blanche Memo’s directive and push forward,” then they would bid to dismiss as “if they were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance, then they could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.” Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-06 01:17:18

This week, XRP dropped slightly by about 0.3%. While some cryptocurrencies saw a bit of selling, this small dip in XRP isn’t a big concern for most investors. The price is still holding above key support levels. There’s still uncertainty about whether XRP has started its next big move up. On smaller timeframes, no clear breakout has formed yet, though the price is making higher highs and higher lows — a positive sign. Price Correction Could Be Ending Crypto analyst Dark Defender said that XRP recently faced resistance at $2.22 and $2.36, with the price pulling back to $2.13. He believes this pullback was expected and that the market is preparing for the next move up, as long as XRP holds above the $2.00 level. Dark Defender also shared his long-term outlook. He said XRP is in the final phase of a fifth wave structure and expects this to lead to higher prices. He predicts the first move toward $3, followed by further gains with targets of $4.40 and $6.30 if the pattern continues. The key support to watch in the short term is $1.88. However, some analysts warn that short-term trends are still unclear. The recent price movement has been choppy, and there is no strong sign of an upward impulse yet.

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

The SEC’s most recent action comes after the regulator decided to postpone verdicts on active altcoin ETF filings until June 17. The agency is seeking public comments on whether the listing proposal satisfies regulatory requirements, specifically preventing deceptive and manipulative practices. “In particular, the Commission seeks comment on whether the proposal to list and trade Shares of the Trust, which would hold LTC, is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices or raises any new or novel concerns not previously contemplated by the Commission,” the agency wrote in a filing. James Seyffart’s prediction becomes a reality The SEC revealed in a statement that it has further delayed deciding on Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). In light of this action, the agency is requesting an inquiry into whether Nasdaq’s proposal to list the ETF conforms with legal requirements. Canary Capital, which was founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg last year, had submitted initial paperwork for the fund in October. The decision by the SEC has generated conversations within the crypto community. James Seyffart , a Bloomberg analyst with extensive experience, especially with Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), offered commentary on the subject. Based on Seyffart’s argument, he correctly predicted that the SEC would postpone making a decision on the Litecoin ETF, as it had done with other cryptocurrency ETFs so far, such as Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF filing. Moreover, according to Seyffart, Litecoin is the asset with the best chance of receiving early approval . Recently, the analyst predicted that there was a 90% chance that an LTC ETF would be approved this year, which gave the price of Litecoin a positive outlook. According to CoinMarketCap, Litecoin is currently down by 2.2% over 24 hours, trading hands for over $83. Litecoin (LTC) is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency and the 25th biggest digital coin by market cap. The asset is a forked version of Bitcoin established in 2011 by ex-Google employee Charlie Lee. The SEC has delayed Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF just like other crypto ETF proposals The SEC was set to decide on the proposed spot in Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF on May 5. In the meantime, market observers had become more hopeful. In support of this, on Polymarket, approval odds had risen to their highest level since the middle of March. In January, Nasdaq reportedly filed Form 19b-4, a proposed rule change, to list and trade Canary’s Litecoin ETF shares. The proposal was then made available for public comment in the Federal Register on February 4. This was the first day of the 45-day review period, which ended on March 21st. However, the SEC decided to make this time frame longer by 45 days, setting a new 90-day deadline of May 5. The statement said, “Accordingly, the Commission, under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 6 designates May 5, 2025, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NASDAQ-2025-005).” For other cryptocurrency ETF applications, the regulator has taken similar actions. The SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) proposal until June 15 and Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP (XRP) ETF until June 17. This was also the case with Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETH) staking ETF. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The post quickly went viral, with some calling it unnecessary fear-mongering and others suggesting it hints at possible market manipulation. What Was Said? The post argued that Ripple’s monthly XRP sales, unusual network patterns, and historic price movements — particularly during XRP’s famous 2017 rally — hinted at possible price suppression. It even cited a study that found a negative connection between XRP’s transaction network and its price performance. Naturally, this raised plenty of questions within the crypto community. Expert Clears The Air However, attorney and XRP supporter Bill Morgan explained that the post made several exaggerated claims. For starters, he clarified that Ripple doesn’t own 43% of XRP’s supply, as the post suggested. According to CoinMarketCap data, around 58.5% of XRP is in circulation, excluding what Ripple holds in escrow. Morgan also said that Ripple’s monthly sales from escrow make up just a small fraction of the total market volume and have no impact on price. In fact, evidence presented in the SEC lawsuit revealed that Ripple took measures to support XRP’s price, such as locking up large amounts of tokens in escrow to reduce market pressure. This post in the thread is over generalised to begin with. Firstly, Ripple does not own 43% of supply. even @CoinMarketCap publishes that the circulating supply (excluding what ripple holes outside escrow) is 58.5%. Secondly, what Ripple releases from escrow and sells each month… https://t.co/XnTBuHaZJ7 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) May 5, 2025 He added that the SEC spent over 18 months investigating Ripple before filing the lawsuit, and if any proof of price manipulation existed, it would have been used in court. This, he argued, makes the suppression claims hard to believe. Further clarifying the situation, Morgan said that XRP’s price has historically followed the crypto market, moving in line with Bitcoin and Ethereum. This trend has remained consistent for the past four years, and little has changed to challenge that pattern.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-06 01:52:25

In the analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Aleman noted that these addresses have increased their exposure to ETH, even as the asset trades well below recent highs. Ethereum Holders Are Staying Put Despite Unrealized Loss Since reaching its cycle high of $4,107 in December 2024, ETH has experienced a sharp pullback of over 50%, currently trading around the $1,800 mark. Despite this steep correction, long-term ETH holders – particularly those behind accumulation addresses – have not been deterred. Instead of exiting their positions, they continue to hold firm.

Key On-Chain Metric Reveals Insights Interestingly, since March 10, on-chain data reveals that many of these accumulation addresses have entered unrealized loss territory. For context, ETH fell to a local low of $1,866 while its Realized Price stood at $2,026. For the uninitiated, an accumulation address is a crypto wallet that steadily receives and holds a particular asset – like Ethereum – without sending it out. These addresses are typically long-term holders, ones who have held ETH for more than 155 days. When accumulation addresses continue to acquire assets in the face of declining prices, it often signals that investors expect a bullish reversal in the near future. These wallets essentially represent “strong hands” in the market. Similarly, Realized Price is the average price at which all coins in a cryptocurrency network were last moved, calculated by dividing the total realized market cap by the circulating supply. It reflects the aggregate cost basis of holders and is often used to assess whether the market is in profit or loss. Since March 10, the Realized Price for these addresses has dropped by 2.32%, from $2,026 to $1,980 as of May 3. Yet, rather than scaling back, these addresses have increased their ETH holdings significantly. Aleman adds: Despite the continued downtrend, and even while in unrealized losses, accumulating addresses have not abandoned their strategy. Instead, they increased their ETH exposure: on March 10 they held 15.5356M ETH, and by May 3 this rose to 19.0378M ETH, a 22.54% increase, as seen in the ETH Cohort analysis and Balance on Accumulation Addresses. Has ETH Hit Market Bottom? While some analysts warn that ETH could fall further – possibly to as low as $1,200 – others believe that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap may have already bottomed out for this cycle.

A sudden $17 million whale activity spike has renewed focus on the Shiba Inu price prediction. AAVE, on the other hand, is holding its ground above key averages. The AAVE crypto price is pushing toward $196, possibly heading to $240 if bulls stay in control. But both face hesitations that leave room for doubt. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) skips the waiting game. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, with leftovers going to the day’s biggest buyer. This system turns buying into a smart move. Compared to SHIB and AAVE, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market mood, it’s driving it. Among the top names right now, BlockDAG clearly runs the best crypto presale. Whale Surge Sparks Fresh Shiba Inu Price Prediction Buzz Shiba Inu (SHIB) is back in focus as whale activity jumps by 228%, moving $17 million worth of tokens daily. This sudden interest follows a quiet period and hints at renewed confidence. The Shiba Inu price prediction is gaining attention again, especially as May historically brings upward moves. While retail traders stay cautious, large holders are quietly accumulating. SHIB trades at $0.0000126, with major resistance between $0.0000140 and $0.0000190. Breaking that level could trigger a strong rally. The Shiba Inu price prediction also leans on Bitcoin’s recovery and easing macro fears. With sentiment shifting from fear to neutral, the Shiba Inu price prediction shows potential for a breakout if momentum continues. Aave Crypto Price Could Rally to $240 if Bulls Succeed The Aave crypto price is holding firm above key moving averages, showing positive sentiment as buyers step in on dips. Bulls are eyeing the $196 level, but resistance is expected there. If support holds near the 20-day EMA and the price breaks $180, a move to $220 or $240 is possible. Minor resistance at $190 might not hold back the momentum. However, if bears drag the Aave crypto price below the 50-SMA, it could slip to $155 and even touch $130. For now, steady buying and strong support levels hint at a bullish setup unless sellers regain control. Watching the $180–$196 zone is crucial for the next move. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Drop 50M BDAG Daily, Winner Takes the Leftovers BlockDAG has flipped the usual crypto game with something fresh – Buyer Battles. It has no private rounds, no gatekeeping, just a daily challenge open to everyone. Each day, 50 million BDAG coins are set aside. Buyers compete by purchasing, and the day’s biggest buyer takes home any unsold coins as a bonus. It’s not just a fair system, it turns buying into a strategy where bigger moves can lead to bigger wins. This model drives steady action and encourages frequent, bold participation. With BDAG priced at just $0.0019 until May 13, the timing works in favour of early buyers. Once listings go live and the price hits $0.05, those early gains show real weight. The daily battle setup doesn’t just engage users, it rewards them. It creates a path where retail buyers can win big without needing deep pockets or early access. This makes BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles more than just a promo, they’re a key reason it’s being seen as the best crypto presale in 2025. BlockDAG has already raised over $225 million and sold 19.6 billion coins, with 10 exchange listings confirmed, including one tier-one. Since Batch 1, the return has climbed by 2520%, highlighting strong momentum. Best Buys Right Now Shiba Inu is catching fresh attention with a $17 million whale move, reviving the Shiba Inu price prediction ahead of May’s typical uptrend. AAVE is also holding strong, with the AAVE crypto price aiming for $196 and beyond – if buyers stay in charge. But both rely on market shifts. BlockDAG isn’t waiting. Its Buyer Battles drop 50 million BDAG daily, giving leftover coins to the top buyer. No VIP access needed, just daily action. With a short-time discounted price $0.0019 entry and confirmed exchange listings, BlockDAG is setting the pace. Its early gains make it 2025’s best crypto presale.

The Dogecoin bullish signal is hard to ignore as patterns on the charts suggest a possible 200% price increase. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action has sparked fresh discussion, with over $160 billion SHIB purchased by large holders within just two days. These developments are stirring speculative interest. However, beyond memes and volatility lies a more calculated opportunity. Web3 ai is not driven by hype but by real-time utility and AI-driven trading support. Powered by its $WAI token, the project delivers usable products now, not promises for later. With a presale targeting a 1747% ROI and a complete AI toolset already live, Web3 ai may quietly be the best crypto coin to buy at this pivotal market moment. Dogecoin Bullish Signal Points to a Possible Major Upswing Dogecoin has once again captured the attention of traders and analysts. The Dogecoin bullish signal is now supported by a visible cup-and-handle pattern that traditionally precedes large breakouts. If this pattern follows its usual trajectory, Dogecoin could experience gains of up to 200% from current levels. Investors watching Dogecoin must weigh the bullish setup against these longer-term concerns. While the upside is tempting, staying mindful of resistance levels and overall sentiment shifts is critical. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale Action Signals Confidence, But Questions Remain The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has yet to break out, but whale wallets are making bold moves. In just 48 hours, over $160 billion SHIB tokens flowed into large holder addresses, suggesting growing confidence among seasoned market participants. This significant accumulation has renewed optimism around SHIB’s prospects. At the same time, price movements have not mirrored these inflows. Often in meme-based markets, whale activity can foreshadow major price shifts. Still, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale action must be viewed in context. The token continues to face challenges regarding sustainability, particularly around token burns and ecosystem growth. For SHIB to truly capitalize on whale interest, further development within its Layer 2 Shibarium and increased utility will likely be necessary. Until then, the moves by large holders serve as a speculative signal rather than a guaranteed breakout indicator. Web3 ai ($WAI): Combining AI, Utility, and a 1747% ROI Advantage While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture headlines, Web3 ai takes a much more strategic approach. It addresses the growing demand for tools that convert market data into meaningful, real-time trading decisions. Web3 ai’s AI-powered suite includes features like arbitrage discovery, sentiment analysis, yield optimization, and liquidity tracking, all actively working across Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and Polygon networks. What separates Web3 ai from traditional meme tokens is the depth of its ecosystem. The $WAI token is not just speculative. It serves multiple functions across the platform, including: Unlocking advanced AI trading and analysis tools Enabling staking for passive income and tiered access Facilitating governance and decision-making on future upgrades Supporting a deflationary model with revenue-driven token burns At the moment, Web3 ai’s crypto presale offers a unique advantage. Early investors can enter across 50 stages, starting at $0.0003 and concluding at $0.003267. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242, this structure sets up a clear path to a 1747% ROI for early buyers. This positions Web3 ai firmly in the discussion for the best crypto coin to buy right now. Its combination of real products, growing adoption potential, and clear token utility presents an appealing alternative to hype-driven assets. Last Words Dogecoin’s bullish signal could result in significant gains if price patterns hold. Shiba Inu’s whale action demonstrates confidence that may lead to an eventual price surge. However, both remain heavily influenced by sentiment and market cycles. Web3 ai offers something far more aligned with forward-looking crypto trends. Its AI-enhanced platform is already live, helping traders make smarter decisions today. The $WAI token unlocks access to essential AI tools, while the presale offers a rare early-stage opportunity for impressive returns. As the platform grows and AI adoption expands throughout crypto markets, Web3 ai could quickly shift from promising newcomer to established market leader. For those seeking the best crypto coin to buy now , Web3 ai represents a logical and compelling choice. Early access does not just offer profit potential, it offers the chance to be part of crypto’s next major innovation wave.

Whether your focus is security, privacy, strong ecosystems, or practical utility, these projects check the right boxes.

It’s more than just a coin; $CWT activates features, grants governance rights, and unlocks loyalty perks within the ecosystem. More importantly, Cold Wallet isn’t focused on buzz, it’s executing a roadmap packed with exchange listings, cross-chain compatibility, and anonymous dApp access planned across Q3 and Q4. For those seeking digital privacy and real upside, Cold Wallet stands among the top crypto gems to buy now. Chainlink: Core Infrastructure Powering Web3 Chainlink is not focused on headlines, its value lies in being essential to Web3’s backbone. With a current trading price of $24.50 in April 2025 and over $120 million exiting exchanges lately, there’s growing belief in its long-term importance. The CCIP feature is now active on Hedera and heading to Ronin, enabling secure, multi-chain data and asset flow unmatched in scope.

Chainlink holds its spot by being the tech foundation others rely on. For those wanting exposure to dependable Web3 infrastructure, Chainlink is one of the top crypto gems to buy now.

It’s more than just trading behavior, it shows strong faith in a privacy protocol that resists intrusion. With its latest upgrade (v0.18.4.0) and the Cuprate node redesign, Monero continues refining speed and future performance. Privacy features like stealth addresses, ring signatures, and hidden transaction values remain central. Long-term predictions suggest growth toward $454 this year and possibly $1,500 or more by 2031. For those serious about anonymity, Monero is clearly among the top crypto gems to buy now. Binance Coin: Key Asset Behind the Biggest Exchange BNB, currently priced at $610.67, is showing solid progress. Its recent Kraken listing broadens access to a wider audience.

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

BNB was once overlooked, trading for pennies—until it soared and left many regretting they didn’t jump in sooner. That opportunity’s long gone. Now, in 2025, a new contender is drawing major attention: Qubetics ($TICS). This isn’t just another token riding a wave of hype—it’s built to solve real problems with tools that support global payments, cross-border work, and practical blockchain applications. Already crowned the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential, Qubetics is in presale mode and gaining serious momentum. For those who missed the BNB breakout, this might be the second chance they’ve been waiting for. Crypto’s Missed Jackpot: BNB’s Rise and the Lesson It Left Behind Crypto has always been about timing. Back in 2017, BNB was just a low-cost token linked to a new exchange. Nobody thought it would break records. But those who grabbed it early? They saw it climb from mere cents to over $600 at its peak. That kind of return isn’t just rare—it’s unforgettable. What made BNB so big was simple: use case and accessibility. It gave discounts, worked across Binance tools, and built hype. But today, the crypto crowd is more demanding. They want real-life use. They want something that’s not only tradable but useful outside exchanges. And that’s where the next big story begins—with Qubetics ($TICS), a fresh entry gaining traction fast and now crowned as the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential by analysts and crypto circles alike. Why Qubetics Isn’t Just Another Coin—It’s the Bridge to Real-Life Financial Freedom Unlike meme tokens or single-use cryptos, Qubetics is designed for function. It’s a toolkit for freelancers, remote workers, creators, and business owners who want to get paid fast and send money across borders without stress. And it’s doing that through smart tech like: A non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that puts control back in users’ hands Built-in support for cross-border transactions Smart routing that reduces wait times and fees That’s why it’s being called the Top Altcoin for Massive Return Potential in 2025. It’s not just crypto—it’s a business utility stack wrapped in blockchain. Here’s the current presale data: Stage: 33 Token Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511 million+ Holders: 25,800+ Funds Raised: $16.7 million+ Analysts are now projecting: $TICS at $1 = 334% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2071% ROI $TICS at $15 = 6414% ROI And there’s even buzz that $TICS could reach $10–$15 after mainnet launch. With applications this practical, the hype isn’t speculation—it’s demand. The Presale Pressure Is Building—But Time’s Running Out Stage 33 of the Qubetics crypto presale is almost sold out. At $0.2302, it’s still within reach—but not for long. Those watching it closely remember what missing BNB felt like. This feels oddly familiar.

Non-profit corporations and exchanges can now sell crypto in South Korea. Analysts think political interests are behind the new crypto guidelines. The South Korean Financial Services Commission has enacted a new set of guidelines, allowing the Asian country’s citizens to engage in cryptocurrency transactions. The latest development marks a landmark decision, setting June 2025 as the date when the new rules will kick in. According to reports, the Commission will allow non-profit corporations and virtual asset exchanges to sell digital assets. However, exchanges must structure their trading processes to minimize market impact when selling. In the meantime, the Commission will create a “Donation Review Committee” charged with supervising external audit corporations engaging in digital asset transactions.

The discussion draft, led by the House agricultural and financial services committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill, is an “incremental, albeit meaningful, rewrite” of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Paradigm’s vice president of regulatory affairs Justin Slaughter said in a May 5 X post. One-pager of the digital asset market structure discussion draft submitted by House Republicans on May 5. Source: US House Agriculture Committee One of the major changes from FIT21 is that the draft defines an affiliated person as anyone who owns more than 1% of a digital commodity issued by the project — down from 5% in the FIT21 bill — a move Slaughter said may curb the influence of big crypto firms and lead to more participation in the crypto market. “This is a portent of the entire bill. There are often criticisms of crypto being too dominated by a few large firms. This bill makes clear the regulatory regime proposed is going to push against that fact and strongly encourage more small-d ‘democratization’ of the space.” The draft also defines a “mature blockchain system” as one that, together with its related digital commodity, is not under the “common control” of any person or group. Source: Justin Slaughter The Securities and Exchange Commission would be the main authority regulating activity on crypto networks until they become sufficiently decentralized, Slaughter noted. The draft also clarified that decentralized finance trading protocols are those that enable users to engage in a financial transaction in a “self-directed manner.” Protocols that meet this criterion are exempt from registering as digital commodity brokers or dealers. The draft also referred to digital commodities as “investment contract assets” to distinguish their treatment from stocks and other traditional assets under the Howey test. According to Slaughter’s analysis, securities laws won’t be triggered unless the secondary sale of tokens also transfers ownership or profit in the underlying business. Crypto firms would also have a path to raise funds under the SEC’s oversight while also having a “clear process” to register their digital commodities with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the committee members said in a separate May 5 statement. Joint rulemaking, procedures, or guidelines related to crypto asset delisting must be established by the CFTC and SEC should a registered asset no longer comply with rules laid out by the regulators. A ‘clear opportunity’ to advance crypto innovation, rules once and for all Speaking about the need for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, the House committee members said crypto is a “clear opportunity” to advance innovation in the US — most notably through modernizing America’s financial infrastructure and reinforcing US dollar dominance. The Republicans criticized the previous Biden administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC for adopting a regulation-by-enforcement strategy rather than creating clear rules for market participants. Related: VanEck files for BNB ETF, first in US Many crypto firms were stuck in “legal limbo” as a result of the unclear rules, which pushed some industry players overseas, where clearer rules exist, the House committee members said. “America needs to be the powerhouse for digital asset investment and innovation. For that to happen, we need a commonsense regulatory regime,” said Dusty Johnson, chairman of the subcommittee on commodity markets, digital assets and rural development. Slaughter added: “This is the bill that will, finally, provide a clear regulatory regime on crypto that many have been calling for.” Republicans already facing roadblocks over discussion draft House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters plans to block a Republican-led event discussing digital assets on May 6, a Democratic staffer told Cointelegraph. The hearing, “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets,” is expected to discuss the new crypto markets draft discussion paper pitched by Thompson, Hill, and other committee members. However, according to the unnamed Democratic staffer, the current rules require all members of the House Financial Services Committee to agree on such hearings.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.5 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

On May 5, Tether minted another $1 billion Tether ( USDT ) on the Tron network, according to Arkham Intelligence. This brings the total USDT on Tron to $71.4 billion, according to the Tether Transparency report . In comparison, there is currently $72.8 billion USDT circulating on the Ethereum network, so just $1.4 billion more USDT on Tron will see it become the leading network for the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, as it has been previously over the last two years. Tron was ahead of Ethereum for USDT circulation between July 2022 and November 2024, but a large $18 billion mint on Ethereum pushed the network ahead again, according to CryptoQuant.

In a report in late April, the United States Treasury Department predicted that the stablecoin market could reach $2 trillion by 2028 if regulatory clarity is achieved. Stablecoin legislation nearing next vote It is widely believed that two key pieces of legislation need to be passed into law in the US to cement the position of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act sets out clear definitions for “payment stablecoins” and reserve rules for stablecoin issuers. Lawmakers in the US Senate will move forward with a vote on the GENIUS stablecoin bill before May 26, according to reports. Meanwhile, the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, which governs the approval and supervision of “federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers,” is also going through Congress. Tether is also planning to launch a US-based stablecoin later this year, with timing dependent on the passing of legislation.
