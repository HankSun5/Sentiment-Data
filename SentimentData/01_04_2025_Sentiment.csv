The price is currently hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band, indicating suppressed volatility and a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads around 38.56, suggesting that the asset is approaching oversold territory, though not quite there yet. The mid-Bollinger Band at approximately $0.03323 acts as dynamic resistance, which BRETT has struggled to breach. Without a decisive breakout above this level, upward momentum may remain limited. Unless volume or sentiment shifts significantly, the asset may continue range-bound movement or experience slight downside pressure. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of BRETT/USDT, the market is exhibiting signs of consolidation with limited momentum. The price remains close to the lower Bollinger Band, which reflects a lack of strong buying pressure. The MACD is currently flat, with the signal and MACD lines nearly overlapping around the zero line, suggesting indecision and a neutral momentum outlook. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power indicator hovers around the zero mark, indicating an even tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Without a breakout above $0.03341 resistance, BRETT is likely to remain in a tight range or drift slightly lower amid weak market conviction.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis‚Äôs critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT‚Äôs near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

We are proud to partner with @EricTrump and American Data Centers to launch @AmericanBTC .

The initiative follows Hut 8‚Äôs contribution of most of its ASIC miners to American Data Centers, Inc., which has since been renamed American Bitcoin. The transition reflects Hut 8‚Äôs broader restructuring to streamline its Bitcoin mining operations. American Bitcoin Mining to Absorb Hut 8 Operations Under the new agreement, American Bitcoin will assume all Bitcoin mining activities previously handled under Hut 8‚Äôs Compute segment. Hut 8, however, will remain central to operations by serving as the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner. This partnership is expected to support long-term revenue growth for Hut 8‚Äôs Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. ‚ÄúBy combining Hut 8‚Äôs proven operational excellence in data centers with our shared passion for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, we are poised to strengthen our foundation and drive significant future growth,‚Äù said Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin. Donald Trump Jr. added that while holding Bitcoin has value, mining it under favorable conditions offers a stronger growth opportunity. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot noted that creating American Bitcoin as a standalone entity allows the mining division to scale independently and attract investment. Meanwhile, Hut 8 can concentrate on its infrastructure services, creating a more predictable and financeable structure for both companies. Leadership and Operational Support The leadership team at American Bitcoin will include Mike Ho as Executive Chairman, Matt Prusak as CEO, and Eric Trump as Chief Strategy Officer. The Board of Directors will initially feature Mike Ho, Asher Genoot, Justin Mateen, and Michael Broukhim. As part of the agreement, Hut 8 will provide ASIC colocation and managed services to American Bitcoin, ensuring a smooth transition and continued operational excellence. ‚ÄúWhen the Trump family starts mining Bitcoin, you know the game has changed.

Frustrated with what it perceives as stonewalling, Coinbase has reactivated its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Let‚Äôs dive into why this legal battle is crucial for Coinbase, the crypto industry, and what it means for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Coinbase Reviving the FOIA Lawsuit? Coinbase initially filed this lawsuit to gain access to documents from the FDIC, believing these documents hold critical information relevant to the exchange‚Äôs operations and the broader regulatory landscape. The lawsuit was temporarily paused earlier this year when Travis Hill was appointed as Acting FDIC Chair, sparking hopes of a more cooperative approach. However, despite some initial improvements in communication, Coinbase feels that the FDIC is still not providing the level of FDIC Transparency required. According to a post by Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter, on X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase alleges that key documents are still being withheld, hindering their ability to fully understand the FDIC‚Äôs stance and actions. The Core Issue: Information Access and Regulatory Clarity At the heart of this legal tussle is the fundamental principle of information access . Coinbase, like any regulated entity, needs clarity and access to information from regulatory bodies like the FDIC to operate effectively and compliantly. Here‚Äôs why this is so vital: Compliance and Risk Management: Understanding the FDIC‚Äôs internal communications and policies is crucial for Coinbase to ensure it is meeting all regulatory requirements and managing risks appropriately. Opaque regulatory processes make compliance a guessing game. Industry Precedent: This case sets a precedent for how regulatory bodies interact with the cryptocurrency industry. If Coinbase succeeds in compelling the FDIC to be more transparent, it could pave the way for greater openness across the board, benefiting the entire crypto sector. Investor Confidence: Transparency from regulators builds investor confidence. Knowing that regulatory processes are open and accountable can encourage more institutional and retail investors to participate in the crypto market. Paul Grewal‚Äôs Stance: Insufficient Transparency Remains Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has been vocal about the need for greater transparency. While acknowledging some improved cooperation under the new FDIC leadership, Grewal stated that transparency remains ‚Äúinsufficient.‚Äù This suggests that while the FDIC may have made some efforts to engage with Coinbase, they haven‚Äôt gone far enough to satisfy the exchange‚Äôs concerns regarding access to vital information access . This isn‚Äôt just about Coinbase; it‚Äôs about the broader relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and financial regulators. The demand for transparency highlights a crucial tension point: how can innovative, rapidly evolving sectors like crypto navigate regulatory landscapes that are often perceived as opaque and slow-moving? What are the Potential Outcomes and Implications? The court‚Äôs decision on Coinbase‚Äôs motion to resume the FOIA lawsuit will have significant ramifications: Outcome Implications Court grants Coinbase‚Äôs motion FDIC will be compelled to respond to the lawsuit, potentially leading to the release of requested documents. This would be a win for Coinbase and potentially for transparency in crypto regulation . Court denies Coinbase‚Äôs motion Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to gain information through legal means will be thwarted, at least in the short term. This could signal continued challenges for crypto firms seeking regulatory clarity via FOIA requests. The Role of the Financial Watchdog: FDIC Under Scrutiny The FDIC, as a key financial watchdog , plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs financial system. Its actions, or lack thereof, are closely watched by the financial industry, including the burgeoning crypto sector. This lawsuit puts the spotlight on the FDIC‚Äôs approach to transparency and its engagement with innovative financial technologies. Is the FDIC being overly cautious, or is Coinbase asking for too much? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. Regulators must balance the need for confidentiality and operational integrity with the legitimate demands of regulated entities for clarity and FDIC Transparency . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What can the crypto community learn from this ongoing legal battle? Transparency is Non-Negotiable: Coinbase‚Äôs persistence underscores the importance of demanding transparency from regulatory bodies. It‚Äôs not just about individual company interests but about building a mature and trustworthy crypto ecosystem. Legal Avenues are Important: While dialogue and cooperation are ideal, legal avenues like FOIA can be vital tools to ensure accountability and access to information when necessary. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers and regulators to shape a more transparent and supportive regulatory environment for crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Fight for Transparency Continues Coinbase‚Äôs decision to restart its FOIA lawsuit against the FDIC is a clear signal that the fight for regulatory transparency in the crypto space is far from over. This case is not just about documents and legal procedures; it‚Äôs about fostering a more open, accountable, and ultimately, healthier relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and its regulators. As the FDIC prepares its response, the crypto world watches closely, hoping this renewed legal push will finally unlock the doors to greater information access and clarity.

If you‚Äôre deeply invested in the crypto world, you understand the importance of timely information. Imagine getting only the most crucial alerts without sifting through endless notifications. That‚Äôs precisely what Apple is delivering with its latest update. Apple Intelligence, the tech giant‚Äôs powerful suite of AI tools, is expanding its reach and introducing a game-changing feature: Priority Notifications. This update, rolling out with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, not only brings AI to more users in the EU but also refines how you manage your digital life. Let‚Äôs dive into what these updates mean for you and how they are set to redefine your Apple experience. What are Apple‚Äôs Revolutionary Priority Notifications? Tired of notification overload? We all are! In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, our devices are constantly buzzing with alerts, many of which are simply noise. Apple‚Äôs new Priority Notifications feature, powered by Apple Intelligence, is designed to cut through the clutter. It intelligently analyzes your notifications and highlights those deemed most urgent and time-sensitive. Think of it as your personal AI assistant for notifications, ensuring you never miss what truly matters. Here‚Äôs what makes Priority Notifications a potential game-changer: AI-Driven Filtering: Apple Intelligence algorithms learn your notification patterns to identify critical alerts. Enhanced Visibility: Important notifications are prominently displayed at the top of your notification stack in a new, distinct format, making them instantly noticeable. Reduced Digital Clutter: By prioritizing essential notifications, you can focus on what needs your immediate attention, minimizing distractions from less important updates. Improved Efficiency: Spend less time sifting through notifications and more time responding to what truly matters, whether it‚Äôs a critical crypto market alert or an urgent personal message. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who rely on their Apple devices for time-sensitive information and want to streamline their notification experience. For crypto enthusiasts, this could mean getting instant alerts about significant market movements or important wallet updates, right when they matter most. Expanding Horizons: Apple Intelligence Arrives in the EU with iOS 18.4 The wait is over for Apple users in the European Union! Apple Intelligence , initially unveiled at last year‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference, is now making its way to iPhones and iPads across the EU with the iOS 18.4 update. This expansion is a significant step, bringing a suite of AI-powered features to a wider audience. Previously, Apple cited EU tech regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, as a reason for the delayed rollout, originally slated for April 2025. However, Apple has managed to overcome these hurdles, delivering AI Features to EU users much sooner than anticipated. This move underscores Apple‚Äôs commitment to making its advanced AI capabilities globally accessible, despite regulatory complexities. EU users can now experience features like: Writing Tools: AI-powered assistance for writing and refining text across various apps. Image Playground: An app for generating fun and creative images using AI. Genmoji: Create personalized emojis using generative AI. Furthermore, Apple Intelligence is also extending its reach to Vision Pro users in U.S. English, bringing these powerful AI tools to Apple‚Äôs mixed reality platform. This means Vision Pro users can now leverage Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and more within their immersive experiences. Beyond Notifications: Other Exciting AI Features in iOS 18.4 The iOS 18.4 update is more than just Priority Notifications and EU expansion; it‚Äôs packed with other exciting AI Features designed to enhance your Apple experience. Let‚Äôs explore some of the notable additions: Memory Movies on Mac: Now you can create personalized ‚Äúmemory movies‚Äù on your Mac simply by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will automatically curate photos and videos based on your text input, generating a shareable movie. Sketch Style in Image Playground: Apple‚Äôs AI image generation app, Image Playground, gets a new ‚ÄúSketch‚Äù style. This allows you to create academic and detailed sketches, adding a new artistic dimension to your AI-generated images. Language Expansion: Apple Intelligence is now available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (Simplified). Localized English support has also been added for Singapore and India, making AI features more accessible to a global audience. Apple News+ Food: The recently announced recipe companion, Apple News+ Food, is also launching with this update, providing a new culinary resource within Apple News+. Revamped Apple Photos App: Expect further tweaks and improvements to the Apple Photos app, enhancing your photo management and editing experience. These updates demonstrate Apple‚Äôs ongoing commitment to refining and expanding its AI ecosystem, delivering tangible benefits to users across various aspects of their digital lives. Why is Apple Intelligence Rollout Gradual? You might be wondering why Apple is rolling out Apple Intelligence features in phases rather than all at once. The truth is, developing and deploying sophisticated AI features at scale is a complex undertaking. Apple‚Äôs approach reflects a commitment to quality and a measured introduction of new technologies. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the likely reasons for this gradual rollout: Reason Explanation Technological Complexity Generative AI and related features are cutting-edge technologies. Ensuring stability, accuracy, and user-friendliness requires rigorous testing and phased deployment. Infrastructure Scaling Supporting AI features for millions of users globally demands significant infrastructure. Gradual rollout allows Apple to scale its server capacity and optimize performance without overwhelming its systems. Feature Refinement By releasing features incrementally, Apple can gather user feedback and iterate on its AI models and functionalities. This iterative process helps improve the quality and relevance of AI features over time. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations, especially in regions like the EU with stringent data privacy laws, requires careful planning and phased implementation to ensure compliance and address any legal concerns. Apple‚Äôs deliberate approach ensures a smoother user experience and allows for continuous improvement of its AI offerings. While some users might prefer immediate access to all features, this phased rollout ultimately leads to a more robust and refined AI ecosystem. Embrace the Future of AI with iOS 18.4 The latest iOS 18.4 update marks a significant step forward in Apple‚Äôs AI journey. With the introduction of Priority Notifications and the expansion of Apple Intelligence to the EU, Apple is empowering users with smarter, more intuitive, and more efficient digital experiences. These updates are not just about adding features; they are about fundamentally changing how we interact with our devices, making technology work more seamlessly for us. As Apple continues to refine and expand its AI capabilities, we can expect even more groundbreaking innovations in the future.

Notably, the struggles have spared tech stocks, which continue to surge despite macro factors. According to Reuters , data provided by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that property prices, investments, and sales have resumed their downward trend following a brief period of stability. China‚Äôs government has actively intervened in the property market Property prices in China have been on a steady decline since 2021 after a government crackdown on developers caused a liquidity crisis, abandoned projects and wary buyers. Not much has changed since then, despite recent government intervention. The government has been active in trying to stabilize the property market, including it in its 2025 agenda. The government efforts seem to have paid off for about two months as the prices were relatively steady. However, recent data from the Chinese Real Estate Information Corp shows that the market has lost these small gains as new home sales have dipped. While the government is working to normalize house prices, there‚Äôs also the issue of price controls that are usually imposed by local governments. These dips are not only attributed to government actions, as demographic shifts, low demands causing a glut of unsold homes, and low disposable income due to stagnant incomes come into play. While analysts believe that government efforts will cause a positive change in the trends, other factors threaten that change from happening soon. U.S. tariffs add pressure To add to its economic woes, the U.S. introduced a 25% levy on Chinese auto imports, among other tariffs, piling more pressure on China. China has also retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on goods from the United States, further straining bilateral trade relations between the two nations. The Trump administration is expected to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs on April 2, adding more pressure to the Chinese economy. These have raised concerns about the impact of the tariffs on Chinese consumer behavior and its manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs tech surge fails to revive broader markets On the flip side, Chinese tech stocks have been on a trend Deepseek started earlier in the year. Despite the ongoing success of these Chinese tech stocks, it has had little or no growing effect on emerging markets. This is a divergence from the normal trend where the growth in Chinese stocks has a growing effect on the stocks of other emerging markets, which have remained relatively stagnant. The current rallying effect of the Chinese stock market isn‚Äôt felt in the entire Chinese market and its impact hasn‚Äôt really improved the economy, with analysts attributing its rise to the current frenzy surrounding tech, especially artificial intelligence. According to analysts from UBS Group AG in London, the current tech boom isn‚Äôt the same as the typical Chinese boom that occurred in 2009, 2016, and 2020 and impacted emerging markets. It‚Äôs reported that since August 2024, the MSCI China Index has risen by over 30%, while the same cannot be said for emerging markets, which have fallen by 7% since then. Historically, strong growth in Chinese stocks has had a growth effect on other emerging markets. A historical example will be between 2009 and 2010, where a 63% rise in Chinese shares saw a 100% rise in emerging market shares. A similar trend is seen between 2016 and 2017, where Chinese stocks rose by 50% and the emerging markets broad gauge rose by 46%. Prior to the tech-induced boost caused by the launch of the AI model Deepseek, Chinese stocks last saw a slight surge in September 2024, thanks to the Chinese government‚Äôs overall economic stimulus. According to investment analysts, China‚Äôs new trend of outperforming its emerging markets may last longer than expected or desired. They also expressed concerns over the effects U.S. tariffs have on the Chinese stock market. Uncertain outlook for China‚Äôs economy While there are concerns about the impact of these tariffs on consumer behavior in various sectors, such as housing, investors outside of China are also taking a hint, and it could potentially affect the growth of the Chinese stock market negatively and mean more losses for emerging markets. Insights shared by Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, point out that some funds are expressing little confidence in Chinese stocks making a quick comeback and are already doing away with their Chinese holdings. While local experts point out that the Chinese market will experience some form of growth aided by government intervention, they also indicate that the growth curve won‚Äôt be steep. How these predictions play out is left to be seen as the available data looks bleak currently, given the U.S. tariffs and more impending tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

If you were eagerly anticipating the full potential of Alexa+, Amazon‚Äôs premium AI assistant, you might need to temper your excitement. While Amazon has launched Alexa+, reports are surfacing that many of the hyped, game-changing Alexa Plus Features are nowhere to be found, at least not yet. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs going on with this much-anticipated upgrade and why the rollout is hitting some unexpected snags. What‚Äôs the Buzz About Alexa Plus Features? Amazon promised a revolutionary upgrade with Alexa+, showcasing impressive capabilities at a recent press event. We were teased with glimpses of an AI assistant that could truly understand and anticipate our needs, performing what are termed ‚Äúagentic AI tasks.‚Äù Think seamless interactions like: Ordering your favorite takeout from Grubhub with just a voice command. Generating imaginative stories to keep kids entertained for hours. Recognizing household members and prompting them about their chores. Brainstorming the perfect gift ideas for any occasion. Even ordering an Uber and getting personalized cooking recommendations. These Amazon AI Assistant functionalities painted a picture of a truly intelligent and helpful home companion, far beyond the basic Alexa we know. The anticipation was palpable, especially for those invested in creating a fully integrated smart home ecosystem. The Disappointing Reality: Delayed Alexa Features However, the initial launch of Alexa+ tells a different story. According to reports, many of these showcased Alexa Plus Features are conspicuously absent. Users who upgraded expecting a fully realized AI assistant are finding themselves with a service that feels‚Ä¶incomplete. Key functionalities like Grubhub ordering, story generation, visual person identification for chore reminders, and gift idea brainstorming are simply not available yet. It‚Äôs like ordering a fully loaded car and finding out it‚Äôs missing the navigation system and sunroof. Furthermore, some features, such as Uber ordering and cooking recommendations, are only available to a select group of users, making the rollout feel fragmented and inconsistent. The promised web app for Alexa+, which was announced with fanfare just last month, also lacks a firm release date, adding to the uncertainty. Why Are Key Smart Home AI Features Delayed? The culprit behind these Delayed Alexa Features seems to be the complex AI infrastructure underpinning Alexa+. Reports suggest that the development process has been plagued with challenges from the outset. Building an AI capable of handling the sophisticated ‚Äúagentic‚Äù tasks Amazon envisions is no small feat. It requires robust and reliable systems that can handle natural language processing, contextual understanding, and seamless integration with various services. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the potential challenges: AI Infrastructure Complexity: Developing the AI models and systems to power these advanced features is inherently complex and time-consuming.

Scalability Issues: Rolling out these features to millions of users requires a scalable infrastructure that can handle the increased demand and data processing. What Does This Mean for Smart Home Enthusiasts? For those invested in Smart Home AI and eagerly awaiting the next leap in voice assistant technology, this delay is undoubtedly disappointing. It highlights the gap between marketing hype and the realities of developing cutting-edge AI. While Alexa+ still holds promise, the initial rollout serves as a reminder that revolutionary technology often comes with unforeseen challenges and delays. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that this is just the beginning. Amazon has committed to delivering these advanced features, and the current situation appears to be a temporary setback rather than a complete derailment. As AI technology continues to evolve rapidly, we can expect to see these capabilities gradually rolled out in the coming months. Actionable Insights: Managing Expectations and Future Outlook Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights as we navigate this evolving landscape: Manage Expectations: Don‚Äôt expect all promised Alexa+ features to be available immediately. Temper your expectations and anticipate a phased rollout. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on tech news and official Amazon announcements for updates on feature releases and timelines. Provide Feedback: If you are an early Alexa+ adopter, provide feedback to Amazon about your experience and feature requests. This can help shape future development. Patience is Key: Developing advanced AI is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience will be crucial as these sophisticated features are refined and rolled out. Conclusion: The Future of Alexa+ and Smart Home AI Remains Bright While the initial launch of Alexa+ may not have delivered all the promised bells and whistles, the underlying potential of Amazon AI Assistant and the future of Smart Home AI remains incredibly exciting.

Analyst Reveals His Buy Zone Strategy",https://cryptonews.com/news/eth-drops-near-1500-eyes-1200-support-zone/,"ETH fell by 1.1% in the past 24 hours, sliding to just above $1,800 as analysts suggested the recent rally may have been a dead-cat bounce. Among the top five cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has posted the steepest losses in 2025, down 45.4% year-to-date. The network‚Äôs struggle to remain competitive has pressured the price of its native asset, with rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) offering lower fees and faster execution speeds. ETH Nears Critical $1,500 Support After Major Downtrend Crypto trader Big Cheds, who has more than 300,000 followers on X, pointed to the $1,200 level as a critical support and potential buy zone for ETH if the current downtrend continues. $ETH now $1840 from $3400 below. Prob worth a sniff when it tags $1200-$1300 range https://t.co/NARqJWgxS6 pic.twitter.com/w076n9xLIe ‚Äî Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) March 30, 2025 He noted that a bounce from this level could lead to a mid-term rally toward the $3,400 range, translating to a 283% gain. Looking at the weekly chart, ETH has been in a prolonged downtrend since it failed to break above $4,000 for the third time. This triple top pattern reflected investor hesitation in pushing valuations higher amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Despite these challenges, some technical levels have held firm. The $1,500 support zone has previously acted as a launching point for strong recoveries. ETH rebounded by 41% and 149% the last two times it touched this level, with each move resulting in a higher high. If a similar reaction occurs again, the price could target the $5,000 mark, which would represent a 221% increase. Can ETH Bounce Back or Is $1,200 the Next Stop? Whether ETH will hold its footing at $1,500 or continue slipping remains to be seen. A sustained drop below that level could send the price toward $1,200, and potentially as low as $900, implying a total downside risk of around 42% from current levels. Traders and long-term holders alike will be watching closely to see how ETH reacts to this zone. A strong bounce could reignite interest, while a bearish breakdown might confirm further downside in the short term. Once cryptos regain their strength and the bullish cycle resumes, storing these digital assets safely will be a key priority to investors.

The AI world is buzzing with a potentially seismic shift. OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking GPT models, has hinted at releasing a new ‚Äúopen‚Äù language model. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì ‚Äúopen‚Äù! This news is electrifying for those in the crypto space who understand the power of decentralization and open access. Could this be a game-changer for how generative AI is developed and utilized? Let‚Äôs dive into what this announcement means and why it‚Äôs creating waves. Why is an OpenAI Open Language Model a Big Deal? For years, OpenAI has been known for its cutting-edge, yet largely closed-source, AI models. Think of models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 ‚Äì incredibly powerful, but access is controlled and the underlying code isn‚Äôt freely available. This contrasts sharply with the ethos of the crypto world, which champions transparency and open-source development. However, it seems the winds are changing. OpenAI is signaling a move towards a more open approach, reminiscent of their earlier days with GPT-2 . But why now? Let‚Äôs break it down: Competitive Pressure: Companies like DeepSeek and Meta (with their Llama models) have gained significant traction by adopting an open source AI strategy. Meta‚Äôs Llama models, for instance, have seen over a billion downloads! This success likely hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by OpenAI. Community Demand: The AI research and development community has been vocal about the need for more open and accessible AI models . OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form directly addresses this, asking developers and researchers what they want to see in an open model.

This suggests it won‚Äôt be a basic model but will possess a degree of sophistication. Preparedness Framework: OpenAI emphasizes that this model, like all others, will undergo rigorous evaluation before release. However, they acknowledge the unique nature of an open-source model, anticipating modifications and adaptations post-release. Focus on Utility: OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form and statements highlight a desire to make this model as ‚Äúuseful as possible‚Äù for developers, researchers, and even large organizations. They envision scenarios where companies and governments might prefer to run models themselves, rather than relying solely on API access. The Benefits of Open Source AI: A Crypto Perspective For the crypto community, the move towards open source AI resonates deeply. Here‚Äôs why: Benefit Explanation Transparency & Trust Open source code allows for public scrutiny, fostering greater trust and transparency in AI development. This aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. Innovation & Collaboration Open models encourage wider experimentation and collaboration. Just as open-source blockchain projects have thrived, open AI can spur rapid innovation through community contributions. Decentralization Potential Open source AI can contribute to a more decentralized AI landscape, reducing the concentration of power in a few large tech companies. This mirrors the crypto vision of decentralizing control. Accessibility & Democratization Open models lower the barrier to entry for AI development, making powerful tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers globally. Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of an OpenAI open language model is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Responsible Use: Open models can be used for malicious purposes. OpenAI will need to carefully consider safety and ethical implications, especially given the potential for modification post-release. Resource Intensity: Developing and maintaining powerful open models requires significant resources. OpenAI needs a sustainable strategy for this endeavor. Balancing Openness with Business Interests: OpenAI is a for-profit company. Finding the right balance between open sourcing and protecting their competitive advantage will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you‚Äôre a crypto developer, investor, or simply an AI enthusiast, here‚Äôs how you can engage with this development: Participate in OpenAI‚Äôs Feedback Process: If you have ideas or insights on what you‚Äôd like to see in an open model, fill out OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form.

The analyst, reviewing the 4-hour candlestick chart, pointed to extremely oversold RSI levels as a basis for this outlook. Although a bounce appears to be the more probable outcome, there is still a 30 to 40% chance of a short-term drop into deeper support territory. Dogecoin RSI Dips Below 10 On 4-Hour Chart To Possibly Extend Decline The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis indicator used to measure an asset‚Äôs momentum. When above 70, the asset is considered overbought, meaning it might be due for a price correction or pullback. On the other hand, readings below 30 are considered oversold, meaning that the asset might be undervalued and could bounce upward soon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Turns Bullish With 1-Day RSI In Oversold Region, Why DOGE Can Reach $0.9 In the case of Dogecoin, the meme coin has been under intense selling pressure since the beginning of March. This selling pressure has seen it lose most of its price gains in late 2024 and break below notable support pressure. This, in turn, has seen the RSI fall towards the oversold levels across multiple timeframes. According to the technical overview, the Relative Strength Index on the 1-hour timeframe is between 25 and 27, signaling strong oversold conditions. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped even lower, falling beneath 10, which typically indicates an asset is due for a corrective bounce. The daily RSI is currently hovering around 32 to 33, still above the oversold zone but trending downward. These readings suggest that while bearish pressure is present, the setup of a bounce from oversold levels increasingly favors a rebound as buyers look to re-enter near support. Analyst Sees Bounce Toward $0.172‚Äì$0.175 As More Probable Outcome According to the analyst, the break of the RSI below the oversold levels points to a decline toward the $0.1580 and $0.1590 support region. Despite the possibility of a decline toward the $0.1580 to $0.1590 support region, the analyst noted a higher probability (around 60 to 70%) of a near-term bounce after hitting this support region, possibly targeting the $0.172 to $0.175 range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Stages Bounce From Lower Border Of Second Falling Wedge, New Targets Unlocked? The projection hinges on Dogecoin‚Äôs possible reaction to such a deeply oversold RSI level. The analyst emphasized that this is an assumption rather than financial advice, but the technical context supports the likelihood of a relief rally if the support holds. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1649, down by 3.6% in the past 24 hours. With both downside and upside scenarios laid out, short-term Dogecoin price action now depends on how the market reacts at the current $0.165 level. A move toward $0.172 or higher could unfold quickly if buyers step in right now. However, if selling continues, Dogecoin might continue its decline throughout the week before attempting a recovery.

The crypto market never sleeps, and right now, Qubetics ($TICS), Bittensor (TAO), and Tron (TRX) are making headlines with major developments. Bittensor is transforming artificial intelligence by decentralizing machine learning models, while Tron is pushing deeper into decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. Both projects are gaining momentum, making them key contenders in the market. But Qubetics is the one stealing the spotlight. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs solving one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems‚Äîbridging fragmented blockchain ecosystems. More importantly, its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace is unlocking new ways for people and businesses to trade real-world assets on-chain. With its presale already surpassing millions, Qubetics is gaining serious traction, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in today . Qubetics: The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization The world is filled with valuable assets‚Äîreal estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property‚Äîyet most remain inaccessible to everyday people due to high entry barriers and liquidity issues. Qubetics is changing that through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which converts these physical assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or used as collateral on the blockchain. A real estate owner, for example, can tokenize a luxury apartment, allowing people across the globe to own fractional shares. No need for hefty down payments or complex legal paperwork‚Äîjust direct access to real estate ownership through blockchain technology. The same applies to high-value assets like gold, oil, patents, and even rare collectibles, making Qubetics a game-changer in asset digitization. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, meaning it unifies multiple blockchains, eliminating the headache of cross-chain compatibility. Whether someone holds Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche assets, Qubetics allows seamless transactions across chains. For businesses, this means borderless commerce without limitations. With regulatory discussions heating up around RWA tokenization, analysts predict Qubetics is at the forefront of a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Presale: A Rare Opportunity The Qubetics presale is making waves for all the right reasons. Unlike many projects that drag on for months, Qubetics has a strict 7-day stage system, with each stage ending every Sunday at 12 AM. At the close of every stage, the price automatically increases by 10%, rewarding early buyers. Currently in its 28th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.1430, with over 504 million tokens sold and a presale tally surpassing $15.5 million. More than 23,900 token holders have already secured their share, making Qubetics one of the best crypto presales right now.To put this into perspective, a $2,500 purchase at the current price secures around 17,475 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that‚Äôs $17,475 in value. With mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, the Qubetics presale is shaping up to be a limited-time opportunity before the next price jump. No wonder it‚Äôs on the radar as one of the top cryptos to invest in today.

Per a report from the Russian newspaper Kommersant , the ban would apply only in the southern part of the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk, but could run until mid-2031. Irkutsk Mining Ban Incoming? Miners in southern Irkutsk have already been ordered to shut down their rigs in the winter months until 2031. Inside a crypto mining data center in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: GetBailkal/YouTube/Screenshot) But many miners have remained in the area on the understanding that they can operate unimpeded in warmer months. However, top officials warned earlier this year that the existing ban was not doing enough to ease pressure on local power grids. Kommersant, a media outlet known to enjoy good relations with the Kremlin, said its sources had revealed the Russian government ‚Äúmay impose a total ban on mining in the southern part of the Irkutsk region as early as April 1.‚Äù As Russia‚Äôs first BTC mining hub, southern Irkutsk is home to several large mining centers, which collectively consume around 650 MW of power. A total ban would be highly problematic to these centers, industry insiders told the newspaper. They added that ‚Äúin the event of a ban,‚Äù they would be powerless to act ‚Äúdue to difficulties connecting to networks in other regions.‚Äù Many nearby regions have also imposed wintertime crypto mining bans, a fact that could leave miners with no choice other than to relocate.

(Source: AIST TV/YouTube/Screenshot) The media outlet noted that neither the Ministry of Energy nor the offices of the Governor of the Irkutsk Oblast responded to its request for official comment. However, the outlet reported that President Vladimir Putin had replied that he had agreed to ‚Äúconsider and support‚Äù Kobzev‚Äôs request ‚Äúin the interests of the region.‚Äù The newspaper claimed its (anonymous) sources said the matter was discussed at a government-led power industry summit in Moscow on March 27. ‚ÄúBased on the results of the meeting, [the government] will likely decide to grant the [governor‚Äôs request],‚Äù Kommersant‚Äôs ‚Äúsources‚Äù claimed.

(Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) North of Region to Escape Ban? Kobzev has previously claimed that his plans would leave industrial miners in the north of the oblast free to continue with their work. But Kobzev has claimed that power shortages in southern Irkutsk are now becoming critical. He stated that ‚Äúover the past five years,‚Äù energy consumption in the Irkutsk region has ‚Äúgrown by 28%‚Äù The governor blamed mining for contributing to an energy deficit in the region. He said that the deficit could grow to 2.9 GW by 2030 if no action were taken. The entirety of Siberia has become a hub for Russian crypto miners due to its low electricity prices and famously long and cold winters. Officials think that total mining load in the region now stands at 1.066 GW, with miners in the north using 419 MW and southern miners using 647 MW. Legal, industrial miners account for the vast majority (84%) of the energy usage. Kobzev said that mining firms have already obtained permission to bring another 1.272 GW of capacity online in the area.

Kobzev also claimed that small-scale, quasi-legal crypto miners are also causing a drain on the local grid. He stated that ‚Äúcommercial consumers operating at low voltages‚Äù were using over 160 MW of power per month.

The media outlet wrote that commercial and industrial consumers typically pay prices of around 5 rubles ($0.059) per kWh.

On Sunday, Musk said he believed his role in DOGE was affecting Tesla‚Äôs share price. He spoke about the matter during a town hall event in Wisconsin, where he has been campaigning in the state‚Äôs supreme court election.¬†According to Musk, those who oppose his efforts to slash government jobs under President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration have tried to pressure him by going after Tesla. Musk speaking at a Town Hall event in Wisconsin. Source: Fox 9 ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ‚Ä¶ stop doing this,‚Äù Musk said, referring to his work with the Trump White House. ‚ÄúMy Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it‚Äôs a big deal.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs share price was already down 35.83% for the year before Monday‚Äôs market opening, which means that the stock has nearly been cut in half compared to its peak in December. Shares slid another 1.7% on Monday. Despite this downturn, Musk offered some hope for shareholders, calling the price drop a possible ‚Äúbuying opportunity‚Äù for people who believe in the company‚Äôs long-term prospects. Tesla stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Musk was in Wisconsin to support a conservative candidate in a closely watched supreme court election. He has contributed more than $12 million on the campaign, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at a rally on Sunday for signing a petition against what he described as ‚Äúactivist judges.‚Äù Though Musk‚Äôs political influence has come into the spotlight recently, signs of trouble at Tesla had already begun to appear. The electric car maker‚Äôs vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary figures suggest sales continue to slump this year in key markets like Europe. Other car manufacturers in the U.S. have also stumbled amid warnings about rising tariffs on imported goods. Potential trade conflicts could disrupt a tightly woven network of parts suppliers spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, causing more problems for an industry still recovering from past supply chain challenges. Tesla‚Äôs troubles, then, may be part of a broader challenge facing American automakers. Yet many see the Tesla case as unique because of Musk‚Äôs sudden shift into high-profile politics. Since the Trump administration began in January, Musk has become a familiar face around the White House. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024, regularly offers opinions on political matters through his social media company X, and now holds a top seat in DOGE. For critics, this raises concerns about where Musk‚Äôs focus lies: on running an electric vehicle firm or serving as a powerful government insider. Protestors swarmed Tesla‚Äôs showrooms on the weekend Protests escalated on Saturday as anti-Musk activists swarmed Tesla showrooms and service centers. They called it the ‚ÄúTesla Takedown.‚Äù According to the protestors, the goal was to oppose Musk‚Äôs political activities and his efforts to slash government spending under Trump. Musk has already gained access to the highly sensitive information of federal employees. Consequently, more than 277 Tesla locations across the country saw some form of demonstration, though the size of the crowd varied by city. In states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, turnouts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred. People held signs reading, ‚ÄúHonk if you hate Elon‚Äù and ‚ÄúFight the billionaire broligarchy.‚Äù In Texas, Musk‚Äôs home state, and in Minnesota, Maryland, and other parts of the country, similar protests took place. Social media images showed picketers standing in front of Tesla showrooms, chanting slogans and waving banners. A protestor outside a Tesla store in Texas. Source: CBS Texas A small but visible group of counterprotesters also gathered at some locations, voicing support for President Trump and, by extension, Musk. In Dublin, California, across from a showroom where dozens of activists chanted, a few Trump supporters waved American flags. A bigger protest was observed near Berkeley, where participants claimed that Musk‚Äôs ties to the administration were pushing the country in a dangerous direction. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a fascist state,‚Äù said a retired high school teacher at the Berkeley demonstration. ‚ÄúWe need to stop this or we‚Äôll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.‚Äù Protesters should up with various signs calling Elon a ‚ÄúFascist.‚Äù Source: ABC News Outside the U.S., anti-Musk sentiment is also growing. Protesters gathered at more than 230 Tesla sites worldwide, including in European cities like London. Though the crowds there were smaller, the messages were similar. Signs compared Musk to Adolf Hitler and accused him of using a straight-arm salute after Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The protest in London drew a handful of Americans living abroad who felt compelled to speak out. One participant in London held a sign labeling Tesla cars as ‚ÄúSwasticars,‚Äù a jarring reference to Nazi Germany. ‚ÄúWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we‚Äôre facing,‚Äù said one of the protesters, describing Musk‚Äôs alliance with the Trump White House as a risk for democracy. The Tesla Takedown movement was organized by a coalition that includes people who once owned Tesla vehicles, public figures like actor John Cusack, and some Democratic lawmakers. Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas said on a recent organizing call that she would keep ‚Äúscreaming in the halls of Congress‚Äù to highlight Musk‚Äôs actions. On Saturday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal appeared at a protest in Seattle, describing Musk‚Äôs role in DOGE as a ‚Äúdangerous mixing of corporate power and government access.‚Äù A mother showed up to my recent town hall, crying because she was worried about being able to access health care for her new baby.

Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) March 31, 2025 Some individuals have reportedly set Tesla vehicles on fire, an act that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has condemned as domestic terrorism. Musk, for his part, has labeled those committing these crimes as ‚Äúpsychos‚Äù and asked them to stop. Authorities in Germany are investigating a blaze that destroyed seven Tesla cars early Saturday, though it was unclear if it was connected to the broader protests. In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police said a black pickup side mirror struck two people at a demonstration outside a Tesla service center. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries, and officials quickly identified the suspect. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Investor demand is skyrocketing, with Phase 6 of its presale already 90% sold out . XRP Stuck at $2.13 After Legal Clarity Ripple Labs‚Äô SEC settlement on March 25, 2025, initially sparked optimism, but XRP has struggled to maintain bullish momentum.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: $4.5M Raised as Investors Rush In Amid Ripple‚Äôs subdued market performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a compelling alternative for crypto investors seeking significant returns. MAGACOIN has already raised over $4,500,000 from enthusiastic investors during its ongoing presale. Investor demand has been exceptional, with Phase 6 now 90% sold out .

Why MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs $1 Milestone Matters Achieving the $1 milestone would firmly establish MAGACOIN FINANCE as a major cryptocurrency player, validating the project‚Äôs fundamentals and sparking further investor enthusiasm. Analysts predict that crossing the $1 threshold could trigger a wave of increased market demand, driving the price even higher. Given XRP‚Äôs limited upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs clear path to rapid growth presents investors with a compelling alternative. Its presale success‚Äîraising over $4.5 million already‚Äîis proof of robust market confidence. Ripple (XRP) vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investor Demand Speaks Volumes The stark contrast between XRP‚Äôs stagnant price action and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs surging presale illustrates where investor confidence is shifting. XRP‚Äôs uncertain market outlook, compounded by its inability to rally significantly post-settlement, contrasts sharply with the bullish sentiment surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE.

With more than 15,000 transactions processed daily and over 200 nodes participating, BlockDAG rigorously tests its infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet debut in 2025. While other projects focus on market dynamics, BlockDAG is setting the standard for technological preparedness. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Token Burn Soars Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a remarkable increase in its token burn rate, with more than 1 billion tokens eliminated from circulation in just one day‚Äîa 57,000% rise. This increase mainly came from a single entity sending 1 billion SHIB to an unrecoverable address. Despite this intense burn rate, SHIB‚Äôs market price has stayed stable, trading around $0.00001443, which is a 55% drop from its peak this year. Technical analysis shows a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, indicating a possible bullish trend. This pattern might push the price up by about 130%, aiming for $0.00003395. Furthermore, Shibarium, Shiba Inu‚Äôs Layer-2 solution, is nearing a total of 1 billion transactions, showing increased use and activity. The network has already handled nearly 975 million transactions, supports over 245,000 accounts, and has generated more than 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Aims for $20 Amid Positive Trends Chainlink‚Äôs token, LINK, is currently on an upward trajectory after exiting a downward channel that started in February 2025. LINK now stabilizes at $15.15, with aspirations to break the $20 barrier soon. The recent upturn has pushed LINK above the 200 EMA, setting it on a path toward $19.30, with the $20 level being a key target for market participants. Supporting this positive trend, on-chain data shows that LINK‚Äôs social engagement is at a peak, hinting at increased interest from the market. Moreover, a spike in development activities since early March 2025 and a decrease in LINK available on exchanges suggest that major holders are accumulating, pointing to optimistic forecasts for LINK‚Äôs market performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet‚Äôs Final Stages Before 2025 Mainnet As it gears up for its 2025 mainnet release, BlockDAG has reached a crucial stage with its Beta ‚ÄúPrimordial‚Äù Testnet. This phase isn‚Äôt just for show but a thorough evaluation of the network‚Äôs systems to ensure they meet essential performance and security standards when they go live. The testnet mimics peak load conditions to check how the system handles stress. BlockDAG aims to process at least 15,000 transactions daily and maintain over 200 active mining nodes to test its scalability and decentralized nature. Additionally, the testnet scrutinizes wallet functionality, ensuring smooth integration with MetaMask and effective operation across various platforms. Developers are putting smart contracts to work, dApps are being utilized by users, and the token vesting process is being tested with over 110,000 accounts. The insights and data collected now are vital for making any necessary adjustments before the final launch. The project is also building momentum with $209.5 million secured in its presale, 19 billion coins distributed, and an ROI of 2,380% since the first batch. With coins now priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is demonstrating the robustness of its infrastructure as it prepares for launch. In essence, the testnet serves as a comprehensive rehearsal for the mainnet, allowing both users and developers to anticipate the actual launch experience. For BlockDAG, this is the ultimate preparation for making the launch a reality. Shaping Future Viability Through Real-Time Testing While market movements and investor interest can generate short-term momentum, the longevity of a technology comes from its ability to perform reliably under real-world conditions. Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent token burn and Chainlink‚Äôs positive market trends have captured the market‚Äôs interest, relying heavily on speculative responses. In contrast, BlockDAG is rigorously validating its infrastructure with its ongoing Beta Testnet. It‚Äôs processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging numerous miners, and seamlessly integrating smart contracts and wallet functionality. While other projects speculate on potential outcomes, BlockDAG is gathering concrete evidence on what actually works. The focus is on tangible results, distinguishing it from projects driven by market speculation.

XRP‚Äôs price has soared following a regulatory victory as Ripple concludes its prolonged legal conflict with the SEC, while Solana‚Äôs collaboration with Polymarket has fueled talks of its price reaching $1,000. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG‚Äôs Beta Testnet has been diligently crafting a robust framework with its dependable support system and developer-oriented design. In contrast to the fluctuating paths of other ventures, BlockDAG (BDAG) consistently prioritizes stability and support for developers, distinguishing it in the field. XRP‚Äôs Price Boost: Regulatory Progress XRP, tied to Ripple Labs, has seen a significant price rise, jumping more than 8% recently. This increase follows the announcement by Ripple‚Äôs CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC has concluded its lawsuit initiated four years ago against the firm. This legal battle, started in 2020, challenged Ripple over raising $1.4 billion via unregistered XRP sales. Its resolution mirrors a regulatory evolution under the current government, which appears more open to cryptocurrencies. For example, the SEC has also dismissed actions against other cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase and Robinhood. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)‚Äôs approval of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, is poised to boost XRP‚Äôs role in international transactions. These developments have thus reinforced confidence, driving up XRP‚Äôs price. Polymarket Boosts Solana‚Äôs Momentum Polymarket‚Äôs recent decision to accept Solana (SOL) deposits has energized the cryptocurrency community. Users can now transfer SOL directly to their prediction market wallets, extending Polymarket‚Äôs reach and increasing its platform activity. Following this news, SOL‚Äôs price quickly rose by 7% to $140, with a significant 143% jump in daily trading volumes hitting $4.18 billion. This enthusiasm has sparked debates about SOL‚Äôs potential climb to the $1,000 threshold. Moreover, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently apologized for a controversial ad, affirming the project‚Äôs commitment to community involvement. These actions collectively highlight Solana‚Äôs growing market presence and the community‚Äôs faith in its future direction. Constant Support: BlockDAG‚Äôs Commitment During Beta Testnet BlockDAG‚Äôs dedication to user satisfaction and operational dependability is evident in its extensive support system. As the Beta Testnet phase progresses, users, developers, and miners benefit from continuous technical support through the Freshdesk platform. The 24/7 Antier 1st Level Support Desk effectively manages queries, quickly resolving them or forwarding complex issues to the specialized BlockDAG support team. For more complicated technical problems, Antier developers are prepared to intervene, ensuring the testing process runs smoothly with little interruption. This proactive and comprehensive support structure is crucial during the Beta Testnet phase, where network stability and smooth integration are key. BlockDAG‚Äôs approachable and responsive support line builds user trust and promotes greater engagement from developers and miners. This strategy supports the project‚Äôs goals of stability, scalability, and prompt issue resolution. Financially, BlockDAG‚Äôs notable crypto presale success has established a strong foundation for its future. The project has amassed an impressive $209.5 million during the presale, with the current batch at number 27 and a batch price of $0.0248. The ROI since the first batch has reached a remarkable 2,380%, illustrating the project‚Äôs quick momentum and increasing community support. To date, over 19 billion coins have been purchased, underscoring the widespread enthusiasm and confidence in BlockDAG‚Äôs future potential. Building a Strong Base Amid Market Shifts While XRP and Solana are in the spotlight with regulatory victories and strategic partnerships, BlockDAG is establishing a foundation for sustained success with practical and dependable initiatives. Its Beta Testnet focuses on more than just market speculation, emphasizing stability, developer involvement, and strong support. In contrast to projects that fluctuate with market conditions, BlockDAG emphasizes steady performance and community trust. The network‚Äôs round-the-clock technical support and Antier developers‚Äô expertise reflect a commitment to reducing disruptions and enhancing the experience for all participants.

Coinbase And Others Face Increased Volatility According to Bloomberg, Coinbase‚Äôs stock has dropped more than 30% since the beginning of the quarter, marking its worst performance since the collapse of the FTX exchange in late 2022. This decline is reflective of a broader trend affecting nearly all major crypto-linked stocks, including companies like Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY.TO), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The cryptocurrency market itself is experiencing turmoil, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling over 20% from its all-time high and Ethereum (ETH) plummeting more than 45% in value. These shifts come amid President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalation of a ‚Äúglobal trade war,‚Äù which has stirred fears about the health of the country‚Äôs economy. Economic data has exacerbated these concerns, pushing the S&P 500 Index (GSPC) toward its worst quarter since mid-2022. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau noted that many within the cryptocurrency community recognize that the current market conditions are not primarily driven by fundamental factors. Instead, Lau emphasized that macroeconomic issues‚Äîsuch as tariffs and the potential trade war‚Äîare influencing investor sentiment significantly. The looming threat of a recession has reportedly added to the unease, causing higher-risk crypto-linked stocks to be even more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Lau explains that investments in companies like Coinbase carry additional risks, including the potential for bankruptcy, allegedly making them particularly susceptible to swift sell-offs. Cryptocurrency Market Struggles To Rebound The current state of the cryptocurrency market is a stark contrast to the optimism that prevailed at the start of the year, following Trump‚Äôs election. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $109,000 on Inauguration Day. Earlier this month, Bitcoin prices fell after Trump announced a strategic reserve for the market‚Äôs leading crypto, but did not allocate taxpayer funds to expand it. As of now, Bitcoin trades around $83,000, still above pre-election levels but far from its peak. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key While shares of various crypto-related companies surged following the election, Coinbase and crypto miners have since relinquished those gains. Notably, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy (MSTR) is among the few stocks in the sector that has managed to remain in positive territory since November 5. Despite the downturn, the cryptocurrency industry continues to gain influence in Washington and is moving closer to integration with traditional financial systems. However, this growing power has yet to translate into a market rebound. Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, expressed skepticism about the current state of investor sentiment, stating, ‚ÄúWhat we saw a couple of months ago, I don‚Äôt know how much crazier it can get than that. I think we‚Äôre going to have to be looking for new catalysts.‚Äù Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|coin|COIN stocks|coinbase|coinbase news|crypto|Crypto Exchange Coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-01 00:00:40

Over the past weeks, since he vowed to turn Poland into a crypto haven, S≈Çawomir Mentzen has moved closer to participating in a likely run-off in June. The nationalist candidate is most popular among young Poles who often flock to his rallies. Observers say this is largely due to his quite active presence on social media. Mentzen has been also attracting followers with a program that draws inspiration from U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political messages. Mentzen approaches run-off territory in recent Polish polls Polish voters will be going to the ballot boxes on May 18 to elect their new president this year. The incumbent, Andrzej Duda, is nearing the end of his second and last five-year term in office and won‚Äôt be able to run again under the country‚Äôs constitution. While none of the leading candidates is expected to win in the first round, Warsaw mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, nominated by Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs center-right, liberal-conservative Civic Platform (PO) party is the clear front-runner. Second in opinion polls is historian Karol Nawrocki, head of the Institute of National Remembrance, who is backed by President Duda‚Äôs right-wing, national-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) party. His place in the potential second round on June 1 is now challenged by S≈Çawomir Mentzen. Co za zako≈Ñczenie dnia! Dziƒôkujƒô O≈Çawa!

He launched his campaign at the end of August, earlier than his competitors, and has been narrowing the gap between him and the mainstream leaders. Mentzen is still third in the race but a survey conducted by the Polish research company Opinia24 in mid-March showed him with 18.9%, less than a percentage point behind Nawrocki at 19.5%. Trzaskowski is well ahead of both with the support of 32% of the respondents, although that‚Äôs not enough for a first round win. The results were published by RMF24 which ordered the poll. The Polish news outlet highlighted S≈Çawomir Mentzen‚Äôs continuous gain over the past few months. He has added 2 percentage points since February and is 8 points above his December score. Pro-crypto presidential candidate leads among young voters Polling numbers quoted by Politico are also registering Mentzen‚Äôs ascend throughout the race but pointing to a larger difference between him and Nawrocki. RMF24 noted, however, that Opinia24‚Äôs pre-election forecast for the 2023 parliamentary vote, when Mentzen won a seat in the Polish Sejm , was credited as the most accurate. Young Poles is the segment where Mentzen confidently leads, according to Opinia. Some 46% of those aged 18 to 29 have declared their intention to vote for Konfederacja‚Äôs 38-year-old candidate. He is also ranked first by Polish citizens in the 30-39 bracket and has a slight advantage over Trzaskowski among male voters. S≈Çawomir Mentzen has been relying heavily on popular platforms like Tiktok and X as well as Youtube to convey his views, a mix of conservative, nationalistic and libertarian ideas. He ‚Äúhas made social media his home,‚Äù the European political news website Euractiv pointed out in a recent article. His election program titled ‚ÄúStrong Rich Poland‚Äù abounds with political messages mirroring Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign promises such as ensuring ‚Äútight borders,‚Äù providing ‚Äúdefense of free speech,‚Äù ‚Äúreducing bureaucracy,‚Äù and introducing ‚Äúlow and simple taxes.‚Äù He insists ‚ÄúPoland needs a strong army‚Äù but says ‚ÄúNo to Polish troops in Ukraine.‚Äù Poland should create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If I become the President of Poland, our country will become a cryptocurrency haven, with very friendly regulations, low taxes, and a supportive approach from banks and regulators.

42722732,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=703305,1743465970,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42722732.jpeg,Nvidia stock sinks 4% as Trump‚Äôs tariff plans rattle AI trade,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-stock-sinks-4/,"Nvidia shares fell over 4% early Monday after US President Donald Trump delivered a stern message about trade tariffs. Trump said on Sunday that no country would be given any special treatment regarding tariffs. He also signed new trade policies into effect on April 2 , which he calls ‚ÄúLiberation Day.‚Äù This frightened investors, who had expected a softer trade stance. Trump‚Äôs remarks set off a market-wide sell-off led by tech stocks . Shares in Tesla fell over 5%, the biggest decline for the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù tech behemoths. Already in the‚ÄÇcrosshairs of new trade restrictions, Nvidia saw its stock also tumble. New tariffs disrupt Nvidia‚Äôs role in the AI arms race An imminent 25% tariff from the US government on goods‚ÄÇfrom Mexico and Canada directly impacts Nvidia . The company produces advanced graphics‚ÄÇprocessing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence (AI) servers. So, many of these AI servers are put together in Mexico and driven across the border into the US. According to trade data, the US imported $43 billion in computers, including AI servers,‚ÄÇfrom Mexico in 2024. The company expects new tariffs to increase the cost of such servers, which could decrease demand for‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs AI chips. Taiwan, also a key source of‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs GPU supply, could also see the extension of trade controls. In 2024, the US imported $33‚ÄÇbillion worth of computer parts, including Nvidia-powered printed circuit boards, from Taiwan. The tech firm‚Äôs production costs could increase if Trump hits Taiwan with more tariffs. Nvidia gears up for major‚ÄÇchanges ahead The short-term effects of the tariffs will take time to play out, but Nvidia is already‚ÄÇlooking ahead. At its latest GTC conference , CEO Jensen Huang answered questions‚ÄÇabout trade restrictions, specifying that export control restrictions concerning artificial intelligence and China were the reason behind the firm‚Äôs challenges. He acknowledged that tariffs would have ‚Äúa little impact‚Äù on the company in the‚ÄÇshort term, but he also stressed‚ÄÇthat Nvidia is pursuing longer-term solutions. One important step toward that goal is expanding production in the US. Huang cited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ‚Äòs $100 billion investment to develop new chip factories in the United States. TSMC is a major manufacturing partner for Nvidia, and the move potentially helps mitigate overreliance on overseas factories in the future. However, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has‚ÄÇfaced pressure in 2025. As of Monday morning, it had fallen almost 22% from the start of‚ÄÇthe year. Before Trump made his most‚ÄÇrecent comments, analysts said the stock market had yet to fully digest the new tariffs‚Äô impact. Now, some financial experts are cautioning that‚ÄÇinvestors should also consider how these longer-term rules governing trade will inform the industry. Even before Trump‚Äôs latest remarks, some analysts had cautioned that the market was not yet‚ÄÇproperly pricing the full effects of these tariffs. According to Josh Schafer of Yahoo Finance reports, many investors underestimated the extent and scope of Trump‚Äôs‚ÄÇtrade policies. The market now sees how serious and long-term these tariffs‚ÄÇcould be, said Henrietta Treyz, an economic policy expert at Veda Partners.

33767162,[object Object],1743467420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Bleeds $630M as Crypto Fund Outflows Accelerate for Second Week Straight,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleeds-630m-crypto-fund-outflows-accelerate/,"Crypto asset investment products faced another week of outflows last week, marking the second consecutive week of investor pullback. According to the latest weekly report released by CoinShares, total outflows amounted to $584 million, pushing the two-week outflow total to roughly $1.2 billion. This shift highlights a cautious sentiment among investors, particularly in light of macroeconomic factors. CoinShares‚Äô Head of Research, James Butterfill, linked the trend to ongoing uncertainty about interest rate policy in the US. The report also noted a significant drop in market participation, with exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally recording just $6.9 billion in traded volume for the week ‚Äî the lowest since US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January. Bitcoin Leads Outflows While Altcoins Show Pockets of Strength The United States saw the highest fund exits with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada with $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong also registered $24 million and $19 million in respective outflows. In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions , recording inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million. Bitcoin remained at the center of the movement, accounting for $630 million in weekly outflows. However, sentiment did not shift heavily toward bearish bets, as short Bitcoin products also saw minor outflows totaling $1.2 million, suggesting a lack of conviction in downside positioning. Ethereum also experienced $58 million in outflows, reflecting broader risk aversion. However, several altcoins bucked the trend, with Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon witnessing modest inflows of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million respectively. These movements indicate that some investors may be seeking exposure to alternative assets amid price corrections. Multi-asset products stood out as a contrasting trend, attracting $98 million in inflows. This may suggest that investors are diversifying their portfolios or taking advantage of recent altcoin weaknesses to allocate across multiple assets. Investor Behavior Shaped by Macro Sentiment CoinShares‚Äô data reflects a market environment still heavily influenced by macroeconomic outlooks and central bank policy expectations. With investor anticipation for interest rate cuts declining, digital asset fund flows have turned negative after months of consistent inflows earlier this year. James Butterfill noted: We believe this is in reaction to the pessimism amongst investors for the prospect of interest rate cuts by the FED this year. Notably. the decrease in ETP trading volume could also reflect a broader lull in investor engagement as markets wait for further direction. While Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers of the recent outflows, the inflows into certain altcoins and multi-asset products point to nuanced sentiment rather than broad-based risk-off behavior.

Now priced at $0.70, that‚Äôs a more than 300%‚ÄÇrally for ADA to reach this goal. But skepticism simmers as network action fades ‚Äî daily transactions plunged 70% from late 2024, falling to 26,437‚ÄÇby early March 2025. With bullish patterns and rising social‚ÄÇsentiment suggesting support for a potential 20% bounce towards $0.85, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi upstart whose presale momentum and tokenomics could leave ADA‚Äôs subdued outlook in the dust. The Uncertain Horizon of‚ÄÇCardano Price‚ÄÇdynamics of Cardano are still trapped in the paradoxes. However, despite ascending social optimism‚Äîpartially driven by the SEC‚Äôs suddenly non-securities classification of ADA‚Äîthe network‚Äôs utility metrics fare‚ÄÇpoorly. Analysts draw attention to the bullish ‚Äúflag‚Äù pattern that has been developing since December‚ÄÇ2024, as is characteristic for a precursor to rallies, but declining transactional activity erodes confidence. Before ADA can reach its 2025 price peak of‚ÄÇ$1.20, it has to break the $0.85 resistance zone, equivalent to a 20% increase from where it is right now. Yet, skeptics wonder if deflating adoption can be the foundation for long-term growth, prompting investors to look‚ÄÇfor alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for those exponential returns. The Dominance of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ($0.025 ‚Äî Phase 4) is expected to see 140%‚ÄÇincrease at launch ($0.06). Those who take early stage pricing now can expect a 20% profit before the next price jump brings the price‚ÄÇto $0.03. Combine this with $5.9 million of capital already raised and 7600 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders and the algorithmic buy-pressure and revenue-redistribution tokenomics become a compelling‚ÄÇproposition. Mutuum Finance stands‚ÄÇout because of the self-sustaining ecosystem. Its lending protocol drives steady demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, and mtTokens‚Äîdeposit certificates‚ÄÇthat earn interest‚Äîgenerate supplemental yield streams. This incremental design of the presale, currently at its fourth of eleven stages, encourages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors to get in‚ÄÇon the action as soon as possible, with each tier raising the price to reward those who act fast. Favourable post-launch predictions fuelled by both exchange listings and platform adoption dictate a rise to $1.50‚Äì$3.50 in under a few months, equating with‚ÄÇa 5,900%‚Äì14,000% ROI for phase-four contributors. Strategic‚ÄÇGrowth & Security Mutuum Finance‚Äôs approach is‚ÄÇdriven by transparency A Certik audit is in progress for its smart contracts, with public release of results expected after they are‚ÄÇfinalized. Coupled with a tokenomics plan to dampen sell pressure, this specializing in security makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a‚ÄÇhigh reward, low risk entry. Unlike speculative assets, its value is directly correlated to platform usage ‚Äî every loan issued and every deposit made‚ÄÇincreases the demand for the token. As Cardano‚ÄÇstruggles with stagnating utility and Solana wrestles with volatility, Mutuum Finance becomes the presale phenomenon of 2025. As phase four fills quickly‚ÄÇand exchange listings are on the horizon, the fusion of DeFi innovation and strategic tokenomics offers a clear path to outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale marks a rare moment of urgency and opportunity‚ÄÇfor investors who are looking for a safe harbour from volatile markets. Seize the Momentum Mutuum Finance‚Äôs fourth presale phase is‚ÄÇcounting down the clock. Next 20% price jump‚ÄÇis around the corner ‚Äì $0.03 per token; after the launch, triple-digit returns.

The cryptocurrency was closing in on the $90,000 psychological level but has since reversed direction, falling by 6.4% over the past week to hover around $82,000 at the time of writing. This decline has placed renewed attention on market metrics that suggest the rally may have been short-lived. Amid this downward movement, several on-chain analysts have raised questions about whether recent price trends reflect real demand or speculative behavior. Particularly, insights from CryptoQuant contributors point to warning signs, including a divergence between market capitalization and actual network activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead NVT Indicator Signals Caution Amid Low Transaction Volume In a recent post titled ‚ÄúManipulative Moves or True Value? A Bitcoin and NVT Analysis,‚Äù CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest pointed to the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio as a critical metric for understanding current market dynamics. The NVT ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization by its daily transaction volume. According to BorisVest, Bitcoin‚Äôs elevated NVT Golden Cross reading indicates a high market cap against low transaction activity ‚Äî a combination that historically suggests price inflation driven by speculative interest rather than organic growth. BorisVest emphasized that periods with a high NVT often precede market corrections. In contrast, when the NVT falls into the green zone ‚Äî signaling a low market cap with rising transaction volume ‚Äî it may present a stronger foundation for price appreciation. As of now, the metric suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rise lacks transactional support, and continued pullbacks remain possible unless volume returns to the network. Bitcoin Speculators Absent, Sentiment Remains Cautious Adding to the cautious outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor known as crypto sunmoon highlighted the role of leverage in driving crypto bull markets. The analyst pointed out that funding rates have recently ‚Äúdead-crossed,‚Äù which occurs when short-term funding rates fall below long-term rates, often indicating bearish sentiment among traders. According to sunmoon, this shift suggests that speculators are currently unwilling to take on risk ‚Äî a key component needed to fuel bullish price movements. The analyst concluded that the return of speculative trading behavior, typically marked by rising funding rates and leveraged positions, is essential for reigniting upward momentum in Bitcoin.

This will be the firm‚Äôs first open-weight release since GPT-2, a decision that had been delayed due to other priorities but now feels essential. Per the update, the novel model is expected to bring strong reasoning capabilities and provide simplicity for developers and organizations. From OpenAI ChatGPT to Sora It is worth mentioning that Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, shared the news on X, expressing excitement about making the model highly effective. More importantly, this announcement follows OpenAI‚Äôs history of launching novel AI products. Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the tool has become widely used for text-based tasks. This Large Language Model transformed how people from different parts of the world interact with artificial intelligence . As reported by CoinGape, In 2024, OpenAI introduced Sora, an advanced video generation model. In addition, the release of voice Chat further improved AI‚Äôs role by allowing seamless spoken interactions. Interestingly, these notable innovations have redefined how AI integrates into daily life. Now, OpenAI is moving toward open-weight models. This will allow greater customization. For example, businesses, developers, and governments that prefer self-hosted AI solutions will be able to modify the model for specific needs. This new project could lead to wider adoption and new applications across various industries. ChatGPT Developer Involvement and Future Trends Before releasing the project to the public, OpenAI seeks developers‚Äô input through a series of sessions. According to Sam Altman, the events will begin in San Francisco, followed by meetings in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As detailed, developers will gain early access to prototypes, providing insight into potential applications. Altman confirmed that OpenAI will evaluate the model using its preparedness framework. Since open-weight models can be altered post-release, additional security measures will be implemented. By involving developers early, OpenAI intends to fuse innovation and responsibility. This will ensure that the model is both effective and safe for people to use. Another Studio Ghibli Trend Ahead? It is important to add that AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork has shown how artificial intelligence can shape creative industries. For context, when OpenAI added image generation to ChatGPT-4o, people started making Studio Ghibli-style portraits, and the trend quickly spread. Even Elon Musk joined the Ghibli trend . Still, this new trend has raised certain questions about the future of creative art. Still, with OpenAI‚Äôs new model on the way, another wave of AI-generated content could take off. As AI keeps improving, it may bring new ways for people to create and share.
