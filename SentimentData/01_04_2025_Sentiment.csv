The price is currently hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band, indicating suppressed volatility and a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads around 38.56, suggesting that the asset is approaching oversold territory, though not quite there yet. The mid-Bollinger Band at approximately $0.03323 acts as dynamic resistance, which BRETT has struggled to breach. Without a decisive breakout above this level, upward momentum may remain limited. Unless volume or sentiment shifts significantly, the asset may continue range-bound movement or experience slight downside pressure.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

The initiative follows Hut 8’s contribution of most of its ASIC miners to American Data Centers, Inc., which has since been renamed American Bitcoin. The transition reflects Hut 8’s broader restructuring to streamline its Bitcoin mining operations. American Bitcoin Mining to Absorb Hut 8 Operations Under the new agreement, American Bitcoin will assume all Bitcoin mining activities previously handled under Hut 8’s Compute segment. Hut 8, however, will remain central to operations by serving as the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner. This partnership is expected to support long-term revenue growth for Hut 8’s Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. “By combining Hut 8’s proven operational excellence in data centers with our shared passion for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, we are poised to strengthen our foundation and drive significant future growth,” said Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin. Donald Trump Jr. added that while holding Bitcoin has value, mining it under favorable conditions offers a stronger growth opportunity. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot noted that creating American Bitcoin as a standalone entity allows the mining division to scale independently and attract investment. Meanwhile, Hut 8 can concentrate on its infrastructure services, creating a more predictable and financeable structure for both companies. Leadership and Operational Support The leadership team at American Bitcoin will include Mike Ho as Executive Chairman, Matt Prusak as CEO, and Eric Trump as Chief Strategy Officer. The Board of Directors will initially feature Mike Ho, Asher Genoot, Justin Mateen, and Michael Broukhim. As part of the agreement, Hut 8 will provide ASIC colocation and managed services to American Bitcoin, ensuring a smooth transition and continued operational excellence. “When the Trump family starts mining Bitcoin, you know the game has changed.

Frustrated with what it perceives as stonewalling, Coinbase has reactivated its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Let’s dive into why this legal battle is crucial for Coinbase, the crypto industry, and what it means for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Coinbase Reviving the FOIA Lawsuit? Coinbase initially filed this lawsuit to gain access to documents from the FDIC, believing these documents hold critical information relevant to the exchange’s operations and the broader regulatory landscape. The lawsuit was temporarily paused earlier this year when Travis Hill was appointed as Acting FDIC Chair, sparking hopes of a more cooperative approach. However, despite some initial improvements in communication, Coinbase feels that the FDIC is still not providing the level of FDIC Transparency required. According to a post by Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter, on X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase alleges that key documents are still being withheld, hindering their ability to fully understand the FDIC’s stance and actions. The Core Issue: Information Access and Regulatory Clarity At the heart of this legal tussle is the fundamental principle of information access . Coinbase, like any regulated entity, needs clarity and access to information from regulatory bodies like the FDIC to operate effectively and compliantly. Here’s why this is so vital: Compliance and Risk Management: Understanding the FDIC’s internal communications and policies is crucial for Coinbase to ensure it is meeting all regulatory requirements and managing risks appropriately. Opaque regulatory processes make compliance a guessing game. Industry Precedent: This case sets a precedent for how regulatory bodies interact with the cryptocurrency industry. If Coinbase succeeds in compelling the FDIC to be more transparent, it could pave the way for greater openness across the board, benefiting the entire crypto sector. Investor Confidence: Transparency from regulators builds investor confidence. Knowing that regulatory processes are open and accountable can encourage more institutional and retail investors to participate in the crypto market. Paul Grewal’s Stance: Insufficient Transparency Remains Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has been vocal about the need for greater transparency. While acknowledging some improved cooperation under the new FDIC leadership, Grewal stated that transparency remains “insufficient.” This suggests that while the FDIC may have made some efforts to engage with Coinbase, they haven’t gone far enough to satisfy the exchange’s concerns regarding access to vital information access . This isn’t just about Coinbase; it’s about the broader relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and financial regulators. The demand for transparency highlights a crucial tension point: how can innovative, rapidly evolving sectors like crypto navigate regulatory landscapes that are often perceived as opaque and slow-moving? What are the Potential Outcomes and Implications? The court’s decision on Coinbase’s motion to resume the FOIA lawsuit will have significant ramifications: Outcome Implications Court grants Coinbase’s motion FDIC will be compelled to respond to the lawsuit, potentially leading to the release of requested documents. This would be a win for Coinbase and potentially for transparency in crypto regulation . Court denies Coinbase’s motion Coinbase’s efforts to gain information through legal means will be thwarted, at least in the short term. This could signal continued challenges for crypto firms seeking regulatory clarity via FOIA requests. The Role of the Financial Watchdog: FDIC Under Scrutiny The FDIC, as a key financial watchdog , plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation’s financial system. Its actions, or lack thereof, are closely watched by the financial industry, including the burgeoning crypto sector. This lawsuit puts the spotlight on the FDIC’s approach to transparency and its engagement with innovative financial technologies. Is the FDIC being overly cautious, or is Coinbase asking for too much? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. Regulators must balance the need for confidentiality and operational integrity with the legitimate demands of regulated entities for clarity and FDIC Transparency . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What can the crypto community learn from this ongoing legal battle? Transparency is Non-Negotiable: Coinbase’s persistence underscores the importance of demanding transparency from regulatory bodies. It’s not just about individual company interests but about building a mature and trustworthy crypto ecosystem. Legal Avenues are Important: While dialogue and cooperation are ideal, legal avenues like FOIA can be vital tools to ensure accountability and access to information when necessary. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers and regulators to shape a more transparent and supportive regulatory environment for crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Fight for Transparency Continues Coinbase’s decision to restart its FOIA lawsuit against the FDIC is a clear signal that the fight for regulatory transparency in the crypto space is far from over. This case is not just about documents and legal procedures; it’s about fostering a more open, accountable, and ultimately, healthier relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and its regulators. As the FDIC prepares its response, the crypto world watches closely, hoping this renewed legal push will finally unlock the doors to greater information access and clarity.

If you’re deeply invested in the crypto world, you understand the importance of timely information. Imagine getting only the most crucial alerts without sifting through endless notifications. That’s precisely what Apple is delivering with its latest update. Apple Intelligence, the tech giant’s powerful suite of AI tools, is expanding its reach and introducing a game-changing feature: Priority Notifications. This update, rolling out with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, not only brings AI to more users in the EU but also refines how you manage your digital life. Let’s dive into what these updates mean for you and how they are set to redefine your Apple experience. What are Apple’s Revolutionary Priority Notifications? Tired of notification overload? We all are! In today’s fast-paced digital world, our devices are constantly buzzing with alerts, many of which are simply noise. Apple’s new Priority Notifications feature, powered by Apple Intelligence, is designed to cut through the clutter. It intelligently analyzes your notifications and highlights those deemed most urgent and time-sensitive. Think of it as your personal AI assistant for notifications, ensuring you never miss what truly matters. Here’s what makes Priority Notifications a potential game-changer: AI-Driven Filtering: Apple Intelligence algorithms learn your notification patterns to identify critical alerts. Enhanced Visibility: Important notifications are prominently displayed at the top of your notification stack in a new, distinct format, making them instantly noticeable. Reduced Digital Clutter: By prioritizing essential notifications, you can focus on what needs your immediate attention, minimizing distractions from less important updates. Improved Efficiency: Spend less time sifting through notifications and more time responding to what truly matters, whether it’s a critical crypto market alert or an urgent personal message. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who rely on their Apple devices for time-sensitive information and want to streamline their notification experience. For crypto enthusiasts, this could mean getting instant alerts about significant market movements or important wallet updates, right when they matter most. Expanding Horizons: Apple Intelligence Arrives in the EU with iOS 18.4 The wait is over for Apple users in the European Union! Apple Intelligence , initially unveiled at last year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, is now making its way to iPhones and iPads across the EU with the iOS 18.4 update. This expansion is a significant step, bringing a suite of AI-powered features to a wider audience. Previously, Apple cited EU tech regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, as a reason for the delayed rollout, originally slated for April 2025. However, Apple has managed to overcome these hurdles, delivering AI Features to EU users much sooner than anticipated. This move underscores Apple’s commitment to making its advanced AI capabilities globally accessible, despite regulatory complexities. EU users can now experience features like: Writing Tools: AI-powered assistance for writing and refining text across various apps. Image Playground: An app for generating fun and creative images using AI. Genmoji: Create personalized emojis using generative AI. Furthermore, Apple Intelligence is also extending its reach to Vision Pro users in U.S. English, bringing these powerful AI tools to Apple’s mixed reality platform. This means Vision Pro users can now leverage Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and more within their immersive experiences. Beyond Notifications: Other Exciting AI Features in iOS 18.4 The iOS 18.4 update is more than just Priority Notifications and EU expansion; it’s packed with other exciting AI Features designed to enhance your Apple experience. Let’s explore some of the notable additions: Memory Movies on Mac: Now you can create personalized “memory movies” on your Mac simply by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will automatically curate photos and videos based on your text input, generating a shareable movie. Sketch Style in Image Playground: Apple’s AI image generation app, Image Playground, gets a new “Sketch” style. This allows you to create academic and detailed sketches, adding a new artistic dimension to your AI-generated images. Language Expansion: Apple Intelligence is now available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (Simplified). Localized English support has also been added for Singapore and India, making AI features more accessible to a global audience. Apple News+ Food: The recently announced recipe companion, Apple News+ Food, is also launching with this update, providing a new culinary resource within Apple News+. Revamped Apple Photos App: Expect further tweaks and improvements to the Apple Photos app, enhancing your photo management and editing experience. These updates demonstrate Apple’s ongoing commitment to refining and expanding its AI ecosystem, delivering tangible benefits to users across various aspects of their digital lives. Why is Apple Intelligence Rollout Gradual? You might be wondering why Apple is rolling out Apple Intelligence features in phases rather than all at once. The truth is, developing and deploying sophisticated AI features at scale is a complex undertaking. Apple’s approach reflects a commitment to quality and a measured introduction of new technologies. Here’s a breakdown of the likely reasons for this gradual rollout: Reason Explanation Technological Complexity Generative AI and related features are cutting-edge technologies. Ensuring stability, accuracy, and user-friendliness requires rigorous testing and phased deployment. Infrastructure Scaling Supporting AI features for millions of users globally demands significant infrastructure. Gradual rollout allows Apple to scale its server capacity and optimize performance without overwhelming its systems. Feature Refinement By releasing features incrementally, Apple can gather user feedback and iterate on its AI models and functionalities. This iterative process helps improve the quality and relevance of AI features over time. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations, especially in regions like the EU with stringent data privacy laws, requires careful planning and phased implementation to ensure compliance and address any legal concerns. Apple’s deliberate approach ensures a smoother user experience and allows for continuous improvement of its AI offerings. While some users might prefer immediate access to all features, this phased rollout ultimately leads to a more robust and refined AI ecosystem. Embrace the Future of AI with iOS 18.4 The latest iOS 18.4 update marks a significant step forward in Apple’s AI journey. With the introduction of Priority Notifications and the expansion of Apple Intelligence to the EU, Apple is empowering users with smarter, more intuitive, and more efficient digital experiences. These updates are not just about adding features; they are about fundamentally changing how we interact with our devices, making technology work more seamlessly for us. As Apple continues to refine and expand its AI capabilities, we can expect even more groundbreaking innovations in the future. For now, users can look forward to a smarter, more streamlined, and more personalized Apple experience with iOS 18.4 and beyond.

Notably, the struggles have spared tech stocks, which continue to surge despite macro factors. According to Reuters , data provided by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that property prices, investments, and sales have resumed their downward trend following a brief period of stability. China’s government has actively intervened in the property market Property prices in China have been on a steady decline since 2021 after a government crackdown on developers caused a liquidity crisis, abandoned projects and wary buyers. Not much has changed since then, despite recent government intervention. The government has been active in trying to stabilize the property market, including it in its 2025 agenda. The government efforts seem to have paid off for about two months as the prices were relatively steady. However, recent data from the Chinese Real Estate Information Corp shows that the market has lost these small gains as new home sales have dipped. While the government is working to normalize house prices, there’s also the issue of price controls that are usually imposed by local governments. These dips are not only attributed to government actions, as demographic shifts, low demands causing a glut of unsold homes, and low disposable income due to stagnant incomes come into play. While analysts believe that government efforts will cause a positive change in the trends, other factors threaten that change from happening soon. U.S. tariffs add pressure To add to its economic woes, the U.S. introduced a 25% levy on Chinese auto imports, among other tariffs, piling more pressure on China. China has also retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on goods from the United States, further straining bilateral trade relations between the two nations. The Trump administration is expected to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs on April 2, adding more pressure to the Chinese economy. These have raised concerns about the impact of the tariffs on Chinese consumer behavior and its manufacturing sector. China’s tech surge fails to revive broader markets On the flip side, Chinese tech stocks have been on a trend Deepseek started earlier in the year. Despite the ongoing success of these Chinese tech stocks, it has had little or no growing effect on emerging markets. This is a divergence from the normal trend where the growth in Chinese stocks has a growing effect on the stocks of other emerging markets, which have remained relatively stagnant. The current rallying effect of the Chinese stock market isn’t felt in the entire Chinese market and its impact hasn’t really improved the economy, with analysts attributing its rise to the current frenzy surrounding tech, especially artificial intelligence. According to analysts from UBS Group AG in London, the current tech boom isn’t the same as the typical Chinese boom that occurred in 2009, 2016, and 2020 and impacted emerging markets. It’s reported that since August 2024, the MSCI China Index has risen by over 30%, while the same cannot be said for emerging markets, which have fallen by 7% since then. Historically, strong growth in Chinese stocks has had a growth effect on other emerging markets. A historical example will be between 2009 and 2010, where a 63% rise in Chinese shares saw a 100% rise in emerging market shares. A similar trend is seen between 2016 and 2017, where Chinese stocks rose by 50% and the emerging markets broad gauge rose by 46%. Prior to the tech-induced boost caused by the launch of the AI model Deepseek, Chinese stocks last saw a slight surge in September 2024, thanks to the Chinese government’s overall economic stimulus. According to investment analysts, China’s new trend of outperforming its emerging markets may last longer than expected or desired. They also expressed concerns over the effects U.S. tariffs have on the Chinese stock market. Uncertain outlook for China’s economy While there are concerns about the impact of these tariffs on consumer behavior in various sectors, such as housing, investors outside of China are also taking a hint, and it could potentially affect the growth of the Chinese stock market negatively and mean more losses for emerging markets. Insights shared by Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, point out that some funds are expressing little confidence in Chinese stocks making a quick comeback and are already doing away with their Chinese holdings. While local experts point out that the Chinese market will experience some form of growth aided by government intervention, they also indicate that the growth curve won’t be steep. How these predictions play out is left to be seen as the available data looks bleak currently, given the U.S. tariffs and more impending tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

If you were eagerly anticipating the full potential of Alexa+, Amazon’s premium AI assistant, you might need to temper your excitement. While Amazon has launched Alexa+, reports are surfacing that many of the hyped, game-changing Alexa Plus Features are nowhere to be found, at least not yet. Let’s dive into what’s going on with this much-anticipated upgrade and why the rollout is hitting some unexpected snags. What’s the Buzz About Alexa Plus Features? Amazon promised a revolutionary upgrade with Alexa+, showcasing impressive capabilities at a recent press event. We were teased with glimpses of an AI assistant that could truly understand and anticipate our needs, performing what are termed “agentic AI tasks.” Think seamless interactions like: Ordering your favorite takeout from Grubhub with just a voice command. Generating imaginative stories to keep kids entertained for hours. Recognizing household members and prompting them about their chores. Brainstorming the perfect gift ideas for any occasion. Even ordering an Uber and getting personalized cooking recommendations. These Amazon AI Assistant functionalities painted a picture of a truly intelligent and helpful home companion, far beyond the basic Alexa we know. The anticipation was palpable, especially for those invested in creating a fully integrated smart home ecosystem. The Disappointing Reality: Delayed Alexa Features However, the initial launch of Alexa+ tells a different story. According to reports, many of these showcased Alexa Plus Features are conspicuously absent. Users who upgraded expecting a fully realized AI assistant are finding themselves with a service that feels…incomplete. Key functionalities like Grubhub ordering, story generation, visual person identification for chore reminders, and gift idea brainstorming are simply not available yet. It’s like ordering a fully loaded car and finding out it’s missing the navigation system and sunroof. Furthermore, some features, such as Uber ordering and cooking recommendations, are only available to a select group of users, making the rollout feel fragmented and inconsistent. The promised web app for Alexa+, which was announced with fanfare just last month, also lacks a firm release date, adding to the uncertainty. Why Are Key Smart Home AI Features Delayed? The culprit behind these Delayed Alexa Features seems to be the complex AI infrastructure underpinning Alexa+. Reports suggest that the development process has been plagued with challenges from the outset. Building an AI capable of handling the sophisticated “agentic” tasks Amazon envisions is no small feat. It requires robust and reliable systems that can handle natural language processing, contextual understanding, and seamless integration with various services. Here’s a breakdown of the potential challenges: AI Infrastructure Complexity: Developing the AI models and systems to power these advanced features is inherently complex and time-consuming. Integration Hurdles: Seamlessly integrating with third-party services like Grubhub and Uber requires intricate partnerships and technical coordination. Performance and Reliability: Ensuring the AI is not only functional but also performs reliably and accurately across a wide range of user scenarios is crucial for a positive user experience. Scalability Issues: Rolling out these features to millions of users requires a scalable infrastructure that can handle the increased demand and data processing. What Does This Mean for Smart Home Enthusiasts? For those invested in Smart Home AI and eagerly awaiting the next leap in voice assistant technology, this delay is undoubtedly disappointing. It highlights the gap between marketing hype and the realities of developing cutting-edge AI. While Alexa+ still holds promise, the initial rollout serves as a reminder that revolutionary technology often comes with unforeseen challenges and delays. However, it’s important to remember that this is just the beginning. Amazon has committed to delivering these advanced features, and the current situation appears to be a temporary setback rather than a complete derailment. As AI technology continues to evolve rapidly, we can expect to see these capabilities gradually rolled out in the coming months. Actionable Insights: Managing Expectations and Future Outlook Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights as we navigate this evolving landscape: Manage Expectations: Don’t expect all promised Alexa+ features to be available immediately. Temper your expectations and anticipate a phased rollout. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on tech news and official Amazon announcements for updates on feature releases and timelines. Provide Feedback: If you are an early Alexa+ adopter, provide feedback to Amazon about your experience and feature requests. This can help shape future development. Patience is Key: Developing advanced AI is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience will be crucial as these sophisticated features are refined and rolled out. Conclusion: The Future of Alexa+ and Smart Home AI Remains Bright While the initial launch of Alexa+ may not have delivered all the promised bells and whistles, the underlying potential of Amazon AI Assistant and the future of Smart Home AI remains incredibly exciting.

42720384,https://cryptonews.com/?p=346343,1743460936,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/42720384.jpeg,"Will ETH Hit Rock Bottom at $1,200? Analyst Reveals His Buy Zone Strategy",https://cryptonews.com/news/eth-drops-near-1500-eyes-1200-support-zone/,"ETH fell by 1.1% in the past 24 hours, sliding to just above $1,800 as analysts suggested the recent rally may have been a dead-cat bounce. Among the top five cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has posted the steepest losses in 2025, down 45.4% year-to-date. The network’s struggle to remain competitive has pressured the price of its native asset, with rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) offering lower fees and faster execution speeds. ETH Nears Critical $1,500 Support After Major Downtrend Crypto trader Big Cheds, who has more than 300,000 followers on X, pointed to the $1,200 level as a critical support and potential buy zone for ETH if the current downtrend continues. $ETH now $1840 from $3400 below. Prob worth a sniff when it tags $1200-$1300 range https://t.co/NARqJWgxS6 pic.twitter.com/w076n9xLIe — Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) March 30, 2025 He noted that a bounce from this level could lead to a mid-term rally toward the $3,400 range, translating to a 283% gain. Looking at the weekly chart, ETH has been in a prolonged downtrend since it failed to break above $4,000 for the third time. This triple top pattern reflected investor hesitation in pushing valuations higher amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Despite these challenges, some technical levels have held firm. The $1,500 support zone has previously acted as a launching point for strong recoveries. ETH rebounded by 41% and 149% the last two times it touched this level, with each move resulting in a higher high. If a similar reaction occurs again, the price could target the $5,000 mark, which would represent a 221% increase. Can ETH Bounce Back or Is $1,200 the Next Stop? Whether ETH will hold its footing at $1,500 or continue slipping remains to be seen. A sustained drop below that level could send the price toward $1,200, and potentially as low as $900, implying a total downside risk of around 42% from current levels. Traders and long-term holders alike will be watching closely to see how ETH reacts to this zone. A strong bounce could reignite interest, while a bearish breakdown might confirm further downside in the short term. Once cryptos regain their strength and the bullish cycle resumes, storing these digital assets safely will be a key priority to investors.

42719757,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144925,1743461423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary OpenAI Unveils Plans for New Open Source AI Language Model,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-unveils-open-source-model/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto and tech enthusiasts! The AI world is buzzing with a potentially seismic shift. OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking GPT models, has hinted at releasing a new “open” language model. Yes, you read that right – “open”! This news is electrifying for those in the crypto space who understand the power of decentralization and open access. Could this be a game-changer for how generative AI is developed and utilized? Let’s dive into what this announcement means and why it’s creating waves. Why is an OpenAI Open Language Model a Big Deal? For years, OpenAI has been known for its cutting-edge, yet largely closed-source, AI models. Think of models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 – incredibly powerful, but access is controlled and the underlying code isn’t freely available. This contrasts sharply with the ethos of the crypto world, which champions transparency and open-source development. However, it seems the winds are changing. OpenAI is signaling a move towards a more open approach, reminiscent of their earlier days with GPT-2 . But why now? Let’s break it down: Competitive Pressure: Companies like DeepSeek and Meta (with their Llama models) have gained significant traction by adopting an open source AI strategy. Meta’s Llama models, for instance, have seen over a billion downloads! This success likely hasn’t gone unnoticed by OpenAI. Community Demand: The AI research and development community has been vocal about the need for more open and accessible AI models . OpenAI’s feedback form directly addresses this, asking developers and researchers what they want to see in an open model. Sam Altman’s Perspective: Even OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has acknowledged that the company might have been on the “wrong side of history” regarding open sourcing. His recent statements suggest an internal shift in thinking, even if it’s not universally shared within OpenAI. What Can We Expect from this New Open Source AI Model? While details are still emerging, here’s what we know and what we can infer about OpenAI’s upcoming open language model : Reasoning Capabilities: Altman mentioned that the model will have “reasoning” capabilities similar to OpenAI’s o3-mini. This suggests it won’t be a basic model but will possess a degree of sophistication. Preparedness Framework: OpenAI emphasizes that this model, like all others, will undergo rigorous evaluation before release. However, they acknowledge the unique nature of an open-source model, anticipating modifications and adaptations post-release. Focus on Utility: OpenAI’s feedback form and statements highlight a desire to make this model as “useful as possible” for developers, researchers, and even large organizations. They envision scenarios where companies and governments might prefer to run models themselves, rather than relying solely on API access. The Benefits of Open Source AI: A Crypto Perspective For the crypto community, the move towards open source AI resonates deeply. Here’s why: Benefit Explanation Transparency & Trust Open source code allows for public scrutiny, fostering greater trust and transparency in AI development. This aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. Innovation & Collaboration Open models encourage wider experimentation and collaboration. Just as open-source blockchain projects have thrived, open AI can spur rapid innovation through community contributions. Decentralization Potential Open source AI can contribute to a more decentralized AI landscape, reducing the concentration of power in a few large tech companies. This mirrors the crypto vision of decentralizing control. Accessibility & Democratization Open models lower the barrier to entry for AI development, making powerful tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers globally. Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of an OpenAI open language model is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Responsible Use: Open models can be used for malicious purposes. OpenAI will need to carefully consider safety and ethical implications, especially given the potential for modification post-release. Resource Intensity: Developing and maintaining powerful open models requires significant resources. OpenAI needs a sustainable strategy for this endeavor. Balancing Openness with Business Interests: OpenAI is a for-profit company. Finding the right balance between open sourcing and protecting their competitive advantage will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a crypto developer, investor, or simply an AI enthusiast, here’s how you can engage with this development: Participate in OpenAI’s Feedback Process: If you have ideas or insights on what you’d like to see in an open model, fill out OpenAI’s feedback form. Your input can directly shape the future of this model. Explore Existing Open Source AI Models: Familiarize yourself with models like Meta’s Llama, and DeepSeek’s offerings. Understanding the current landscape will help you appreciate OpenAI’s new model better. Consider the Implications for Crypto & AI Convergence: Think about how open AI models could be integrated with blockchain technology. Are there opportunities for decentralized AI applications, AI-powered crypto tools, or new intersections we haven’t yet imagined? Conclusion: A New Chapter for OpenAI and Open Source AI? OpenAI’s move towards releasing an open language model is a significant moment. It signals a potential shift in strategy, acknowledging the power of open source and the growing demand for accessible generative AI . For the crypto world, this development is particularly exciting, aligning with the values of transparency, decentralization, and community-driven innovation.

The analyst, reviewing the 4-hour candlestick chart, pointed to extremely oversold RSI levels as a basis for this outlook. Although a bounce appears to be the more probable outcome, there is still a 30 to 40% chance of a short-term drop into deeper support territory. Dogecoin RSI Dips Below 10 On 4-Hour Chart To Possibly Extend Decline The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis indicator used to measure an asset’s momentum. When above 70, the asset is considered overbought, meaning it might be due for a price correction or pullback. On the other hand, readings below 30 are considered oversold, meaning that the asset might be undervalued and could bounce upward soon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Turns Bullish With 1-Day RSI In Oversold Region, Why DOGE Can Reach $0.9 In the case of Dogecoin, the meme coin has been under intense selling pressure since the beginning of March. This selling pressure has seen it lose most of its price gains in late 2024 and break below notable support pressure. This, in turn, has seen the RSI fall towards the oversold levels across multiple timeframes. According to the technical overview, the Relative Strength Index on the 1-hour timeframe is between 25 and 27, signaling strong oversold conditions. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped even lower, falling beneath 10, which typically indicates an asset is due for a corrective bounce. The daily RSI is currently hovering around 32 to 33, still above the oversold zone but trending downward. These readings suggest that while bearish pressure is present, the setup of a bounce from oversold levels increasingly favors a rebound as buyers look to re-enter near support. Analyst Sees Bounce Toward $0.172–$0.175 As More Probable Outcome According to the analyst, the break of the RSI below the oversold levels points to a decline toward the $0.1580 and $0.1590 support region. Despite the possibility of a decline toward the $0.1580 to $0.1590 support region, the analyst noted a higher probability (around 60 to 70%) of a near-term bounce after hitting this support region, possibly targeting the $0.172 to $0.175 range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Stages Bounce From Lower Border Of Second Falling Wedge, New Targets Unlocked? The projection hinges on Dogecoin’s possible reaction to such a deeply oversold RSI level. The analyst emphasized that this is an assumption rather than financial advice, but the technical context supports the likelihood of a relief rally if the support holds. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1649, down by 3.6% in the past 24 hours. With both downside and upside scenarios laid out, short-term Dogecoin price action now depends on how the market reacts at the current $0.165 level. A move toward $0.172 or higher could unfold quickly if buyers step in right now. However, if selling continues, Dogecoin might continue its decline throughout the week before attempting a recovery.

The crypto market never sleeps, and right now, Qubetics ($TICS), Bittensor (TAO), and Tron (TRX) are making headlines with major developments. Bittensor is transforming artificial intelligence by decentralizing machine learning models, while Tron is pushing deeper into decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. Both projects are gaining momentum, making them key contenders in the market. But Qubetics is the one stealing the spotlight. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it’s solving one of crypto’s biggest problems—bridging fragmented blockchain ecosystems. More importantly, its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace is unlocking new ways for people and businesses to trade real-world assets on-chain. With its presale already surpassing millions, Qubetics is gaining serious traction, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in today . Qubetics: The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization The world is filled with valuable assets—real estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property—yet most remain inaccessible to everyday people due to high entry barriers and liquidity issues. Qubetics is changing that through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which converts these physical assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or used as collateral on the blockchain. A real estate owner, for example, can tokenize a luxury apartment, allowing people across the globe to own fractional shares. No need for hefty down payments or complex legal paperwork—just direct access to real estate ownership through blockchain technology. The same applies to high-value assets like gold, oil, patents, and even rare collectibles, making Qubetics a game-changer in asset digitization. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, meaning it unifies multiple blockchains, eliminating the headache of cross-chain compatibility. Whether someone holds Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche assets, Qubetics allows seamless transactions across chains. For businesses, this means borderless commerce without limitations. With regulatory discussions heating up around RWA tokenization, analysts predict Qubetics is at the forefront of a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Presale: A Rare Opportunity The Qubetics presale is making waves for all the right reasons. Unlike many projects that drag on for months, Qubetics has a strict 7-day stage system, with each stage ending every Sunday at 12 AM. At the close of every stage, the price automatically increases by 10%, rewarding early buyers.

Per a report from the Russian newspaper Kommersant , the ban would apply only in the southern part of the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk, but could run until mid-2031. Irkutsk Mining Ban Incoming? Miners in southern Irkutsk have already been ordered to shut down their rigs in the winter months until 2031. Inside a crypto mining data center in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: GetBailkal/YouTube/Screenshot) But many miners have remained in the area on the understanding that they can operate unimpeded in warmer months. However, top officials warned earlier this year that the existing ban was not doing enough to ease pressure on local power grids. Kommersant, a media outlet known to enjoy good relations with the Kremlin, said its sources had revealed the Russian government “may impose a total ban on mining in the southern part of the Irkutsk region as early as April 1.” As Russia’s first BTC mining hub, southern Irkutsk is home to several large mining centers, which collectively consume around 650 MW of power. A total ban would be highly problematic to these centers, industry insiders told the newspaper. They added that “in the event of a ban,” they would be powerless to act “due to difficulties connecting to networks in other regions.” Many nearby regions have also imposed wintertime crypto mining bans, a fact that could leave miners with no choice other than to relocate. Trump ‘p—ed off’ with Putin as Ukraine ceasefire talks stall https://t.co/2xkkA64x13 — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) March 30, 2025 Governors Intervenes As previously reported, Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev wrote to the Kremlin earlier this year to ask for its cooperation . Kobzev said the power currently provided to miners should be used to “implement socio-economic tasks that are important for the region.” Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev. (Source: AIST TV/YouTube/Screenshot) The media outlet noted that neither the Ministry of Energy nor the offices of the Governor of the Irkutsk Oblast responded to its request for official comment. However, the outlet reported that President Vladimir Putin had replied that he had agreed to “consider and support” Kobzev’s request “in the interests of the region.” The newspaper claimed its (anonymous) sources said the matter was discussed at a government-led power industry summit in Moscow on March 27. “Based on the results of the meeting, [the government] will likely decide to grant the [governor’s request],” Kommersant’s “sources” claimed. Sergei Bezdelov, the head of the nation’s biggest crypto mining group, the Industrial Mining Association, said his association was “against any form of prohibition.” A church in central Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) North of Region to Escape Ban? Kobzev has previously claimed that his plans would leave industrial miners in the north of the oblast free to continue with their work. But Kobzev has claimed that power shortages in southern Irkutsk are now becoming critical. He stated that “over the past five years,” energy consumption in the Irkutsk region has “grown by 28%” The governor blamed mining for contributing to an energy deficit in the region. He said that the deficit could grow to 2.9 GW by 2030 if no action were taken. The entirety of Siberia has become a hub for Russian crypto miners due to its low electricity prices and famously long and cold winters. Officials think that total mining load in the region now stands at 1.066 GW, with miners in the north using 419 MW and southern miners using 647 MW. Legal, industrial miners account for the vast majority (84%) of the energy usage. Kobzev said that mining firms have already obtained permission to bring another 1.272 GW of capacity online in the area. Russia and the United States have started talks on joint rare earth metals and other projects in Russia, and some companies have already expressed an interest in them, President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy said https://t.co/VMYTz33cgb — Reuters (@Reuters) March 31, 2025 Irkutsk Mining Bans Already Helping Save Energy, Officials Claim Irkutsk officials say that the existing ban, which came into force in January this year, has already helped reduce monthly power consumption by 305 MW per month. Kobzev also claimed that small-scale, quasi-legal crypto miners are also causing a drain on the local grid. He stated that “commercial consumers operating at low voltages” were using over 160 MW of power per month. A leading Russian economist has warned Moscow against developing a national strategic Bitcoin reserve, calling crypto stockpiles a “ticking time bomb.” #BitcoinReserve #Russia https://t.co/MSkCrobQPI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 Despite the power issues in Siberia, Irkutsk energy prices for consumers using over 10 MW per month are still “among the most attractive in the country,” Kommersant wrote. The media outlet wrote that commercial and industrial consumers typically pay prices of around 5 rubles ($0.059) per kWh. Most Russian crypto mining experts think that around 90% of domestic industrial miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) .

On Sunday, Musk said he believed his role in DOGE was affecting Tesla’s share price. He spoke about the matter during a town hall event in Wisconsin, where he has been campaigning in the state’s supreme court election. According to Musk, those who oppose his efforts to slash government jobs under President Donald Trump’s administration have tried to pressure him by going after Tesla. Musk speaking at a Town Hall event in Wisconsin. Source: Fox 9 “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to … stop doing this,” Musk said, referring to his work with the Trump White House. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.” Tesla’s share price was already down 35.83% for the year before Monday’s market opening, which means that the stock has nearly been cut in half compared to its peak in December. Shares slid another 1.7% on Monday. Despite this downturn, Musk offered some hope for shareholders, calling the price drop a possible “buying opportunity” for people who believe in the company’s long-term prospects. Tesla stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Musk was in Wisconsin to support a conservative candidate in a closely watched supreme court election. He has contributed more than $12 million on the campaign, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at a rally on Sunday for signing a petition against what he described as “activist judges.” Though Musk’s political influence has come into the spotlight recently, signs of trouble at Tesla had already begun to appear. The electric car maker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary figures suggest sales continue to slump this year in key markets like Europe. Other car manufacturers in the U.S. have also stumbled amid warnings about rising tariffs on imported goods. Potential trade conflicts could disrupt a tightly woven network of parts suppliers spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, causing more problems for an industry still recovering from past supply chain challenges. Tesla’s troubles, then, may be part of a broader challenge facing American automakers. Yet many see the Tesla case as unique because of Musk’s sudden shift into high-profile politics. Since the Trump administration began in January, Musk has become a familiar face around the White House. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024, regularly offers opinions on political matters through his social media company X, and now holds a top seat in DOGE. For critics, this raises concerns about where Musk’s focus lies: on running an electric vehicle firm or serving as a powerful government insider. Protestors swarmed Tesla’s showrooms on the weekend Protests escalated on Saturday as anti-Musk activists swarmed Tesla showrooms and service centers. They called it the “Tesla Takedown.” According to the protestors, the goal was to oppose Musk’s political activities and his efforts to slash government spending under Trump. Musk has already gained access to the highly sensitive information of federal employees. Consequently, more than 277 Tesla locations across the country saw some form of demonstration, though the size of the crowd varied by city. In states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, turnouts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred. People held signs reading, “Honk if you hate Elon” and “Fight the billionaire broligarchy.” In Texas, Musk’s home state, and in Minnesota, Maryland, and other parts of the country, similar protests took place. Social media images showed picketers standing in front of Tesla showrooms, chanting slogans and waving banners. A protestor outside a Tesla store in Texas. Source: CBS Texas A small but visible group of counterprotesters also gathered at some locations, voicing support for President Trump and, by extension, Musk. In Dublin, California, across from a showroom where dozens of activists chanted, a few Trump supporters waved American flags. A bigger protest was observed near Berkeley, where participants claimed that Musk’s ties to the administration were pushing the country in a dangerous direction. “We’re living in a fascist state,” said a retired high school teacher at the Berkeley demonstration. “We need to stop this or we’ll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.” Protesters should up with various signs calling Elon a “Fascist.” Source: ABC News Outside the U.S., anti-Musk sentiment is also growing. Protesters gathered at more than 230 Tesla sites worldwide, including in European cities like London. Though the crowds there were smaller, the messages were similar. Signs compared Musk to Adolf Hitler and accused him of using a straight-arm salute after Trump’s inauguration. The protest in London drew a handful of Americans living abroad who felt compelled to speak out. One participant in London held a sign labeling Tesla cars as “Swasticars,” a jarring reference to Nazi Germany. “We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we’re facing,” said one of the protesters, describing Musk’s alliance with the Trump White House as a risk for democracy. The Tesla Takedown movement was organized by a coalition that includes people who once owned Tesla vehicles, public figures like actor John Cusack, and some Democratic lawmakers. Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas said on a recent organizing call that she would keep “screaming in the halls of Congress” to highlight Musk’s actions. On Saturday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal appeared at a protest in Seattle, describing Musk’s role in DOGE as a “dangerous mixing of corporate power and government access.” A mother showed up to my recent town hall, crying because she was worried about being able to access health care for her new baby. This is Donald Trump — breaking institutions, sowing chaos and confusion, and striking fear into Americans. No matter your politics, that’s wrong. pic.twitter.com/da4FtqZWDv — Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) March 31, 2025 Some individuals have reportedly set Tesla vehicles on fire, an act that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has condemned as domestic terrorism. Musk, for his part, has labeled those committing these crimes as “psychos” and asked them to stop. Authorities in Germany are investigating a blaze that destroyed seven Tesla cars early Saturday, though it was unclear if it was connected to the broader protests. In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police said a black pickup side mirror struck two people at a demonstration outside a Tesla service center. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries, and officials quickly identified the suspect. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Despite the landmark $50 million fine settlement—significantly down from the original $125 million —XRP’s market reaction has been lukewarm, hovering around $2.13 as of March 30, 2025. As Ripple struggles to reclaim past momentum, investors are eagerly shifting their focus to MAGACOIN FINANCE, an emerging cryptocurrency that has already raised an impressive $4.5 million in its ongoing presale. Investor demand is skyrocketing, with Phase 6 of its presale already 90% sold out . XRP Stuck at $2.13 After Legal Clarity Ripple Labs’ SEC settlement on March 25, 2025, initially sparked optimism, but XRP has struggled to maintain bullish momentum. The cryptocurrency currently trades at: Current Price: $2.13 Intraday High: $2.21 Intraday Low: $2.08 24-Hour Change: +0.019% Although some analysts forecast XRP could reach between $5 to $7 by mid-2025, the recent lackluster price action has cast doubt on the token’s future growth prospects. Investors seeking substantial returns are increasingly looking elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE: $4.5M Raised as Investors Rush In Amid Ripple’s subdued market performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a compelling alternative for crypto investors seeking significant returns. MAGACOIN has already raised over $4,500,000 from enthusiastic investors during its ongoing presale. Investor demand has been exceptional, with Phase 6 now 90% sold out . Market experts attribute MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive popularity to its well-structured tokenomics, ambitious growth strategy, and the potential for substantial returns—predicting the token will comfortably reach $1 by 2025. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE’s $1 Milestone Matters Achieving the $1 milestone would firmly establish MAGACOIN FINANCE as a major cryptocurrency player, validating the project’s fundamentals and sparking further investor enthusiasm. Analysts predict that crossing the $1 threshold could trigger a wave of increased market demand, driving the price even higher. Given XRP’s limited upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s clear path to rapid growth presents investors with a compelling alternative. Its presale success—raising over $4.5 million already—is proof of robust market confidence. Ripple (XRP) vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investor Demand Speaks Volumes The stark contrast between XRP’s stagnant price action and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surging presale illustrates where investor confidence is shifting. XRP’s uncertain market outlook, compounded by its inability to rally significantly post-settlement, contrasts sharply with the bullish sentiment surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Phase 6 now almost entirely sold out, investors who act now are positioned for maximum returns before prices inevitably climb in future presale stages.

Shiba Inu’s significant token burn and Layer-2 developments, along with Chainlink’s goal of reaching $20, showcase strong market narratives—yet, they focus primarily on market sentiment and trading movements. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) moves its focus from market speculation to operational efficiency. The Beta Testnet is not about market predictions but about proving functionality. With more than 15,000 transactions processed daily and over 200 nodes participating, BlockDAG rigorously tests its infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet debut in 2025. While other projects focus on market dynamics, BlockDAG is setting the standard for technological preparedness. Shiba Inu’s Token Burn Soars Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a remarkable increase in its token burn rate, with more than 1 billion tokens eliminated from circulation in just one day—a 57,000% rise. This increase mainly came from a single entity sending 1 billion SHIB to an unrecoverable address. Despite this intense burn rate, SHIB’s market price has stayed stable, trading around $0.00001443, which is a 55% drop from its peak this year. Technical analysis shows a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, indicating a possible bullish trend. This pattern might push the price up by about 130%, aiming for $0.00003395. Furthermore, Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 solution, is nearing a total of 1 billion transactions, showing increased use and activity. The network has already handled nearly 975 million transactions, supports over 245,000 accounts, and has generated more than 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Aims for $20 Amid Positive Trends Chainlink’s token, LINK, is currently on an upward trajectory after exiting a downward channel that started in February 2025. LINK now stabilizes at $15.15, with aspirations to break the $20 barrier soon. The recent upturn has pushed LINK above the 200 EMA, setting it on a path toward $19.30, with the $20 level being a key target for market participants. Supporting this positive trend, on-chain data shows that LINK’s social engagement is at a peak, hinting at increased interest from the market. Moreover, a spike in development activities since early March 2025 and a decrease in LINK available on exchanges suggest that major holders are accumulating, pointing to optimistic forecasts for LINK’s market performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet’s Final Stages Before 2025 Mainnet As it gears up for its 2025 mainnet release, BlockDAG has reached a crucial stage with its Beta “Primordial” Testnet. This phase isn’t just for show but a thorough evaluation of the network’s systems to ensure they meet essential performance and security standards when they go live. The testnet mimics peak load conditions to check how the system handles stress. BlockDAG aims to process at least 15,000 transactions daily and maintain over 200 active mining nodes to test its scalability and decentralized nature. Additionally, the testnet scrutinizes wallet functionality, ensuring smooth integration with MetaMask and effective operation across various platforms. Developers are putting smart contracts to work, dApps are being utilized by users, and the token vesting process is being tested with over 110,000 accounts. The insights and data collected now are vital for making any necessary adjustments before the final launch. The project is also building momentum with $209.5 million secured in its presale, 19 billion coins distributed, and an ROI of 2,380% since the first batch. With coins now priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is demonstrating the robustness of its infrastructure as it prepares for launch. In essence, the testnet serves as a comprehensive rehearsal for the mainnet, allowing both users and developers to anticipate the actual launch experience. For BlockDAG, this is the ultimate preparation for making the launch a reality. Shaping Future Viability Through Real-Time Testing While market movements and investor interest can generate short-term momentum, the longevity of a technology comes from its ability to perform reliably under real-world conditions. Shiba Inu’s recent token burn and Chainlink’s positive market trends have captured the market’s interest, relying heavily on speculative responses. In contrast, BlockDAG is rigorously validating its infrastructure with its ongoing Beta Testnet. It’s processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging numerous miners, and seamlessly integrating smart contracts and wallet functionality. While other projects speculate on potential outcomes, BlockDAG is gathering concrete evidence on what actually works. The focus is on tangible results, distinguishing it from projects driven by market speculation.

Pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 353,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks DOGE could witness a 33% corrective move if it loses a key support area. “DOGE $0.11-$0.12 range incoming. Mark $0.16.” In a strategy session, Cheds explains why he thinks DOGE could tumble before potentially bottoming out. “There’s no reason to get excited [about DOGE]. It’s a bad chart. It looks like [$0.11] is going to come and test lower. [DOGE has] a really strong descending supply trend.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.166. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the crypto strategist believes that the native asset of the top smart contract protocol is headed toward its high time frame support at around $1,000. “ETH now $1,840 from $3,400 below. Probably worth a sniff when it tags the $1,200-$1,300 range.” Source: Cheds/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $1,808. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , Cheds says that bulls have the upper hand as long as the coin is trading above $2. But he also says that holders should consider paring back risk if XRP moves below the key price level. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.12.

XRP’s price has soared following a regulatory victory as Ripple concludes its prolonged legal conflict with the SEC, while Solana’s collaboration with Polymarket has fueled talks of its price reaching $1,000. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet has been diligently crafting a robust framework with its dependable support system and developer-oriented design. In contrast to the fluctuating paths of other ventures, BlockDAG (BDAG) consistently prioritizes stability and support for developers, distinguishing it in the field. XRP’s Price Boost: Regulatory Progress XRP, tied to Ripple Labs, has seen a significant price rise, jumping more than 8% recently. This increase follows the announcement by Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC has concluded its lawsuit initiated four years ago against the firm. This legal battle, started in 2020, challenged Ripple over raising $1.4 billion via unregistered XRP sales. Its resolution mirrors a regulatory evolution under the current government, which appears more open to cryptocurrencies. For example, the SEC has also dismissed actions against other cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase and Robinhood. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)’s approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is poised to boost XRP’s role in international transactions. These developments have thus reinforced confidence, driving up XRP’s price. Polymarket Boosts Solana’s Momentum Polymarket’s recent decision to accept Solana (SOL) deposits has energized the cryptocurrency community. Users can now transfer SOL directly to their prediction market wallets, extending Polymarket’s reach and increasing its platform activity. Following this news, SOL’s price quickly rose by 7% to $140, with a significant 143% jump in daily trading volumes hitting $4.18 billion. This enthusiasm has sparked debates about SOL’s potential climb to the $1,000 threshold. Moreover, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently apologized for a controversial ad, affirming the project’s commitment to community involvement. These actions collectively highlight Solana’s growing market presence and the community’s faith in its future direction. Constant Support: BlockDAG’s Commitment During Beta Testnet BlockDAG’s dedication to user satisfaction and operational dependability is evident in its extensive support system. As the Beta Testnet phase progresses, users, developers, and miners benefit from continuous technical support through the Freshdesk platform. The 24/7 Antier 1st Level Support Desk effectively manages queries, quickly resolving them or forwarding complex issues to the specialized BlockDAG support team. For more complicated technical problems, Antier developers are prepared to intervene, ensuring the testing process runs smoothly with little interruption. This proactive and comprehensive support structure is crucial during the Beta Testnet phase, where network stability and smooth integration are key. BlockDAG’s approachable and responsive support line builds user trust and promotes greater engagement from developers and miners. This strategy supports the project’s goals of stability, scalability, and prompt issue resolution. Financially, BlockDAG’s notable crypto presale success has established a strong foundation for its future. The project has amassed an impressive $209.5 million during the presale, with the current batch at number 27 and a batch price of $0.0248. The ROI since the first batch has reached a remarkable 2,380%, illustrating the project’s quick momentum and increasing community support. To date, over 19 billion coins have been purchased, underscoring the widespread enthusiasm and confidence in BlockDAG’s future potential. Building a Strong Base Amid Market Shifts While XRP and Solana are in the spotlight with regulatory victories and strategic partnerships, BlockDAG is establishing a foundation for sustained success with practical and dependable initiatives. Its Beta Testnet focuses on more than just market speculation, emphasizing stability, developer involvement, and strong support. In contrast to projects that fluctuate with market conditions, BlockDAG emphasizes steady performance and community trust.

Coinbase And Others Face Increased Volatility According to Bloomberg, Coinbase’s stock has dropped more than 30% since the beginning of the quarter, marking its worst performance since the collapse of the FTX exchange in late 2022. This decline is reflective of a broader trend affecting nearly all major crypto-linked stocks, including companies like Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY.TO), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The cryptocurrency market itself is experiencing turmoil, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling over 20% from its all-time high and Ethereum (ETH) plummeting more than 45% in value. These shifts come amid President Donald Trump’s escalation of a “global trade war,” which has stirred fears about the health of the country’s economy. Economic data has exacerbated these concerns, pushing the S&P 500 Index (GSPC) toward its worst quarter since mid-2022. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau noted that many within the cryptocurrency community recognize that the current market conditions are not primarily driven by fundamental factors. Instead, Lau emphasized that macroeconomic issues—such as tariffs and the potential trade war—are influencing investor sentiment significantly. The looming threat of a recession has reportedly added to the unease, causing higher-risk crypto-linked stocks to be even more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Lau explains that investments in companies like Coinbase carry additional risks, including the potential for bankruptcy, allegedly making them particularly susceptible to swift sell-offs. Cryptocurrency Market Struggles To Rebound The current state of the cryptocurrency market is a stark contrast to the optimism that prevailed at the start of the year, following Trump’s election. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $109,000 on Inauguration Day. Earlier this month, Bitcoin prices fell after Trump announced a strategic reserve for the market’s leading crypto, but did not allocate taxpayer funds to expand it. As of now, Bitcoin trades around $83,000, still above pre-election levels but far from its peak. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key While shares of various crypto-related companies surged following the election, Coinbase and crypto miners have since relinquished those gains. Notably, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) is among the few stocks in the sector that has managed to remain in positive territory since November 5. Despite the downturn, the cryptocurrency industry continues to gain influence in Washington and is moving closer to integration with traditional financial systems. However, this growing power has yet to translate into a market rebound. Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, expressed skepticism about the current state of investor sentiment, stating, “What we saw a couple of months ago, I don’t know how much crazier it can get than that. I think we’re going to have to be looking for new catalysts.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|coin|COIN stocks|coinbase|coinbase news|crypto|Crypto Exchange Coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-01 00:00:40

Over the past weeks, since he vowed to turn Poland into a crypto haven, Sławomir Mentzen has moved closer to participating in a likely run-off in June. The nationalist candidate is most popular among young Poles who often flock to his rallies. Observers say this is largely due to his quite active presence on social media. Mentzen has been also attracting followers with a program that draws inspiration from U.S. President Donald Trump’s political messages. Mentzen approaches run-off territory in recent Polish polls Polish voters will be going to the ballot boxes on May 18 to elect their new president this year. The incumbent, Andrzej Duda, is nearing the end of his second and last five-year term in office and won’t be able to run again under the country’s constitution. While none of the leading candidates is expected to win in the first round, Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, nominated by Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s center-right, liberal-conservative Civic Platform (PO) party is the clear front-runner. Second in opinion polls is historian Karol Nawrocki, head of the Institute of National Remembrance, who is backed by President Duda’s right-wing, national-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) party. His place in the potential second round on June 1 is now challenged by Sławomir Mentzen. Co za zakończenie dnia! Dziękuję Oława! Jesteście niesamowici! pic.twitter.com/lTNSMIfroh — Sławomir Mentzen (@SlawomirMentzen) March 29, 2025 The latter is the candidate of the far-right political alliance Confederation Liberty and Independence (Konfederacja). He launched his campaign at the end of August, earlier than his competitors, and has been narrowing the gap between him and the mainstream leaders. Mentzen is still third in the race but a survey conducted by the Polish research company Opinia24 in mid-March showed him with 18.9%, less than a percentage point behind Nawrocki at 19.5%. Trzaskowski is well ahead of both with the support of 32% of the respondents, although that’s not enough for a first round win. The results were published by RMF24 which ordered the poll. The Polish news outlet highlighted Sławomir Mentzen’s continuous gain over the past few months. He has added 2 percentage points since February and is 8 points above his December score. Pro-crypto presidential candidate leads among young voters Polling numbers quoted by Politico are also registering Mentzen’s ascend throughout the race but pointing to a larger difference between him and Nawrocki. RMF24 noted, however, that Opinia24’s pre-election forecast for the 2023 parliamentary vote, when Mentzen won a seat in the Polish Sejm , was credited as the most accurate. Young Poles is the segment where Mentzen confidently leads, according to Opinia. Some 46% of those aged 18 to 29 have declared their intention to vote for Konfederacja’s 38-year-old candidate. He is also ranked first by Polish citizens in the 30-39 bracket and has a slight advantage over Trzaskowski among male voters. Sławomir Mentzen has been relying heavily on popular platforms like Tiktok and X as well as Youtube to convey his views, a mix of conservative, nationalistic and libertarian ideas. He “has made social media his home,” the European political news website Euractiv pointed out in a recent article. His election program titled “Strong Rich Poland” abounds with political messages mirroring Donald Trump’s campaign promises such as ensuring “tight borders,” providing “defense of free speech,” “reducing bureaucracy,” and introducing “low and simple taxes.” He insists “Poland needs a strong army” but says “No to Polish troops in Ukraine.” Poland should create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If I become the President of Poland, our country will become a cryptocurrency haven, with very friendly regulations, low taxes, and a supportive approach from banks and regulators. BTC to the Moon! pic.twitter.com/izKc4spkkV — Sławomir Mentzen (@SlawomirMentzen) November 17, 2024 A full paragraph in his 20-point platform is dedicated to crypto. The Polish state fights it because it can’t control it, Mentzen says, vowing “to strive to free up cryptocurrency trading” and “ensure Poland has the most crypto-friendly law in the entire European Union.” In a post on X in November, he also embraced Trump’s bitcoin reserve initiative. Sławomir Mentzen holds a degree in physics and a PhD in economics after defending a doctoral thesis on public debt at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in his hometown of Toruń. Besides politics, he has been involved in business as well, having owned a law firm and a beer brand. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Trump said on Sunday that no country would be given any special treatment regarding tariffs. He also signed new trade policies into effect on April 2 , which he calls “Liberation Day.” This frightened investors, who had expected a softer trade stance. Trump’s remarks set off a market-wide sell-off led by tech stocks . Shares in Tesla fell over 5%, the biggest decline for the “Magnificent Seven” tech behemoths. Already in the crosshairs of new trade restrictions, Nvidia saw its stock also tumble. New tariffs disrupt Nvidia’s role in the AI arms race An imminent 25% tariff from the US government on goods from Mexico and Canada directly impacts Nvidia . The company produces advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence (AI) servers. So, many of these AI servers are put together in Mexico and driven across the border into the US. According to trade data, the US imported $43 billion in computers, including AI servers, from Mexico in 2024. The company expects new tariffs to increase the cost of such servers, which could decrease demand for Nvidia’s AI chips. Taiwan, also a key source of Nvidia’s GPU supply, could also see the extension of trade controls. In 2024, the US imported $33 billion worth of computer parts, including Nvidia-powered printed circuit boards, from Taiwan. The tech firm’s production costs could increase if Trump hits Taiwan with more tariffs. Nvidia gears up for major changes ahead The short-term effects of the tariffs will take time to play out, but Nvidia is already looking ahead. At its latest GTC conference , CEO Jensen Huang answered questions about trade restrictions, specifying that export control restrictions concerning artificial intelligence and China were the reason behind the firm’s challenges. He acknowledged that tariffs would have “a little impact” on the company in the short term, but he also stressed that Nvidia is pursuing longer-term solutions. One important step toward that goal is expanding production in the US. Huang cited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ‘s $100 billion investment to develop new chip factories in the United States. TSMC is a major manufacturing partner for Nvidia, and the move potentially helps mitigate overreliance on overseas factories in the future. However, Nvidia’s stock has faced pressure in 2025. As of Monday morning, it had fallen almost 22% from the start of the year. Before Trump made his most recent comments, analysts said the stock market had yet to fully digest the new tariffs’ impact. Now, some financial experts are cautioning that investors should also consider how these longer-term rules governing trade will inform the industry. Even before Trump’s latest remarks, some analysts had cautioned that the market was not yet properly pricing the full effects of these tariffs. According to Josh Schafer of Yahoo Finance reports, many investors underestimated the extent and scope of Trump’s trade policies. The market now sees how serious and long-term these tariffs could be, said Henrietta Treyz, an economic policy expert at Veda Partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

33767162,[object Object],1743467420,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Bleeds $630M as Crypto Fund Outflows Accelerate for Second Week Straight,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleeds-630m-crypto-fund-outflows-accelerate/,"Crypto asset investment products faced another week of outflows last week, marking the second consecutive week of investor pullback. According to the latest weekly report released by CoinShares, total outflows amounted to $584 million, pushing the two-week outflow total to roughly $1.2 billion. This shift highlights a cautious sentiment among investors, particularly in light of macroeconomic factors. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, linked the trend to ongoing uncertainty about interest rate policy in the US. The report also noted a significant drop in market participation, with exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally recording just $6.9 billion in traded volume for the week — the lowest since US spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in January. Bitcoin Leads Outflows While Altcoins Show Pockets of Strength The United States saw the highest fund exits with $475 million in outflows, followed by Canada with $109 million. Germany and Hong Kong also registered $24 million and $19 million in respective outflows. In contrast, Switzerland and Brazil stood out as exceptions , recording inflows of $39 million and $48.5 million. Bitcoin remained at the center of the movement, accounting for $630 million in weekly outflows. However, sentiment did not shift heavily toward bearish bets, as short Bitcoin products also saw minor outflows totaling $1.2 million, suggesting a lack of conviction in downside positioning. Ethereum also experienced $58 million in outflows, reflecting broader risk aversion. However, several altcoins bucked the trend, with Solana, Litecoin, and Polygon witnessing modest inflows of $2.7 million, $1.3 million, and $1 million respectively. These movements indicate that some investors may be seeking exposure to alternative assets amid price corrections. Multi-asset products stood out as a contrasting trend, attracting $98 million in inflows. This may suggest that investors are diversifying their portfolios or taking advantage of recent altcoin weaknesses to allocate across multiple assets. Investor Behavior Shaped by Macro Sentiment CoinShares’ data reflects a market environment still heavily influenced by macroeconomic outlooks and central bank policy expectations. With investor anticipation for interest rate cuts declining, digital asset fund flows have turned negative after months of consistent inflows earlier this year. James Butterfill noted: We believe this is in reaction to the pessimism amongst investors for the prospect of interest rate cuts by the FED this year. Notably. the decrease in ETP trading volume could also reflect a broader lull in investor engagement as markets wait for further direction. While Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers of the recent outflows, the inflows into certain altcoins and multi-asset products point to nuanced sentiment rather than broad-based risk-off behavior.

Now priced at $0.70, that’s a more than 300% rally for ADA to reach this goal. But skepticism simmers as network action fades — daily transactions plunged 70% from late 2024, falling to 26,437 by early March 2025. With bullish patterns and rising social sentiment suggesting support for a potential 20% bounce towards $0.85, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi upstart whose presale momentum and tokenomics could leave ADA’s subdued outlook in the dust. The Uncertain Horizon of Cardano Price dynamics of Cardano are still trapped in the paradoxes. However, despite ascending social optimism—partially driven by the SEC’s suddenly non-securities classification of ADA—the network’s utility metrics fare poorly. Analysts draw attention to the bullish “flag” pattern that has been developing since December 2024, as is characteristic for a precursor to rallies, but declining transactional activity erodes confidence. Before ADA can reach its 2025 price peak of $1.20, it has to break the $0.85 resistance zone, equivalent to a 20% increase from where it is right now. Yet, skeptics wonder if deflating adoption can be the foundation for long-term growth, prompting investors to look for alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for those exponential returns. The Dominance of Mutuum Finance’s Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ($0.025 — Phase 4) is expected to see 140% increase at launch ($0.06). Those who take early stage pricing now can expect a 20% profit before the next price jump brings the price to $0.03. Combine this with $5.9 million of capital already raised and 7600 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders and the algorithmic buy-pressure and revenue-redistribution tokenomics become a compelling proposition. Mutuum Finance stands out because of the self-sustaining ecosystem. Its lending protocol drives steady demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, and mtTokens—deposit certificates that earn interest—generate supplemental yield streams. This incremental design of the presale, currently at its fourth of eleven stages, encourages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors to get in on the action as soon as possible, with each tier raising the price to reward those who act fast. Favourable post-launch predictions fuelled by both exchange listings and platform adoption dictate a rise to $1.50–$3.50 in under a few months, equating with a 5,900%–14,000% ROI for phase-four contributors. Strategic Growth & Security Mutuum Finance’s approach is driven by transparency A Certik audit is in progress for its smart contracts, with public release of results expected after they are finalized. Coupled with a tokenomics plan to dampen sell pressure, this specializing in security makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a high reward, low risk entry. Unlike speculative assets, its value is directly correlated to platform usage — every loan issued and every deposit made increases the demand for the token. As Cardano struggles with stagnating utility and Solana wrestles with volatility, Mutuum Finance becomes the presale phenomenon of 2025. As phase four fills quickly and exchange listings are on the horizon, the fusion of DeFi innovation and strategic tokenomics offers a clear path to outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale marks a rare moment of urgency and opportunity for investors who are looking for a safe harbour from volatile markets. Seize the Momentum Mutuum Finance’s fourth presale phase is counting down the clock. Next 20% price jump is around the corner – $0.03 per token; after the launch, triple-digit returns.

The cryptocurrency was closing in on the $90,000 psychological level but has since reversed direction, falling by 6.4% over the past week to hover around $82,000 at the time of writing. This decline has placed renewed attention on market metrics that suggest the rally may have been short-lived. Amid this downward movement, several on-chain analysts have raised questions about whether recent price trends reflect real demand or speculative behavior. Particularly, insights from CryptoQuant contributors point to warning signs, including a divergence between market capitalization and actual network activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead NVT Indicator Signals Caution Amid Low Transaction Volume In a recent post titled “Manipulative Moves or True Value? A Bitcoin and NVT Analysis,” CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest pointed to the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio as a critical metric for understanding current market dynamics. The NVT ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market capitalization by its daily transaction volume. According to BorisVest, Bitcoin’s elevated NVT Golden Cross reading indicates a high market cap against low transaction activity — a combination that historically suggests price inflation driven by speculative interest rather than organic growth. BorisVest emphasized that periods with a high NVT often precede market corrections. In contrast, when the NVT falls into the green zone — signaling a low market cap with rising transaction volume — it may present a stronger foundation for price appreciation. As of now, the metric suggests Bitcoin’s recent price rise lacks transactional support, and continued pullbacks remain possible unless volume returns to the network. Bitcoin Speculators Absent, Sentiment Remains Cautious Adding to the cautious outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor known as crypto sunmoon highlighted the role of leverage in driving crypto bull markets. The analyst pointed out that funding rates have recently “dead-crossed,” which occurs when short-term funding rates fall below long-term rates, often indicating bearish sentiment among traders. According to sunmoon, this shift suggests that speculators are currently unwilling to take on risk — a key component needed to fuel bullish price movements. The analyst concluded that the return of speculative trading behavior, typically marked by rising funding rates and leveraged positions, is essential for reigniting upward momentum in Bitcoin.

This will be the firm’s first open-weight release since GPT-2, a decision that had been delayed due to other priorities but now feels essential. Per the update, the novel model is expected to bring strong reasoning capabilities and provide simplicity for developers and organizations. From OpenAI ChatGPT to Sora It is worth mentioning that Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, shared the news on X, expressing excitement about making the model highly effective. More importantly, this announcement follows OpenAI’s history of launching novel AI products. Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the tool has become widely used for text-based tasks. This Large Language Model transformed how people from different parts of the world interact with artificial intelligence . As reported by CoinGape, In 2024, OpenAI introduced Sora, an advanced video generation model. In addition, the release of voice Chat further improved AI’s role by allowing seamless spoken interactions. Interestingly, these notable innovations have redefined how AI integrates into daily life. Now, OpenAI is moving toward open-weight models. This will allow greater customization. For example, businesses, developers, and governments that prefer self-hosted AI solutions will be able to modify the model for specific needs. This new project could lead to wider adoption and new applications across various industries. ChatGPT Developer Involvement and Future Trends Before releasing the project to the public, OpenAI seeks developers’ input through a series of sessions. According to Sam Altman, the events will begin in San Francisco, followed by meetings in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As detailed, developers will gain early access to prototypes, providing insight into potential applications. Altman confirmed that OpenAI will evaluate the model using its preparedness framework. Since open-weight models can be altered post-release, additional security measures will be implemented. By involving developers early, OpenAI intends to fuse innovation and responsibility. This will ensure that the model is both effective and safe for people to use. Another Studio Ghibli Trend Ahead? It is important to add that AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork has shown how artificial intelligence can shape creative industries. For context, when OpenAI added image generation to ChatGPT-4o, people started making Studio Ghibli-style portraits, and the trend quickly spread. Even Elon Musk joined the Ghibli trend . Still, this new trend has raised certain questions about the future of creative art. Still, with OpenAI’s new model on the way, another wave of AI-generated content could take off. As AI keeps improving, it may bring new ways for people to create and share.

The privacy tool, launched by Ethereum builders 0xbow.io on March 31, earned support from the likes of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who not only backed the privacy project but made one of the first deposits on the platform. 0xbow.io said that it implements “Association Sets” to batch transactions into the anonymous Privacy Pools and that a screening test is conducted to ensure that those transactions aren’t linked to illicit actors, such as hackers, phishers and scammers. gm Ethereum ☀️ It is our great honor to announce the mainnet launch of Privacy Pools! ETH users can now achieve on-chain privacy, while still dissociating from illicit funds It is now up to all of us to Make Privacy Normal Again 🫡 More info in this thread 👇 pic.twitter.com/3nJO0AxoD1 — 0xbow.io (@0xbowio) March 31, 2025 The Association Sets are “dynamic” — meaning that if a transaction is admitted but later found to be illicit, it can be removed from the set without disrupting any other deposits, 0xbow.io said. If a deposit is disqualified, the user can click the “ragequit” function to return the funds to their original deposit address. The innovation is part of 0xbow.io’s vision to “Make Privacy Normal Again” while also attempting to achieve regulatory compliance. Privacy protocols have received considerable backlash from regulators in recent years due to their increasing use by illicit actors to launder funds. One of those privacy tools, Tornado Cash, was sanctioned by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) between August 2022 and March 2025 after it was linked to around $7 billion laundered by the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group. Tornado Cash has since been removed from OFAC’s blacklist after a US appeals court said the sanctions were unlawful in January 2025. 0xbow.io noted that initial deposits are limited to 1 Ether ( ETH ) but that the limit would be raised once the privacy protocol is more battle-tested. Privacy Pools inspired by Buterin and others Over 21 ETH has already been transferred into Privacy Pools from 69 deposits, including at least one from Buterin, 0xbow.io noted. Source: Vitalik Buterin In addition to Buterin, 0xbow.io said it also received investment support from Number Group, BanklessVC, Public Works and several angel investors. Related: Privacy isn’t a luxury in crypto, it’s a necessity — Midnight CEO 0xbow.io also praised Buterin, Chainalysis Chief Scientist Jacob Illum, and two academics at the University of Basel in Switzerland for crafting a September 2023 white paper outlining how Privacy Pools could be built. 0xbow.io strategic adviser Ameen Soleimani also contributed to the paper, which has seen over 12,000 downloads and has been cited in nine other papers. The Privacy Pool code also passed a successful audit from Audit Wizard. a smart contract auditing firm co-founded by former Apple engineer Joe van Loon. More than $41 billion worth of illicit transfers were made in 2024, which made up 0.14% of total onchain volume for the year, according to the Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime report published on Jan. 15. While it marked around an 11% fall from 2023, Chainalysis said that figure could climb to around $51 billion as more criminal-tied addresses are found. Magazine: What are native rollups?

Bitfinex is one of the first global exchanges to list the GUN token. Unlike typical free-to-play games where purchased or earned items remain locked within the game ecosystem, GUNZ gives players actual ownership of digital assets, meaning these items can be traded, kept, or sold on the in-game marketplace or other compatible platforms. This approach aims to provide more flexibility and control to users over the digital goods they earn during gameplay. The platform is currently featured in two games: Off The Grid (OTG), a cyberpunk-themed extraction battle royale available on PC and consoles, and Technocore , a mobile game focused on navigating a drone through complex environments while collecting loot. Players in both titles can find loot boxes known as HEXes, which, if successfully extracted, can be converted into NFTs. This mechanism links gameplay achievements with blockchain-based ownership, distinguishing GUNZ from traditional loot or cosmetic systems. Trade Gun Now What is the GUN Token? The GUN token is the native digital currency of the GUNZ gaming platform, designed to support a decentralized economy within participating games such as Off The Grid and Technocore . It serves as both a utility and reward token, enabling players to trade, purchase, and unlock in-game items and features. Unlike traditional game currencies that are confined to a single game or controlled entirely by a central authority, GUN operates on a blockchain, giving players verifiable ownership of the tokens they earn or purchase. Within the GUNZ ecosystem, GUN tokens are primarily used to facilitate transactions on the in-game marketplace, where players can buy, sell, or trade items that have been tokenized as NFTs. These items can range from weapons and cosmetic upgrades to character enhancements and hideout features. This decentralized model means players can extract real-world value from their in-game progress by exchanging digital assets in a transparent and secure environment. trade gun now GUN is also tied to gameplay incentives. Players earn tokens by completing various challenges or objectives during matches, such as ranking highly in the game, extracting loot, or using specific gear effectively. This system encourages active participation and skill development, rewarding players not only with in-game progression but with tradable digital assets.

District Court to reinstate its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against government agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) The exchange says the FDIC is still withholding some important documents and not fully cooperating with requests for information. The lawsuit seeks to force the FDIC to hand over records of its conversations with banks related to cryptocurrency actions, including the ‘pause letters’ issued to banks telling them to stop providing crypto services.” Coinbase seeks court’s intervention as FDIC cooperation falters in Operation Choke Point 2.0 dispute Coinbase has been involved in a months-long battle with the FDIC. The firm has been pursuing the FDIC over Operation Choke Point 2.0 for months now and has achieved impressive results. Despite this, Coinbase is asking the DC District Court to resume its litigation against the regulator. The legal action was initially paused in February 2025 after President Trump appointed Travis Hill as acting FDIC chairman. Hill vowed to enhance the agency’s transparency beyond FOIA requirements, raising hopes that the matter could be resolved outside of court. Still, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, says there is ongoing dissatisfaction with the FDIC’s transparency. He acknowledges that cooperation has improved under the new leadership but feels it is still not enough. “We’re asking the Court to resume our lawsuit because the FDIC has unfortunately stopped sharing information. While we would have loved to resolve this outside of the legal system – and we do appreciate the increased cooperation we’ve seen from the new FDIC leadership – we still have a ways to go,” claimed Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer. As a key US financial regulator overseeing banks, the FDIC played a central role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, restricting banks’ interactions with cryptocurrency businesses. However, it recently began a pro-crypto turn, releasing relevant documents and revoking several of its anti-crypto regulations. Grewal says that he “appreciated the increased cooperation” from the FDIC. However, he noted that the cooperation had stopped weeks ago. According to Coinbase’s filing , the FDIC hasn’t sent any new information since late February and claimed in early March that the exchange’s subsequent requests were “unreasonable and beyond the scope of discovery.” The FDIC is expected to respond to Coinbase’s motion within two weeks. Coinbase pushes for court action as FDIC’s overreach could alter the future of crypto innovation Operation Choke Point 2.0 is the term used for a series of actions allegedly taken by certain federal regulators and agencies, including the FDIC, to limit banking access to certain high-risk or controversial industries, including cryptocurrency businesses. Critics say this is a subtle ploy to kill the crypto space by denying exchanges, brokerages, and other players in the ecosystem access to traditional banking services. Coinbase contends that actions taken, especially through informal guidance and informal pressure on banks, have launched a hostile environment for cryptocurrency businesses under the FDIC. These operations resulted in an illegal restriction on access to banking services, which placed cryptographic firms in a relatively disadvantaged position in the financial arena. As part of its effort to revive the case, Coinbase is seeking court intervention to compel the FDIC to answer and prevent such overreach in the future. Coinbase argues that such overreach chills innovation in the digital assets market. The FDIC’s actions, they argue, violate both due process and the First Amendment, as cryptocurrency companies believe they should not be penalized based on what business they choose to operate.

XRP has focused on cross-border remittances, while Bittensor has introduced a decentralized approach to AI training. BlockDAG , however, is taking a broader view. Its roadmap includes decentralized identity, AI integration, and token-holder governance—built on its DAG-based hybrid architecture. With a $209.5 million presale and a 2,380% return from Batch 1 to Batch 27, BlockDAG is framing itself not just as a project, but as a platform designed to support the next phase of the Web3 ecosystem. XRP’s Role in Global Payments & Its Investment Track Record Ripple Labs launched XRP in 2012 to streamline international payments. It was built to provide fast, low-cost transaction processing for banks and financial institutions, specifically through real-time gross settlement and remittance networks. At launch, XRP traded for fractions of a cent. Today, as of March 28, 2025, it is priced around $2.32. Its journey has been marked by market shifts and, more significantly, legal scrutiny. The SEC lawsuit initiated in 2020 has had a lasting impact on XRP’s price and market standing. Despite those legal headwinds, XRP continues to hold a major market position. It remains one of the top digital assets by market capitalization, with growing adoption among banks and payment providers worldwide. This suggests that, despite its challenges, XRP has maintained long-term utility in global finance. Bittensor (TAO): Decentralized AI & Notable Price Movement Bittensor’s TAO token went live on March 6, 2023, at an initial price of $93.40. The network aims to decentralize artificial intelligence by enabling participants to contribute computing resources and algorithms to a shared ecosystem. The goal is to create an open, collaborative AI marketplace. TAO saw sharp price movements following launch. It peaked at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. These figures show significant investor returns from the starting price, even amid the typical volatility of crypto markets. What makes Bittensor stand out is its blend of AI and blockchain. This intersection has attracted attention from developers and investors alike. As more industries explore decentralized AI models, TAO’s role as an early mover could prove significant in shaping this new segment of the crypto economy. BlockDAG’s Future-Focused Roadmap: From AI to Digital Identity As blockchain evolves, the focus is moving away from simple transaction speeds and toward building meaningful infrastructure. BlockDAG is aligning itself with this shift—by preparing for a digital future that includes AI, self-managed identity, and decentralized governance. With $209.5 million raised in its presale—achieved without institutional venture backing—BlockDAG demonstrates how community support can drive momentum. It’s now in Batch 27, selling tokens at $0.0248. From Batch 1 to date, the ROI has reached 2,380%, and over 19 billion coins have already been sold. But this traction supports more than just market demand. BlockDAG is actively developing infrastructure for use cases that extend beyond finance. Features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge cryptography, and smart contract flexibility are core to its architecture—setting the stage for identity solutions, AI agents, and programmable governance. This means users could one day control their digital identity securely without third-party oversight, or engage with autonomous AI systems for everyday tasks. Governance could evolve beyond voting apps into smart, code-driven policy-making tools—giving token holders real influence. These aren’t speculative ideas. They’re technical possibilities being built into the foundation today. With Testnet already in motion and Mainnet on the horizon, BlockDAG’s ecosystem is actively preparing for these applications—not years from now, but in the near term. Key Insights! As blockchain technology matures, the strongest projects will be those building more than tokens. XRP pushed the boundaries of payment speed, and Bittensor opened up new ground in decentralized AI. But BlockDAG is constructing something more comprehensive. Its roadmap addresses foundational needs: AI-native compatibility, identity ownership, and token-based governance. And with a community-funded $209.5 million presale—no early VC required—BlockDAG is proving that users are ready to back purpose-driven infrastructure. As Web3 scales globally, the future will belong to platforms that empower users with both control and functionality. BlockDAG’s architecture is built with that in mind—focused on resilience, adaptability, and utility in the years to come.

42726779,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=721446,1743472829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42726779.jpeg,Bitcoin Whales Accumulate as Short-Term Holders Capitulate—What This Mean for BTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whales-accumulate-as-short-term-holders-capitulate-what-this-mean-for-btc/,"Bitcoin has continued to show weakness in price movement, with limited upside momentum over the past several weeks. The cryptocurrency has declined by 22.3% in the last month alone, bringing its price down to $83,191 at the time of writing. The drop reflects ongoing uncertainty in the broader crypto market, as investors are struggling with reduced risk appetite and a lack of strong bullish catalysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Targets Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally, What Happened Last Time Whale Accumulation Patterns Echo Previous Bull Market Phases Despite the downtrend, recent on-chain activity suggests that certain investor cohorts remain confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. In particular, whale addresses—wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC—have demonstrated a historical correlation with Bitcoin’s price trends. According to CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet, the current market cycle bears a resemblance to the 2020 bull cycle, where these whales exhibited accumulation behavior during bearish sentiment phases. Mignolet noted that these patterns occurred three times throughout the 2020 cycle, each coinciding with brief drawdowns in price. In the current phase, similar accumulation activity is being observed among whale entities, particularly those with holdings in the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. These patterns, as Mignolet suggests, may indicate that these market leaders are not exiting their positions, despite price pressure. Notably, the significance of whale behavior lies in its historical influence on market direction. As long as whales remain in accumulation mode, it could provide a base of support for the broader market and reduce the likelihood of further rapid declines. However, this dynamic does not eliminate the possibility of continued volatility, especially if broader market sentiment does not improve. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Capitulation In contrast to whale activity, short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of distress. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has remained below 1.0 for over two months, currently hovering around 0.98. This metric compares the selling price of Bitcoin with its acquisition price. When it falls below 1, it suggests that holders are selling at a loss—often viewed as a sign of capitulation. STH Capitulation “When this ratio drops below 1, it signals capitulation among STHs, often leading to short-term price declines. We can confirm this trend by observing the $BTC being sent to exchanges at a loss.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Link ⤵️https://t.co/BUIo9caGck pic.twitter.com/QfNfFpT9VL — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 31, 2025 Additionally, on-chain data shows that approximately 46,000 BTC have been sent to exchanges at a loss in recent weeks, highlighting the stress among STHs.

Helium’s IoT hotspots and Raydium’s slick Solana-based exchange show strong efforts to shape the future. But despite their ambitions, both have struggled to maintain consistent network reliability and market strength. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pulling ahead by doing what others haven’t: making uptime a priority. With fault-tolerant design and seamless availability, it’s giving users and developers a dependable place to build—and that’s translating directly into presale success and growing momentum. Helium’s Wireless Vision Shows Promise Helium began its journey in 2012, founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey. It officially launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to create a fully decentralized network for IoT devices. The idea was bold: reward users for setting up hotspots to expand wireless coverage. Then came Helium Mobile in May 2023, offering unlimited talk, text, and data for just $20 a month. That move paid off—by December 2023, Helium Mobile made up roughly 90% of Helium’s entire network revenue. The token story, however, has been a rollercoaster. In Q3 2024, HNT’s circulating market cap surged 124% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, while its price jumped 119% to $7.54. But as of March 28, 2025, HNT has fallen back to $3.37—a steep 93.1% drop from its peak of $48.80. Despite this, Helium’s ecosystem is expanding globally, boosted by fresh partnerships and international moves. Still, the volatility leaves questions around its long-term reliability. Raydium Surges on Solana—But Faces the Heat of Big Volume Raydium entered the market in early 2021 and quickly carved out space as a go-to DEX on Solana. Thanks to Solana’s speed and low fees, Raydium attracted users fast—handling between $1 and $2 billion in weekly trading volume by early 2024. Then came a massive spike: $12 billion in a single week later that year, underscoring its explosive growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium’s RAY token is priced at $2.00. Daily trading volume stands at roughly $56.99 million, and its market cap is around $581.66 million. With control of 60.7% of Solana’s DEX market, Raydium has certainly proven its strength in DeFi. But even with liquidity and development on its side, keeping pace with growing expectations is no small task. BlockDAG’s Secret Weapon? Always-On Infrastructure That Won’t Let You Down What’s driving the buzz around BlockDAG? It’s not just the gains—it’s the rock-solid foundation underneath. While other platforms face outages and pressure during high demand, BlockDAG is built to stay live no matter what. Its fault-tolerant design ensures that even if nodes or regions fail, the network keeps moving. This is no accident. BlockDAG’s global architecture spreads across multiple data centers, rerouting traffic instantly when needed. That means no bottlenecks, no panic, and no interruptions for users or developers. It’s smart, stable, and ahead of the curve. And it’s working. BlockDAG has already raised $209.5 million during its presale. With over 18.9 billion coins sold and batch 27 priced at $0.0248, the return from batch 1 stands at a jaw-dropping 2,380%. That kind of growth doesn’t come from hype alone—it comes from confidence. This isn’t just about having a strong system. It’s about showing users they can trust it to be there tomorrow, next year, and beyond. And in crypto, that kind of trust is rare—and valuable. Why BlockDAG’s Resilience Could Be the Edge Every Developer Wants Every blockchain wants to promise big returns, but only a few can guarantee stability. Helium has the vision, and Raydium brings liquidity—but both face pressure to maintain uptime and confidence. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has made reliability part of its DNA. Its infrastructure is built to handle pressure without flinching, and that’s exactly what developers and buyers are looking for. The presale numbers already prove it, but the real story is in the long game. As more projects look to build without disruption, BlockDAG’s fault tolerance becomes more than just a feature—it becomes a reason to choose it over others. And with this level of performance and investor backing, it’s clear: BlockDAG isn’t just ready for what’s next—it’s already building it.

New projects launch daily, hype comes and goes, and trends shift like quicksand. But one thing never changes: the search for the best altcoins to invest in now. Everyone wants to find the next breakout project before it skyrockets, the token that could turn a few hundred bucks into a fortune. And right now, some serious contenders are making waves. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand, and Injective—three powerhouse projects that aren’t just surviving in this chaotic market but thriving. These aren’t your average altcoins; they’re leading the charge in Web3 innovation, sustainable blockchain solutions, and decentralized finance (DeFi). If you’re looking for real opportunities—not just speculation—you’re in the right place. Let’s break down why these three could be the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads as the world’s first Layer-1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly bridging various blockchain ecosystems. Currently in its 28th stage of its crypto presale , Qubetics ($TICS) has sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900+ holders, raising $15.5 million. Priced at $0.1430 per token, analysts are buzzing with predictions. By the end of the crypto presale, $TICS is expected to reach $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Following the mainnet launch, some estimates suggest $TICS could soar to $15, an astonishing 10,388% ROI, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Just imagine a $2,000 investment in $TICS at $0.1430 secures 13,980 tokens. If the price hits $1, that’s $13,980; at $5, it grows to $69,900. If $TICS reaches $15, your $2,000 turns into $209,700 — a massive 10,388% ROI. But what’s fueling this excitement? Qubetics ($TICS) is pioneering a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine a platform where businesses can tokenize assets like real estate, art, or intellectual property, making them accessible to a global audience. A startup could fractionalize its equity, allowing backers worldwide to own a piece. Artists might tokenize their work, enabling fans to buy shares and support their creations directly. This democratization of assets is not just a concept; Qubetics ($TICS), as a first-layer blockchain, is making it a reality, positioning itself as a game-changer in the investment landscape. Algorand: The Green Powerhouse of Blockchain Algorand has carved a niche as a sustainable and efficient blockchain platform. Founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand runs on a Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism that delivers high-speed transaction finality, low fees, and minimal energy consumption. Its environmentally friendly model has earned it recognition as one of the most sustainable blockchains in the world, aligning with the growing demand for green technology across global markets. The platform is designed to support a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services and asset tokenization to identity solutions and cross-border payments. Its smart contract capabilities are scalable and secure, offering developers a robust environment to build next-generation applications. Algorand has also gained traction with institutions and governments exploring blockchain-based solutions for digital identity, carbon tracking, and central bank digital currencies. What sets Algorand apart is its consistent focus on real-world impact and academic innovation. Backed by a passionate community and a growing ecosystem of partnerships, it continues to attract developers, enterprises, and organizations that value speed, security, and sustainability. Despite broader market volatility, Algorand’s commitment to future-focused blockchain infrastructure makes it one of the most compelling projects in the space for long-term adoption and development. Injective: Redefining Decentralized Trading Injective is gaining serious attention for reimagining decentralized trading with an infrastructure that blends speed, security, and complete user control. At its core, Injective powers a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem that allows users to trade spot, perpetual, and derivatives assets — all with zero gas fees. This model removes a major friction point seen in other DeFi platforms, making on-chain trading faster and far more cost-effective. Unlike traditional DEXs that sacrifice speed for decentralization, Injective leverages advanced infrastructure to deliver both. A standout development is Injective’s integration with the Cosmos SDK, which brings enhanced interoperability across various blockchain networks. This expansion enables Injective to offer seamless cross-chain trading, opening doors to deeper liquidity and broader use cases. The platform also supports custom-built financial markets, giving developers the ability to launch innovative DeFi products without needing to rely on centralized intermediaries. With a growing list of partnerships and developer support, Injective is cementing its reputation as one of the most forward-thinking DeFi protocols. Its focus on usability, zero fees, and interoperability is not just setting it apart — it’s creating a new standard. For those tracking serious altcoin contenders, Injective continues to prove it’s built for the long run. Final Thoughts: Why Qubetics, Algorand, and Injective Are the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now The crypto market isn’t waiting for anyone—and neither should you. With Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand, and Injective, we’re looking at three projects that aren’t just the best altcoins to invest in now but also keeping up with industry trends—they’re setting them. Qubetics ($TICS), as the first Layer-1 Web3 aggregator, is redefining real-world asset tokenization, making high-value assets accessible to everyone. Its crypto presale is gaining serious traction, and the ROI potential is off the charts. Algorand continues to dominate the sustainable blockchain space, offering a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional financial systems. Meanwhile, Injective is shaking up DeFi with its zero gas fee trading ecosystem, proving that decentralization doesn’t have to mean slow or expensive transactions. Whether you’re in this for massive growth potential, long-term adoption, or game-changing blockchain innovation, these three altcoins are making their mark. The market is moving fast, and opportunities like this don’t stick around forever. The question is—are you ready to make your move?

In a March 31 post on X, Armstrong argued that crypto companies should be treated similarly to banks and be “allowed to, and incentivized to, share interest with consumers.” He added that allowing onchain interest would be “consistent with a free market approach.” Source: Brian Armstrong There are currently two competing pieces of federal stablecoin legislation working their way through the legislative process in the US: the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. In reference to the stablecoin legislation, Armstrong said the US had an opportunity to “level the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.” Armstrong: Onchain interest a boon for US economy Armstrong argued that while stablecoins have already found product-market fit by “digitizing the dollar and other fiat currencies,” the addition of onchain interest would allow “the average person, and the US economy, to reap the full benefits.” He said that if legislative changes allowed stablecoin issuers to pay interest to holders, US consumers could earn a yield of around 4% on their holdings, far outstripping the 2024 average interest yield on a consumer savings account, which Armstrong cited as 0.41%. Armstrong also said onchain interest could benefit the broader US economy — by incentivizing the global use of US dollar stablecoins. This could see their use grow, “pulling dollars back to U.S. treasuries and extending dollar dominance in an increasingly digital global economy,” according to the Coinbase CEO. He also argued that the potential for a higher yield than traditional savings accounts would result in “more yield in consumers’ hands means more spending, saving, investing — fueling economic growth in all local economies where stablecoins are held.” “If we don’t unlock onchain interest, the U.S. misses out on billions more USD users and trillions in potential cash flows,” Armstrong added. Currently, neither the STABLE Act nor the GENIUS Act gives the legal go-ahead for onchain interest-generating stablecoins. In fact, in its current form, the STABLE Act includes a short passage prohibiting “payment stablecoin” issuers from paying yield to holders: Source: STABLE Act Related: Stablecoins, tokenized assets gain as Trump tariffs loom Similarly, the GENIUS Act, which recently passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18-6, has been amended to exclude interest-bearing instruments from its definition of a “payment stablecoin.” Commenting on the current state of the STABLE Act, Representative Bryan Steil told Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, that two pieces of legislation are positioned to “mirror up” following a few more draft rounds in the House and Senate — due to the differences between them being textual rather than substantive. “At the end of the day, I think there’s recognition that we want to work with our Senate colleagues to get this across the line,” Steil said.
