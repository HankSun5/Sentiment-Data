The price is currently hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band, indicating suppressed volatility and a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads around 38.56, suggesting that the asset is approaching oversold territory, though not quite there yet. The mid-Bollinger Band at approximately $0.03323 acts as dynamic resistance, which BRETT has struggled to breach. Without a decisive breakout above this level, upward momentum may remain limited. Unless volume or sentiment shifts significantly, the asset may continue range-bound movement or experience slight downside pressure. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of BRETT/USDT, the market is exhibiting signs of consolidation with limited momentum. The price remains close to the lower Bollinger Band, which reflects a lack of strong buying pressure. The MACD is currently flat, with the signal and MACD lines nearly overlapping around the zero line, suggesting indecision and a neutral momentum outlook. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power indicator hovers around the zero mark, indicating an even tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Without a breakout above $0.03341 resistance, BRETT is likely to remain in a tight range or drift slightly lower amid weak market conviction.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis‚Äôs critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT‚Äôs near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

We are proud to partner with @EricTrump and American Data Centers to launch @AmericanBTC .

The initiative follows Hut 8‚Äôs contribution of most of its ASIC miners to American Data Centers, Inc., which has since been renamed American Bitcoin. The transition reflects Hut 8‚Äôs broader restructuring to streamline its Bitcoin mining operations. American Bitcoin Mining to Absorb Hut 8 Operations Under the new agreement, American Bitcoin will assume all Bitcoin mining activities previously handled under Hut 8‚Äôs Compute segment. Hut 8, however, will remain central to operations by serving as the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner. This partnership is expected to support long-term revenue growth for Hut 8‚Äôs Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. ‚ÄúBy combining Hut 8‚Äôs proven operational excellence in data centers with our shared passion for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, we are poised to strengthen our foundation and drive significant future growth,‚Äù said Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin. Donald Trump Jr. added that while holding Bitcoin has value, mining it under favorable conditions offers a stronger growth opportunity. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot noted that creating American Bitcoin as a standalone entity allows the mining division to scale independently and attract investment. Meanwhile, Hut 8 can concentrate on its infrastructure services, creating a more predictable and financeable structure for both companies. Leadership and Operational Support The leadership team at American Bitcoin will include Mike Ho as Executive Chairman, Matt Prusak as CEO, and Eric Trump as Chief Strategy Officer. The Board of Directors will initially feature Mike Ho, Asher Genoot, Justin Mateen, and Michael Broukhim. As part of the agreement, Hut 8 will provide ASIC colocation and managed services to American Bitcoin, ensuring a smooth transition and continued operational excellence. ‚ÄúWhen the Trump family starts mining Bitcoin, you know the game has changed.

Frustrated with what it perceives as stonewalling, Coinbase has reactivated its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Let‚Äôs dive into why this legal battle is crucial for Coinbase, the crypto industry, and what it means for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Coinbase Reviving the FOIA Lawsuit? Coinbase initially filed this lawsuit to gain access to documents from the FDIC, believing these documents hold critical information relevant to the exchange‚Äôs operations and the broader regulatory landscape. The lawsuit was temporarily paused earlier this year when Travis Hill was appointed as Acting FDIC Chair, sparking hopes of a more cooperative approach. However, despite some initial improvements in communication, Coinbase feels that the FDIC is still not providing the level of FDIC Transparency required. According to a post by Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter, on X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase alleges that key documents are still being withheld, hindering their ability to fully understand the FDIC‚Äôs stance and actions. The Core Issue: Information Access and Regulatory Clarity At the heart of this legal tussle is the fundamental principle of information access . Coinbase, like any regulated entity, needs clarity and access to information from regulatory bodies like the FDIC to operate effectively and compliantly. Here‚Äôs why this is so vital: Compliance and Risk Management: Understanding the FDIC‚Äôs internal communications and policies is crucial for Coinbase to ensure it is meeting all regulatory requirements and managing risks appropriately. Opaque regulatory processes make compliance a guessing game. Industry Precedent: This case sets a precedent for how regulatory bodies interact with the cryptocurrency industry. If Coinbase succeeds in compelling the FDIC to be more transparent, it could pave the way for greater openness across the board, benefiting the entire crypto sector. Investor Confidence: Transparency from regulators builds investor confidence. Knowing that regulatory processes are open and accountable can encourage more institutional and retail investors to participate in the crypto market. Paul Grewal‚Äôs Stance: Insufficient Transparency Remains Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has been vocal about the need for greater transparency. While acknowledging some improved cooperation under the new FDIC leadership, Grewal stated that transparency remains ‚Äúinsufficient.‚Äù This suggests that while the FDIC may have made some efforts to engage with Coinbase, they haven‚Äôt gone far enough to satisfy the exchange‚Äôs concerns regarding access to vital information access . This isn‚Äôt just about Coinbase; it‚Äôs about the broader relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and financial regulators. The demand for transparency highlights a crucial tension point: how can innovative, rapidly evolving sectors like crypto navigate regulatory landscapes that are often perceived as opaque and slow-moving? What are the Potential Outcomes and Implications? The court‚Äôs decision on Coinbase‚Äôs motion to resume the FOIA lawsuit will have significant ramifications: Outcome Implications Court grants Coinbase‚Äôs motion FDIC will be compelled to respond to the lawsuit, potentially leading to the release of requested documents. This would be a win for Coinbase and potentially for transparency in crypto regulation . Court denies Coinbase‚Äôs motion Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to gain information through legal means will be thwarted, at least in the short term. This could signal continued challenges for crypto firms seeking regulatory clarity via FOIA requests. The Role of the Financial Watchdog: FDIC Under Scrutiny The FDIC, as a key financial watchdog , plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs financial system. Its actions, or lack thereof, are closely watched by the financial industry, including the burgeoning crypto sector. This lawsuit puts the spotlight on the FDIC‚Äôs approach to transparency and its engagement with innovative financial technologies. Is the FDIC being overly cautious, or is Coinbase asking for too much? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. Regulators must balance the need for confidentiality and operational integrity with the legitimate demands of regulated entities for clarity and FDIC Transparency . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What can the crypto community learn from this ongoing legal battle? Transparency is Non-Negotiable: Coinbase‚Äôs persistence underscores the importance of demanding transparency from regulatory bodies. It‚Äôs not just about individual company interests but about building a mature and trustworthy crypto ecosystem. Legal Avenues are Important: While dialogue and cooperation are ideal, legal avenues like FOIA can be vital tools to ensure accountability and access to information when necessary. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers and regulators to shape a more transparent and supportive regulatory environment for crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Fight for Transparency Continues Coinbase‚Äôs decision to restart its FOIA lawsuit against the FDIC is a clear signal that the fight for regulatory transparency in the crypto space is far from over. This case is not just about documents and legal procedures; it‚Äôs about fostering a more open, accountable, and ultimately, healthier relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and its regulators. As the FDIC prepares its response, the crypto world watches closely, hoping this renewed legal push will finally unlock the doors to greater information access and clarity.

If you‚Äôre deeply invested in the crypto world, you understand the importance of timely information. Imagine getting only the most crucial alerts without sifting through endless notifications. That‚Äôs precisely what Apple is delivering with its latest update. Apple Intelligence, the tech giant‚Äôs powerful suite of AI tools, is expanding its reach and introducing a game-changing feature: Priority Notifications. This update, rolling out with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, not only brings AI to more users in the EU but also refines how you manage your digital life. Let‚Äôs dive into what these updates mean for you and how they are set to redefine your Apple experience. What are Apple‚Äôs Revolutionary Priority Notifications? Tired of notification overload? We all are! In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, our devices are constantly buzzing with alerts, many of which are simply noise. Apple‚Äôs new Priority Notifications feature, powered by Apple Intelligence, is designed to cut through the clutter. It intelligently analyzes your notifications and highlights those deemed most urgent and time-sensitive. Think of it as your personal AI assistant for notifications, ensuring you never miss what truly matters. Here‚Äôs what makes Priority Notifications a potential game-changer: AI-Driven Filtering: Apple Intelligence algorithms learn your notification patterns to identify critical alerts. Enhanced Visibility: Important notifications are prominently displayed at the top of your notification stack in a new, distinct format, making them instantly noticeable. Reduced Digital Clutter: By prioritizing essential notifications, you can focus on what needs your immediate attention, minimizing distractions from less important updates. Improved Efficiency: Spend less time sifting through notifications and more time responding to what truly matters, whether it‚Äôs a critical crypto market alert or an urgent personal message. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who rely on their Apple devices for time-sensitive information and want to streamline their notification experience. For crypto enthusiasts, this could mean getting instant alerts about significant market movements or important wallet updates, right when they matter most. Expanding Horizons: Apple Intelligence Arrives in the EU with iOS 18.4 The wait is over for Apple users in the European Union! Apple Intelligence , initially unveiled at last year‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference, is now making its way to iPhones and iPads across the EU with the iOS 18.4 update. This expansion is a significant step, bringing a suite of AI-powered features to a wider audience. Previously, Apple cited EU tech regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, as a reason for the delayed rollout, originally slated for April 2025. However, Apple has managed to overcome these hurdles, delivering AI Features to EU users much sooner than anticipated. This move underscores Apple‚Äôs commitment to making its advanced AI capabilities globally accessible, despite regulatory complexities. EU users can now experience features like: Writing Tools: AI-powered assistance for writing and refining text across various apps. Image Playground: An app for generating fun and creative images using AI. Genmoji: Create personalized emojis using generative AI. Furthermore, Apple Intelligence is also extending its reach to Vision Pro users in U.S. English, bringing these powerful AI tools to Apple‚Äôs mixed reality platform. This means Vision Pro users can now leverage Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and more within their immersive experiences. Beyond Notifications: Other Exciting AI Features in iOS 18.4 The iOS 18.4 update is more than just Priority Notifications and EU expansion; it‚Äôs packed with other exciting AI Features designed to enhance your Apple experience. Let‚Äôs explore some of the notable additions: Memory Movies on Mac: Now you can create personalized ‚Äúmemory movies‚Äù on your Mac simply by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will automatically curate photos and videos based on your text input, generating a shareable movie. Sketch Style in Image Playground: Apple‚Äôs AI image generation app, Image Playground, gets a new ‚ÄúSketch‚Äù style. This allows you to create academic and detailed sketches, adding a new artistic dimension to your AI-generated images. Language Expansion: Apple Intelligence is now available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (Simplified). Localized English support has also been added for Singapore and India, making AI features more accessible to a global audience. Apple News+ Food: The recently announced recipe companion, Apple News+ Food, is also launching with this update, providing a new culinary resource within Apple News+. Revamped Apple Photos App: Expect further tweaks and improvements to the Apple Photos app, enhancing your photo management and editing experience. These updates demonstrate Apple‚Äôs ongoing commitment to refining and expanding its AI ecosystem, delivering tangible benefits to users across various aspects of their digital lives. Why is Apple Intelligence Rollout Gradual? You might be wondering why Apple is rolling out Apple Intelligence features in phases rather than all at once. The truth is, developing and deploying sophisticated AI features at scale is a complex undertaking. Apple‚Äôs approach reflects a commitment to quality and a measured introduction of new technologies. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the likely reasons for this gradual rollout: Reason Explanation Technological Complexity Generative AI and related features are cutting-edge technologies. Ensuring stability, accuracy, and user-friendliness requires rigorous testing and phased deployment. Infrastructure Scaling Supporting AI features for millions of users globally demands significant infrastructure. Gradual rollout allows Apple to scale its server capacity and optimize performance without overwhelming its systems. Feature Refinement By releasing features incrementally, Apple can gather user feedback and iterate on its AI models and functionalities. This iterative process helps improve the quality and relevance of AI features over time. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations, especially in regions like the EU with stringent data privacy laws, requires careful planning and phased implementation to ensure compliance and address any legal concerns. Apple‚Äôs deliberate approach ensures a smoother user experience and allows for continuous improvement of its AI offerings. While some users might prefer immediate access to all features, this phased rollout ultimately leads to a more robust and refined AI ecosystem. Embrace the Future of AI with iOS 18.4 The latest iOS 18.4 update marks a significant step forward in Apple‚Äôs AI journey. With the introduction of Priority Notifications and the expansion of Apple Intelligence to the EU, Apple is empowering users with smarter, more intuitive, and more efficient digital experiences. These updates are not just about adding features; they are about fundamentally changing how we interact with our devices, making technology work more seamlessly for us. As Apple continues to refine and expand its AI capabilities, we can expect even more groundbreaking innovations in the future.

Notably, the struggles have spared tech stocks, which continue to surge despite macro factors. According to Reuters , data provided by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that property prices, investments, and sales have resumed their downward trend following a brief period of stability. China‚Äôs government has actively intervened in the property market Property prices in China have been on a steady decline since 2021 after a government crackdown on developers caused a liquidity crisis, abandoned projects and wary buyers. Not much has changed since then, despite recent government intervention. The government has been active in trying to stabilize the property market, including it in its 2025 agenda. The government efforts seem to have paid off for about two months as the prices were relatively steady. However, recent data from the Chinese Real Estate Information Corp shows that the market has lost these small gains as new home sales have dipped. While the government is working to normalize house prices, there‚Äôs also the issue of price controls that are usually imposed by local governments. These dips are not only attributed to government actions, as demographic shifts, low demands causing a glut of unsold homes, and low disposable income due to stagnant incomes come into play. While analysts believe that government efforts will cause a positive change in the trends, other factors threaten that change from happening soon. U.S. tariffs add pressure To add to its economic woes, the U.S. introduced a 25% levy on Chinese auto imports, among other tariffs, piling more pressure on China. China has also retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on goods from the United States, further straining bilateral trade relations between the two nations. The Trump administration is expected to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs on April 2, adding more pressure to the Chinese economy. These have raised concerns about the impact of the tariffs on Chinese consumer behavior and its manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs tech surge fails to revive broader markets On the flip side, Chinese tech stocks have been on a trend Deepseek started earlier in the year. Despite the ongoing success of these Chinese tech stocks, it has had little or no growing effect on emerging markets. This is a divergence from the normal trend where the growth in Chinese stocks has a growing effect on the stocks of other emerging markets, which have remained relatively stagnant. The current rallying effect of the Chinese stock market isn‚Äôt felt in the entire Chinese market and its impact hasn‚Äôt really improved the economy, with analysts attributing its rise to the current frenzy surrounding tech, especially artificial intelligence. According to analysts from UBS Group AG in London, the current tech boom isn‚Äôt the same as the typical Chinese boom that occurred in 2009, 2016, and 2020 and impacted emerging markets. It‚Äôs reported that since August 2024, the MSCI China Index has risen by over 30%, while the same cannot be said for emerging markets, which have fallen by 7% since then. Historically, strong growth in Chinese stocks has had a growth effect on other emerging markets. A historical example will be between 2009 and 2010, where a 63% rise in Chinese shares saw a 100% rise in emerging market shares. A similar trend is seen between 2016 and 2017, where Chinese stocks rose by 50% and the emerging markets broad gauge rose by 46%. Prior to the tech-induced boost caused by the launch of the AI model Deepseek, Chinese stocks last saw a slight surge in September 2024, thanks to the Chinese government‚Äôs overall economic stimulus. According to investment analysts, China‚Äôs new trend of outperforming its emerging markets may last longer than expected or desired. They also expressed concerns over the effects U.S. tariffs have on the Chinese stock market. Uncertain outlook for China‚Äôs economy While there are concerns about the impact of these tariffs on consumer behavior in various sectors, such as housing, investors outside of China are also taking a hint, and it could potentially affect the growth of the Chinese stock market negatively and mean more losses for emerging markets. Insights shared by Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, point out that some funds are expressing little confidence in Chinese stocks making a quick comeback and are already doing away with their Chinese holdings. While local experts point out that the Chinese market will experience some form of growth aided by government intervention, they also indicate that the growth curve won‚Äôt be steep. How these predictions play out is left to be seen as the available data looks bleak currently, given the U.S. tariffs and more impending tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

If you were eagerly anticipating the full potential of Alexa+, Amazon‚Äôs premium AI assistant, you might need to temper your excitement. While Amazon has launched Alexa+, reports are surfacing that many of the hyped, game-changing Alexa Plus Features are nowhere to be found, at least not yet. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs going on with this much-anticipated upgrade and why the rollout is hitting some unexpected snags. What‚Äôs the Buzz About Alexa Plus Features? Amazon promised a revolutionary upgrade with Alexa+, showcasing impressive capabilities at a recent press event. We were teased with glimpses of an AI assistant that could truly understand and anticipate our needs, performing what are termed ‚Äúagentic AI tasks.‚Äù Think seamless interactions like: Ordering your favorite takeout from Grubhub with just a voice command. Generating imaginative stories to keep kids entertained for hours. Recognizing household members and prompting them about their chores. Brainstorming the perfect gift ideas for any occasion. Even ordering an Uber and getting personalized cooking recommendations. These Amazon AI Assistant functionalities painted a picture of a truly intelligent and helpful home companion, far beyond the basic Alexa we know. The anticipation was palpable, especially for those invested in creating a fully integrated smart home ecosystem. The Disappointing Reality: Delayed Alexa Features However, the initial launch of Alexa+ tells a different story. According to reports, many of these showcased Alexa Plus Features are conspicuously absent. Users who upgraded expecting a fully realized AI assistant are finding themselves with a service that feels‚Ä¶incomplete. Key functionalities like Grubhub ordering, story generation, visual person identification for chore reminders, and gift idea brainstorming are simply not available yet. It‚Äôs like ordering a fully loaded car and finding out it‚Äôs missing the navigation system and sunroof. Furthermore, some features, such as Uber ordering and cooking recommendations, are only available to a select group of users, making the rollout feel fragmented and inconsistent. The promised web app for Alexa+, which was announced with fanfare just last month, also lacks a firm release date, adding to the uncertainty. Why Are Key Smart Home AI Features Delayed? The culprit behind these Delayed Alexa Features seems to be the complex AI infrastructure underpinning Alexa+. Reports suggest that the development process has been plagued with challenges from the outset. Building an AI capable of handling the sophisticated ‚Äúagentic‚Äù tasks Amazon envisions is no small feat. It requires robust and reliable systems that can handle natural language processing, contextual understanding, and seamless integration with various services. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the potential challenges: AI Infrastructure Complexity: Developing the AI models and systems to power these advanced features is inherently complex and time-consuming.

Scalability Issues: Rolling out these features to millions of users requires a scalable infrastructure that can handle the increased demand and data processing. What Does This Mean for Smart Home Enthusiasts? For those invested in Smart Home AI and eagerly awaiting the next leap in voice assistant technology, this delay is undoubtedly disappointing. It highlights the gap between marketing hype and the realities of developing cutting-edge AI. While Alexa+ still holds promise, the initial rollout serves as a reminder that revolutionary technology often comes with unforeseen challenges and delays. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that this is just the beginning. Amazon has committed to delivering these advanced features, and the current situation appears to be a temporary setback rather than a complete derailment. As AI technology continues to evolve rapidly, we can expect to see these capabilities gradually rolled out in the coming months. Actionable Insights: Managing Expectations and Future Outlook Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights as we navigate this evolving landscape: Manage Expectations: Don‚Äôt expect all promised Alexa+ features to be available immediately. Temper your expectations and anticipate a phased rollout. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on tech news and official Amazon announcements for updates on feature releases and timelines. Provide Feedback: If you are an early Alexa+ adopter, provide feedback to Amazon about your experience and feature requests. This can help shape future development. Patience is Key: Developing advanced AI is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience will be crucial as these sophisticated features are refined and rolled out. Conclusion: The Future of Alexa+ and Smart Home AI Remains Bright While the initial launch of Alexa+ may not have delivered all the promised bells and whistles, the underlying potential of Amazon AI Assistant and the future of Smart Home AI remains incredibly exciting.

Analyst Reveals His Buy Zone Strategy",https://cryptonews.com/news/eth-drops-near-1500-eyes-1200-support-zone/,"ETH fell by 1.1% in the past 24 hours, sliding to just above $1,800 as analysts suggested the recent rally may have been a dead-cat bounce. Among the top five cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has posted the steepest losses in 2025, down 45.4% year-to-date. The network‚Äôs struggle to remain competitive has pressured the price of its native asset, with rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) offering lower fees and faster execution speeds. ETH Nears Critical $1,500 Support After Major Downtrend Crypto trader Big Cheds, who has more than 300,000 followers on X, pointed to the $1,200 level as a critical support and potential buy zone for ETH if the current downtrend continues. $ETH now $1840 from $3400 below. Prob worth a sniff when it tags $1200-$1300 range https://t.co/NARqJWgxS6 pic.twitter.com/w076n9xLIe ‚Äî Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) March 30, 2025 He noted that a bounce from this level could lead to a mid-term rally toward the $3,400 range, translating to a 283% gain. Looking at the weekly chart, ETH has been in a prolonged downtrend since it failed to break above $4,000 for the third time. This triple top pattern reflected investor hesitation in pushing valuations higher amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Despite these challenges, some technical levels have held firm. The $1,500 support zone has previously acted as a launching point for strong recoveries. ETH rebounded by 41% and 149% the last two times it touched this level, with each move resulting in a higher high. If a similar reaction occurs again, the price could target the $5,000 mark, which would represent a 221% increase. Can ETH Bounce Back or Is $1,200 the Next Stop? Whether ETH will hold its footing at $1,500 or continue slipping remains to be seen. A sustained drop below that level could send the price toward $1,200, and potentially as low as $900, implying a total downside risk of around 42% from current levels. Traders and long-term holders alike will be watching closely to see how ETH reacts to this zone. A strong bounce could reignite interest, while a bearish breakdown might confirm further downside in the short term. Once cryptos regain their strength and the bullish cycle resumes, storing these digital assets safely will be a key priority to investors.

The AI world is buzzing with a potentially seismic shift. OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking GPT models, has hinted at releasing a new ‚Äúopen‚Äù language model. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì ‚Äúopen‚Äù! This news is electrifying for those in the crypto space who understand the power of decentralization and open access. Could this be a game-changer for how generative AI is developed and utilized? Let‚Äôs dive into what this announcement means and why it‚Äôs creating waves. Why is an OpenAI Open Language Model a Big Deal? For years, OpenAI has been known for its cutting-edge, yet largely closed-source, AI models. Think of models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 ‚Äì incredibly powerful, but access is controlled and the underlying code isn‚Äôt freely available. This contrasts sharply with the ethos of the crypto world, which champions transparency and open-source development. However, it seems the winds are changing. OpenAI is signaling a move towards a more open approach, reminiscent of their earlier days with GPT-2 . But why now? Let‚Äôs break it down: Competitive Pressure: Companies like DeepSeek and Meta (with their Llama models) have gained significant traction by adopting an open source AI strategy. Meta‚Äôs Llama models, for instance, have seen over a billion downloads! This success likely hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by OpenAI. Community Demand: The AI research and development community has been vocal about the need for more open and accessible AI models . OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form directly addresses this, asking developers and researchers what they want to see in an open model.

This suggests it won‚Äôt be a basic model but will possess a degree of sophistication. Preparedness Framework: OpenAI emphasizes that this model, like all others, will undergo rigorous evaluation before release. However, they acknowledge the unique nature of an open-source model, anticipating modifications and adaptations post-release. Focus on Utility: OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form and statements highlight a desire to make this model as ‚Äúuseful as possible‚Äù for developers, researchers, and even large organizations. They envision scenarios where companies and governments might prefer to run models themselves, rather than relying solely on API access. The Benefits of Open Source AI: A Crypto Perspective For the crypto community, the move towards open source AI resonates deeply. Here‚Äôs why: Benefit Explanation Transparency & Trust Open source code allows for public scrutiny, fostering greater trust and transparency in AI development. This aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. Innovation & Collaboration Open models encourage wider experimentation and collaboration. Just as open-source blockchain projects have thrived, open AI can spur rapid innovation through community contributions. Decentralization Potential Open source AI can contribute to a more decentralized AI landscape, reducing the concentration of power in a few large tech companies. This mirrors the crypto vision of decentralizing control. Accessibility & Democratization Open models lower the barrier to entry for AI development, making powerful tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers globally. Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of an OpenAI open language model is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Responsible Use: Open models can be used for malicious purposes. OpenAI will need to carefully consider safety and ethical implications, especially given the potential for modification post-release. Resource Intensity: Developing and maintaining powerful open models requires significant resources. OpenAI needs a sustainable strategy for this endeavor. Balancing Openness with Business Interests: OpenAI is a for-profit company. Finding the right balance between open sourcing and protecting their competitive advantage will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you‚Äôre a crypto developer, investor, or simply an AI enthusiast, here‚Äôs how you can engage with this development: Participate in OpenAI‚Äôs Feedback Process: If you have ideas or insights on what you‚Äôd like to see in an open model, fill out OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form.

The analyst, reviewing the 4-hour candlestick chart, pointed to extremely oversold RSI levels as a basis for this outlook. Although a bounce appears to be the more probable outcome, there is still a 30 to 40% chance of a short-term drop into deeper support territory. Dogecoin RSI Dips Below 10 On 4-Hour Chart To Possibly Extend Decline The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis indicator used to measure an asset‚Äôs momentum. When above 70, the asset is considered overbought, meaning it might be due for a price correction or pullback. On the other hand, readings below 30 are considered oversold, meaning that the asset might be undervalued and could bounce upward soon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Turns Bullish With 1-Day RSI In Oversold Region, Why DOGE Can Reach $0.9 In the case of Dogecoin, the meme coin has been under intense selling pressure since the beginning of March. This selling pressure has seen it lose most of its price gains in late 2024 and break below notable support pressure. This, in turn, has seen the RSI fall towards the oversold levels across multiple timeframes. According to the technical overview, the Relative Strength Index on the 1-hour timeframe is between 25 and 27, signaling strong oversold conditions. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped even lower, falling beneath 10, which typically indicates an asset is due for a corrective bounce. The daily RSI is currently hovering around 32 to 33, still above the oversold zone but trending downward. These readings suggest that while bearish pressure is present, the setup of a bounce from oversold levels increasingly favors a rebound as buyers look to re-enter near support. Analyst Sees Bounce Toward $0.172‚Äì$0.175 As More Probable Outcome According to the analyst, the break of the RSI below the oversold levels points to a decline toward the $0.1580 and $0.1590 support region. Despite the possibility of a decline toward the $0.1580 to $0.1590 support region, the analyst noted a higher probability (around 60 to 70%) of a near-term bounce after hitting this support region, possibly targeting the $0.172 to $0.175 range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Stages Bounce From Lower Border Of Second Falling Wedge, New Targets Unlocked? The projection hinges on Dogecoin‚Äôs possible reaction to such a deeply oversold RSI level. The analyst emphasized that this is an assumption rather than financial advice, but the technical context supports the likelihood of a relief rally if the support holds. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1649, down by 3.6% in the past 24 hours. With both downside and upside scenarios laid out, short-term Dogecoin price action now depends on how the market reacts at the current $0.165 level. A move toward $0.172 or higher could unfold quickly if buyers step in right now. However, if selling continues, Dogecoin might continue its decline throughout the week before attempting a recovery.

The crypto market never sleeps, and right now, Qubetics ($TICS), Bittensor (TAO), and Tron (TRX) are making headlines with major developments. Bittensor is transforming artificial intelligence by decentralizing machine learning models, while Tron is pushing deeper into decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. Both projects are gaining momentum, making them key contenders in the market. But Qubetics is the one stealing the spotlight. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs solving one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems‚Äîbridging fragmented blockchain ecosystems. More importantly, its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace is unlocking new ways for people and businesses to trade real-world assets on-chain. With its presale already surpassing millions, Qubetics is gaining serious traction, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in today . Qubetics: The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization The world is filled with valuable assets‚Äîreal estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property‚Äîyet most remain inaccessible to everyday people due to high entry barriers and liquidity issues. Qubetics is changing that through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which converts these physical assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or used as collateral on the blockchain. A real estate owner, for example, can tokenize a luxury apartment, allowing people across the globe to own fractional shares. No need for hefty down payments or complex legal paperwork‚Äîjust direct access to real estate ownership through blockchain technology. The same applies to high-value assets like gold, oil, patents, and even rare collectibles, making Qubetics a game-changer in asset digitization. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, meaning it unifies multiple blockchains, eliminating the headache of cross-chain compatibility. Whether someone holds Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche assets, Qubetics allows seamless transactions across chains. For businesses, this means borderless commerce without limitations. With regulatory discussions heating up around RWA tokenization, analysts predict Qubetics is at the forefront of a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Presale: A Rare Opportunity The Qubetics presale is making waves for all the right reasons. Unlike many projects that drag on for months, Qubetics has a strict 7-day stage system, with each stage ending every Sunday at 12 AM. At the close of every stage, the price automatically increases by 10%, rewarding early buyers. Currently in its 28th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.1430, with over 504 million tokens sold and a presale tally surpassing $15.5 million. More than 23,900 token holders have already secured their share, making Qubetics one of the best crypto presales right now.To put this into perspective, a $2,500 purchase at the current price secures around 17,475 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that‚Äôs $17,475 in value. With mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, the Qubetics presale is shaping up to be a limited-time opportunity before the next price jump. No wonder it‚Äôs on the radar as one of the top cryptos to invest in today.

Per a report from the Russian newspaper Kommersant , the ban would apply only in the southern part of the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk, but could run until mid-2031. Irkutsk Mining Ban Incoming? Miners in southern Irkutsk have already been ordered to shut down their rigs in the winter months until 2031. Inside a crypto mining data center in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: GetBailkal/YouTube/Screenshot) But many miners have remained in the area on the understanding that they can operate unimpeded in warmer months. However, top officials warned earlier this year that the existing ban was not doing enough to ease pressure on local power grids. Kommersant, a media outlet known to enjoy good relations with the Kremlin, said its sources had revealed the Russian government ‚Äúmay impose a total ban on mining in the southern part of the Irkutsk region as early as April 1.‚Äù As Russia‚Äôs first BTC mining hub, southern Irkutsk is home to several large mining centers, which collectively consume around 650 MW of power. A total ban would be highly problematic to these centers, industry insiders told the newspaper. They added that ‚Äúin the event of a ban,‚Äù they would be powerless to act ‚Äúdue to difficulties connecting to networks in other regions.‚Äù Many nearby regions have also imposed wintertime crypto mining bans, a fact that could leave miners with no choice other than to relocate.

(Source: AIST TV/YouTube/Screenshot) The media outlet noted that neither the Ministry of Energy nor the offices of the Governor of the Irkutsk Oblast responded to its request for official comment. However, the outlet reported that President Vladimir Putin had replied that he had agreed to ‚Äúconsider and support‚Äù Kobzev‚Äôs request ‚Äúin the interests of the region.‚Äù The newspaper claimed its (anonymous) sources said the matter was discussed at a government-led power industry summit in Moscow on March 27. ‚ÄúBased on the results of the meeting, [the government] will likely decide to grant the [governor‚Äôs request],‚Äù Kommersant‚Äôs ‚Äúsources‚Äù claimed.

(Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) North of Region to Escape Ban? Kobzev has previously claimed that his plans would leave industrial miners in the north of the oblast free to continue with their work. But Kobzev has claimed that power shortages in southern Irkutsk are now becoming critical. He stated that ‚Äúover the past five years,‚Äù energy consumption in the Irkutsk region has ‚Äúgrown by 28%‚Äù The governor blamed mining for contributing to an energy deficit in the region. He said that the deficit could grow to 2.9 GW by 2030 if no action were taken. The entirety of Siberia has become a hub for Russian crypto miners due to its low electricity prices and famously long and cold winters. Officials think that total mining load in the region now stands at 1.066 GW, with miners in the north using 419 MW and southern miners using 647 MW. Legal, industrial miners account for the vast majority (84%) of the energy usage. Kobzev said that mining firms have already obtained permission to bring another 1.272 GW of capacity online in the area.

Kobzev also claimed that small-scale, quasi-legal crypto miners are also causing a drain on the local grid. He stated that ‚Äúcommercial consumers operating at low voltages‚Äù were using over 160 MW of power per month.

The media outlet wrote that commercial and industrial consumers typically pay prices of around 5 rubles ($0.059) per kWh.

On Sunday, Musk said he believed his role in DOGE was affecting Tesla‚Äôs share price. He spoke about the matter during a town hall event in Wisconsin, where he has been campaigning in the state‚Äôs supreme court election.¬†According to Musk, those who oppose his efforts to slash government jobs under President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration have tried to pressure him by going after Tesla. Musk speaking at a Town Hall event in Wisconsin. Source: Fox 9 ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ‚Ä¶ stop doing this,‚Äù Musk said, referring to his work with the Trump White House. ‚ÄúMy Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it‚Äôs a big deal.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs share price was already down 35.83% for the year before Monday‚Äôs market opening, which means that the stock has nearly been cut in half compared to its peak in December. Shares slid another 1.7% on Monday. Despite this downturn, Musk offered some hope for shareholders, calling the price drop a possible ‚Äúbuying opportunity‚Äù for people who believe in the company‚Äôs long-term prospects. Tesla stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Musk was in Wisconsin to support a conservative candidate in a closely watched supreme court election. He has contributed more than $12 million on the campaign, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at a rally on Sunday for signing a petition against what he described as ‚Äúactivist judges.‚Äù Though Musk‚Äôs political influence has come into the spotlight recently, signs of trouble at Tesla had already begun to appear. The electric car maker‚Äôs vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary figures suggest sales continue to slump this year in key markets like Europe. Other car manufacturers in the U.S. have also stumbled amid warnings about rising tariffs on imported goods. Potential trade conflicts could disrupt a tightly woven network of parts suppliers spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, causing more problems for an industry still recovering from past supply chain challenges. Tesla‚Äôs troubles, then, may be part of a broader challenge facing American automakers. Yet many see the Tesla case as unique because of Musk‚Äôs sudden shift into high-profile politics. Since the Trump administration began in January, Musk has become a familiar face around the White House. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024, regularly offers opinions on political matters through his social media company X, and now holds a top seat in DOGE. For critics, this raises concerns about where Musk‚Äôs focus lies: on running an electric vehicle firm or serving as a powerful government insider. Protestors swarmed Tesla‚Äôs showrooms on the weekend Protests escalated on Saturday as anti-Musk activists swarmed Tesla showrooms and service centers. They called it the ‚ÄúTesla Takedown.‚Äù According to the protestors, the goal was to oppose Musk‚Äôs political activities and his efforts to slash government spending under Trump. Musk has already gained access to the highly sensitive information of federal employees. Consequently, more than 277 Tesla locations across the country saw some form of demonstration, though the size of the crowd varied by city. In states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, turnouts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred. People held signs reading, ‚ÄúHonk if you hate Elon‚Äù and ‚ÄúFight the billionaire broligarchy.‚Äù In Texas, Musk‚Äôs home state, and in Minnesota, Maryland, and other parts of the country, similar protests took place. Social media images showed picketers standing in front of Tesla showrooms, chanting slogans and waving banners. A protestor outside a Tesla store in Texas. Source: CBS Texas A small but visible group of counterprotesters also gathered at some locations, voicing support for President Trump and, by extension, Musk. In Dublin, California, across from a showroom where dozens of activists chanted, a few Trump supporters waved American flags. A bigger protest was observed near Berkeley, where participants claimed that Musk‚Äôs ties to the administration were pushing the country in a dangerous direction. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a fascist state,‚Äù said a retired high school teacher at the Berkeley demonstration. ‚ÄúWe need to stop this or we‚Äôll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.‚Äù Protesters should up with various signs calling Elon a ‚ÄúFascist.‚Äù Source: ABC News Outside the U.S., anti-Musk sentiment is also growing. Protesters gathered at more than 230 Tesla sites worldwide, including in European cities like London. Though the crowds there were smaller, the messages were similar. Signs compared Musk to Adolf Hitler and accused him of using a straight-arm salute after Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The protest in London drew a handful of Americans living abroad who felt compelled to speak out. One participant in London held a sign labeling Tesla cars as ‚ÄúSwasticars,‚Äù a jarring reference to Nazi Germany. ‚ÄúWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we‚Äôre facing,‚Äù said one of the protesters, describing Musk‚Äôs alliance with the Trump White House as a risk for democracy. The Tesla Takedown movement was organized by a coalition that includes people who once owned Tesla vehicles, public figures like actor John Cusack, and some Democratic lawmakers. Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas said on a recent organizing call that she would keep ‚Äúscreaming in the halls of Congress‚Äù to highlight Musk‚Äôs actions. On Saturday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal appeared at a protest in Seattle, describing Musk‚Äôs role in DOGE as a ‚Äúdangerous mixing of corporate power and government access.‚Äù A mother showed up to my recent town hall, crying because she was worried about being able to access health care for her new baby.

Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) March 31, 2025 Some individuals have reportedly set Tesla vehicles on fire, an act that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has condemned as domestic terrorism. Musk, for his part, has labeled those committing these crimes as ‚Äúpsychos‚Äù and asked them to stop. Authorities in Germany are investigating a blaze that destroyed seven Tesla cars early Saturday, though it was unclear if it was connected to the broader protests. In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police said a black pickup side mirror struck two people at a demonstration outside a Tesla service center. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries, and officials quickly identified the suspect. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Investor demand is skyrocketing, with Phase 6 of its presale already 90% sold out . XRP Stuck at $2.13 After Legal Clarity Ripple Labs‚Äô SEC settlement on March 25, 2025, initially sparked optimism, but XRP has struggled to maintain bullish momentum.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: $4.5M Raised as Investors Rush In Amid Ripple‚Äôs subdued market performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a compelling alternative for crypto investors seeking significant returns. MAGACOIN has already raised over $4,500,000 from enthusiastic investors during its ongoing presale. Investor demand has been exceptional, with Phase 6 now 90% sold out . Market experts attribute MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs explosive popularity to its well-structured tokenomics, ambitious growth strategy, and the potential for substantial returns‚Äîpredicting the token will comfortably reach $1 by 2025. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs $1 Milestone Matters Achieving the $1 milestone would firmly establish MAGACOIN FINANCE as a major cryptocurrency player, validating the project‚Äôs fundamentals and sparking further investor enthusiasm. Analysts predict that crossing the $1 threshold could trigger a wave of increased market demand, driving the price even higher. Given XRP‚Äôs limited upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs clear path to rapid growth presents investors with a compelling alternative. Its presale success‚Äîraising over $4.5 million already‚Äîis proof of robust market confidence. Ripple (XRP) vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investor Demand Speaks Volumes The stark contrast between XRP‚Äôs stagnant price action and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs surging presale illustrates where investor confidence is shifting. XRP‚Äôs uncertain market outlook, compounded by its inability to rally significantly post-settlement, contrasts sharply with the bullish sentiment surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE.

It looks like [$0.11] is going to come and test lower. [DOGE has] a really strong descending supply trend.‚Äù Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.166. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the crypto strategist believes that the native asset of the top smart contract protocol is headed toward its high time frame support at around $1,000. ‚ÄúETH now $1,840 from $3,400 below. Probably worth a sniff when it tags the $1,200-$1,300 range.‚Äù Source: Cheds/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $1,808. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , Cheds says that bulls have the upper hand as long as the coin is trading above $2. But he also says that holders should consider paring back risk if XRP moves below the key price level. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.12.

Shiba Inu‚Äôs significant token burn and Layer-2 developments, along with Chainlink‚Äôs goal of reaching $20, showcase strong market narratives‚Äîyet, they focus primarily on market sentiment and trading movements. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) moves its focus from market speculation to operational efficiency. The Beta Testnet is not about market predictions but about proving functionality. With more than 15,000 transactions processed daily and over 200 nodes participating, BlockDAG rigorously tests its infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet debut in 2025. While other projects focus on market dynamics, BlockDAG is setting the standard for technological preparedness. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Token Burn Soars Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a remarkable increase in its token burn rate, with more than 1 billion tokens eliminated from circulation in just one day‚Äîa 57,000% rise. This increase mainly came from a single entity sending 1 billion SHIB to an unrecoverable address. Despite this intense burn rate, SHIB‚Äôs market price has stayed stable, trading around $0.00001443, which is a 55% drop from its peak this year. Technical analysis shows a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, indicating a possible bullish trend. This pattern might push the price up by about 130%, aiming for $0.00003395. Furthermore, Shibarium, Shiba Inu‚Äôs Layer-2 solution, is nearing a total of 1 billion transactions, showing increased use and activity. The network has already handled nearly 975 million transactions, supports over 245,000 accounts, and has generated more than 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Aims for $20 Amid Positive Trends Chainlink‚Äôs token, LINK, is currently on an upward trajectory after exiting a downward channel that started in February 2025. LINK now stabilizes at $15.15, with aspirations to break the $20 barrier soon. The recent upturn has pushed LINK above the 200 EMA, setting it on a path toward $19.30, with the $20 level being a key target for market participants. Supporting this positive trend, on-chain data shows that LINK‚Äôs social engagement is at a peak, hinting at increased interest from the market. Moreover, a spike in development activities since early March 2025 and a decrease in LINK available on exchanges suggest that major holders are accumulating, pointing to optimistic forecasts for LINK‚Äôs market performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet‚Äôs Final Stages Before 2025 Mainnet As it gears up for its 2025 mainnet release, BlockDAG has reached a crucial stage with its Beta ‚ÄúPrimordial‚Äù Testnet. This phase isn‚Äôt just for show but a thorough evaluation of the network‚Äôs systems to ensure they meet essential performance and security standards when they go live. The testnet mimics peak load conditions to check how the system handles stress. BlockDAG aims to process at least 15,000 transactions daily and maintain over 200 active mining nodes to test its scalability and decentralized nature. Additionally, the testnet scrutinizes wallet functionality, ensuring smooth integration with MetaMask and effective operation across various platforms. Developers are putting smart contracts to work, dApps are being utilized by users, and the token vesting process is being tested with over 110,000 accounts. The insights and data collected now are vital for making any necessary adjustments before the final launch. The project is also building momentum with $209.5 million secured in its presale, 19 billion coins distributed, and an ROI of 2,380% since the first batch. With coins now priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is demonstrating the robustness of its infrastructure as it prepares for launch. In essence, the testnet serves as a comprehensive rehearsal for the mainnet, allowing both users and developers to anticipate the actual launch experience. For BlockDAG, this is the ultimate preparation for making the launch a reality. Shaping Future Viability Through Real-Time Testing While market movements and investor interest can generate short-term momentum, the longevity of a technology comes from its ability to perform reliably under real-world conditions. Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent token burn and Chainlink‚Äôs positive market trends have captured the market‚Äôs interest, relying heavily on speculative responses. In contrast, BlockDAG is rigorously validating its infrastructure with its ongoing Beta Testnet. It‚Äôs processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging numerous miners, and seamlessly integrating smart contracts and wallet functionality. While other projects speculate on potential outcomes, BlockDAG is gathering concrete evidence on what actually works. The focus is on tangible results, distinguishing it from projects driven by market speculation.

XRP‚Äôs price has soared following a regulatory victory as Ripple concludes its prolonged legal conflict with the SEC, while Solana‚Äôs collaboration with Polymarket has fueled talks of its price reaching $1,000. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG‚Äôs Beta Testnet has been diligently crafting a robust framework with its dependable support system and developer-oriented design. In contrast to the fluctuating paths of other ventures, BlockDAG (BDAG) consistently prioritizes stability and support for developers, distinguishing it in the field. XRP‚Äôs Price Boost: Regulatory Progress XRP, tied to Ripple Labs, has seen a significant price rise, jumping more than 8% recently. This increase follows the announcement by Ripple‚Äôs CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC has concluded its lawsuit initiated four years ago against the firm. This legal battle, started in 2020, challenged Ripple over raising $1.4 billion via unregistered XRP sales. Its resolution mirrors a regulatory evolution under the current government, which appears more open to cryptocurrencies. For example, the SEC has also dismissed actions against other cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase and Robinhood. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)‚Äôs approval of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, is poised to boost XRP‚Äôs role in international transactions. These developments have thus reinforced confidence, driving up XRP‚Äôs price. Polymarket Boosts Solana‚Äôs Momentum Polymarket‚Äôs recent decision to accept Solana (SOL) deposits has energized the cryptocurrency community. Users can now transfer SOL directly to their prediction market wallets, extending Polymarket‚Äôs reach and increasing its platform activity. Following this news, SOL‚Äôs price quickly rose by 7% to $140, with a significant 143% jump in daily trading volumes hitting $4.18 billion. This enthusiasm has sparked debates about SOL‚Äôs potential climb to the $1,000 threshold. Moreover, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently apologized for a controversial ad, affirming the project‚Äôs commitment to community involvement. These actions collectively highlight Solana‚Äôs growing market presence and the community‚Äôs faith in its future direction. Constant Support: BlockDAG‚Äôs Commitment During Beta Testnet BlockDAG‚Äôs dedication to user satisfaction and operational dependability is evident in its extensive support system. As the Beta Testnet phase progresses, users, developers, and miners benefit from continuous technical support through the Freshdesk platform. The 24/7 Antier 1st Level Support Desk effectively manages queries, quickly resolving them or forwarding complex issues to the specialized BlockDAG support team. For more complicated technical problems, Antier developers are prepared to intervene, ensuring the testing process runs smoothly with little interruption. This proactive and comprehensive support structure is crucial during the Beta Testnet phase, where network stability and smooth integration are key. BlockDAG‚Äôs approachable and responsive support line builds user trust and promotes greater engagement from developers and miners. This strategy supports the project‚Äôs goals of stability, scalability, and prompt issue resolution. Financially, BlockDAG‚Äôs notable crypto presale success has established a strong foundation for its future. The project has amassed an impressive $209.5 million during the presale, with the current batch at number 27 and a batch price of $0.0248. The ROI since the first batch has reached a remarkable 2,380%, illustrating the project‚Äôs quick momentum and increasing community support. To date, over 19 billion coins have been purchased, underscoring the widespread enthusiasm and confidence in BlockDAG‚Äôs future potential. Building a Strong Base Amid Market Shifts While XRP and Solana are in the spotlight with regulatory victories and strategic partnerships, BlockDAG is establishing a foundation for sustained success with practical and dependable initiatives. Its Beta Testnet focuses on more than just market speculation, emphasizing stability, developer involvement, and strong support. In contrast to projects that fluctuate with market conditions, BlockDAG emphasizes steady performance and community trust. The network‚Äôs round-the-clock technical support and Antier developers‚Äô expertise reflect a commitment to reducing disruptions and enhancing the experience for all participants.

Coinbase And Others Face Increased Volatility According to Bloomberg, Coinbase‚Äôs stock has dropped more than 30% since the beginning of the quarter, marking its worst performance since the collapse of the FTX exchange in late 2022. This decline is reflective of a broader trend affecting nearly all major crypto-linked stocks, including companies like Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY.TO), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The cryptocurrency market itself is experiencing turmoil, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling over 20% from its all-time high and Ethereum (ETH) plummeting more than 45% in value. These shifts come amid President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalation of a ‚Äúglobal trade war,‚Äù which has stirred fears about the health of the country‚Äôs economy. Economic data has exacerbated these concerns, pushing the S&P 500 Index (GSPC) toward its worst quarter since mid-2022. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau noted that many within the cryptocurrency community recognize that the current market conditions are not primarily driven by fundamental factors. Instead, Lau emphasized that macroeconomic issues‚Äîsuch as tariffs and the potential trade war‚Äîare influencing investor sentiment significantly. The looming threat of a recession has reportedly added to the unease, causing higher-risk crypto-linked stocks to be even more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Lau explains that investments in companies like Coinbase carry additional risks, including the potential for bankruptcy, allegedly making them particularly susceptible to swift sell-offs. Cryptocurrency Market Struggles To Rebound The current state of the cryptocurrency market is a stark contrast to the optimism that prevailed at the start of the year, following Trump‚Äôs election. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $109,000 on Inauguration Day. Earlier this month, Bitcoin prices fell after Trump announced a strategic reserve for the market‚Äôs leading crypto, but did not allocate taxpayer funds to expand it. As of now, Bitcoin trades around $83,000, still above pre-election levels but far from its peak. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key While shares of various crypto-related companies surged following the election, Coinbase and crypto miners have since relinquished those gains. Notably, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy (MSTR) is among the few stocks in the sector that has managed to remain in positive territory since November 5. Despite the downturn, the cryptocurrency industry continues to gain influence in Washington and is moving closer to integration with traditional financial systems. However, this growing power has yet to translate into a market rebound. Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, expressed skepticism about the current state of investor sentiment, stating, ‚ÄúWhat we saw a couple of months ago, I don‚Äôt know how much crazier it can get than that. I think we‚Äôre going to have to be looking for new catalysts.‚Äù Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|coin|COIN stocks|coinbase|coinbase news|crypto|Crypto Exchange Coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-01 00:00:40

Over the past weeks, since he vowed to turn Poland into a crypto haven, S≈Çawomir Mentzen has moved closer to participating in a likely run-off in June. The nationalist candidate is most popular among young Poles who often flock to his rallies. Observers say this is largely due to his quite active presence on social media. Mentzen has been also attracting followers with a program that draws inspiration from U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political messages. Mentzen approaches run-off territory in recent Polish polls Polish voters will be going to the ballot boxes on May 18 to elect their new president this year. The incumbent, Andrzej Duda, is nearing the end of his second and last five-year term in office and won‚Äôt be able to run again under the country‚Äôs constitution. While none of the leading candidates is expected to win in the first round, Warsaw mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, nominated by Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs center-right, liberal-conservative Civic Platform (PO) party is the clear front-runner. Second in opinion polls is historian Karol Nawrocki, head of the Institute of National Remembrance, who is backed by President Duda‚Äôs right-wing, national-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) party. His place in the potential second round on June 1 is now challenged by S≈Çawomir Mentzen. Co za zako≈Ñczenie dnia! Dziƒôkujƒô O≈Çawa!

He launched his campaign at the end of August, earlier than his competitors, and has been narrowing the gap between him and the mainstream leaders. Mentzen is still third in the race but a survey conducted by the Polish research company Opinia24 in mid-March showed him with 18.9%, less than a percentage point behind Nawrocki at 19.5%. Trzaskowski is well ahead of both with the support of 32% of the respondents, although that‚Äôs not enough for a first round win. The results were published by RMF24 which ordered the poll. The Polish news outlet highlighted S≈Çawomir Mentzen‚Äôs continuous gain over the past few months. He has added 2 percentage points since February and is 8 points above his December score. Pro-crypto presidential candidate leads among young voters Polling numbers quoted by Politico are also registering Mentzen‚Äôs ascend throughout the race but pointing to a larger difference between him and Nawrocki. RMF24 noted, however, that Opinia24‚Äôs pre-election forecast for the 2023 parliamentary vote, when Mentzen won a seat in the Polish Sejm , was credited as the most accurate. Young Poles is the segment where Mentzen confidently leads, according to Opinia. Some 46% of those aged 18 to 29 have declared their intention to vote for Konfederacja‚Äôs 38-year-old candidate. He is also ranked first by Polish citizens in the 30-39 bracket and has a slight advantage over Trzaskowski among male voters. S≈Çawomir Mentzen has been relying heavily on popular platforms like Tiktok and X as well as Youtube to convey his views, a mix of conservative, nationalistic and libertarian ideas. He ‚Äúhas made social media his home,‚Äù the European political news website Euractiv pointed out in a recent article. His election program titled ‚ÄúStrong Rich Poland‚Äù abounds with political messages mirroring Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign promises such as ensuring ‚Äútight borders,‚Äù providing ‚Äúdefense of free speech,‚Äù ‚Äúreducing bureaucracy,‚Äù and introducing ‚Äúlow and simple taxes.‚Äù He insists ‚ÄúPoland needs a strong army‚Äù but says ‚ÄúNo to Polish troops in Ukraine.‚Äù Poland should create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If I become the President of Poland, our country will become a cryptocurrency haven, with very friendly regulations, low taxes, and a supportive approach from banks and regulators. BTC to the Moon! pic.twitter.com/izKc4spkkV ‚Äî S≈Çawomir Mentzen (@SlawomirMentzen) November 17, 2024 A full paragraph in his 20-point platform is dedicated to crypto. The Polish state fights it because it can‚Äôt control it, Mentzen says, vowing ‚Äúto strive to free up cryptocurrency trading‚Äù and ‚Äúensure Poland has the most crypto-friendly law in the entire European Union.‚Äù In a post on X in November, he also embraced Trump‚Äôs bitcoin reserve initiative. S≈Çawomir Mentzen holds a degree in physics and a PhD in economics after defending a doctoral thesis on public debt at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in his hometown of Toru≈Ñ.

Trump said on Sunday that no country would be given any special treatment regarding tariffs. He also signed new trade policies into effect on April 2 , which he calls ‚ÄúLiberation Day.‚Äù This frightened investors, who had expected a softer trade stance. Trump‚Äôs remarks set off a market-wide sell-off led by tech stocks . Shares in Tesla fell over 5%, the biggest decline for the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù tech behemoths. Already in the‚ÄÇcrosshairs of new trade restrictions, Nvidia saw its stock also tumble. New tariffs disrupt Nvidia‚Äôs role in the AI arms race An imminent 25% tariff from the US government on goods‚ÄÇfrom Mexico and Canada directly impacts Nvidia . The company produces advanced graphics‚ÄÇprocessing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence (AI) servers. So, many of these AI servers are put together in Mexico and driven across the border into the US. According to trade data, the US imported $43 billion in computers, including AI servers,‚ÄÇfrom Mexico in 2024. The company expects new tariffs to increase the cost of such servers, which could decrease demand for‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs AI chips. Taiwan, also a key source of‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs GPU supply, could also see the extension of trade controls. In 2024, the US imported $33‚ÄÇbillion worth of computer parts, including Nvidia-powered printed circuit boards, from Taiwan. The tech firm‚Äôs production costs could increase if Trump hits Taiwan with more tariffs. Nvidia gears up for major‚ÄÇchanges ahead The short-term effects of the tariffs will take time to play out, but Nvidia is already‚ÄÇlooking ahead. At its latest GTC conference , CEO Jensen Huang answered questions‚ÄÇabout trade restrictions, specifying that export control restrictions concerning artificial intelligence and China were the reason behind the firm‚Äôs challenges. He acknowledged that tariffs would have ‚Äúa little impact‚Äù on the company in the‚ÄÇshort term, but he also stressed‚ÄÇthat Nvidia is pursuing longer-term solutions. One important step toward that goal is expanding production in the US. Huang cited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ‚Äòs $100 billion investment to develop new chip factories in the United States. TSMC is a major manufacturing partner for Nvidia, and the move potentially helps mitigate overreliance on overseas factories in the future. However, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has‚ÄÇfaced pressure in 2025. As of Monday morning, it had fallen almost 22% from the start of‚ÄÇthe year. Before Trump made his most‚ÄÇrecent comments, analysts said the stock market had yet to fully digest the new tariffs‚Äô impact. Now, some financial experts are cautioning that‚ÄÇinvestors should also consider how these longer-term rules governing trade will inform the industry. Even before Trump‚Äôs latest remarks, some analysts had cautioned that the market was not yet‚ÄÇproperly pricing the full effects of these tariffs. According to Josh Schafer of Yahoo Finance reports, many investors underestimated the extent and scope of Trump‚Äôs‚ÄÇtrade policies. The market now sees how serious and long-term these tariffs‚ÄÇcould be, said Henrietta Treyz, an economic policy expert at Veda Partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Now priced at $0.70, that‚Äôs a more than 300%‚ÄÇrally for ADA to reach this goal. But skepticism simmers as network action fades ‚Äî daily transactions plunged 70% from late 2024, falling to 26,437‚ÄÇby early March 2025. With bullish patterns and rising social‚ÄÇsentiment suggesting support for a potential 20% bounce towards $0.85, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi upstart whose presale momentum and tokenomics could leave ADA‚Äôs subdued outlook in the dust. The Uncertain Horizon of‚ÄÇCardano Price‚ÄÇdynamics of Cardano are still trapped in the paradoxes. However, despite ascending social optimism‚Äîpartially driven by the SEC‚Äôs suddenly non-securities classification of ADA‚Äîthe network‚Äôs utility metrics fare‚ÄÇpoorly. Analysts draw attention to the bullish ‚Äúflag‚Äù pattern that has been developing since December‚ÄÇ2024, as is characteristic for a precursor to rallies, but declining transactional activity erodes confidence. Before ADA can reach its 2025 price peak of‚ÄÇ$1.20, it has to break the $0.85 resistance zone, equivalent to a 20% increase from where it is right now. Yet, skeptics wonder if deflating adoption can be the foundation for long-term growth, prompting investors to look‚ÄÇfor alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for those exponential returns. The Dominance of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ($0.025 ‚Äî Phase 4) is expected to see 140%‚ÄÇincrease at launch ($0.06). Those who take early stage pricing now can expect a 20% profit before the next price jump brings the price‚ÄÇto $0.03. Combine this with $5.9 million of capital already raised and 7600 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders and the algorithmic buy-pressure and revenue-redistribution tokenomics become a compelling‚ÄÇproposition. Mutuum Finance stands‚ÄÇout because of the self-sustaining ecosystem. Its lending protocol drives steady demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, and mtTokens‚Äîdeposit certificates‚ÄÇthat earn interest‚Äîgenerate supplemental yield streams. This incremental design of the presale, currently at its fourth of eleven stages, encourages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors to get in‚ÄÇon the action as soon as possible, with each tier raising the price to reward those who act fast. Favourable post-launch predictions fuelled by both exchange listings and platform adoption dictate a rise to $1.50‚Äì$3.50 in under a few months, equating with‚ÄÇa 5,900%‚Äì14,000% ROI for phase-four contributors. Strategic‚ÄÇGrowth & Security Mutuum Finance‚Äôs approach is‚ÄÇdriven by transparency A Certik audit is in progress for its smart contracts, with public release of results expected after they are‚ÄÇfinalized. Coupled with a tokenomics plan to dampen sell pressure, this specializing in security makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a‚ÄÇhigh reward, low risk entry. Unlike speculative assets, its value is directly correlated to platform usage ‚Äî every loan issued and every deposit made‚ÄÇincreases the demand for the token. As Cardano‚ÄÇstruggles with stagnating utility and Solana wrestles with volatility, Mutuum Finance becomes the presale phenomenon of 2025. As phase four fills quickly‚ÄÇand exchange listings are on the horizon, the fusion of DeFi innovation and strategic tokenomics offers a clear path to outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale marks a rare moment of urgency and opportunity‚ÄÇfor investors who are looking for a safe harbour from volatile markets. Seize the Momentum Mutuum Finance‚Äôs fourth presale phase is‚ÄÇcounting down the clock. Next 20% price jump‚ÄÇis around the corner ‚Äì $0.03 per token; after the launch, triple-digit returns.

The cryptocurrency was closing in on the $90,000 psychological level but has since reversed direction, falling by 6.4% over the past week to hover around $82,000 at the time of writing. This decline has placed renewed attention on market metrics that suggest the rally may have been short-lived. Amid this downward movement, several on-chain analysts have raised questions about whether recent price trends reflect real demand or speculative behavior. Particularly, insights from CryptoQuant contributors point to warning signs, including a divergence between market capitalization and actual network activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead NVT Indicator Signals Caution Amid Low Transaction Volume In a recent post titled ‚ÄúManipulative Moves or True Value? A Bitcoin and NVT Analysis,‚Äù CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest pointed to the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio as a critical metric for understanding current market dynamics. The NVT ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization by its daily transaction volume. According to BorisVest, Bitcoin‚Äôs elevated NVT Golden Cross reading indicates a high market cap against low transaction activity ‚Äî a combination that historically suggests price inflation driven by speculative interest rather than organic growth. BorisVest emphasized that periods with a high NVT often precede market corrections. In contrast, when the NVT falls into the green zone ‚Äî signaling a low market cap with rising transaction volume ‚Äî it may present a stronger foundation for price appreciation. As of now, the metric suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rise lacks transactional support, and continued pullbacks remain possible unless volume returns to the network. Bitcoin Speculators Absent, Sentiment Remains Cautious Adding to the cautious outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor known as crypto sunmoon highlighted the role of leverage in driving crypto bull markets. The analyst pointed out that funding rates have recently ‚Äúdead-crossed,‚Äù which occurs when short-term funding rates fall below long-term rates, often indicating bearish sentiment among traders. According to sunmoon, this shift suggests that speculators are currently unwilling to take on risk ‚Äî a key component needed to fuel bullish price movements. The analyst concluded that the return of speculative trading behavior, typically marked by rising funding rates and leveraged positions, is essential for reigniting upward momentum in Bitcoin.

This will be the firm‚Äôs first open-weight release since GPT-2, a decision that had been delayed due to other priorities but now feels essential. Per the update, the novel model is expected to bring strong reasoning capabilities and provide simplicity for developers and organizations. From OpenAI ChatGPT to Sora It is worth mentioning that Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, shared the news on X, expressing excitement about making the model highly effective. More importantly, this announcement follows OpenAI‚Äôs history of launching novel AI products. Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the tool has become widely used for text-based tasks. This Large Language Model transformed how people from different parts of the world interact with artificial intelligence . As reported by CoinGape, In 2024, OpenAI introduced Sora, an advanced video generation model. In addition, the release of voice Chat further improved AI‚Äôs role by allowing seamless spoken interactions. Interestingly, these notable innovations have redefined how AI integrates into daily life. Now, OpenAI is moving toward open-weight models. This will allow greater customization. For example, businesses, developers, and governments that prefer self-hosted AI solutions will be able to modify the model for specific needs. This new project could lead to wider adoption and new applications across various industries. ChatGPT Developer Involvement and Future Trends Before releasing the project to the public, OpenAI seeks developers‚Äô input through a series of sessions. According to Sam Altman, the events will begin in San Francisco, followed by meetings in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As detailed, developers will gain early access to prototypes, providing insight into potential applications. Altman confirmed that OpenAI will evaluate the model using its preparedness framework. Since open-weight models can be altered post-release, additional security measures will be implemented. By involving developers early, OpenAI intends to fuse innovation and responsibility. This will ensure that the model is both effective and safe for people to use. Another Studio Ghibli Trend Ahead? It is important to add that AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork has shown how artificial intelligence can shape creative industries. For context, when OpenAI added image generation to ChatGPT-4o, people started making Studio Ghibli-style portraits, and the trend quickly spread. Even Elon Musk joined the Ghibli trend . Still, this new trend has raised certain questions about the future of creative art. Still, with OpenAI‚Äôs new model on the way, another wave of AI-generated content could take off. As AI keeps improving, it may bring new ways for people to create and share.

The privacy tool, launched by Ethereum builders 0xbow.io on March 31, earned support from the likes of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who not only backed the privacy project but made one of the first deposits on the platform. 0xbow.io said that it implements ‚ÄúAssociation Sets‚Äù to batch transactions into the anonymous Privacy Pools and that a screening test is conducted to ensure that those transactions aren‚Äôt linked to illicit actors, such as hackers, phishers and scammers. gm Ethereum ‚òÄÔ∏è It is our great honor to announce the mainnet launch of Privacy Pools!

If a deposit is disqualified, the user can click the ‚Äúragequit‚Äù function to return the funds to their original deposit address. The innovation is part of 0xbow.io‚Äôs vision to ‚ÄúMake Privacy Normal Again‚Äù while also attempting to achieve regulatory compliance. Privacy protocols have received considerable backlash from regulators in recent years due to their increasing use by illicit actors to launder funds. One of those privacy tools, Tornado Cash, was sanctioned by the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) between August 2022 and March 2025 after it was linked to around $7 billion laundered by the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group. Tornado Cash has since been removed from OFAC‚Äôs blacklist after a US appeals court said the sanctions were unlawful in January 2025. 0xbow.io noted that initial deposits are limited to 1 Ether ( ETH ) but that the limit would be raised once the privacy protocol is more battle-tested. Privacy Pools inspired by Buterin and others Over 21 ETH has already been transferred into Privacy Pools from 69 deposits, including at least one from Buterin, 0xbow.io noted. Source: Vitalik Buterin In addition to Buterin, 0xbow.io said it also received investment support from Number Group, BanklessVC, Public Works and several angel investors. Related: Privacy isn‚Äôt a luxury in crypto, it‚Äôs a necessity ‚Äî Midnight CEO 0xbow.io also praised Buterin, Chainalysis Chief Scientist Jacob Illum, and two academics at the University of Basel in Switzerland for crafting a September 2023 white paper outlining how Privacy Pools could be built. 0xbow.io strategic adviser Ameen Soleimani also contributed to the paper, which has seen over 12,000 downloads and has been cited in nine other papers. The Privacy Pool code also passed a successful audit from Audit Wizard. a smart contract auditing firm co-founded by former Apple engineer Joe van Loon. More than $41 billion worth of illicit transfers were made in 2024, which made up 0.14% of total onchain volume for the year, according to the Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime report published on Jan. 15. While it marked around an 11% fall from 2023, Chainalysis said that figure could climb to around $51 billion as more criminal-tied addresses are found. Magazine: What are native rollups?

42726270,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24964,1743470105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is Gunz (GUN)?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/token/what-is-gunz-gun/,"GUNZ is a blockchain-based platform integrated into traditional gaming formats, enabling players to convert in-game items into NFTs (non-fungible tokens) if they choose to do so. Bitfinex is one of the first global exchanges to list the GUN token. Unlike typical free-to-play games where purchased or earned items remain locked within the game ecosystem, GUNZ gives players actual ownership of digital assets, meaning these items can be traded, kept, or sold on the in-game marketplace or other compatible platforms. This approach aims to provide more flexibility and control to users over the digital goods they earn during gameplay. The platform is currently featured in two games: Off The Grid (OTG), a cyberpunk-themed extraction battle royale available on PC and consoles, and Technocore , a mobile game focused on navigating a drone through complex environments while collecting loot. Players in both titles can find loot boxes known as HEXes, which, if successfully extracted, can be converted into NFTs. This mechanism links gameplay achievements with blockchain-based ownership, distinguishing GUNZ from traditional loot or cosmetic systems. Trade Gun Now What is the GUN Token? The GUN token is the native digital currency of the GUNZ gaming platform, designed to support a decentralized economy within participating games such as Off The Grid and Technocore . It serves as both a utility and reward token, enabling players to trade, purchase, and unlock in-game items and features. Unlike traditional game currencies that are confined to a single game or controlled entirely by a central authority, GUN operates on a blockchain, giving players verifiable ownership of the tokens they earn or purchase. Within the GUNZ ecosystem, GUN tokens are primarily used to facilitate transactions on the in-game marketplace, where players can buy, sell, or trade items that have been tokenized as NFTs. These items can range from weapons and cosmetic upgrades to character enhancements and hideout features. This decentralized model means players can extract real-world value from their in-game progress by exchanging digital assets in a transparent and secure environment. trade gun now GUN is also tied to gameplay incentives. Players earn tokens by completing various challenges or objectives during matches, such as ranking highly in the game, extracting loot, or using specific gear effectively. This system encourages active participation and skill development, rewarding players not only with in-game progression but with tradable digital assets. These tokens can then be reinvested into the game or held as a form of value, depending on the user‚Äôs preferences. Importantly, the GUN token is optional for players who prefer a more traditional gaming experience. Players can enjoy GUNZ-powered games without engaging in the token economy, as all core gameplay features remain accessible without the use of GUN.

District Court to reinstate its Freedom of Information Act‚ÄÇlawsuit against government agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) The‚ÄÇexchange says the FDIC is still withholding some important documents and not fully cooperating with requests for information. The lawsuit seeks to force the FDIC to hand over records of its conversations with banks related to cryptocurrency actions, including the ‚Äòpause letters‚Äô issued to banks telling them to stop providing‚ÄÇcrypto services.‚Äù Coinbase seeks court‚Äôs intervention as FDIC cooperation falters in Operation Choke Point 2.0 dispute Coinbase has been involved in a¬†months-long battle¬†with the FDIC. The firm has been pursuing the FDIC over Operation Choke Point 2.0 for months now and has achieved impressive results. Despite this, Coinbase is asking the DC District Court to resume its litigation against the regulator. The legal action was initially paused in February 2025 after President Trump appointed Travis Hill as acting FDIC chairman. Hill vowed to enhance the agency‚Äôs transparency beyond FOIA requirements, raising hopes that the matter could be resolved outside of court. Still, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, says there is ongoing dissatisfaction with the FDIC‚Äôs transparency. He acknowledges that cooperation has improved under the new leadership but feels it is still not enough. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking the Court to resume our lawsuit because the FDIC has unfortunately stopped sharing information. While we would have loved to resolve this outside of the legal system ‚Äì and we do appreciate the increased cooperation we‚Äôve seen from the new FDIC leadership ‚Äì we still have a ways to go,‚Äù¬†claimed¬†Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer. As a key US financial regulator overseeing banks, the FDIC played a central role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, restricting banks‚Äô interactions with cryptocurrency businesses. However, it recently began a pro-crypto turn, releasing relevant documents and revoking several of its anti-crypto regulations. Grewal says that he ‚Äúappreciated the increased cooperation‚Äù from the FDIC. However, he noted that the cooperation had stopped weeks ago. According to Coinbase‚Äôs filing , the FDIC hasn‚Äôt sent any new information since late February and claimed in early March that the exchange‚Äôs subsequent requests were ‚Äúunreasonable and beyond the scope of discovery.‚Äù The FDIC is expected to respond to¬†Coinbase‚Äôs¬†motion within two weeks. Coinbase pushes for court action as FDIC‚Äôs overreach could alter the future of crypto innovation Operation Choke Point 2.0 is the term used for a series of actions allegedly taken by certain federal regulators and agencies, including the FDIC, to limit banking access to certain high-risk or controversial industries, including cryptocurrency businesses. Critics say this is a subtle ploy to kill the crypto space by denying exchanges, brokerages, and other players‚ÄÇin the ecosystem access to traditional banking services. Coinbase contends that actions taken, especially through informal guidance and informal pressure on banks, have launched a hostile environment for‚ÄÇcryptocurrency businesses under the FDIC. These operations resulted in an illegal restriction on access to banking services, which placed cryptographic firms in a‚ÄÇrelatively disadvantaged position in the financial arena. As part of its effort to revive the case,‚ÄÇCoinbase is seeking court intervention to compel the FDIC to answer and prevent such overreach in the future. Coinbase argues that such overreach chills innovation in the digital assets market. The FDIC‚Äôs actions, they argue, violate both due process and the First Amendment, as cryptocurrency companies believe they should not be penalized based on what business they choose to operate. If Coinbase is‚ÄÇsuccessful in reviving its lawsuit, the implications could be sweeping for both the cryptocurrency industry and the regulatory agencies.

XRP has focused on cross-border remittances, while Bittensor has introduced a decentralized approach to AI training. BlockDAG , however, is taking a broader view. Its roadmap includes decentralized identity, AI integration, and token-holder governance‚Äîbuilt on its DAG-based hybrid architecture. With a $209.5 million presale and a 2,380% return from Batch 1 to Batch 27, BlockDAG is framing itself not just as a project, but as a platform designed to support the next phase of the Web3 ecosystem. XRP‚Äôs Role in Global Payments & Its Investment Track Record Ripple Labs launched XRP in 2012 to streamline international payments. It was built to provide fast, low-cost transaction processing for banks and financial institutions, specifically through real-time gross settlement and remittance networks. At launch, XRP traded for fractions of a cent. Today, as of March 28, 2025, it is priced around $2.32. Its journey has been marked by market shifts and, more significantly, legal scrutiny. The SEC lawsuit initiated in 2020 has had a lasting impact on XRP‚Äôs price and market standing. Despite those legal headwinds, XRP continues to hold a major market position. It remains one of the top digital assets by market capitalization, with growing adoption among banks and payment providers worldwide. This suggests that, despite its challenges, XRP has maintained long-term utility in global finance. Bittensor (TAO): Decentralized AI & Notable Price Movement Bittensor‚Äôs TAO token went live on March 6, 2023, at an initial price of $93.40. The network aims to decentralize artificial intelligence by enabling participants to contribute computing resources and algorithms to a shared ecosystem. The goal is to create an open, collaborative AI marketplace. TAO saw sharp price movements following launch. It peaked at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. These figures show significant investor returns from the starting price, even amid the typical volatility of crypto markets. What makes Bittensor stand out is its blend of AI and blockchain. This intersection has attracted attention from developers and investors alike. As more industries explore decentralized AI models, TAO‚Äôs role as an early mover could prove significant in shaping this new segment of the crypto economy. BlockDAG‚Äôs Future-Focused Roadmap: From AI to Digital Identity As blockchain evolves, the focus is moving away from simple transaction speeds and toward building meaningful infrastructure. BlockDAG is aligning itself with this shift‚Äîby preparing for a digital future that includes AI, self-managed identity, and decentralized governance. With $209.5 million raised in its presale‚Äîachieved without institutional venture backing‚ÄîBlockDAG demonstrates how community support can drive momentum. It‚Äôs now in Batch 27, selling tokens at $0.0248. From Batch 1 to date, the ROI has reached 2,380%, and over 19 billion coins have already been sold. But this traction supports more than just market demand. BlockDAG is actively developing infrastructure for use cases that extend beyond finance. Features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge cryptography, and smart contract flexibility are core to its architecture‚Äîsetting the stage for identity solutions, AI agents, and programmable governance. This means users could one day control their digital identity securely without third-party oversight, or engage with autonomous AI systems for everyday tasks. Governance could evolve beyond voting apps into smart, code-driven policy-making tools‚Äîgiving token holders real influence. These aren‚Äôt speculative ideas. They‚Äôre technical possibilities being built into the foundation today. With Testnet already in motion and Mainnet on the horizon, BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem is actively preparing for these applications‚Äînot years from now, but in the near term. Key Insights! As blockchain technology matures, the strongest projects will be those building more than tokens. XRP pushed the boundaries of payment speed, and Bittensor opened up new ground in decentralized AI. But BlockDAG is constructing something more comprehensive. Its roadmap addresses foundational needs: AI-native compatibility, identity ownership, and token-based governance. And with a community-funded $209.5 million presale‚Äîno early VC required‚ÄîBlockDAG is proving that users are ready to back purpose-driven infrastructure. As Web3 scales globally, the future will belong to platforms that empower users with both control and functionality. BlockDAG‚Äôs architecture is built with that in mind‚Äîfocused on resilience, adaptability, and utility in the years to come.

33767162,[object Object],1743472821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Completes Most Bearish Q1 In 7 Years With 46% Losses, Is A Repeat Of 2018 Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-most-bearish-q1/,"Dogecoin is set to complete its most bearish first quarter of the year in seven years with a quarterly loss of around 46%. This has raised the possibility of the foremost meme coin witnessing a repeat of the 2018 price action, when it recorded its worst Q1 loss ever. Dogecoin Set To Complete Most Bearish Q1 In Seven Years Cryptorank data shows that Dogecoin is set to complete its most bearish first quarter in seven years with a loss of around 46%. This is also the first time DOGE has recorded a Q1 loss in three years. In 2023, the foremost meme coin recorded a gain of almost 10%, while in 2024, it recorded an astonishing increase of 147%. Market participants had begun the year with high hopes for Dogecoin, as this year was meant to mark the peak of its bull run, but that hasn‚Äôt happened. In January, the meme coin closed with a meager gain of 4%. However, things quickly spiraled in February when DOGE closed with a loss of 38.5%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has also recorded a loss of 17.5% this month. It is worth mentioning that 2018 is the only time Dogecoin has recorded a worse Q1 loss, losing 68.8% during that period. Based on this, DOGE could mirror the 2018 price action. If so, the foremost meme coin is set to record a Q2 loss, just like in 2018. However, a positive is that Q3 could turn things around like it did in 2018. In 2018, Dogecoin recorded an impressive gain of 138% in Q3 after suffering losses of 68.8% and 11.5% in Q1 and Q2, respectively. A similar gain in Q3 of this year could help erase DOGE‚Äôs losses in this quarter and any potential loss in Q2. However, based on the 2018 price action, the Q3 rally would mark the peak of its bull run this year. DOGE Holding Above Lower Boundary Of Ascending Channel In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Dogecoin continues to hold above the lower boundary of an ascending channel. He remarked that a spike in demand at this current level could fuel a rally toward the mid or upper range. His accompanying chart showed that the mid-range is at $4 while the upper range is above $7. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade suggested that Dogecoin might have found its bottom amid the recent market crash. He stated that DOGE could follow the fractals from September 2024, which could lead to a bullish reversal for the meme coin. Crypto analyst Mater Kenobi also recently alluded to the September 2024 price action, predicting that DOGE could break out again like it did back then. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.165, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|Ali Martinez|Ascending Channel|Coinmarketcap|CryptoRank|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Master Kenobi|meme coin|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-01 02:00:21

The cryptocurrency has declined by 22.3% in the last month alone, bringing its price down to $83,191 at the time of writing. The drop reflects ongoing uncertainty in the broader crypto market, as investors are struggling with reduced risk appetite and a lack of strong bullish catalysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Targets Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally, What Happened Last Time Whale Accumulation Patterns Echo Previous Bull Market Phases Despite the downtrend, recent on-chain activity suggests that certain investor cohorts remain confident in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value. In particular, whale addresses‚Äîwallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC‚Äîhave demonstrated a historical correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends. According to CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet, the current market cycle bears a resemblance to the 2020 bull cycle, where these whales exhibited accumulation behavior during bearish sentiment phases. Mignolet noted that these patterns occurred three times throughout the 2020 cycle, each coinciding with brief drawdowns in price. In the current phase, similar accumulation activity is being observed among whale entities, particularly those with holdings in the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. These patterns, as Mignolet suggests, may indicate that these market leaders are not exiting their positions, despite price pressure. Notably, the significance of whale behavior lies in its historical influence on market direction. As long as whales remain in accumulation mode, it could provide a base of support for the broader market and reduce the likelihood of further rapid declines. However, this dynamic does not eliminate the possibility of continued volatility, especially if broader market sentiment does not improve. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Capitulation In contrast to whale activity, short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of distress. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has remained below 1.0 for over two months, currently hovering around 0.98. This metric compares the selling price of Bitcoin with its acquisition price. When it falls below 1, it suggests that holders are selling at a loss‚Äîoften viewed as a sign of capitulation. STH Capitulation ‚ÄúWhen this ratio drops below 1, it signals capitulation among STHs, often leading to short-term price declines. We can confirm this trend by observing the $BTC being sent to exchanges at a loss.‚Äù ‚Äì By @Darkfost_Coc Link ‚§µÔ∏èhttps://t.co/BUIo9caGck pic.twitter.com/QfNfFpT9VL ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 31, 2025 Additionally, on-chain data shows that approximately 46,000 BTC have been sent to exchanges at a loss in recent weeks, highlighting the stress among STHs.

Helium‚Äôs IoT hotspots and Raydium‚Äôs slick Solana-based exchange show strong efforts to shape the future. But despite their ambitions, both have struggled to maintain consistent network reliability and market strength. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pulling ahead by doing what others haven‚Äôt: making uptime a priority. With fault-tolerant design and seamless availability, it‚Äôs giving users and developers a dependable place to build‚Äîand that‚Äôs translating directly into presale success and growing momentum. Helium‚Äôs Wireless Vision Shows Promise Helium began its journey in 2012, founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey. It officially launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to create a fully decentralized network for IoT devices. The idea was bold: reward users for setting up hotspots to expand wireless coverage. Then came Helium Mobile in May 2023, offering unlimited talk, text, and data for just $20 a month. That move paid off‚Äîby December 2023, Helium Mobile made up roughly 90% of Helium‚Äôs entire network revenue. The token story, however, has been a rollercoaster. In Q3 2024, HNT‚Äôs circulating market cap surged 124% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, while its price jumped 119% to $7.54. But as of March 28, 2025, HNT has fallen back to $3.37‚Äîa steep 93.1% drop from its peak of $48.80. Despite this, Helium‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding globally, boosted by fresh partnerships and international moves. Still, the volatility leaves questions around its long-term reliability. Raydium Surges on Solana‚ÄîBut Faces the Heat of Big Volume Raydium entered the market in early 2021 and quickly carved out space as a go-to DEX on Solana. Thanks to Solana‚Äôs speed and low fees, Raydium attracted users fast‚Äîhandling between $1 and $2 billion in weekly trading volume by early 2024. Then came a massive spike: $12 billion in a single week later that year, underscoring its explosive growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium‚Äôs RAY token is priced at $2.00. Daily trading volume stands at roughly $56.99 million, and its market cap is around $581.66 million. With control of 60.7% of Solana‚Äôs DEX market, Raydium has certainly proven its strength in DeFi. But even with liquidity and development on its side, keeping pace with growing expectations is no small task. BlockDAG‚Äôs Secret Weapon? Always-On Infrastructure That Won‚Äôt Let You Down What‚Äôs driving the buzz around BlockDAG? It‚Äôs not just the gains‚Äîit‚Äôs the rock-solid foundation underneath. While other platforms face outages and pressure during high demand, BlockDAG is built to stay live no matter what. Its fault-tolerant design ensures that even if nodes or regions fail, the network keeps moving. This is no accident. BlockDAG‚Äôs global architecture spreads across multiple data centers, rerouting traffic instantly when needed. That means no bottlenecks, no panic, and no interruptions for users or developers. It‚Äôs smart, stable, and ahead of the curve. And it‚Äôs working. BlockDAG has already raised $209.5 million during its presale. With over 18.9 billion coins sold and batch 27 priced at $0.0248, the return from batch 1 stands at a jaw-dropping 2,380%. That kind of growth doesn‚Äôt come from hype alone‚Äîit comes from confidence. This isn‚Äôt just about having a strong system. It‚Äôs about showing users they can trust it to be there tomorrow, next year, and beyond. And in crypto, that kind of trust is rare‚Äîand valuable. Why BlockDAG‚Äôs Resilience Could Be the Edge Every Developer Wants Every blockchain wants to promise big returns, but only a few can guarantee stability. Helium has the vision, and Raydium brings liquidity‚Äîbut both face pressure to maintain uptime and confidence. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has made reliability part of its DNA. Its infrastructure is built to handle pressure without flinching, and that‚Äôs exactly what developers and buyers are looking for. The presale numbers already prove it, but the real story is in the long game. As more projects look to build without disruption, BlockDAG‚Äôs fault tolerance becomes more than just a feature‚Äîit becomes a reason to choose it over others. And with this level of performance and investor backing, it‚Äôs clear: BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just ready for what‚Äôs next‚Äîit‚Äôs already building it.

New projects launch daily, hype comes and goes, and trends shift like quicksand. But one thing never changes: the search for the best altcoins to invest in now. Everyone wants to find the next breakout project before it skyrockets, the token that could turn a few hundred bucks into a fortune. And right now, some serious contenders are making waves. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand, and Injective‚Äîthree powerhouse projects that aren‚Äôt just surviving in this chaotic market but thriving. These aren‚Äôt your average altcoins; they‚Äôre leading the charge in Web3 innovation, sustainable blockchain solutions, and decentralized finance (DeFi). If you‚Äôre looking for real opportunities‚Äînot just speculation‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the right place. Let‚Äôs break down why these three could be the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads as the world‚Äôs first Layer-1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly bridging various blockchain ecosystems. Currently in its 28th stage of its crypto presale , Qubetics ($TICS) has sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900+ holders, raising $15.5 million. Priced at $0.1430 per token, analysts are buzzing with predictions. By the end of the crypto presale, $TICS is expected to reach $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Following the mainnet launch, some estimates suggest $TICS could soar to $15, an astonishing 10,388% ROI, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Just imagine a $2,000 investment in $TICS at $0.1430 secures 13,980 tokens. If the price hits $1, that‚Äôs $13,980; at $5, it grows to $69,900. If $TICS reaches $15, your $2,000 turns into $209,700 ‚Äî a massive 10,388% ROI. But what‚Äôs fueling this excitement? Qubetics ($TICS) is pioneering a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine a platform where businesses can tokenize assets like real estate, art, or intellectual property, making them accessible to a global audience. A startup could fractionalize its equity, allowing backers worldwide to own a piece. Artists might tokenize their work, enabling fans to buy shares and support their creations directly. This democratization of assets is not just a concept; Qubetics ($TICS), as a first-layer blockchain, is making it a reality, positioning itself as a game-changer in the investment landscape. Algorand: The Green Powerhouse of Blockchain Algorand has carved a niche as a sustainable and efficient blockchain platform. Founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand runs on a Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism that delivers high-speed transaction finality, low fees, and minimal energy consumption. Its environmentally friendly model has earned it recognition as one of the most sustainable blockchains in the world, aligning with the growing demand for green technology across global markets. The platform is designed to support a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services and asset tokenization to identity solutions and cross-border payments. Its smart contract capabilities are scalable and secure, offering developers a robust environment to build next-generation applications. Algorand has also gained traction with institutions and governments exploring blockchain-based solutions for digital identity, carbon tracking, and central bank digital currencies. What sets Algorand apart is its consistent focus on real-world impact and academic innovation. Backed by a passionate community and a growing ecosystem of partnerships, it continues to attract developers, enterprises, and organizations that value speed, security, and sustainability. Despite broader market volatility, Algorand‚Äôs commitment to future-focused blockchain infrastructure makes it one of the most compelling projects in the space for long-term adoption and development. Injective: Redefining Decentralized Trading Injective is gaining serious attention for reimagining decentralized trading with an infrastructure that blends speed, security, and complete user control. At its core, Injective powers a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem that allows users to trade spot, perpetual, and derivatives assets ‚Äî all with zero gas fees. This model removes a major friction point seen in other DeFi platforms, making on-chain trading faster and far more cost-effective. Unlike traditional DEXs that sacrifice speed for decentralization, Injective leverages advanced infrastructure to deliver both. A standout development is Injective‚Äôs integration with the Cosmos SDK, which brings enhanced interoperability across various blockchain networks. This expansion enables Injective to offer seamless cross-chain trading, opening doors to deeper liquidity and broader use cases. The platform also supports custom-built financial markets, giving developers the ability to launch innovative DeFi products without needing to rely on centralized intermediaries.

In a March 31 post on X, Armstrong argued that crypto companies should be treated similarly to banks and be ‚Äúallowed to, and incentivized to, share interest with consumers.‚Äù He added that allowing onchain interest would be ‚Äúconsistent with a free market approach.‚Äù Source: Brian Armstrong There are currently two competing pieces of federal stablecoin legislation working their way through the legislative process in the US: the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. In reference to the stablecoin legislation, Armstrong said the US had an opportunity to ‚Äúlevel the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.‚Äù Armstrong: Onchain interest a boon for US economy Armstrong argued that while stablecoins have already found product-market fit by ‚Äúdigitizing the dollar and other fiat currencies,‚Äù the addition of onchain interest would allow ‚Äúthe average person, and the US economy, to reap the full benefits.‚Äù He said that if legislative changes allowed stablecoin issuers to pay interest to holders, US consumers could earn a yield of around 4% on their holdings, far outstripping the 2024 average interest yield on a consumer savings account, which Armstrong cited as 0.41%. Armstrong also said onchain interest could benefit the broader US economy ‚Äî by incentivizing the global use of US dollar stablecoins. This could see their use grow, ‚Äúpulling dollars back to U.S. treasuries and extending dollar dominance in an increasingly digital global economy,‚Äù according to the Coinbase CEO. He also argued that the potential for a higher yield than traditional savings accounts would result in ‚Äúmore yield in consumers‚Äô hands means more spending, saving, investing ‚Äî fueling economic growth in all local economies where stablecoins are held.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt unlock onchain interest, the U.S. misses out on billions more USD users and trillions in potential cash flows,‚Äù Armstrong added. Currently, neither the STABLE Act nor the GENIUS Act gives the legal go-ahead for onchain interest-generating stablecoins. In fact, in its current form, the STABLE Act includes a short passage prohibiting ‚Äúpayment stablecoin‚Äù issuers from paying yield to holders: Source: STABLE Act Related: Stablecoins, tokenized assets gain as Trump tariffs loom Similarly, the GENIUS Act, which recently passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18-6, has been amended to exclude interest-bearing instruments from its definition of a ‚Äúpayment stablecoin.‚Äù Commenting on the current state of the STABLE Act, Representative Bryan Steil told Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, that two pieces of legislation are positioned to ‚Äúmirror up‚Äù following a few more draft rounds in the House and Senate ‚Äî due to the differences between them being textual rather than substantive. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I think there‚Äôs recognition that we want to work with our Senate colleagues to get this across the line,‚Äù Steil said.

However, according to Etherscan, another 25 Ether was then sent to a wallet listed as Chainflip1. Earlier, another user warned the exploiter about the error, telling them, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate,‚Äù because all the funds were sent to the scam Tornado Cash URL. ‚ÄúIt is so devastating.

Source: Etherscan How zkLend was exploited for $9.6 million zkLend suffered an empty market exploit on Feb. 11 when an attacker used a small deposit and flash loans to inflate the lending accumulator, according to the protocol‚Äôs Feb. 14 post-mortem. The hacker then repeatedly deposited and withdrew funds, exploiting rounding errors that became significant due to the inflated accumulator. The attacker bridged the stolen funds to Ethereum and later failed to launder them through Railgun after protocol policies returned them to the original address. Following the exploit, zkLend proposed the hacker could keep 10% of the funds as a bounty and offered to release the culprit from legal liability and scrutiny from law enforcement if the remaining Ether was returned.

With every scroll through Crypto Twitter, it feels like there‚Äôs a new viral coin making waves. From trading groups to TikTok crypto threads, meme coins are constantly buzzing. And while some coins blow up overnight, the real challenge is spotting the gems before they explode. That‚Äôs where this list comes in‚Äîspecifically spotlighting three of the best new meme coins to invest in right now that are gaining major traction in 2025. And leading this charge is none other than BTFD Coin , a meme coin currently in its presale‚Äôs penultimate stage. With a clever referral program, an engaged army of Bulls, and jaw-dropping growth potential, it‚Äôs turning heads faster than a bull stampede. Let‚Äôs break down why BTFD and two other meme coins like PENGU and BABYDOGE deserve your attention. 1. BTFD Coin: The Bullish Referral Program Everyone‚Äôs Talking About BTFD Coin is a meme coin with serious momentum‚Äîand it‚Äôs not slowing down. With the presale clock ticking and only one stage left, bulls are stampeding into the project. Over $6.45 million has already been raised, with more than 11,700 holders locking in over 72 billion $BTFD tokens. The current price? Just $0.0002. But analysts project it‚Äôll list at $0.0006, and possibly reach its moon target of $0.006, which would represent a 2900% ROI. But the biggest buzz right now? The referral program . If you‚Äôve ever wanted to earn crypto by simply spreading the word, BTFD has it dialed in. Here‚Äôs how it works: users share a unique code‚Äîanyone who uses it and invests $50+ gets 10% more tokens, and if you make the leaderboard, you earn 10% of your referral‚Äôs raise amount. For example, if your code brings in $15,000 in purchases, you could snag $1,500 worth of $BTFD tokens on top of your own. That‚Äôs a whole new layer of passive earning. This referral race runs until the end of the month, and top performers are already stacking serious token bonuses. The fact that you can build your bag just by sharing a code? That‚Äôs a rare opportunity, especially in a meme coin presale that‚Äôs already gaining traction globally. Wondering how to grab your bag of BTFD before it‚Äôs too late? Just set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, then head to the buy page . Once connected, choose your amount, buy, and confirm.

There‚Äôs also a full Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1, 2025. Whether you‚Äôre earning through gaming, staking, or the referral system‚ÄîBTFD‚Äôs utility is seriously layered.

Inspired by Dogecoin, BABYDOGE plays up the cute factor while delivering increasingly functional updates like charitable giving campaigns, DeFi integrations, and a growing suite of ecosystem tools. One of the biggest advantages of BABYDOGE is its massive fanbase and constant online visibility. From viral tweets to exchange listings, it always finds a way to stay relevant. And for new investors or crypto-curious millennials, that visibility matters‚Äîit signals active development and constant demand.

Last week, digital asset investment products attracted a substantial $226 million in inflows, marking nine consecutive trading days of positive sentiment and fueling cautious optimism among investors, according to a CoinShares report. This turnaround follows a particularly rough patch, though a minor setback occurred on Friday, with $74 million exiting the market, likely spooked by unexpectedly high US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data that could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decisions. Bitcoin (BTC) remains the undisputed king of crypto assets, pulling in a commanding $195 million in inflows. This cements its position as the go-to digital asset for institutional investors seeking exposure to the crypto market. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products experienced their fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $2.5 million, suggesting that bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin is waning as long-term optimism takes hold. Despite this recent resurgence, total assets under management (AUM) for global Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have fallen to $114 billion, the lowest since shortly after the US presidential election. This figure suggests that there is still progress to be made. Perhaps the most encouraging sign is the altcoin market finally breaking its losing streak. Altcoins collectively secured $33 million in inflows, a welcome change after four consecutive weeks of outflows totaling a staggering $1.7 billion. Leading this altcoin resurgence were: Ethereum (ETH): $14.5 million Solana (SOL): $7.8 million XRP: $4.8 million Sui (SUI): $4.0 million This marks the first week in over a month that altcoins have seen positive flows, indicating renewed investor confidence in Layer-1 ecosystems and payment-focused tokens. Across the Globe: Where is the Crypto Money Flowing? The positive trend was not confined to a single region; major players across the globe contributed to the inflows: United States: $204 million Switzerland: $14.7 million Germany: $9.2 million Minor outflows were registered in: Hong Kong: $2.1 million Brazil: $1.3 million Navigating macroeconomic uncertainty The recent inflows offer a glimmer of hope that investor sentiment is turning cautiously optimistic. However, macroeconomic headwinds, particularly inflation data and Federal Reserve policy, continue to cast a shadow over the short-term outlook. If this positive momentum can be sustained, altcoins could extend their recovery, and Bitcoin could establish a stable position above current levels. A sustained recovery would indicate the continued strength of institutional interest in the overall digital asset class.

ETH is now consolidating and facing key hurdles near the $1,850 level. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $1,980 resistance level. The price is trading below $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,050 and started another decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,880 and $1,850 support levels. It tested the $1,765 zone. A low was formed at $1,767 and the price recently started a short-term recovery wave . The price climbed above the $1,800 resistance. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,850 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,860 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,900 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. A clear move above the $1,900 resistance might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. An upside break above the $2,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level. The first major support sits near the $1,780 zone. A clear move below the $1,780 support might push the price toward the $1,765 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,710 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,665. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI ‚Äì The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

This comes despite the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent challenges, having plummeted 25% from its all-time high in January of this year. Interestingly, this latest acquisition marks the largest in terms of tokens for Strategy in 2025. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings To $43.4 Billion Since late October, Strategy has engaged in a series of nearly weekly purchases, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately $43.4 billion. Remarkably, this amount represents about 2.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be issued. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Strategy acquired 22,048 Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $86,969 each between March 24 and March 30. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Confirms Breakout From Ascending Triangle, Target Set At $7,800 This purchase is part of a larger trend for the company, which has actively sought to bolster its Bitcoin reserves. In the first quarter alone, Strategy spent approximately $7.79 billion on Bitcoin, with the next largest acquisition earlier this year totaling 20,356 Bitcoin, announced on February 24. To finance this latest purchase, Strategy utilized proceeds raised through its at-the-market sales program for common shares, as well as offerings of preferred shares. This financing approach has proven successful, as the common shares of Strategy have surged nearly 2,200% since Saylor began investing the company‚Äôs cash into Bitcoin in 2020. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin itself has seen an increase of over 600%. Market Indicators Signal Potential BTC Recovery Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently attempting to consolidate above the critical support level of $80,000 after experiencing a decline toward $76,000 for the first time since November 2024. Despite this recent drop, indicators suggest potential for further price recovery in the near term. Recent research from analysis firm CryptoQuant highlights the significance of Binance‚Äôs spot trading volume in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, in early 2025, when Binance‚Äôs volume surpassed that of all other exchanges combined, Bitcoin was experiencing a surge toward new all-time highs of $109,000. The Binance vs. Other Exchanges BTC Spot Volume Delta indicator has turned positive again, indicating that Binance‚Äôs trading volume is consistently outpacing that of its competitors. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key The last time this trend was observed, BTC was trading around $42,000 before climbing to $73,000. Historically, periods of heightened Binance volume have been associated with bullish market sentiment, suggesting that traders may view Binance‚Äôs dominance as a positive signal for Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. It is also worth noting that at the beginning of 2024, Binance‚Äôs volume was reported to be 19 times greater than Coinbase‚Äôs. Although this disparity has decreased to eight times, it still highlights Binance‚Äôs significant leadership in the market.

His family‚Äôs increasing involvement in crypto ventures, including memecoins and stablecoins, is now being cited as a significant complicating factor in the already intricate landscape of crypto regulation . This unexpected intersection of celebrity, politics, and digital assets is raising eyebrows and creating legislative hurdles on Capitol Hill. Is Trump‚Äôs crypto gamble about to reshape the future of digital currency laws? Trump‚Äôs Crypto Ventures Cast Shadow on Crypto Legislation Rep. French Hill (R-AR), a key figure in bipartisan efforts to establish clear crypto legislation , has openly voiced concerns about the challenges posed by Trump‚Äôs burgeoning crypto portfolio. According to a recent report by Decrypt, Hill stated that these ventures are muddying the waters when it comes to achieving consensus on Capitol Hill. This couldn‚Äôt come at a more critical time, especially with pivotal bills like the STABLE Act poised to be reviewed by Congress this week. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why Trump‚Äôs crypto activities are causing legislative headaches: Conflict of Interest Concerns: With Trump‚Äôs family directly benefiting from crypto ventures, questions arise about potential conflicts of interest when shaping cryptocurrency policy . Critics argue that personal financial gains could influence political decision-making, undermining the impartiality needed for effective regulation. Erosion of Bipartisan Support: The already fragile bipartisan consensus on crypto regulation is further strained. Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have been vocal in their criticism, labeling Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures a ‚Äúgrift.‚Äù This sharp rhetoric can deepen partisan divides and make finding common ground on complex issues like the STABLE Act even harder. Increased Scrutiny and Delays: The controversy surrounding Trump crypto ventures is likely to lead to increased scrutiny of any crypto-related bills. Lawmakers might become more cautious, potentially delaying the progress of crucial legislation as they navigate the ethical and political implications of regulating an industry so closely tied to a prominent political figure. The STABLE Act and the Shadow of Trump Crypto The timing of this controversy is particularly sensitive. The STABLE Act, a significant piece of proposed crypto legislation aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework for stablecoins, is heading to Congress this week.

The STABLE Act, or the ‚ÄúStablecoin Transparency of Reserves and Uniform Law Enforcement Act,‚Äù seeks to: Feature Description Regulatory Clarity Establishes a clear federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, addressing concerns about their reserves and operational transparency. Consumer Protection Aims to protect consumers by ensuring stablecoin issuers maintain adequate reserves and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Financial Stability Seeks to mitigate potential risks to the financial system posed by the growing stablecoin market, especially in light of their increasing integration with traditional finance. The act‚Äôs progress is crucial for the future of stablecoins and the broader crypto market. However, the political storm stirred by Trump crypto could make it harder to achieve the bipartisan support needed for its passage. Navigating the Complex Web of Cryptocurrency Policy The situation highlights the broader challenges in formulating effective cryptocurrency policy . The rapid evolution of the crypto market, coupled with the increasing involvement of public figures, demands a nuanced and adaptable regulatory approach. Here are some key considerations for navigating this complex web: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The goal is to foster innovation in the crypto space while simultaneously mitigating risks and protecting consumers. Overly stringent regulations could stifle growth, while lax oversight could lead to instability and illicit activities. Addressing Conflicts of Interest: Clear ethical guidelines are needed to address potential conflicts of interest when politicians or their families are involved in the crypto industry. Transparency and recusal mechanisms may be necessary to maintain public trust. Promoting Bipartisan Cooperation: Given the polarized political climate, fostering bipartisan cooperation is crucial for effective crypto legislation . Finding common ground on consumer protection, financial stability, and national security concerns can pave the way for meaningful progress. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making international regulatory coordination essential. Harmonizing regulations across jurisdictions can prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure a level playing field. The Road Ahead for Crypto Regulation: Challenges and Opportunities Trump‚Äôs entry into the crypto world has undeniably thrown a curveball into the ongoing efforts to regulate digital assets. While his ventures present unique challenges, they also underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This moment could be a catalyst for more serious and comprehensive discussions about the future of crypto regulation . The challenge now lies in navigating the political complexities and focusing on creating a regulatory framework that is both robust and conducive to innovation. Ultimately, the unfolding situation with Trump crypto and the STABLE Act serves as a stark reminder of the intricate interplay between politics, finance, and technology in the digital age. The coming weeks will be critical in determining how these forces shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the broader digital economy.

But what happens when the very images we rely on for verification can no longer be trusted? OpenAI‚Äôs latest marvel, the ChatGPT 4o model, has unveiled a stunningly realistic AI image generator that‚Äôs raising eyebrows and sparking serious concerns. While designed to enhance creative possibilities, this powerful tool is proving to be exceptionally adept at creating incredibly convincing fake receipts . This development adds a potent new weapon to the arsenal of those seeking to exploit the digital realm, potentially ushering in a new era of sophisticated AI fraud and deepfakes . The Dawn of Realistic AI-Generated Receipts: How Good is ChatGPT 4o? This month marked the arrival of ChatGPT 4o, boasting a significantly improved AI image generator capable of embedding text within images with unprecedented realism. Social media quickly buzzed with demonstrations of its capabilities, but one particular application caught the attention of many: the generation of fake receipts . Deedy Das, a prominent VC and social media figure, showcased on X a fabricated receipt for a well-known San Francisco steakhouse, created entirely using ChatGPT 4o. His post highlighted a stark reality: ‚ÄúYou can use 4o to generate fake receipts. There are too many real world verification flows that rely on ‚Äòreal images‚Äô as proof. That era is over.‚Äù ChatGPT 4o can generate receipts now. You can use 4o to generate fake receipts. There are too many real world verification flows that rely on ‚Äúreal images‚Äù as proof. That era is over. pic.twitter.com/9FORS1PWsb ‚Äî Deedy (@deedydas) March 29, 2025 Others were quick to experiment, achieving similarly impressive results. Michael Gofman even refined the output, adding realistic food and drink stains to enhance the authenticity of his fake receipt , demonstrating the ease with which these AI-generated images can be manipulated to appear even more genuine. I think in the original image the letters are too perfect and they don‚Äôt bend with the paper. They look like hovering above the paper. Here is my attempt to make it more realistic. Let me know what you think. pic.twitter.com/EixRSHubeY ‚Äî Michael Gofman (@michaelgofman) March 29, 2025 Bitcoin World‚Äôs own investigation uncovered an even more convincing example originating from France, where a LinkedIn user showcased a crumpled, AI-generated receipt for a local restaurant chain. Intrigued, we put ChatGPT 4o to the test, successfully generating a fake receipt for an Applebee‚Äôs in San Francisco. However, our initial attempt wasn‚Äôt flawless. Subtle giveaways, such as the use of a comma instead of a period in the total and basic math errors, hinted at its artificial origin. While Large Language Models (LLMs) still grapple with arithmetic precision, these imperfections are easily rectified. A fraudster could swiftly correct these minor discrepancies using readily available photo editing software or by refining their prompts to the AI image generator . The Alarming Potential for AI Fraud: What are the Risks? The ease with which realistic fake receipts can now be generated presents significant opportunities for AI fraud . Imagine the implications: Expense Reimbursement Scams: Bad actors could effortlessly create fake receipts to claim reimbursements for fictitious expenses, targeting businesses and organizations. Insurance Fraud: Altered or entirely fabricated receipts could be used to inflate insurance claims, defrauding insurance companies. Tax Evasion: Fake receipts could be employed to create false records for tax deductions or to mask illicit transactions. E-commerce Scams: Fraudulent sellers could generate fake receipts to deceive buyers into believing items have been shipped or transactions completed. The potential for misuse is vast, and the implications for digital trust are profound. As verification processes increasingly rely on digital images, the ability to easily fabricate them undermines the integrity of these systems. OpenAI‚Äôs Response: Creative Freedom vs. Responsible AI Development In response to Bitcoin World‚Äôs inquiries, OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson stated that all images generated by ChatGPT include metadata indicating their AI origin. She added that OpenAI actively ‚Äútakes action‚Äù against users violating its usage policies and is committed to ‚Äúalways learning‚Äù from real-world applications and user feedback. When questioned about why ChatGPT permits the generation of fake receipts in the first place, particularly given OpenAI‚Äôs policies against fraud, Christianson explained that their ‚Äúgoal is to give users as much creative freedom as possible.‚Äù She suggested that AI-generated receipts could have legitimate, non-fraudulent applications, such as ‚Äúteaching people about financial literacy,‚Äù creating original art, and developing product advertisements. Navigating the Deepfake Era: Can We Still Trust Digital Images? The rise of sophisticated AI image generators like ChatGPT 4o forces us to confront a critical question: In a world where digital images can be so easily manipulated, can we still rely on them as proof? The ability to create convincing deepfakes , including fake receipts , challenges the very foundation of digital verification. While OpenAI emphasizes creative freedom and responsible use, the potential for malicious exploitation is undeniable. As technology advances, developing robust methods for detecting and mitigating AI fraud and deepfakes becomes increasingly crucial to maintaining trust in the digital age.

The network is struggling with dwindling demand and a shrinking user base, signaling deeper structural weaknesses. If the critical $130 support breaks, SOL could tumble toward $100‚Äîa psychological low last seen in broader market corrections. Meanwhile, Kaspa has surged 42% in March, making another run at the elusive $0.10 mark. But its trajectory depends on maintaining support and smashing through its long-standing resistance‚Äîstill a tough technical challenge. BlockDAG , however, isn‚Äôt playing the market‚Äôs short-term swings‚Äîit‚Äôs laying the foundation for sustained growth. Keynote 3 introduced the BlockDAG Academy, a structured learning hub catering to developers from beginners to advanced levels. This isn‚Äôt just for show‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategy to expand the ecosystem for years to come. Solana Price Forecast: Breaking Below $130 Could Trigger a Drop to $100 Solana‚Äôs rally has lost steam, with SOL currently trading at $131 after failing to crack the $146.5 resistance. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart, a rejection that typically signals a continuation of downward momentum. If selling pressure intensifies, SOL could revisit $110 or even plunge to the psychological $100 level. Adding to the bearish case, Solana‚Äôs network activity is fading, with daily active addresses and transaction volumes in decline. This dip in demand is affecting both DeFi participation and meme coin trading, worsening the negative sentiment. Indicators like the MACD and RSI are also cooling off, reinforcing the downside risk. On the short-term chart, SOL is attempting to hold the $130 support, but this bounce may be temporary. Short-sellers could use this opportunity to enter positions near the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels. With market sentiment still leaning toward ‚ÄòFear,‚Äô SOL‚Äôs next move could determine whether a $100 test is imminent. Kaspa‚Äôs 42% Surge in March: Can It Break $0.10? Kaspa (KAS) has climbed 42% from its March 11 low of $0.056, fueling speculation of a potential trend reversal. The coin is now facing resistance near $0.10, aligning with the descending wedge pattern and key Fibonacci retracement levels. A decisive breakout above $0.107 could confirm a shift into bullish territory, signaling the start of a sustained uptrend. Momentum indicators like the RSI have recovered from oversold conditions, strengthening the case for further gains. However, if Kaspa fails to break resistance, it could retrace toward the $0.0485 region. For now, traders are watching the $0.078‚Äì$0.080 support range closely. Kaspa‚Äôs ability to push past $0.10 will determine its next big move. If volume remains strong and the market structure holds, the breakout could unlock another wave of upward momentum. BlockDAG Goes Beyond Fundraising‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Creating the Future of Web3 What truly sets BlockDAG apart from other Layer 1 projects is its proactive approach. Keynote 3 introduced the BlockDAG Academy, a structured program designed to cultivate the next generation of developers, Web3 pioneers, and blockchain innovators. While many crypto projects rely on hype, BlockDAG is methodically building a self-sustaining ecosystem. By training developers at every level‚Äîbeginners to advanced smart contract engineers‚Äîit ensures more dApps, greater utility, and long-term value for the BDAG coin. With funding mechanisms such as grants and global hackathons, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just another blockchain‚Äîit‚Äôs shaping the future of Web3 development. This approach supports its ambitious $600M presale target by driving demand beyond speculation. BlockDAG‚Äôs numbers speak volumes: $209.5 million raised, 19 billion BDAG sold, and over 800K app users. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248, early adopters still have a limited window to join. The BlockDAG Academy isn‚Äôt just a side project‚Äîit‚Äôs a growth catalyst that‚Äôs already in motion. Final Thoughts Solana‚Äôs inability to clear key resistance levels, combined with declining user engagement, adds to its bearish outlook. Kaspa‚Äôs impressive 42% rally shows promise, but until it successfully breaks past major resistance, it remains a high-risk play. BlockDAG, on the other hand, isn‚Äôt relying on price speculation to fuel its rise. The BlockDAG Academy‚Äînow fully operational‚Äîintroduces an entirely new dimension to its roadmap: a direct pipeline for developer talent, dApp creation, and real-world adoption. With over 19 billion BDAG sold and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just attracting volume‚Äîit‚Äôs generating it. Unlike most projects that raise capital first and build later, BlockDAG is delivering hardware, software, and education before its mainnet even launches. The momentum is already in motion‚Äîand it‚Äôs only getting started.

A 15-day upward streak, RSI reclaiming 50, and a decisive break past $2.45 point to renewed bullish sentiment, with a potential push toward $3.25. This momentum is reinforced by real catalysts like Canary Capital‚Äôs ETF filing and the SUI Overflow Hackathon, keeping investor enthusiasm alive. Meanwhile, HBAR is showing strength, with a Double Bottom pattern and climbing open interest signaling a potential rally toward $0.504. On-chain data supports further gains, fueled by key developments such as the USD1 stablecoin launch and SWIFT integration trials. While both tokens show promise in the short term, BlockDAG is shaping something much larger. Announced during Keynote 3, its ambition to power 1,000+ dApps by 2026 isn‚Äôt just a vision‚Äîit‚Äôs a structured path toward mass adoption. With WASM + EVM compatibility, a $209.5M presale, and over 19 billion coins sold, BDAG is aligning strong fundamentals with developer-centric tools. SUI‚Äôs 15-Day Rally Hints at a Bullish Breakout in April SUI is staging a strong comeback after a steep 64% decline from its January peak of $5.37. Finding support at $2.30, the token has been steadily climbing for 15 days. This rally is backed by catalysts such as Canary Capital‚Äôs ETF filing and the SUI Overflow Hackathon, both of which have reignited investor confidence. Technical analysis backs the bullish case. The MACD has turned positive, and RSI has surpassed 50 for the first time since January‚Äôs drop. Additionally, SUI has broken past a descending trendline and cleared resistance at $2.45, with the next key level at $3.25‚Äîa critical Fibonacci retracement zone and a long-standing resistance point. Should SUI successfully breach $3.25, the next target sits at $3.65. With positive sentiment shaping the market, SUI appears ready for a strong move if overall conditions remain supportive. HBAR‚Äôs Breakout in Sight? Traders Eye a 144% Surge to $0.504 HBAR is gathering momentum, with analysts predicting a potential surge to $0.504‚Äîequivalent to a 144% rally from its current price. A Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart supports this outlook, with resistance at $0.1968 being the key hurdle. A successful break above this level could propel HBAR to $0.40, and with sustained momentum, even $0.962. Technical signals reinforce the bullish narrative. RSI is climbing toward 50, while MACD has triggered a bullish crossover. Additionally, open interest has jumped 5% within 24 hours, reaching $101.8 million, signaling growing trader optimism. On-chain metrics show increasing net purchases and rising trading volume, further strengthening the breakout case. Institutional backing, including Hedera‚Äôs USD1 stablecoin launch and SWIFT blockchain trial initiatives, adds credibility to HBAR‚Äôs long-term growth prospects. Investors are closely watching the $0.504 level as a decisive turning point. BlockDAG‚Äôs 1,000+ dApp Strategy Positions BDAG for Explosive Growth BlockDAG‚Äôs Keynote 3 revealed an ambitious target: supporting over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps) by 2026. This isn‚Äôt just a marketing claim‚Äîit represents a tangible plan to establish BlockDAG as a leading Layer 1 network. Its ecosystem aims to power DeFi projects, NFT platforms, real-world payment solutions, gaming applications, and even AI-driven systems. Equipped with EVM compatibility, WASM support, and user-friendly tools like the Token & NFT Wizard, BlockDAG is designed for seamless developer onboarding. This initiative is set to drive ecosystem engagement, fuel transaction volume, and significantly boost BDAG token utility. With a live Beta Testnet and more than 100 active nodes, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just outlining a vision‚Äîit‚Äôs already executing it. By Batch 27, its presale had soared past $209.5 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0248 and over 19 billion coins sold. As these 1,000+ dApps roll out, BlockDAG will evolve from a blockchain project into a thriving digital economy. The race to secure early positions is heating up. Final Thoughts SUI appears on track to surpass $3.25, while HBAR‚Äôs technical setup suggests a 144% rally could be on the horizon. However, both rely heavily on short-term trends and niche applications. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is laying the groundwork for a decentralized financial network. Its mission to host 1,000+ dApps isn‚Äôt just speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs an active strategy backed by innovative tools like the NFT Wizard, developer grants, and seamless WASM-EVM deployment. Add in a live Beta Testnet, a rapidly growing community, and upcoming listings on 10 centralized exchanges, and it‚Äôs clear BlockDAG is evolving beyond a simple Layer 1 solution‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a full-scale crypto economy.

Over the years, North Korea has been tied to high-profile cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, with stolen money believed to be used to finance the country‚Äôs military and nuclear‚ÄÇprograms. The United Nations estimated North Korea stole about $3 billion in crypto hacks from 2017 to 2023. However, in just 2024 and 2025 alone, they have already plundered a record $1.7 billion from two of the largest exchanges, WazirX and Bybit. Hackers use fake job offers to steal crypto, putting millions of users at risk There are several factions of North Korean hackers, each specializing in different kinds of cyberattacks. The most infamous one is the Lazarus Group, which has a history of targeting financial institutions and digital asset exchanges. Other groups, such as AppleJeus , Dangerous Password, and Spinout, use different methods (e.g., phishing attacks, fake job offers, malware masquerading as genuine software). The most shocking attack to date took place in February 2025, when crypto exchange Bybit was hacked for $1.5 billion ‚Äî the largest cryptocurrency hack to date. While it was first considered to be a phishing scheme, an in-depth investigation revealed that the exploit was based on a much more advanced strategy. The hackers, from North Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau, had stealthily compromised Safe{Wallet}, a digital wallet system used by many Bybit users, rather than launching an attack directly against the exchange. They infiltrated a backdoor into the software, letting them siphon cash without immediately being noticed. This method was far more sophisticated. Rather than targeting exchanges, it targeted the infrastructure supporting crypto exchanges. Once they steal the cryptocurrency, the hackers launder it and evade detection using off-the-shelf, well-established techniques. They first divide the loot into smaller amounts, pass them through hundreds of digital wallets, and eventually turn them into Bitcoin (BTC). This tactic makes it harder for authorities to trace the money. According to the security firm Chainalysis, Lazarus Group tends to hold stolen money for months, years, and even before spending it, maximizing its chances of avoiding detection. The FBI has identified three alleged members of the Lazarus Group and accused them of cybercrimes. In February 2021, the US Justice Department indicted two of those members for involvement in global cybercrimes. Yet, despite such efforts, North Korean hackers and cybercriminals have continued to adapt and find new methods for interfering with financial systems. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.215 swing high to the $2.023 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.1680. A clear move above the $2.1680 resistance might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance.
