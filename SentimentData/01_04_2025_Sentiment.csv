The price is currently hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band, indicating suppressed volatility and a consolidation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads around 38.56, suggesting that the asset is approaching oversold territory, though not quite there yet. The mid-Bollinger Band at approximately $0.03323 acts as dynamic resistance, which BRETT has struggled to breach. Without a decisive breakout above this level, upward momentum may remain limited. Unless volume or sentiment shifts significantly, the asset may continue range-bound movement or experience slight downside pressure. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart of BRETT/USDT, the market is exhibiting signs of consolidation with limited momentum. The price remains close to the lower Bollinger Band, which reflects a lack of strong buying pressure. The MACD is currently flat, with the signal and MACD lines nearly overlapping around the zero line, suggesting indecision and a neutral momentum outlook. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power indicator hovers around the zero mark, indicating an even tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Without a breakout above $0.03341 resistance, BRETT is likely to remain in a tight range or drift slightly lower amid weak market conviction.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis‚Äôs critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT‚Äôs near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

We are proud to partner with @EricTrump and American Data Centers to launch @AmericanBTC .

The initiative follows Hut 8‚Äôs contribution of most of its ASIC miners to American Data Centers, Inc., which has since been renamed American Bitcoin. The transition reflects Hut 8‚Äôs broader restructuring to streamline its Bitcoin mining operations. American Bitcoin Mining to Absorb Hut 8 Operations Under the new agreement, American Bitcoin will assume all Bitcoin mining activities previously handled under Hut 8‚Äôs Compute segment. Hut 8, however, will remain central to operations by serving as the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner. This partnership is expected to support long-term revenue growth for Hut 8‚Äôs Power and Digital Infrastructure segments. ‚ÄúBy combining Hut 8‚Äôs proven operational excellence in data centers with our shared passion for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, we are poised to strengthen our foundation and drive significant future growth,‚Äù said Eric Trump, co-founder of American Bitcoin. Donald Trump Jr. added that while holding Bitcoin has value, mining it under favorable conditions offers a stronger growth opportunity. Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot noted that creating American Bitcoin as a standalone entity allows the mining division to scale independently and attract investment. Meanwhile, Hut 8 can concentrate on its infrastructure services, creating a more predictable and financeable structure for both companies. Leadership and Operational Support The leadership team at American Bitcoin will include Mike Ho as Executive Chairman, Matt Prusak as CEO, and Eric Trump as Chief Strategy Officer. The Board of Directors will initially feature Mike Ho, Asher Genoot, Justin Mateen, and Michael Broukhim. As part of the agreement, Hut 8 will provide ASIC colocation and managed services to American Bitcoin, ensuring a smooth transition and continued operational excellence. ‚ÄúWhen the Trump family starts mining Bitcoin, you know the game has changed.

Frustrated with what it perceives as stonewalling, Coinbase has reactivated its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Let‚Äôs dive into why this legal battle is crucial for Coinbase, the crypto industry, and what it means for the future of crypto regulation . Why is Coinbase Reviving the FOIA Lawsuit? Coinbase initially filed this lawsuit to gain access to documents from the FDIC, believing these documents hold critical information relevant to the exchange‚Äôs operations and the broader regulatory landscape. The lawsuit was temporarily paused earlier this year when Travis Hill was appointed as Acting FDIC Chair, sparking hopes of a more cooperative approach. However, despite some initial improvements in communication, Coinbase feels that the FDIC is still not providing the level of FDIC Transparency required. According to a post by Eleanor Terrett, a former Fox Business reporter, on X (formerly Twitter), Coinbase alleges that key documents are still being withheld, hindering their ability to fully understand the FDIC‚Äôs stance and actions. The Core Issue: Information Access and Regulatory Clarity At the heart of this legal tussle is the fundamental principle of information access . Coinbase, like any regulated entity, needs clarity and access to information from regulatory bodies like the FDIC to operate effectively and compliantly. Here‚Äôs why this is so vital: Compliance and Risk Management: Understanding the FDIC‚Äôs internal communications and policies is crucial for Coinbase to ensure it is meeting all regulatory requirements and managing risks appropriately. Opaque regulatory processes make compliance a guessing game. Industry Precedent: This case sets a precedent for how regulatory bodies interact with the cryptocurrency industry. If Coinbase succeeds in compelling the FDIC to be more transparent, it could pave the way for greater openness across the board, benefiting the entire crypto sector. Investor Confidence: Transparency from regulators builds investor confidence. Knowing that regulatory processes are open and accountable can encourage more institutional and retail investors to participate in the crypto market. Paul Grewal‚Äôs Stance: Insufficient Transparency Remains Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has been vocal about the need for greater transparency. While acknowledging some improved cooperation under the new FDIC leadership, Grewal stated that transparency remains ‚Äúinsufficient.‚Äù This suggests that while the FDIC may have made some efforts to engage with Coinbase, they haven‚Äôt gone far enough to satisfy the exchange‚Äôs concerns regarding access to vital information access . This isn‚Äôt just about Coinbase; it‚Äôs about the broader relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and financial regulators. The demand for transparency highlights a crucial tension point: how can innovative, rapidly evolving sectors like crypto navigate regulatory landscapes that are often perceived as opaque and slow-moving? What are the Potential Outcomes and Implications? The court‚Äôs decision on Coinbase‚Äôs motion to resume the FOIA lawsuit will have significant ramifications: Outcome Implications Court grants Coinbase‚Äôs motion FDIC will be compelled to respond to the lawsuit, potentially leading to the release of requested documents. This would be a win for Coinbase and potentially for transparency in crypto regulation . Court denies Coinbase‚Äôs motion Coinbase‚Äôs efforts to gain information through legal means will be thwarted, at least in the short term. This could signal continued challenges for crypto firms seeking regulatory clarity via FOIA requests. The Role of the Financial Watchdog: FDIC Under Scrutiny The FDIC, as a key financial watchdog , plays a crucial role in maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs financial system. Its actions, or lack thereof, are closely watched by the financial industry, including the burgeoning crypto sector. This lawsuit puts the spotlight on the FDIC‚Äôs approach to transparency and its engagement with innovative financial technologies. Is the FDIC being overly cautious, or is Coinbase asking for too much? The answer likely lies somewhere in between. Regulators must balance the need for confidentiality and operational integrity with the legitimate demands of regulated entities for clarity and FDIC Transparency . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What can the crypto community learn from this ongoing legal battle? Transparency is Non-Negotiable: Coinbase‚Äôs persistence underscores the importance of demanding transparency from regulatory bodies. It‚Äôs not just about individual company interests but about building a mature and trustworthy crypto ecosystem. Legal Avenues are Important: While dialogue and cooperation are ideal, legal avenues like FOIA can be vital tools to ensure accountability and access to information when necessary. Stay Informed and Engaged: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and engage in constructive dialogue with policymakers and regulators to shape a more transparent and supportive regulatory environment for crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Fight for Transparency Continues Coinbase‚Äôs decision to restart its FOIA lawsuit against the FDIC is a clear signal that the fight for regulatory transparency in the crypto space is far from over. This case is not just about documents and legal procedures; it‚Äôs about fostering a more open, accountable, and ultimately, healthier relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and its regulators. As the FDIC prepares its response, the crypto world watches closely, hoping this renewed legal push will finally unlock the doors to greater information access and clarity.

If you‚Äôre deeply invested in the crypto world, you understand the importance of timely information. Imagine getting only the most crucial alerts without sifting through endless notifications. That‚Äôs precisely what Apple is delivering with its latest update. Apple Intelligence, the tech giant‚Äôs powerful suite of AI tools, is expanding its reach and introducing a game-changing feature: Priority Notifications. This update, rolling out with iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, not only brings AI to more users in the EU but also refines how you manage your digital life. Let‚Äôs dive into what these updates mean for you and how they are set to redefine your Apple experience. What are Apple‚Äôs Revolutionary Priority Notifications? Tired of notification overload? We all are! In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, our devices are constantly buzzing with alerts, many of which are simply noise. Apple‚Äôs new Priority Notifications feature, powered by Apple Intelligence, is designed to cut through the clutter. It intelligently analyzes your notifications and highlights those deemed most urgent and time-sensitive. Think of it as your personal AI assistant for notifications, ensuring you never miss what truly matters. Here‚Äôs what makes Priority Notifications a potential game-changer: AI-Driven Filtering: Apple Intelligence algorithms learn your notification patterns to identify critical alerts. Enhanced Visibility: Important notifications are prominently displayed at the top of your notification stack in a new, distinct format, making them instantly noticeable. Reduced Digital Clutter: By prioritizing essential notifications, you can focus on what needs your immediate attention, minimizing distractions from less important updates. Improved Efficiency: Spend less time sifting through notifications and more time responding to what truly matters, whether it‚Äôs a critical crypto market alert or an urgent personal message. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who rely on their Apple devices for time-sensitive information and want to streamline their notification experience. For crypto enthusiasts, this could mean getting instant alerts about significant market movements or important wallet updates, right when they matter most. Expanding Horizons: Apple Intelligence Arrives in the EU with iOS 18.4 The wait is over for Apple users in the European Union! Apple Intelligence , initially unveiled at last year‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference, is now making its way to iPhones and iPads across the EU with the iOS 18.4 update. This expansion is a significant step, bringing a suite of AI-powered features to a wider audience. Previously, Apple cited EU tech regulations, such as the Digital Markets Act, as a reason for the delayed rollout, originally slated for April 2025. However, Apple has managed to overcome these hurdles, delivering AI Features to EU users much sooner than anticipated. This move underscores Apple‚Äôs commitment to making its advanced AI capabilities globally accessible, despite regulatory complexities. EU users can now experience features like: Writing Tools: AI-powered assistance for writing and refining text across various apps. Image Playground: An app for generating fun and creative images using AI. Genmoji: Create personalized emojis using generative AI. Furthermore, Apple Intelligence is also extending its reach to Vision Pro users in U.S. English, bringing these powerful AI tools to Apple‚Äôs mixed reality platform. This means Vision Pro users can now leverage Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and more within their immersive experiences. Beyond Notifications: Other Exciting AI Features in iOS 18.4 The iOS 18.4 update is more than just Priority Notifications and EU expansion; it‚Äôs packed with other exciting AI Features designed to enhance your Apple experience. Let‚Äôs explore some of the notable additions: Memory Movies on Mac: Now you can create personalized ‚Äúmemory movies‚Äù on your Mac simply by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will automatically curate photos and videos based on your text input, generating a shareable movie. Sketch Style in Image Playground: Apple‚Äôs AI image generation app, Image Playground, gets a new ‚ÄúSketch‚Äù style. This allows you to create academic and detailed sketches, adding a new artistic dimension to your AI-generated images. Language Expansion: Apple Intelligence is now available in more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (Simplified). Localized English support has also been added for Singapore and India, making AI features more accessible to a global audience. Apple News+ Food: The recently announced recipe companion, Apple News+ Food, is also launching with this update, providing a new culinary resource within Apple News+. Revamped Apple Photos App: Expect further tweaks and improvements to the Apple Photos app, enhancing your photo management and editing experience. These updates demonstrate Apple‚Äôs ongoing commitment to refining and expanding its AI ecosystem, delivering tangible benefits to users across various aspects of their digital lives. Why is Apple Intelligence Rollout Gradual? You might be wondering why Apple is rolling out Apple Intelligence features in phases rather than all at once. The truth is, developing and deploying sophisticated AI features at scale is a complex undertaking. Apple‚Äôs approach reflects a commitment to quality and a measured introduction of new technologies. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the likely reasons for this gradual rollout: Reason Explanation Technological Complexity Generative AI and related features are cutting-edge technologies. Ensuring stability, accuracy, and user-friendliness requires rigorous testing and phased deployment. Infrastructure Scaling Supporting AI features for millions of users globally demands significant infrastructure. Gradual rollout allows Apple to scale its server capacity and optimize performance without overwhelming its systems. Feature Refinement By releasing features incrementally, Apple can gather user feedback and iterate on its AI models and functionalities. This iterative process helps improve the quality and relevance of AI features over time. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations, especially in regions like the EU with stringent data privacy laws, requires careful planning and phased implementation to ensure compliance and address any legal concerns. Apple‚Äôs deliberate approach ensures a smoother user experience and allows for continuous improvement of its AI offerings. While some users might prefer immediate access to all features, this phased rollout ultimately leads to a more robust and refined AI ecosystem. Embrace the Future of AI with iOS 18.4 The latest iOS 18.4 update marks a significant step forward in Apple‚Äôs AI journey. With the introduction of Priority Notifications and the expansion of Apple Intelligence to the EU, Apple is empowering users with smarter, more intuitive, and more efficient digital experiences. These updates are not just about adding features; they are about fundamentally changing how we interact with our devices, making technology work more seamlessly for us. As Apple continues to refine and expand its AI capabilities, we can expect even more groundbreaking innovations in the future.

Notably, the struggles have spared tech stocks, which continue to surge despite macro factors. According to Reuters , data provided by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that property prices, investments, and sales have resumed their downward trend following a brief period of stability. China‚Äôs government has actively intervened in the property market Property prices in China have been on a steady decline since 2021 after a government crackdown on developers caused a liquidity crisis, abandoned projects and wary buyers. Not much has changed since then, despite recent government intervention. The government has been active in trying to stabilize the property market, including it in its 2025 agenda. The government efforts seem to have paid off for about two months as the prices were relatively steady. However, recent data from the Chinese Real Estate Information Corp shows that the market has lost these small gains as new home sales have dipped. While the government is working to normalize house prices, there‚Äôs also the issue of price controls that are usually imposed by local governments. These dips are not only attributed to government actions, as demographic shifts, low demands causing a glut of unsold homes, and low disposable income due to stagnant incomes come into play. While analysts believe that government efforts will cause a positive change in the trends, other factors threaten that change from happening soon. U.S. tariffs add pressure To add to its economic woes, the U.S. introduced a 25% levy on Chinese auto imports, among other tariffs, piling more pressure on China. China has also retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on goods from the United States, further straining bilateral trade relations between the two nations. The Trump administration is expected to roll out its own retaliatory tariffs on April 2, adding more pressure to the Chinese economy. These have raised concerns about the impact of the tariffs on Chinese consumer behavior and its manufacturing sector. China‚Äôs tech surge fails to revive broader markets On the flip side, Chinese tech stocks have been on a trend Deepseek started earlier in the year. Despite the ongoing success of these Chinese tech stocks, it has had little or no growing effect on emerging markets. This is a divergence from the normal trend where the growth in Chinese stocks has a growing effect on the stocks of other emerging markets, which have remained relatively stagnant. The current rallying effect of the Chinese stock market isn‚Äôt felt in the entire Chinese market and its impact hasn‚Äôt really improved the economy, with analysts attributing its rise to the current frenzy surrounding tech, especially artificial intelligence. According to analysts from UBS Group AG in London, the current tech boom isn‚Äôt the same as the typical Chinese boom that occurred in 2009, 2016, and 2020 and impacted emerging markets. It‚Äôs reported that since August 2024, the MSCI China Index has risen by over 30%, while the same cannot be said for emerging markets, which have fallen by 7% since then. Historically, strong growth in Chinese stocks has had a growth effect on other emerging markets. A historical example will be between 2009 and 2010, where a 63% rise in Chinese shares saw a 100% rise in emerging market shares. A similar trend is seen between 2016 and 2017, where Chinese stocks rose by 50% and the emerging markets broad gauge rose by 46%. Prior to the tech-induced boost caused by the launch of the AI model Deepseek, Chinese stocks last saw a slight surge in September 2024, thanks to the Chinese government‚Äôs overall economic stimulus. According to investment analysts, China‚Äôs new trend of outperforming its emerging markets may last longer than expected or desired. They also expressed concerns over the effects U.S. tariffs have on the Chinese stock market. Uncertain outlook for China‚Äôs economy While there are concerns about the impact of these tariffs on consumer behavior in various sectors, such as housing, investors outside of China are also taking a hint, and it could potentially affect the growth of the Chinese stock market negatively and mean more losses for emerging markets. Insights shared by Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, point out that some funds are expressing little confidence in Chinese stocks making a quick comeback and are already doing away with their Chinese holdings. While local experts point out that the Chinese market will experience some form of growth aided by government intervention, they also indicate that the growth curve won‚Äôt be steep. How these predictions play out is left to be seen as the available data looks bleak currently, given the U.S. tariffs and more impending tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

If you were eagerly anticipating the full potential of Alexa+, Amazon‚Äôs premium AI assistant, you might need to temper your excitement. While Amazon has launched Alexa+, reports are surfacing that many of the hyped, game-changing Alexa Plus Features are nowhere to be found, at least not yet. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs going on with this much-anticipated upgrade and why the rollout is hitting some unexpected snags. What‚Äôs the Buzz About Alexa Plus Features? Amazon promised a revolutionary upgrade with Alexa+, showcasing impressive capabilities at a recent press event. We were teased with glimpses of an AI assistant that could truly understand and anticipate our needs, performing what are termed ‚Äúagentic AI tasks.‚Äù Think seamless interactions like: Ordering your favorite takeout from Grubhub with just a voice command. Generating imaginative stories to keep kids entertained for hours. Recognizing household members and prompting them about their chores. Brainstorming the perfect gift ideas for any occasion. Even ordering an Uber and getting personalized cooking recommendations. These Amazon AI Assistant functionalities painted a picture of a truly intelligent and helpful home companion, far beyond the basic Alexa we know. The anticipation was palpable, especially for those invested in creating a fully integrated smart home ecosystem. The Disappointing Reality: Delayed Alexa Features However, the initial launch of Alexa+ tells a different story. According to reports, many of these showcased Alexa Plus Features are conspicuously absent. Users who upgraded expecting a fully realized AI assistant are finding themselves with a service that feels‚Ä¶incomplete. Key functionalities like Grubhub ordering, story generation, visual person identification for chore reminders, and gift idea brainstorming are simply not available yet. It‚Äôs like ordering a fully loaded car and finding out it‚Äôs missing the navigation system and sunroof. Furthermore, some features, such as Uber ordering and cooking recommendations, are only available to a select group of users, making the rollout feel fragmented and inconsistent. The promised web app for Alexa+, which was announced with fanfare just last month, also lacks a firm release date, adding to the uncertainty. Why Are Key Smart Home AI Features Delayed? The culprit behind these Delayed Alexa Features seems to be the complex AI infrastructure underpinning Alexa+. Reports suggest that the development process has been plagued with challenges from the outset. Building an AI capable of handling the sophisticated ‚Äúagentic‚Äù tasks Amazon envisions is no small feat. It requires robust and reliable systems that can handle natural language processing, contextual understanding, and seamless integration with various services. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the potential challenges: AI Infrastructure Complexity: Developing the AI models and systems to power these advanced features is inherently complex and time-consuming.

Scalability Issues: Rolling out these features to millions of users requires a scalable infrastructure that can handle the increased demand and data processing. What Does This Mean for Smart Home Enthusiasts? For those invested in Smart Home AI and eagerly awaiting the next leap in voice assistant technology, this delay is undoubtedly disappointing. It highlights the gap between marketing hype and the realities of developing cutting-edge AI. While Alexa+ still holds promise, the initial rollout serves as a reminder that revolutionary technology often comes with unforeseen challenges and delays. However, it‚Äôs important to remember that this is just the beginning. Amazon has committed to delivering these advanced features, and the current situation appears to be a temporary setback rather than a complete derailment. As AI technology continues to evolve rapidly, we can expect to see these capabilities gradually rolled out in the coming months. Actionable Insights: Managing Expectations and Future Outlook Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights as we navigate this evolving landscape: Manage Expectations: Don‚Äôt expect all promised Alexa+ features to be available immediately. Temper your expectations and anticipate a phased rollout. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on tech news and official Amazon announcements for updates on feature releases and timelines. Provide Feedback: If you are an early Alexa+ adopter, provide feedback to Amazon about your experience and feature requests. This can help shape future development. Patience is Key: Developing advanced AI is a marathon, not a sprint. Patience will be crucial as these sophisticated features are refined and rolled out. Conclusion: The Future of Alexa+ and Smart Home AI Remains Bright While the initial launch of Alexa+ may not have delivered all the promised bells and whistles, the underlying potential of Amazon AI Assistant and the future of Smart Home AI remains incredibly exciting.

Analyst Reveals His Buy Zone Strategy",https://cryptonews.com/news/eth-drops-near-1500-eyes-1200-support-zone/,"ETH fell by 1.1% in the past 24 hours, sliding to just above $1,800 as analysts suggested the recent rally may have been a dead-cat bounce. Among the top five cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has posted the steepest losses in 2025, down 45.4% year-to-date. The network‚Äôs struggle to remain competitive has pressured the price of its native asset, with rival smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) offering lower fees and faster execution speeds. ETH Nears Critical $1,500 Support After Major Downtrend Crypto trader Big Cheds, who has more than 300,000 followers on X, pointed to the $1,200 level as a critical support and potential buy zone for ETH if the current downtrend continues. $ETH now $1840 from $3400 below. Prob worth a sniff when it tags $1200-$1300 range https://t.co/NARqJWgxS6 pic.twitter.com/w076n9xLIe ‚Äî Cheds Trading (@BigCheds) March 30, 2025 He noted that a bounce from this level could lead to a mid-term rally toward the $3,400 range, translating to a 283% gain. Looking at the weekly chart, ETH has been in a prolonged downtrend since it failed to break above $4,000 for the third time. This triple top pattern reflected investor hesitation in pushing valuations higher amid an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Despite these challenges, some technical levels have held firm. The $1,500 support zone has previously acted as a launching point for strong recoveries. ETH rebounded by 41% and 149% the last two times it touched this level, with each move resulting in a higher high. If a similar reaction occurs again, the price could target the $5,000 mark, which would represent a 221% increase. Can ETH Bounce Back or Is $1,200 the Next Stop? Whether ETH will hold its footing at $1,500 or continue slipping remains to be seen. A sustained drop below that level could send the price toward $1,200, and potentially as low as $900, implying a total downside risk of around 42% from current levels. Traders and long-term holders alike will be watching closely to see how ETH reacts to this zone. A strong bounce could reignite interest, while a bearish breakdown might confirm further downside in the short term. Once cryptos regain their strength and the bullish cycle resumes, storing these digital assets safely will be a key priority to investors.

The AI world is buzzing with a potentially seismic shift. OpenAI, the company behind the groundbreaking GPT models, has hinted at releasing a new ‚Äúopen‚Äù language model. Yes, you read that right ‚Äì ‚Äúopen‚Äù! This news is electrifying for those in the crypto space who understand the power of decentralization and open access. Could this be a game-changer for how generative AI is developed and utilized? Let‚Äôs dive into what this announcement means and why it‚Äôs creating waves. Why is an OpenAI Open Language Model a Big Deal? For years, OpenAI has been known for its cutting-edge, yet largely closed-source, AI models. Think of models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 ‚Äì incredibly powerful, but access is controlled and the underlying code isn‚Äôt freely available. This contrasts sharply with the ethos of the crypto world, which champions transparency and open-source development. However, it seems the winds are changing. OpenAI is signaling a move towards a more open approach, reminiscent of their earlier days with GPT-2 . But why now? Let‚Äôs break it down: Competitive Pressure: Companies like DeepSeek and Meta (with their Llama models) have gained significant traction by adopting an open source AI strategy. Meta‚Äôs Llama models, for instance, have seen over a billion downloads! This success likely hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed by OpenAI. Community Demand: The AI research and development community has been vocal about the need for more open and accessible AI models . OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form directly addresses this, asking developers and researchers what they want to see in an open model.

This suggests it won‚Äôt be a basic model but will possess a degree of sophistication. Preparedness Framework: OpenAI emphasizes that this model, like all others, will undergo rigorous evaluation before release. However, they acknowledge the unique nature of an open-source model, anticipating modifications and adaptations post-release. Focus on Utility: OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form and statements highlight a desire to make this model as ‚Äúuseful as possible‚Äù for developers, researchers, and even large organizations. They envision scenarios where companies and governments might prefer to run models themselves, rather than relying solely on API access. The Benefits of Open Source AI: A Crypto Perspective For the crypto community, the move towards open source AI resonates deeply. Here‚Äôs why: Benefit Explanation Transparency & Trust Open source code allows for public scrutiny, fostering greater trust and transparency in AI development. This aligns with the core principles of blockchain technology. Innovation & Collaboration Open models encourage wider experimentation and collaboration. Just as open-source blockchain projects have thrived, open AI can spur rapid innovation through community contributions. Decentralization Potential Open source AI can contribute to a more decentralized AI landscape, reducing the concentration of power in a few large tech companies. This mirrors the crypto vision of decentralizing control. Accessibility & Democratization Open models lower the barrier to entry for AI development, making powerful tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers globally. Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of an OpenAI open language model is exciting, there are challenges to consider: Responsible Use: Open models can be used for malicious purposes. OpenAI will need to carefully consider safety and ethical implications, especially given the potential for modification post-release. Resource Intensity: Developing and maintaining powerful open models requires significant resources. OpenAI needs a sustainable strategy for this endeavor. Balancing Openness with Business Interests: OpenAI is a for-profit company. Finding the right balance between open sourcing and protecting their competitive advantage will be crucial. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you‚Äôre a crypto developer, investor, or simply an AI enthusiast, here‚Äôs how you can engage with this development: Participate in OpenAI‚Äôs Feedback Process: If you have ideas or insights on what you‚Äôd like to see in an open model, fill out OpenAI‚Äôs feedback form.

The analyst, reviewing the 4-hour candlestick chart, pointed to extremely oversold RSI levels as a basis for this outlook. Although a bounce appears to be the more probable outcome, there is still a 30 to 40% chance of a short-term drop into deeper support territory. Dogecoin RSI Dips Below 10 On 4-Hour Chart To Possibly Extend Decline The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical analysis indicator used to measure an asset‚Äôs momentum. When above 70, the asset is considered overbought, meaning it might be due for a price correction or pullback. On the other hand, readings below 30 are considered oversold, meaning that the asset might be undervalued and could bounce upward soon. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Turns Bullish With 1-Day RSI In Oversold Region, Why DOGE Can Reach $0.9 In the case of Dogecoin, the meme coin has been under intense selling pressure since the beginning of March. This selling pressure has seen it lose most of its price gains in late 2024 and break below notable support pressure. This, in turn, has seen the RSI fall towards the oversold levels across multiple timeframes. According to the technical overview, the Relative Strength Index on the 1-hour timeframe is between 25 and 27, signaling strong oversold conditions. On the 4-hour chart, the RSI has dropped even lower, falling beneath 10, which typically indicates an asset is due for a corrective bounce. The daily RSI is currently hovering around 32 to 33, still above the oversold zone but trending downward. These readings suggest that while bearish pressure is present, the setup of a bounce from oversold levels increasingly favors a rebound as buyers look to re-enter near support. Analyst Sees Bounce Toward $0.172‚Äì$0.175 As More Probable Outcome According to the analyst, the break of the RSI below the oversold levels points to a decline toward the $0.1580 and $0.1590 support region. Despite the possibility of a decline toward the $0.1580 to $0.1590 support region, the analyst noted a higher probability (around 60 to 70%) of a near-term bounce after hitting this support region, possibly targeting the $0.172 to $0.175 range. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Stages Bounce From Lower Border Of Second Falling Wedge, New Targets Unlocked? The projection hinges on Dogecoin‚Äôs possible reaction to such a deeply oversold RSI level. The analyst emphasized that this is an assumption rather than financial advice, but the technical context supports the likelihood of a relief rally if the support holds. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1649, down by 3.6% in the past 24 hours. With both downside and upside scenarios laid out, short-term Dogecoin price action now depends on how the market reacts at the current $0.165 level. A move toward $0.172 or higher could unfold quickly if buyers step in right now. However, if selling continues, Dogecoin might continue its decline throughout the week before attempting a recovery.

The crypto market never sleeps, and right now, Qubetics ($TICS), Bittensor (TAO), and Tron (TRX) are making headlines with major developments. Bittensor is transforming artificial intelligence by decentralizing machine learning models, while Tron is pushing deeper into decentralized applications and Web3 infrastructure. Both projects are gaining momentum, making them key contenders in the market. But Qubetics is the one stealing the spotlight. As the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, it‚Äôs solving one of crypto‚Äôs biggest problems‚Äîbridging fragmented blockchain ecosystems. More importantly, its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace is unlocking new ways for people and businesses to trade real-world assets on-chain. With its presale already surpassing millions, Qubetics is gaining serious traction, making it one of the top cryptos to invest in today . Qubetics: The Future of Real-World Asset Tokenization The world is filled with valuable assets‚Äîreal estate, commodities, fine art, and intellectual property‚Äîyet most remain inaccessible to everyday people due to high entry barriers and liquidity issues. Qubetics is changing that through Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which converts these physical assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold, or used as collateral on the blockchain. A real estate owner, for example, can tokenize a luxury apartment, allowing people across the globe to own fractional shares. No need for hefty down payments or complex legal paperwork‚Äîjust direct access to real estate ownership through blockchain technology. The same applies to high-value assets like gold, oil, patents, and even rare collectibles, making Qubetics a game-changer in asset digitization. Qubetics is also a Web3 aggregator, meaning it unifies multiple blockchains, eliminating the headache of cross-chain compatibility. Whether someone holds Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche assets, Qubetics allows seamless transactions across chains. For businesses, this means borderless commerce without limitations. With regulatory discussions heating up around RWA tokenization, analysts predict Qubetics is at the forefront of a trillion-dollar industry. This makes it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. Qubetics Presale: A Rare Opportunity The Qubetics presale is making waves for all the right reasons. Unlike many projects that drag on for months, Qubetics has a strict 7-day stage system, with each stage ending every Sunday at 12 AM. At the close of every stage, the price automatically increases by 10%, rewarding early buyers. Currently in its 28th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.1430, with over 504 million tokens sold and a presale tally surpassing $15.5 million. More than 23,900 token holders have already secured their share, making Qubetics one of the best crypto presales right now.To put this into perspective, a $2,500 purchase at the current price secures around 17,475 $TICS tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1 post-presale, that‚Äôs $17,475 in value. With mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, the Qubetics presale is shaping up to be a limited-time opportunity before the next price jump. No wonder it‚Äôs on the radar as one of the top cryptos to invest in today.

Per a report from the Russian newspaper Kommersant , the ban would apply only in the southern part of the Siberian oblast of Irkutsk, but could run until mid-2031. Irkutsk Mining Ban Incoming? Miners in southern Irkutsk have already been ordered to shut down their rigs in the winter months until 2031. Inside a crypto mining data center in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: GetBailkal/YouTube/Screenshot) But many miners have remained in the area on the understanding that they can operate unimpeded in warmer months. However, top officials warned earlier this year that the existing ban was not doing enough to ease pressure on local power grids. Kommersant, a media outlet known to enjoy good relations with the Kremlin, said its sources had revealed the Russian government ‚Äúmay impose a total ban on mining in the southern part of the Irkutsk region as early as April 1.‚Äù As Russia‚Äôs first BTC mining hub, southern Irkutsk is home to several large mining centers, which collectively consume around 650 MW of power. A total ban would be highly problematic to these centers, industry insiders told the newspaper. They added that ‚Äúin the event of a ban,‚Äù they would be powerless to act ‚Äúdue to difficulties connecting to networks in other regions.‚Äù Many nearby regions have also imposed wintertime crypto mining bans, a fact that could leave miners with no choice other than to relocate.

(Source: AIST TV/YouTube/Screenshot) The media outlet noted that neither the Ministry of Energy nor the offices of the Governor of the Irkutsk Oblast responded to its request for official comment. However, the outlet reported that President Vladimir Putin had replied that he had agreed to ‚Äúconsider and support‚Äù Kobzev‚Äôs request ‚Äúin the interests of the region.‚Äù The newspaper claimed its (anonymous) sources said the matter was discussed at a government-led power industry summit in Moscow on March 27. ‚ÄúBased on the results of the meeting, [the government] will likely decide to grant the [governor‚Äôs request],‚Äù Kommersant‚Äôs ‚Äúsources‚Äù claimed.

(Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) North of Region to Escape Ban? Kobzev has previously claimed that his plans would leave industrial miners in the north of the oblast free to continue with their work. But Kobzev has claimed that power shortages in southern Irkutsk are now becoming critical. He stated that ‚Äúover the past five years,‚Äù energy consumption in the Irkutsk region has ‚Äúgrown by 28%‚Äù The governor blamed mining for contributing to an energy deficit in the region. He said that the deficit could grow to 2.9 GW by 2030 if no action were taken. The entirety of Siberia has become a hub for Russian crypto miners due to its low electricity prices and famously long and cold winters. Officials think that total mining load in the region now stands at 1.066 GW, with miners in the north using 419 MW and southern miners using 647 MW. Legal, industrial miners account for the vast majority (84%) of the energy usage. Kobzev said that mining firms have already obtained permission to bring another 1.272 GW of capacity online in the area.

Kobzev also claimed that small-scale, quasi-legal crypto miners are also causing a drain on the local grid. He stated that ‚Äúcommercial consumers operating at low voltages‚Äù were using over 160 MW of power per month.

The media outlet wrote that commercial and industrial consumers typically pay prices of around 5 rubles ($0.059) per kWh.

On Sunday, Musk said he believed his role in DOGE was affecting Tesla‚Äôs share price. He spoke about the matter during a town hall event in Wisconsin, where he has been campaigning in the state‚Äôs supreme court election.¬†According to Musk, those who oppose his efforts to slash government jobs under President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration have tried to pressure him by going after Tesla. Musk speaking at a Town Hall event in Wisconsin. Source: Fox 9 ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ‚Ä¶ stop doing this,‚Äù Musk said, referring to his work with the Trump White House. ‚ÄúMy Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it‚Äôs a big deal.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs share price was already down 35.83% for the year before Monday‚Äôs market opening, which means that the stock has nearly been cut in half compared to its peak in December. Shares slid another 1.7% on Monday. Despite this downturn, Musk offered some hope for shareholders, calling the price drop a possible ‚Äúbuying opportunity‚Äù for people who believe in the company‚Äôs long-term prospects. Tesla stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Musk was in Wisconsin to support a conservative candidate in a closely watched supreme court election. He has contributed more than $12 million on the campaign, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at a rally on Sunday for signing a petition against what he described as ‚Äúactivist judges.‚Äù Though Musk‚Äôs political influence has come into the spotlight recently, signs of trouble at Tesla had already begun to appear. The electric car maker‚Äôs vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary figures suggest sales continue to slump this year in key markets like Europe. Other car manufacturers in the U.S. have also stumbled amid warnings about rising tariffs on imported goods. Potential trade conflicts could disrupt a tightly woven network of parts suppliers spread across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, causing more problems for an industry still recovering from past supply chain challenges. Tesla‚Äôs troubles, then, may be part of a broader challenge facing American automakers. Yet many see the Tesla case as unique because of Musk‚Äôs sudden shift into high-profile politics. Since the Trump administration began in January, Musk has become a familiar face around the White House. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024, regularly offers opinions on political matters through his social media company X, and now holds a top seat in DOGE. For critics, this raises concerns about where Musk‚Äôs focus lies: on running an electric vehicle firm or serving as a powerful government insider. Protestors swarmed Tesla‚Äôs showrooms on the weekend Protests escalated on Saturday as anti-Musk activists swarmed Tesla showrooms and service centers. They called it the ‚ÄúTesla Takedown.‚Äù According to the protestors, the goal was to oppose Musk‚Äôs political activities and his efforts to slash government spending under Trump. Musk has already gained access to the highly sensitive information of federal employees. Consequently, more than 277 Tesla locations across the country saw some form of demonstration, though the size of the crowd varied by city. In states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York, turnouts ranged from a few dozen to several hundred. People held signs reading, ‚ÄúHonk if you hate Elon‚Äù and ‚ÄúFight the billionaire broligarchy.‚Äù In Texas, Musk‚Äôs home state, and in Minnesota, Maryland, and other parts of the country, similar protests took place. Social media images showed picketers standing in front of Tesla showrooms, chanting slogans and waving banners. A protestor outside a Tesla store in Texas. Source: CBS Texas A small but visible group of counterprotesters also gathered at some locations, voicing support for President Trump and, by extension, Musk. In Dublin, California, across from a showroom where dozens of activists chanted, a few Trump supporters waved American flags. A bigger protest was observed near Berkeley, where participants claimed that Musk‚Äôs ties to the administration were pushing the country in a dangerous direction. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living in a fascist state,‚Äù said a retired high school teacher at the Berkeley demonstration. ‚ÄúWe need to stop this or we‚Äôll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.‚Äù Protesters should up with various signs calling Elon a ‚ÄúFascist.‚Äù Source: ABC News Outside the U.S., anti-Musk sentiment is also growing. Protesters gathered at more than 230 Tesla sites worldwide, including in European cities like London. Though the crowds there were smaller, the messages were similar. Signs compared Musk to Adolf Hitler and accused him of using a straight-arm salute after Trump‚Äôs inauguration. The protest in London drew a handful of Americans living abroad who felt compelled to speak out. One participant in London held a sign labeling Tesla cars as ‚ÄúSwasticars,‚Äù a jarring reference to Nazi Germany. ‚ÄúWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we‚Äôre facing,‚Äù said one of the protesters, describing Musk‚Äôs alliance with the Trump White House as a risk for democracy. The Tesla Takedown movement was organized by a coalition that includes people who once owned Tesla vehicles, public figures like actor John Cusack, and some Democratic lawmakers. Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas said on a recent organizing call that she would keep ‚Äúscreaming in the halls of Congress‚Äù to highlight Musk‚Äôs actions. On Saturday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal appeared at a protest in Seattle, describing Musk‚Äôs role in DOGE as a ‚Äúdangerous mixing of corporate power and government access.‚Äù A mother showed up to my recent town hall, crying because she was worried about being able to access health care for her new baby.

Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) March 31, 2025 Some individuals have reportedly set Tesla vehicles on fire, an act that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has condemned as domestic terrorism. Musk, for his part, has labeled those committing these crimes as ‚Äúpsychos‚Äù and asked them to stop. Authorities in Germany are investigating a blaze that destroyed seven Tesla cars early Saturday, though it was unclear if it was connected to the broader protests. In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police said a black pickup side mirror struck two people at a demonstration outside a Tesla service center. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries, and officials quickly identified the suspect. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Investor demand is skyrocketing, with Phase 6 of its presale already 90% sold out . XRP Stuck at $2.13 After Legal Clarity Ripple Labs‚Äô SEC settlement on March 25, 2025, initially sparked optimism, but XRP has struggled to maintain bullish momentum.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: $4.5M Raised as Investors Rush In Amid Ripple‚Äôs subdued market performance, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a compelling alternative for crypto investors seeking significant returns. MAGACOIN has already raised over $4,500,000 from enthusiastic investors during its ongoing presale. Investor demand has been exceptional, with Phase 6 now 90% sold out . Market experts attribute MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs explosive popularity to its well-structured tokenomics, ambitious growth strategy, and the potential for substantial returns‚Äîpredicting the token will comfortably reach $1 by 2025. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs $1 Milestone Matters Achieving the $1 milestone would firmly establish MAGACOIN FINANCE as a major cryptocurrency player, validating the project‚Äôs fundamentals and sparking further investor enthusiasm. Analysts predict that crossing the $1 threshold could trigger a wave of increased market demand, driving the price even higher. Given XRP‚Äôs limited upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs clear path to rapid growth presents investors with a compelling alternative. Its presale success‚Äîraising over $4.5 million already‚Äîis proof of robust market confidence. Ripple (XRP) vs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Investor Demand Speaks Volumes The stark contrast between XRP‚Äôs stagnant price action and MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs surging presale illustrates where investor confidence is shifting. XRP‚Äôs uncertain market outlook, compounded by its inability to rally significantly post-settlement, contrasts sharply with the bullish sentiment surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE.

It looks like [$0.11] is going to come and test lower. [DOGE has] a really strong descending supply trend.‚Äù Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.166. Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the crypto strategist believes that the native asset of the top smart contract protocol is headed toward its high time frame support at around $1,000. ‚ÄúETH now $1,840 from $3,400 below. Probably worth a sniff when it tags the $1,200-$1,300 range.‚Äù Source: Cheds/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $1,808. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , Cheds says that bulls have the upper hand as long as the coin is trading above $2. But he also says that holders should consider paring back risk if XRP moves below the key price level. At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.12.

Shiba Inu‚Äôs significant token burn and Layer-2 developments, along with Chainlink‚Äôs goal of reaching $20, showcase strong market narratives‚Äîyet, they focus primarily on market sentiment and trading movements. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) moves its focus from market speculation to operational efficiency. The Beta Testnet is not about market predictions but about proving functionality. With more than 15,000 transactions processed daily and over 200 nodes participating, BlockDAG rigorously tests its infrastructure in preparation for its mainnet debut in 2025. While other projects focus on market dynamics, BlockDAG is setting the standard for technological preparedness. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Token Burn Soars Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a remarkable increase in its token burn rate, with more than 1 billion tokens eliminated from circulation in just one day‚Äîa 57,000% rise. This increase mainly came from a single entity sending 1 billion SHIB to an unrecoverable address. Despite this intense burn rate, SHIB‚Äôs market price has stayed stable, trading around $0.00001443, which is a 55% drop from its peak this year. Technical analysis shows a megaphone pattern on the weekly chart, indicating a possible bullish trend. This pattern might push the price up by about 130%, aiming for $0.00003395. Furthermore, Shibarium, Shiba Inu‚Äôs Layer-2 solution, is nearing a total of 1 billion transactions, showing increased use and activity. The network has already handled nearly 975 million transactions, supports over 245,000 accounts, and has generated more than 10.15 million blocks. Chainlink (LINK) Aims for $20 Amid Positive Trends Chainlink‚Äôs token, LINK, is currently on an upward trajectory after exiting a downward channel that started in February 2025. LINK now stabilizes at $15.15, with aspirations to break the $20 barrier soon. The recent upturn has pushed LINK above the 200 EMA, setting it on a path toward $19.30, with the $20 level being a key target for market participants. Supporting this positive trend, on-chain data shows that LINK‚Äôs social engagement is at a peak, hinting at increased interest from the market. Moreover, a spike in development activities since early March 2025 and a decrease in LINK available on exchanges suggest that major holders are accumulating, pointing to optimistic forecasts for LINK‚Äôs market performance. BlockDAG Beta Testnet‚Äôs Final Stages Before 2025 Mainnet As it gears up for its 2025 mainnet release, BlockDAG has reached a crucial stage with its Beta ‚ÄúPrimordial‚Äù Testnet. This phase isn‚Äôt just for show but a thorough evaluation of the network‚Äôs systems to ensure they meet essential performance and security standards when they go live. The testnet mimics peak load conditions to check how the system handles stress. BlockDAG aims to process at least 15,000 transactions daily and maintain over 200 active mining nodes to test its scalability and decentralized nature. Additionally, the testnet scrutinizes wallet functionality, ensuring smooth integration with MetaMask and effective operation across various platforms. Developers are putting smart contracts to work, dApps are being utilized by users, and the token vesting process is being tested with over 110,000 accounts. The insights and data collected now are vital for making any necessary adjustments before the final launch. The project is also building momentum with $209.5 million secured in its presale, 19 billion coins distributed, and an ROI of 2,380% since the first batch. With coins now priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is demonstrating the robustness of its infrastructure as it prepares for launch. In essence, the testnet serves as a comprehensive rehearsal for the mainnet, allowing both users and developers to anticipate the actual launch experience. For BlockDAG, this is the ultimate preparation for making the launch a reality. Shaping Future Viability Through Real-Time Testing While market movements and investor interest can generate short-term momentum, the longevity of a technology comes from its ability to perform reliably under real-world conditions. Shiba Inu‚Äôs recent token burn and Chainlink‚Äôs positive market trends have captured the market‚Äôs interest, relying heavily on speculative responses. In contrast, BlockDAG is rigorously validating its infrastructure with its ongoing Beta Testnet. It‚Äôs processing thousands of transactions daily, engaging numerous miners, and seamlessly integrating smart contracts and wallet functionality. While other projects speculate on potential outcomes, BlockDAG is gathering concrete evidence on what actually works. The focus is on tangible results, distinguishing it from projects driven by market speculation.

XRP‚Äôs price has soared following a regulatory victory as Ripple concludes its prolonged legal conflict with the SEC, while Solana‚Äôs collaboration with Polymarket has fueled talks of its price reaching $1,000. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG‚Äôs Beta Testnet has been diligently crafting a robust framework with its dependable support system and developer-oriented design. In contrast to the fluctuating paths of other ventures, BlockDAG (BDAG) consistently prioritizes stability and support for developers, distinguishing it in the field. XRP‚Äôs Price Boost: Regulatory Progress XRP, tied to Ripple Labs, has seen a significant price rise, jumping more than 8% recently. This increase follows the announcement by Ripple‚Äôs CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, that the SEC has concluded its lawsuit initiated four years ago against the firm. This legal battle, started in 2020, challenged Ripple over raising $1.4 billion via unregistered XRP sales. Its resolution mirrors a regulatory evolution under the current government, which appears more open to cryptocurrencies. For example, the SEC has also dismissed actions against other cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase and Robinhood. Additionally, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)‚Äôs approval of Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, is poised to boost XRP‚Äôs role in international transactions. These developments have thus reinforced confidence, driving up XRP‚Äôs price. Polymarket Boosts Solana‚Äôs Momentum Polymarket‚Äôs recent decision to accept Solana (SOL) deposits has energized the cryptocurrency community. Users can now transfer SOL directly to their prediction market wallets, extending Polymarket‚Äôs reach and increasing its platform activity. Following this news, SOL‚Äôs price quickly rose by 7% to $140, with a significant 143% jump in daily trading volumes hitting $4.18 billion. This enthusiasm has sparked debates about SOL‚Äôs potential climb to the $1,000 threshold. Moreover, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko recently apologized for a controversial ad, affirming the project‚Äôs commitment to community involvement. These actions collectively highlight Solana‚Äôs growing market presence and the community‚Äôs faith in its future direction. Constant Support: BlockDAG‚Äôs Commitment During Beta Testnet BlockDAG‚Äôs dedication to user satisfaction and operational dependability is evident in its extensive support system. As the Beta Testnet phase progresses, users, developers, and miners benefit from continuous technical support through the Freshdesk platform. The 24/7 Antier 1st Level Support Desk effectively manages queries, quickly resolving them or forwarding complex issues to the specialized BlockDAG support team. For more complicated technical problems, Antier developers are prepared to intervene, ensuring the testing process runs smoothly with little interruption. This proactive and comprehensive support structure is crucial during the Beta Testnet phase, where network stability and smooth integration are key. BlockDAG‚Äôs approachable and responsive support line builds user trust and promotes greater engagement from developers and miners. This strategy supports the project‚Äôs goals of stability, scalability, and prompt issue resolution. Financially, BlockDAG‚Äôs notable crypto presale success has established a strong foundation for its future. The project has amassed an impressive $209.5 million during the presale, with the current batch at number 27 and a batch price of $0.0248. The ROI since the first batch has reached a remarkable 2,380%, illustrating the project‚Äôs quick momentum and increasing community support. To date, over 19 billion coins have been purchased, underscoring the widespread enthusiasm and confidence in BlockDAG‚Äôs future potential. Building a Strong Base Amid Market Shifts While XRP and Solana are in the spotlight with regulatory victories and strategic partnerships, BlockDAG is establishing a foundation for sustained success with practical and dependable initiatives. Its Beta Testnet focuses on more than just market speculation, emphasizing stability, developer involvement, and strong support. In contrast to projects that fluctuate with market conditions, BlockDAG emphasizes steady performance and community trust. The network‚Äôs round-the-clock technical support and Antier developers‚Äô expertise reflect a commitment to reducing disruptions and enhancing the experience for all participants.

Coinbase And Others Face Increased Volatility According to Bloomberg, Coinbase‚Äôs stock has dropped more than 30% since the beginning of the quarter, marking its worst performance since the collapse of the FTX exchange in late 2022. This decline is reflective of a broader trend affecting nearly all major crypto-linked stocks, including companies like Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY.TO), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Core Scientific (CORZ). Related Reading: XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst The cryptocurrency market itself is experiencing turmoil, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling over 20% from its all-time high and Ethereum (ETH) plummeting more than 45% in value. These shifts come amid President Donald Trump‚Äôs escalation of a ‚Äúglobal trade war,‚Äù which has stirred fears about the health of the country‚Äôs economy. Economic data has exacerbated these concerns, pushing the S&P 500 Index (GSPC) toward its worst quarter since mid-2022. Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau noted that many within the cryptocurrency community recognize that the current market conditions are not primarily driven by fundamental factors. Instead, Lau emphasized that macroeconomic issues‚Äîsuch as tariffs and the potential trade war‚Äîare influencing investor sentiment significantly. The looming threat of a recession has reportedly added to the unease, causing higher-risk crypto-linked stocks to be even more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Lau explains that investments in companies like Coinbase carry additional risks, including the potential for bankruptcy, allegedly making them particularly susceptible to swift sell-offs. Cryptocurrency Market Struggles To Rebound The current state of the cryptocurrency market is a stark contrast to the optimism that prevailed at the start of the year, following Trump‚Äôs election. Bitcoin reached a record high of over $109,000 on Inauguration Day. Earlier this month, Bitcoin prices fell after Trump announced a strategic reserve for the market‚Äôs leading crypto, but did not allocate taxpayer funds to expand it. As of now, Bitcoin trades around $83,000, still above pre-election levels but far from its peak. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key While shares of various crypto-related companies surged following the election, Coinbase and crypto miners have since relinquished those gains. Notably, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy (MSTR) is among the few stocks in the sector that has managed to remain in positive territory since November 5. Despite the downturn, the cryptocurrency industry continues to gain influence in Washington and is moving closer to integration with traditional financial systems. However, this growing power has yet to translate into a market rebound. Connor Loewen, a cryptocurrency analyst at 3iQ, expressed skepticism about the current state of investor sentiment, stating, ‚ÄúWhat we saw a couple of months ago, I don‚Äôt know how much crazier it can get than that. I think we‚Äôre going to have to be looking for new catalysts.‚Äù Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|coin|COIN stocks|coinbase|coinbase news|crypto|Crypto Exchange Coinbase|crypto news|cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-01 00:00:40

Over the past weeks, since he vowed to turn Poland into a crypto haven, S≈Çawomir Mentzen has moved closer to participating in a likely run-off in June. The nationalist candidate is most popular among young Poles who often flock to his rallies. Observers say this is largely due to his quite active presence on social media. Mentzen has been also attracting followers with a program that draws inspiration from U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political messages. Mentzen approaches run-off territory in recent Polish polls Polish voters will be going to the ballot boxes on May 18 to elect their new president this year. The incumbent, Andrzej Duda, is nearing the end of his second and last five-year term in office and won‚Äôt be able to run again under the country‚Äôs constitution. While none of the leading candidates is expected to win in the first round, Warsaw mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, nominated by Prime Minister Donald Tusk‚Äôs center-right, liberal-conservative Civic Platform (PO) party is the clear front-runner. Second in opinion polls is historian Karol Nawrocki, head of the Institute of National Remembrance, who is backed by President Duda‚Äôs right-wing, national-conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) party. His place in the potential second round on June 1 is now challenged by S≈Çawomir Mentzen. Co za zako≈Ñczenie dnia! Dziƒôkujƒô O≈Çawa!

He launched his campaign at the end of August, earlier than his competitors, and has been narrowing the gap between him and the mainstream leaders. Mentzen is still third in the race but a survey conducted by the Polish research company Opinia24 in mid-March showed him with 18.9%, less than a percentage point behind Nawrocki at 19.5%. Trzaskowski is well ahead of both with the support of 32% of the respondents, although that‚Äôs not enough for a first round win. The results were published by RMF24 which ordered the poll. The Polish news outlet highlighted S≈Çawomir Mentzen‚Äôs continuous gain over the past few months. He has added 2 percentage points since February and is 8 points above his December score. Pro-crypto presidential candidate leads among young voters Polling numbers quoted by Politico are also registering Mentzen‚Äôs ascend throughout the race but pointing to a larger difference between him and Nawrocki. RMF24 noted, however, that Opinia24‚Äôs pre-election forecast for the 2023 parliamentary vote, when Mentzen won a seat in the Polish Sejm , was credited as the most accurate. Young Poles is the segment where Mentzen confidently leads, according to Opinia. Some 46% of those aged 18 to 29 have declared their intention to vote for Konfederacja‚Äôs 38-year-old candidate. He is also ranked first by Polish citizens in the 30-39 bracket and has a slight advantage over Trzaskowski among male voters. S≈Çawomir Mentzen has been relying heavily on popular platforms like Tiktok and X as well as Youtube to convey his views, a mix of conservative, nationalistic and libertarian ideas. He ‚Äúhas made social media his home,‚Äù the European political news website Euractiv pointed out in a recent article. His election program titled ‚ÄúStrong Rich Poland‚Äù abounds with political messages mirroring Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign promises such as ensuring ‚Äútight borders,‚Äù providing ‚Äúdefense of free speech,‚Äù ‚Äúreducing bureaucracy,‚Äù and introducing ‚Äúlow and simple taxes.‚Äù He insists ‚ÄúPoland needs a strong army‚Äù but says ‚ÄúNo to Polish troops in Ukraine.‚Äù Poland should create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If I become the President of Poland, our country will become a cryptocurrency haven, with very friendly regulations, low taxes, and a supportive approach from banks and regulators. BTC to the Moon! pic.twitter.com/izKc4spkkV ‚Äî S≈Çawomir Mentzen (@SlawomirMentzen) November 17, 2024 A full paragraph in his 20-point platform is dedicated to crypto. The Polish state fights it because it can‚Äôt control it, Mentzen says, vowing ‚Äúto strive to free up cryptocurrency trading‚Äù and ‚Äúensure Poland has the most crypto-friendly law in the entire European Union.‚Äù In a post on X in November, he also embraced Trump‚Äôs bitcoin reserve initiative. S≈Çawomir Mentzen holds a degree in physics and a PhD in economics after defending a doctoral thesis on public debt at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in his hometown of Toru≈Ñ.

Trump said on Sunday that no country would be given any special treatment regarding tariffs. He also signed new trade policies into effect on April 2 , which he calls ‚ÄúLiberation Day.‚Äù This frightened investors, who had expected a softer trade stance. Trump‚Äôs remarks set off a market-wide sell-off led by tech stocks . Shares in Tesla fell over 5%, the biggest decline for the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù tech behemoths. Already in the‚ÄÇcrosshairs of new trade restrictions, Nvidia saw its stock also tumble. New tariffs disrupt Nvidia‚Äôs role in the AI arms race An imminent 25% tariff from the US government on goods‚ÄÇfrom Mexico and Canada directly impacts Nvidia . The company produces advanced graphics‚ÄÇprocessing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence (AI) servers. So, many of these AI servers are put together in Mexico and driven across the border into the US. According to trade data, the US imported $43 billion in computers, including AI servers,‚ÄÇfrom Mexico in 2024. The company expects new tariffs to increase the cost of such servers, which could decrease demand for‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs AI chips. Taiwan, also a key source of‚ÄÇNvidia‚Äôs GPU supply, could also see the extension of trade controls. In 2024, the US imported $33‚ÄÇbillion worth of computer parts, including Nvidia-powered printed circuit boards, from Taiwan. The tech firm‚Äôs production costs could increase if Trump hits Taiwan with more tariffs. Nvidia gears up for major‚ÄÇchanges ahead The short-term effects of the tariffs will take time to play out, but Nvidia is already‚ÄÇlooking ahead. At its latest GTC conference , CEO Jensen Huang answered questions‚ÄÇabout trade restrictions, specifying that export control restrictions concerning artificial intelligence and China were the reason behind the firm‚Äôs challenges. He acknowledged that tariffs would have ‚Äúa little impact‚Äù on the company in the‚ÄÇshort term, but he also stressed‚ÄÇthat Nvidia is pursuing longer-term solutions. One important step toward that goal is expanding production in the US. Huang cited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) ‚Äòs $100 billion investment to develop new chip factories in the United States. TSMC is a major manufacturing partner for Nvidia, and the move potentially helps mitigate overreliance on overseas factories in the future. However, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has‚ÄÇfaced pressure in 2025. As of Monday morning, it had fallen almost 22% from the start of‚ÄÇthe year. Before Trump made his most‚ÄÇrecent comments, analysts said the stock market had yet to fully digest the new tariffs‚Äô impact. Now, some financial experts are cautioning that‚ÄÇinvestors should also consider how these longer-term rules governing trade will inform the industry. Even before Trump‚Äôs latest remarks, some analysts had cautioned that the market was not yet‚ÄÇproperly pricing the full effects of these tariffs. According to Josh Schafer of Yahoo Finance reports, many investors underestimated the extent and scope of Trump‚Äôs‚ÄÇtrade policies. The market now sees how serious and long-term these tariffs‚ÄÇcould be, said Henrietta Treyz, an economic policy expert at Veda Partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Now priced at $0.70, that‚Äôs a more than 300%‚ÄÇrally for ADA to reach this goal. But skepticism simmers as network action fades ‚Äî daily transactions plunged 70% from late 2024, falling to 26,437‚ÄÇby early March 2025. With bullish patterns and rising social‚ÄÇsentiment suggesting support for a potential 20% bounce towards $0.85, attention is turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi upstart whose presale momentum and tokenomics could leave ADA‚Äôs subdued outlook in the dust. The Uncertain Horizon of‚ÄÇCardano Price‚ÄÇdynamics of Cardano are still trapped in the paradoxes. However, despite ascending social optimism‚Äîpartially driven by the SEC‚Äôs suddenly non-securities classification of ADA‚Äîthe network‚Äôs utility metrics fare‚ÄÇpoorly. Analysts draw attention to the bullish ‚Äúflag‚Äù pattern that has been developing since December‚ÄÇ2024, as is characteristic for a precursor to rallies, but declining transactional activity erodes confidence. Before ADA can reach its 2025 price peak of‚ÄÇ$1.20, it has to break the $0.85 resistance zone, equivalent to a 20% increase from where it is right now. Yet, skeptics wonder if deflating adoption can be the foundation for long-term growth, prompting investors to look‚ÄÇfor alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for those exponential returns. The Dominance of Mutuum Finance‚Äôs Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ($0.025 ‚Äî Phase 4) is expected to see 140%‚ÄÇincrease at launch ($0.06). Those who take early stage pricing now can expect a 20% profit before the next price jump brings the price‚ÄÇto $0.03. Combine this with $5.9 million of capital already raised and 7600 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holders and the algorithmic buy-pressure and revenue-redistribution tokenomics become a compelling‚ÄÇproposition. Mutuum Finance stands‚ÄÇout because of the self-sustaining ecosystem. Its lending protocol drives steady demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens, and mtTokens‚Äîdeposit certificates‚ÄÇthat earn interest‚Äîgenerate supplemental yield streams. This incremental design of the presale, currently at its fourth of eleven stages, encourages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors to get in‚ÄÇon the action as soon as possible, with each tier raising the price to reward those who act fast. Favourable post-launch predictions fuelled by both exchange listings and platform adoption dictate a rise to $1.50‚Äì$3.50 in under a few months, equating with‚ÄÇa 5,900%‚Äì14,000% ROI for phase-four contributors. Strategic‚ÄÇGrowth & Security Mutuum Finance‚Äôs approach is‚ÄÇdriven by transparency A Certik audit is in progress for its smart contracts, with public release of results expected after they are‚ÄÇfinalized. Coupled with a tokenomics plan to dampen sell pressure, this specializing in security makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a‚ÄÇhigh reward, low risk entry. Unlike speculative assets, its value is directly correlated to platform usage ‚Äî every loan issued and every deposit made‚ÄÇincreases the demand for the token. As Cardano‚ÄÇstruggles with stagnating utility and Solana wrestles with volatility, Mutuum Finance becomes the presale phenomenon of 2025. As phase four fills quickly‚ÄÇand exchange listings are on the horizon, the fusion of DeFi innovation and strategic tokenomics offers a clear path to outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale marks a rare moment of urgency and opportunity‚ÄÇfor investors who are looking for a safe harbour from volatile markets. Seize the Momentum Mutuum Finance‚Äôs fourth presale phase is‚ÄÇcounting down the clock. Next 20% price jump‚ÄÇis around the corner ‚Äì $0.03 per token; after the launch, triple-digit returns.

The cryptocurrency was closing in on the $90,000 psychological level but has since reversed direction, falling by 6.4% over the past week to hover around $82,000 at the time of writing. This decline has placed renewed attention on market metrics that suggest the rally may have been short-lived. Amid this downward movement, several on-chain analysts have raised questions about whether recent price trends reflect real demand or speculative behavior. Particularly, insights from CryptoQuant contributors point to warning signs, including a divergence between market capitalization and actual network activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead NVT Indicator Signals Caution Amid Low Transaction Volume In a recent post titled ‚ÄúManipulative Moves or True Value? A Bitcoin and NVT Analysis,‚Äù CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest pointed to the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio as a critical metric for understanding current market dynamics. The NVT ratio is calculated by dividing Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization by its daily transaction volume. According to BorisVest, Bitcoin‚Äôs elevated NVT Golden Cross reading indicates a high market cap against low transaction activity ‚Äî a combination that historically suggests price inflation driven by speculative interest rather than organic growth. BorisVest emphasized that periods with a high NVT often precede market corrections. In contrast, when the NVT falls into the green zone ‚Äî signaling a low market cap with rising transaction volume ‚Äî it may present a stronger foundation for price appreciation. As of now, the metric suggests Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price rise lacks transactional support, and continued pullbacks remain possible unless volume returns to the network. Bitcoin Speculators Absent, Sentiment Remains Cautious Adding to the cautious outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor known as crypto sunmoon highlighted the role of leverage in driving crypto bull markets. The analyst pointed out that funding rates have recently ‚Äúdead-crossed,‚Äù which occurs when short-term funding rates fall below long-term rates, often indicating bearish sentiment among traders. According to sunmoon, this shift suggests that speculators are currently unwilling to take on risk ‚Äî a key component needed to fuel bullish price movements. The analyst concluded that the return of speculative trading behavior, typically marked by rising funding rates and leveraged positions, is essential for reigniting upward momentum in Bitcoin.

This will be the firm‚Äôs first open-weight release since GPT-2, a decision that had been delayed due to other priorities but now feels essential. Per the update, the novel model is expected to bring strong reasoning capabilities and provide simplicity for developers and organizations. From OpenAI ChatGPT to Sora It is worth mentioning that Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, shared the news on X, expressing excitement about making the model highly effective. More importantly, this announcement follows OpenAI‚Äôs history of launching novel AI products. Since the release of ChatGPT in 2022, the tool has become widely used for text-based tasks. This Large Language Model transformed how people from different parts of the world interact with artificial intelligence . As reported by CoinGape, In 2024, OpenAI introduced Sora, an advanced video generation model. In addition, the release of voice Chat further improved AI‚Äôs role by allowing seamless spoken interactions. Interestingly, these notable innovations have redefined how AI integrates into daily life. Now, OpenAI is moving toward open-weight models. This will allow greater customization. For example, businesses, developers, and governments that prefer self-hosted AI solutions will be able to modify the model for specific needs. This new project could lead to wider adoption and new applications across various industries. ChatGPT Developer Involvement and Future Trends Before releasing the project to the public, OpenAI seeks developers‚Äô input through a series of sessions. According to Sam Altman, the events will begin in San Francisco, followed by meetings in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As detailed, developers will gain early access to prototypes, providing insight into potential applications. Altman confirmed that OpenAI will evaluate the model using its preparedness framework. Since open-weight models can be altered post-release, additional security measures will be implemented. By involving developers early, OpenAI intends to fuse innovation and responsibility. This will ensure that the model is both effective and safe for people to use. Another Studio Ghibli Trend Ahead? It is important to add that AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style artwork has shown how artificial intelligence can shape creative industries. For context, when OpenAI added image generation to ChatGPT-4o, people started making Studio Ghibli-style portraits, and the trend quickly spread. Even Elon Musk joined the Ghibli trend . Still, this new trend has raised certain questions about the future of creative art. Still, with OpenAI‚Äôs new model on the way, another wave of AI-generated content could take off. As AI keeps improving, it may bring new ways for people to create and share.

The privacy tool, launched by Ethereum builders 0xbow.io on March 31, earned support from the likes of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who not only backed the privacy project but made one of the first deposits on the platform. 0xbow.io said that it implements ‚ÄúAssociation Sets‚Äù to batch transactions into the anonymous Privacy Pools and that a screening test is conducted to ensure that those transactions aren‚Äôt linked to illicit actors, such as hackers, phishers and scammers. gm Ethereum ‚òÄÔ∏è It is our great honor to announce the mainnet launch of Privacy Pools!

If a deposit is disqualified, the user can click the ‚Äúragequit‚Äù function to return the funds to their original deposit address. The innovation is part of 0xbow.io‚Äôs vision to ‚ÄúMake Privacy Normal Again‚Äù while also attempting to achieve regulatory compliance. Privacy protocols have received considerable backlash from regulators in recent years due to their increasing use by illicit actors to launder funds. One of those privacy tools, Tornado Cash, was sanctioned by the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) between August 2022 and March 2025 after it was linked to around $7 billion laundered by the North Korean state-backed Lazarus Group. Tornado Cash has since been removed from OFAC‚Äôs blacklist after a US appeals court said the sanctions were unlawful in January 2025. 0xbow.io noted that initial deposits are limited to 1 Ether ( ETH ) but that the limit would be raised once the privacy protocol is more battle-tested. Privacy Pools inspired by Buterin and others Over 21 ETH has already been transferred into Privacy Pools from 69 deposits, including at least one from Buterin, 0xbow.io noted. Source: Vitalik Buterin In addition to Buterin, 0xbow.io said it also received investment support from Number Group, BanklessVC, Public Works and several angel investors. Related: Privacy isn‚Äôt a luxury in crypto, it‚Äôs a necessity ‚Äî Midnight CEO 0xbow.io also praised Buterin, Chainalysis Chief Scientist Jacob Illum, and two academics at the University of Basel in Switzerland for crafting a September 2023 white paper outlining how Privacy Pools could be built. 0xbow.io strategic adviser Ameen Soleimani also contributed to the paper, which has seen over 12,000 downloads and has been cited in nine other papers. The Privacy Pool code also passed a successful audit from Audit Wizard. a smart contract auditing firm co-founded by former Apple engineer Joe van Loon. More than $41 billion worth of illicit transfers were made in 2024, which made up 0.14% of total onchain volume for the year, according to the Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime report published on Jan. 15. While it marked around an 11% fall from 2023, Chainalysis said that figure could climb to around $51 billion as more criminal-tied addresses are found. Magazine: What are native rollups?

42726270,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24964,1743470105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What is Gunz (GUN)?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/token/what-is-gunz-gun/,"GUNZ is a blockchain-based platform integrated into traditional gaming formats, enabling players to convert in-game items into NFTs (non-fungible tokens) if they choose to do so. Bitfinex is one of the first global exchanges to list the GUN token. Unlike typical free-to-play games where purchased or earned items remain locked within the game ecosystem, GUNZ gives players actual ownership of digital assets, meaning these items can be traded, kept, or sold on the in-game marketplace or other compatible platforms. This approach aims to provide more flexibility and control to users over the digital goods they earn during gameplay. The platform is currently featured in two games: Off The Grid (OTG), a cyberpunk-themed extraction battle royale available on PC and consoles, and Technocore , a mobile game focused on navigating a drone through complex environments while collecting loot. Players in both titles can find loot boxes known as HEXes, which, if successfully extracted, can be converted into NFTs. This mechanism links gameplay achievements with blockchain-based ownership, distinguishing GUNZ from traditional loot or cosmetic systems. Trade Gun Now What is the GUN Token? The GUN token is the native digital currency of the GUNZ gaming platform, designed to support a decentralized economy within participating games such as Off The Grid and Technocore . It serves as both a utility and reward token, enabling players to trade, purchase, and unlock in-game items and features. Unlike traditional game currencies that are confined to a single game or controlled entirely by a central authority, GUN operates on a blockchain, giving players verifiable ownership of the tokens they earn or purchase. Within the GUNZ ecosystem, GUN tokens are primarily used to facilitate transactions on the in-game marketplace, where players can buy, sell, or trade items that have been tokenized as NFTs. These items can range from weapons and cosmetic upgrades to character enhancements and hideout features. This decentralized model means players can extract real-world value from their in-game progress by exchanging digital assets in a transparent and secure environment. trade gun now GUN is also tied to gameplay incentives. Players earn tokens by completing various challenges or objectives during matches, such as ranking highly in the game, extracting loot, or using specific gear effectively. This system encourages active participation and skill development, rewarding players not only with in-game progression but with tradable digital assets. These tokens can then be reinvested into the game or held as a form of value, depending on the user‚Äôs preferences. Importantly, the GUN token is optional for players who prefer a more traditional gaming experience. Players can enjoy GUNZ-powered games without engaging in the token economy, as all core gameplay features remain accessible without the use of GUN.

District Court to reinstate its Freedom of Information Act‚ÄÇlawsuit against government agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) The‚ÄÇexchange says the FDIC is still withholding some important documents and not fully cooperating with requests for information. The lawsuit seeks to force the FDIC to hand over records of its conversations with banks related to cryptocurrency actions, including the ‚Äòpause letters‚Äô issued to banks telling them to stop providing‚ÄÇcrypto services.‚Äù Coinbase seeks court‚Äôs intervention as FDIC cooperation falters in Operation Choke Point 2.0 dispute Coinbase has been involved in a¬†months-long battle¬†with the FDIC. The firm has been pursuing the FDIC over Operation Choke Point 2.0 for months now and has achieved impressive results. Despite this, Coinbase is asking the DC District Court to resume its litigation against the regulator. The legal action was initially paused in February 2025 after President Trump appointed Travis Hill as acting FDIC chairman. Hill vowed to enhance the agency‚Äôs transparency beyond FOIA requirements, raising hopes that the matter could be resolved outside of court. Still, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, says there is ongoing dissatisfaction with the FDIC‚Äôs transparency. He acknowledges that cooperation has improved under the new leadership but feels it is still not enough. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking the Court to resume our lawsuit because the FDIC has unfortunately stopped sharing information. While we would have loved to resolve this outside of the legal system ‚Äì and we do appreciate the increased cooperation we‚Äôve seen from the new FDIC leadership ‚Äì we still have a ways to go,‚Äù¬†claimed¬†Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer. As a key US financial regulator overseeing banks, the FDIC played a central role in Operation Choke Point 2.0, restricting banks‚Äô interactions with cryptocurrency businesses. However, it recently began a pro-crypto turn, releasing relevant documents and revoking several of its anti-crypto regulations. Grewal says that he ‚Äúappreciated the increased cooperation‚Äù from the FDIC. However, he noted that the cooperation had stopped weeks ago. According to Coinbase‚Äôs filing , the FDIC hasn‚Äôt sent any new information since late February and claimed in early March that the exchange‚Äôs subsequent requests were ‚Äúunreasonable and beyond the scope of discovery.‚Äù The FDIC is expected to respond to¬†Coinbase‚Äôs¬†motion within two weeks. Coinbase pushes for court action as FDIC‚Äôs overreach could alter the future of crypto innovation Operation Choke Point 2.0 is the term used for a series of actions allegedly taken by certain federal regulators and agencies, including the FDIC, to limit banking access to certain high-risk or controversial industries, including cryptocurrency businesses. Critics say this is a subtle ploy to kill the crypto space by denying exchanges, brokerages, and other players‚ÄÇin the ecosystem access to traditional banking services. Coinbase contends that actions taken, especially through informal guidance and informal pressure on banks, have launched a hostile environment for‚ÄÇcryptocurrency businesses under the FDIC. These operations resulted in an illegal restriction on access to banking services, which placed cryptographic firms in a‚ÄÇrelatively disadvantaged position in the financial arena. As part of its effort to revive the case,‚ÄÇCoinbase is seeking court intervention to compel the FDIC to answer and prevent such overreach in the future. Coinbase argues that such overreach chills innovation in the digital assets market. The FDIC‚Äôs actions, they argue, violate both due process and the First Amendment, as cryptocurrency companies believe they should not be penalized based on what business they choose to operate. If Coinbase is‚ÄÇsuccessful in reviving its lawsuit, the implications could be sweeping for both the cryptocurrency industry and the regulatory agencies.

XRP has focused on cross-border remittances, while Bittensor has introduced a decentralized approach to AI training. BlockDAG , however, is taking a broader view. Its roadmap includes decentralized identity, AI integration, and token-holder governance‚Äîbuilt on its DAG-based hybrid architecture. With a $209.5 million presale and a 2,380% return from Batch 1 to Batch 27, BlockDAG is framing itself not just as a project, but as a platform designed to support the next phase of the Web3 ecosystem. XRP‚Äôs Role in Global Payments & Its Investment Track Record Ripple Labs launched XRP in 2012 to streamline international payments. It was built to provide fast, low-cost transaction processing for banks and financial institutions, specifically through real-time gross settlement and remittance networks. At launch, XRP traded for fractions of a cent. Today, as of March 28, 2025, it is priced around $2.32. Its journey has been marked by market shifts and, more significantly, legal scrutiny. The SEC lawsuit initiated in 2020 has had a lasting impact on XRP‚Äôs price and market standing. Despite those legal headwinds, XRP continues to hold a major market position. It remains one of the top digital assets by market capitalization, with growing adoption among banks and payment providers worldwide. This suggests that, despite its challenges, XRP has maintained long-term utility in global finance. Bittensor (TAO): Decentralized AI & Notable Price Movement Bittensor‚Äôs TAO token went live on March 6, 2023, at an initial price of $93.40. The network aims to decentralize artificial intelligence by enabling participants to contribute computing resources and algorithms to a shared ecosystem. The goal is to create an open, collaborative AI marketplace. TAO saw sharp price movements following launch. It peaked at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. These figures show significant investor returns from the starting price, even amid the typical volatility of crypto markets. What makes Bittensor stand out is its blend of AI and blockchain. This intersection has attracted attention from developers and investors alike. As more industries explore decentralized AI models, TAO‚Äôs role as an early mover could prove significant in shaping this new segment of the crypto economy. BlockDAG‚Äôs Future-Focused Roadmap: From AI to Digital Identity As blockchain evolves, the focus is moving away from simple transaction speeds and toward building meaningful infrastructure. BlockDAG is aligning itself with this shift‚Äîby preparing for a digital future that includes AI, self-managed identity, and decentralized governance. With $209.5 million raised in its presale‚Äîachieved without institutional venture backing‚ÄîBlockDAG demonstrates how community support can drive momentum. It‚Äôs now in Batch 27, selling tokens at $0.0248. From Batch 1 to date, the ROI has reached 2,380%, and over 19 billion coins have already been sold. But this traction supports more than just market demand. BlockDAG is actively developing infrastructure for use cases that extend beyond finance. Features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge cryptography, and smart contract flexibility are core to its architecture‚Äîsetting the stage for identity solutions, AI agents, and programmable governance. This means users could one day control their digital identity securely without third-party oversight, or engage with autonomous AI systems for everyday tasks. Governance could evolve beyond voting apps into smart, code-driven policy-making tools‚Äîgiving token holders real influence. These aren‚Äôt speculative ideas. They‚Äôre technical possibilities being built into the foundation today. With Testnet already in motion and Mainnet on the horizon, BlockDAG‚Äôs ecosystem is actively preparing for these applications‚Äînot years from now, but in the near term. Key Insights! As blockchain technology matures, the strongest projects will be those building more than tokens. XRP pushed the boundaries of payment speed, and Bittensor opened up new ground in decentralized AI. But BlockDAG is constructing something more comprehensive. Its roadmap addresses foundational needs: AI-native compatibility, identity ownership, and token-based governance. And with a community-funded $209.5 million presale‚Äîno early VC required‚ÄîBlockDAG is proving that users are ready to back purpose-driven infrastructure. As Web3 scales globally, the future will belong to platforms that empower users with both control and functionality. BlockDAG‚Äôs architecture is built with that in mind‚Äîfocused on resilience, adaptability, and utility in the years to come.

The cryptocurrency has declined by 22.3% in the last month alone, bringing its price down to $83,191 at the time of writing. The drop reflects ongoing uncertainty in the broader crypto market, as investors are struggling with reduced risk appetite and a lack of strong bullish catalysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Targets Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally, What Happened Last Time Whale Accumulation Patterns Echo Previous Bull Market Phases Despite the downtrend, recent on-chain activity suggests that certain investor cohorts remain confident in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value. In particular, whale addresses‚Äîwallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC‚Äîhave demonstrated a historical correlation with Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends. According to CryptoQuant contributor Mignolet, the current market cycle bears a resemblance to the 2020 bull cycle, where these whales exhibited accumulation behavior during bearish sentiment phases. Mignolet noted that these patterns occurred three times throughout the 2020 cycle, each coinciding with brief drawdowns in price. In the current phase, similar accumulation activity is being observed among whale entities, particularly those with holdings in the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC range. These patterns, as Mignolet suggests, may indicate that these market leaders are not exiting their positions, despite price pressure. Notably, the significance of whale behavior lies in its historical influence on market direction. As long as whales remain in accumulation mode, it could provide a base of support for the broader market and reduce the likelihood of further rapid declines. However, this dynamic does not eliminate the possibility of continued volatility, especially if broader market sentiment does not improve. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Capitulation In contrast to whale activity, short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of distress. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has remained below 1.0 for over two months, currently hovering around 0.98. This metric compares the selling price of Bitcoin with its acquisition price. When it falls below 1, it suggests that holders are selling at a loss‚Äîoften viewed as a sign of capitulation. STH Capitulation ‚ÄúWhen this ratio drops below 1, it signals capitulation among STHs, often leading to short-term price declines. We can confirm this trend by observing the $BTC being sent to exchanges at a loss.‚Äù ‚Äì By @Darkfost_Coc Link ‚§µÔ∏èhttps://t.co/BUIo9caGck pic.twitter.com/QfNfFpT9VL ‚Äî CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 31, 2025 Additionally, on-chain data shows that approximately 46,000 BTC have been sent to exchanges at a loss in recent weeks, highlighting the stress among STHs.

Helium‚Äôs IoT hotspots and Raydium‚Äôs slick Solana-based exchange show strong efforts to shape the future. But despite their ambitions, both have struggled to maintain consistent network reliability and market strength. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is pulling ahead by doing what others haven‚Äôt: making uptime a priority. With fault-tolerant design and seamless availability, it‚Äôs giving users and developers a dependable place to build‚Äîand that‚Äôs translating directly into presale success and growing momentum. Helium‚Äôs Wireless Vision Shows Promise Helium began its journey in 2012, founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey. It officially launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to create a fully decentralized network for IoT devices. The idea was bold: reward users for setting up hotspots to expand wireless coverage. Then came Helium Mobile in May 2023, offering unlimited talk, text, and data for just $20 a month. That move paid off‚Äîby December 2023, Helium Mobile made up roughly 90% of Helium‚Äôs entire network revenue. The token story, however, has been a rollercoaster. In Q3 2024, HNT‚Äôs circulating market cap surged 124% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, while its price jumped 119% to $7.54. But as of March 28, 2025, HNT has fallen back to $3.37‚Äîa steep 93.1% drop from its peak of $48.80. Despite this, Helium‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding globally, boosted by fresh partnerships and international moves. Still, the volatility leaves questions around its long-term reliability. Raydium Surges on Solana‚ÄîBut Faces the Heat of Big Volume Raydium entered the market in early 2021 and quickly carved out space as a go-to DEX on Solana. Thanks to Solana‚Äôs speed and low fees, Raydium attracted users fast‚Äîhandling between $1 and $2 billion in weekly trading volume by early 2024. Then came a massive spike: $12 billion in a single week later that year, underscoring its explosive growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium‚Äôs RAY token is priced at $2.00. Daily trading volume stands at roughly $56.99 million, and its market cap is around $581.66 million. With control of 60.7% of Solana‚Äôs DEX market, Raydium has certainly proven its strength in DeFi. But even with liquidity and development on its side, keeping pace with growing expectations is no small task. BlockDAG‚Äôs Secret Weapon? Always-On Infrastructure That Won‚Äôt Let You Down What‚Äôs driving the buzz around BlockDAG? It‚Äôs not just the gains‚Äîit‚Äôs the rock-solid foundation underneath. While other platforms face outages and pressure during high demand, BlockDAG is built to stay live no matter what. Its fault-tolerant design ensures that even if nodes or regions fail, the network keeps moving. This is no accident. BlockDAG‚Äôs global architecture spreads across multiple data centers, rerouting traffic instantly when needed. That means no bottlenecks, no panic, and no interruptions for users or developers. It‚Äôs smart, stable, and ahead of the curve. And it‚Äôs working. BlockDAG has already raised $209.5 million during its presale. With over 18.9 billion coins sold and batch 27 priced at $0.0248, the return from batch 1 stands at a jaw-dropping 2,380%. That kind of growth doesn‚Äôt come from hype alone‚Äîit comes from confidence. This isn‚Äôt just about having a strong system. It‚Äôs about showing users they can trust it to be there tomorrow, next year, and beyond. And in crypto, that kind of trust is rare‚Äîand valuable. Why BlockDAG‚Äôs Resilience Could Be the Edge Every Developer Wants Every blockchain wants to promise big returns, but only a few can guarantee stability. Helium has the vision, and Raydium brings liquidity‚Äîbut both face pressure to maintain uptime and confidence. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has made reliability part of its DNA. Its infrastructure is built to handle pressure without flinching, and that‚Äôs exactly what developers and buyers are looking for. The presale numbers already prove it, but the real story is in the long game. As more projects look to build without disruption, BlockDAG‚Äôs fault tolerance becomes more than just a feature‚Äîit becomes a reason to choose it over others. And with this level of performance and investor backing, it‚Äôs clear: BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just ready for what‚Äôs next‚Äîit‚Äôs already building it.

New projects launch daily, hype comes and goes, and trends shift like quicksand. But one thing never changes: the search for the best altcoins to invest in now. Everyone wants to find the next breakout project before it skyrockets, the token that could turn a few hundred bucks into a fortune. And right now, some serious contenders are making waves. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand, and Injective‚Äîthree powerhouse projects that aren‚Äôt just surviving in this chaotic market but thriving. These aren‚Äôt your average altcoins; they‚Äôre leading the charge in Web3 innovation, sustainable blockchain solutions, and decentralized finance (DeFi). If you‚Äôre looking for real opportunities‚Äînot just speculation‚Äîyou‚Äôre in the right place. Let‚Äôs break down why these three could be the best altcoins to invest in now. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads as the world‚Äôs first Layer-1 Web3 aggregator, seamlessly bridging various blockchain ecosystems. Currently in its 28th stage of its crypto presale , Qubetics ($TICS) has sold over 504 million $TICS tokens to more than 23,900+ holders, raising $15.5 million. Priced at $0.1430 per token, analysts are buzzing with predictions. By the end of the crypto presale, $TICS is expected to reach $1 (599% ROI), $5 (3,396% ROI), and even $10 (6,892% ROI). Following the mainnet launch, some estimates suggest $TICS could soar to $15, an astonishing 10,388% ROI, one of the best altcoins to invest in now. Just imagine a $2,000 investment in $TICS at $0.1430 secures 13,980 tokens. If the price hits $1, that‚Äôs $13,980; at $5, it grows to $69,900. If $TICS reaches $15, your $2,000 turns into $209,700 ‚Äî a massive 10,388% ROI. But what‚Äôs fueling this excitement? Qubetics ($TICS) is pioneering a Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. Imagine a platform where businesses can tokenize assets like real estate, art, or intellectual property, making them accessible to a global audience. A startup could fractionalize its equity, allowing backers worldwide to own a piece. Artists might tokenize their work, enabling fans to buy shares and support their creations directly. This democratization of assets is not just a concept; Qubetics ($TICS), as a first-layer blockchain, is making it a reality, positioning itself as a game-changer in the investment landscape. Algorand: The Green Powerhouse of Blockchain Algorand has carved a niche as a sustainable and efficient blockchain platform. Founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand runs on a Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism that delivers high-speed transaction finality, low fees, and minimal energy consumption. Its environmentally friendly model has earned it recognition as one of the most sustainable blockchains in the world, aligning with the growing demand for green technology across global markets. The platform is designed to support a wide range of decentralized applications, from financial services and asset tokenization to identity solutions and cross-border payments. Its smart contract capabilities are scalable and secure, offering developers a robust environment to build next-generation applications. Algorand has also gained traction with institutions and governments exploring blockchain-based solutions for digital identity, carbon tracking, and central bank digital currencies. What sets Algorand apart is its consistent focus on real-world impact and academic innovation. Backed by a passionate community and a growing ecosystem of partnerships, it continues to attract developers, enterprises, and organizations that value speed, security, and sustainability. Despite broader market volatility, Algorand‚Äôs commitment to future-focused blockchain infrastructure makes it one of the most compelling projects in the space for long-term adoption and development. Injective: Redefining Decentralized Trading Injective is gaining serious attention for reimagining decentralized trading with an infrastructure that blends speed, security, and complete user control. At its core, Injective powers a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem that allows users to trade spot, perpetual, and derivatives assets ‚Äî all with zero gas fees. This model removes a major friction point seen in other DeFi platforms, making on-chain trading faster and far more cost-effective. Unlike traditional DEXs that sacrifice speed for decentralization, Injective leverages advanced infrastructure to deliver both. A standout development is Injective‚Äôs integration with the Cosmos SDK, which brings enhanced interoperability across various blockchain networks. This expansion enables Injective to offer seamless cross-chain trading, opening doors to deeper liquidity and broader use cases. The platform also supports custom-built financial markets, giving developers the ability to launch innovative DeFi products without needing to rely on centralized intermediaries. With a growing list of partnerships and developer support, Injective is cementing its reputation as one of the most forward-thinking DeFi protocols. Its focus on usability, zero fees, and interoperability is not just setting it apart ‚Äî it‚Äôs creating a new standard. For those tracking serious altcoin contenders, Injective continues to prove it‚Äôs built for the long run. Final Thoughts: Why Qubetics, Algorand, and Injective Are the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now The crypto market isn‚Äôt waiting for anyone‚Äîand neither should you. With Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand, and Injective, we‚Äôre looking at three projects that aren‚Äôt just the best altcoins to invest in now but also keeping up with industry trends‚Äîthey‚Äôre setting them. Qubetics ($TICS), as the first Layer-1 Web3 aggregator, is redefining real-world asset tokenization, making high-value assets accessible to everyone. Its crypto presale is gaining serious traction, and the ROI potential is off the charts. Algorand continues to dominate the sustainable blockchain space, offering a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional financial systems. Meanwhile, Injective is shaking up DeFi with its zero gas fee trading ecosystem, proving that decentralization doesn‚Äôt have to mean slow or expensive transactions. Whether you‚Äôre in this for massive growth potential, long-term adoption, or game-changing blockchain innovation, these three altcoins are making their mark. The market is moving fast, and opportunities like this don‚Äôt stick around forever. The question is‚Äîare you ready to make your move?

In a March 31 post on X, Armstrong argued that crypto companies should be treated similarly to banks and be ‚Äúallowed to, and incentivized to, share interest with consumers.‚Äù He added that allowing onchain interest would be ‚Äúconsistent with a free market approach.‚Äù Source: Brian Armstrong There are currently two competing pieces of federal stablecoin legislation working their way through the legislative process in the US: the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. In reference to the stablecoin legislation, Armstrong said the US had an opportunity to ‚Äúlevel the playing field and ensure these laws pave a way for all regulated stablecoins to deliver interest directly to consumers, the same way a savings or checking account can.‚Äù Armstrong: Onchain interest a boon for US economy Armstrong argued that while stablecoins have already found product-market fit by ‚Äúdigitizing the dollar and other fiat currencies,‚Äù the addition of onchain interest would allow ‚Äúthe average person, and the US economy, to reap the full benefits.‚Äù He said that if legislative changes allowed stablecoin issuers to pay interest to holders, US consumers could earn a yield of around 4% on their holdings, far outstripping the 2024 average interest yield on a consumer savings account, which Armstrong cited as 0.41%. Armstrong also said onchain interest could benefit the broader US economy ‚Äî by incentivizing the global use of US dollar stablecoins. This could see their use grow, ‚Äúpulling dollars back to U.S. treasuries and extending dollar dominance in an increasingly digital global economy,‚Äù according to the Coinbase CEO. He also argued that the potential for a higher yield than traditional savings accounts would result in ‚Äúmore yield in consumers‚Äô hands means more spending, saving, investing ‚Äî fueling economic growth in all local economies where stablecoins are held.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt unlock onchain interest, the U.S. misses out on billions more USD users and trillions in potential cash flows,‚Äù Armstrong added. Currently, neither the STABLE Act nor the GENIUS Act gives the legal go-ahead for onchain interest-generating stablecoins. In fact, in its current form, the STABLE Act includes a short passage prohibiting ‚Äúpayment stablecoin‚Äù issuers from paying yield to holders: Source: STABLE Act Related: Stablecoins, tokenized assets gain as Trump tariffs loom Similarly, the GENIUS Act, which recently passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18-6, has been amended to exclude interest-bearing instruments from its definition of a ‚Äúpayment stablecoin.‚Äù Commenting on the current state of the STABLE Act, Representative Bryan Steil told Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, that two pieces of legislation are positioned to ‚Äúmirror up‚Äù following a few more draft rounds in the House and Senate ‚Äî due to the differences between them being textual rather than substantive. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I think there‚Äôs recognition that we want to work with our Senate colleagues to get this across the line,‚Äù Steil said.

However, according to Etherscan, another 25 Ether was then sent to a wallet listed as Chainflip1. Earlier, another user warned the exploiter about the error, telling them, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt celebrate,‚Äù because all the funds were sent to the scam Tornado Cash URL. ‚ÄúIt is so devastating.

Source: Etherscan How zkLend was exploited for $9.6 million zkLend suffered an empty market exploit on Feb. 11 when an attacker used a small deposit and flash loans to inflate the lending accumulator, according to the protocol‚Äôs Feb. 14 post-mortem. The hacker then repeatedly deposited and withdrew funds, exploiting rounding errors that became significant due to the inflated accumulator. The attacker bridged the stolen funds to Ethereum and later failed to launder them through Railgun after protocol policies returned them to the original address. Following the exploit, zkLend proposed the hacker could keep 10% of the funds as a bounty and offered to release the culprit from legal liability and scrutiny from law enforcement if the remaining Ether was returned. Related: DeFi protocol SIR.trading loses entire $355K TVL in ‚Äòworst news‚Äô possible The offer deadline of Feb. 14 passed with no public response from either party.

With every scroll through Crypto Twitter, it feels like there‚Äôs a new viral coin making waves. From trading groups to TikTok crypto threads, meme coins are constantly buzzing. And while some coins blow up overnight, the real challenge is spotting the gems before they explode. That‚Äôs where this list comes in‚Äîspecifically spotlighting three of the best new meme coins to invest in right now that are gaining major traction in 2025. And leading this charge is none other than BTFD Coin , a meme coin currently in its presale‚Äôs penultimate stage. With a clever referral program, an engaged army of Bulls, and jaw-dropping growth potential, it‚Äôs turning heads faster than a bull stampede. Let‚Äôs break down why BTFD and two other meme coins like PENGU and BABYDOGE deserve your attention. 1. BTFD Coin: The Bullish Referral Program Everyone‚Äôs Talking About BTFD Coin is a meme coin with serious momentum‚Äîand it‚Äôs not slowing down. With the presale clock ticking and only one stage left, bulls are stampeding into the project. Over $6.45 million has already been raised, with more than 11,700 holders locking in over 72 billion $BTFD tokens. The current price? Just $0.0002. But analysts project it‚Äôll list at $0.0006, and possibly reach its moon target of $0.006, which would represent a 2900% ROI. But the biggest buzz right now? The referral program . If you‚Äôve ever wanted to earn crypto by simply spreading the word, BTFD has it dialed in. Here‚Äôs how it works: users share a unique code‚Äîanyone who uses it and invests $50+ gets 10% more tokens, and if you make the leaderboard, you earn 10% of your referral‚Äôs raise amount. For example, if your code brings in $15,000 in purchases, you could snag $1,500 worth of $BTFD tokens on top of your own. That‚Äôs a whole new layer of passive earning. This referral race runs until the end of the month, and top performers are already stacking serious token bonuses. The fact that you can build your bag just by sharing a code? That‚Äôs a rare opportunity, especially in a meme coin presale that‚Äôs already gaining traction globally. Wondering how to grab your bag of BTFD before it‚Äôs too late? Just set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, then head to the buy page . Once connected, choose your amount, buy, and confirm. When the presale ends, you‚Äôll be able to claim your tokens and start staking for that juicy 90% APY. All the while, your referral bonuses will be stacking up in your wallet like digital dividends. There‚Äôs also a full Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1, 2025. Whether you‚Äôre earning through gaming, staking, or the referral system‚ÄîBTFD‚Äôs utility is seriously layered.

Inspired by Dogecoin, BABYDOGE plays up the cute factor while delivering increasingly functional updates like charitable giving campaigns, DeFi integrations, and a growing suite of ecosystem tools. One of the biggest advantages of BABYDOGE is its massive fanbase and constant online visibility. From viral tweets to exchange listings, it always finds a way to stay relevant. And for new investors or crypto-curious millennials, that visibility matters‚Äîit signals active development and constant demand. Even if the token‚Äôs meme roots run deep, the utility and brand behind BABYDOGE are more strategic than most people realize.

Last week, digital asset investment products attracted a substantial $226 million in inflows, marking nine consecutive trading days of positive sentiment and fueling cautious optimism among investors, according to a CoinShares report. This turnaround follows a particularly rough patch, though a minor setback occurred on Friday, with $74 million exiting the market, likely spooked by unexpectedly high US core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data that could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decisions. Bitcoin (BTC) remains the undisputed king of crypto assets, pulling in a commanding $195 million in inflows. This cements its position as the go-to digital asset for institutional investors seeking exposure to the crypto market. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products experienced their fourth consecutive week of outflows, totaling $2.5 million, suggesting that bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin is waning as long-term optimism takes hold. Despite this recent resurgence, total assets under management (AUM) for global Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have fallen to $114 billion, the lowest since shortly after the US presidential election. This figure suggests that there is still progress to be made. Perhaps the most encouraging sign is the altcoin market finally breaking its losing streak. Altcoins collectively secured $33 million in inflows, a welcome change after four consecutive weeks of outflows totaling a staggering $1.7 billion. Leading this altcoin resurgence were: Ethereum (ETH): $14.5 million Solana (SOL): $7.8 million XRP: $4.8 million Sui (SUI): $4.0 million This marks the first week in over a month that altcoins have seen positive flows, indicating renewed investor confidence in Layer-1 ecosystems and payment-focused tokens. Across the Globe: Where is the Crypto Money Flowing? The positive trend was not confined to a single region; major players across the globe contributed to the inflows: United States: $204 million Switzerland: $14.7 million Germany: $9.2 million Minor outflows were registered in: Hong Kong: $2.1 million Brazil: $1.3 million Navigating macroeconomic uncertainty The recent inflows offer a glimmer of hope that investor sentiment is turning cautiously optimistic. However, macroeconomic headwinds, particularly inflation data and Federal Reserve policy, continue to cast a shadow over the short-term outlook. If this positive momentum can be sustained, altcoins could extend their recovery, and Bitcoin could establish a stable position above current levels. A sustained recovery would indicate the continued strength of institutional interest in the overall digital asset class.

ETH is now consolidating and facing key hurdles near the $1,850 level. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $1,980 resistance level. The price is trading below $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,850 and $1,880 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,050 and started another decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,880 and $1,850 support levels. It tested the $1,765 zone. A low was formed at $1,767 and the price recently started a short-term recovery wave . The price climbed above the $1,800 resistance. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $1,860 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,850 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,860 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,900 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. A clear move above the $1,900 resistance might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. An upside break above the $2,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,800 level. The first major support sits near the $1,780 zone. A clear move below the $1,780 support might push the price toward the $1,765 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,710 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,665. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI ‚Äì The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

This comes despite the market‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent challenges, having plummeted 25% from its all-time high in January of this year. Interestingly, this latest acquisition marks the largest in terms of tokens for Strategy in 2025. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings To $43.4 Billion Since late October, Strategy has engaged in a series of nearly weekly purchases, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to approximately $43.4 billion. Remarkably, this amount represents about 2.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be issued. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Strategy acquired 22,048 Bitcoin at an average price of roughly $86,969 each between March 24 and March 30. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Confirms Breakout From Ascending Triangle, Target Set At $7,800 This purchase is part of a larger trend for the company, which has actively sought to bolster its Bitcoin reserves. In the first quarter alone, Strategy spent approximately $7.79 billion on Bitcoin, with the next largest acquisition earlier this year totaling 20,356 Bitcoin, announced on February 24. To finance this latest purchase, Strategy utilized proceeds raised through its at-the-market sales program for common shares, as well as offerings of preferred shares. This financing approach has proven successful, as the common shares of Strategy have surged nearly 2,200% since Saylor began investing the company‚Äôs cash into Bitcoin in 2020. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin itself has seen an increase of over 600%. Market Indicators Signal Potential BTC Recovery Bitcoin, on the other hand, is currently attempting to consolidate above the critical support level of $80,000 after experiencing a decline toward $76,000 for the first time since November 2024. Despite this recent drop, indicators suggest potential for further price recovery in the near term. Recent research from analysis firm CryptoQuant highlights the significance of Binance‚Äôs spot trading volume in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, in early 2025, when Binance‚Äôs volume surpassed that of all other exchanges combined, Bitcoin was experiencing a surge toward new all-time highs of $109,000. The Binance vs. Other Exchanges BTC Spot Volume Delta indicator has turned positive again, indicating that Binance‚Äôs trading volume is consistently outpacing that of its competitors. Related Reading: Ethereum To $20K? Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key The last time this trend was observed, BTC was trading around $42,000 before climbing to $73,000. Historically, periods of heightened Binance volume have been associated with bullish market sentiment, suggesting that traders may view Binance‚Äôs dominance as a positive signal for Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. It is also worth noting that at the beginning of 2024, Binance‚Äôs volume was reported to be 19 times greater than Coinbase‚Äôs. Although this disparity has decreased to eight times, it still highlights Binance‚Äôs significant leadership in the market. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs analysis, the ongoing strength of Binance as a trading platform will likely play a crucial role in shaping market dynamics as Bitcoin seeks to regain its footing above the $80,000 mark.

His family‚Äôs increasing involvement in crypto ventures, including memecoins and stablecoins, is now being cited as a significant complicating factor in the already intricate landscape of crypto regulation . This unexpected intersection of celebrity, politics, and digital assets is raising eyebrows and creating legislative hurdles on Capitol Hill. Is Trump‚Äôs crypto gamble about to reshape the future of digital currency laws? Trump‚Äôs Crypto Ventures Cast Shadow on Crypto Legislation Rep. French Hill (R-AR), a key figure in bipartisan efforts to establish clear crypto legislation , has openly voiced concerns about the challenges posed by Trump‚Äôs burgeoning crypto portfolio. According to a recent report by Decrypt, Hill stated that these ventures are muddying the waters when it comes to achieving consensus on Capitol Hill. This couldn‚Äôt come at a more critical time, especially with pivotal bills like the STABLE Act poised to be reviewed by Congress this week. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why Trump‚Äôs crypto activities are causing legislative headaches: Conflict of Interest Concerns: With Trump‚Äôs family directly benefiting from crypto ventures, questions arise about potential conflicts of interest when shaping cryptocurrency policy . Critics argue that personal financial gains could influence political decision-making, undermining the impartiality needed for effective regulation. Erosion of Bipartisan Support: The already fragile bipartisan consensus on crypto regulation is further strained. Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have been vocal in their criticism, labeling Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures a ‚Äúgrift.‚Äù This sharp rhetoric can deepen partisan divides and make finding common ground on complex issues like the STABLE Act even harder. Increased Scrutiny and Delays: The controversy surrounding Trump crypto ventures is likely to lead to increased scrutiny of any crypto-related bills. Lawmakers might become more cautious, potentially delaying the progress of crucial legislation as they navigate the ethical and political implications of regulating an industry so closely tied to a prominent political figure. The STABLE Act and the Shadow of Trump Crypto The timing of this controversy is particularly sensitive. The STABLE Act, a significant piece of proposed crypto legislation aimed at clarifying the regulatory framework for stablecoins, is heading to Congress this week.

But what happens when the very images we rely on for verification can no longer be trusted? OpenAI‚Äôs latest marvel, the ChatGPT 4o model, has unveiled a stunningly realistic AI image generator that‚Äôs raising eyebrows and sparking serious concerns. While designed to enhance creative possibilities, this powerful tool is proving to be exceptionally adept at creating incredibly convincing fake receipts . This development adds a potent new weapon to the arsenal of those seeking to exploit the digital realm, potentially ushering in a new era of sophisticated AI fraud and deepfakes . The Dawn of Realistic AI-Generated Receipts: How Good is ChatGPT 4o? This month marked the arrival of ChatGPT 4o, boasting a significantly improved AI image generator capable of embedding text within images with unprecedented realism. Social media quickly buzzed with demonstrations of its capabilities, but one particular application caught the attention of many: the generation of fake receipts . Deedy Das, a prominent VC and social media figure, showcased on X a fabricated receipt for a well-known San Francisco steakhouse, created entirely using ChatGPT 4o. His post highlighted a stark reality: ‚ÄúYou can use 4o to generate fake receipts. There are too many real world verification flows that rely on ‚Äòreal images‚Äô as proof. That era is over.‚Äù ChatGPT 4o can generate receipts now. You can use 4o to generate fake receipts. There are too many real world verification flows that rely on ‚Äúreal images‚Äù as proof. That era is over. pic.twitter.com/9FORS1PWsb ‚Äî Deedy (@deedydas) March 29, 2025 Others were quick to experiment, achieving similarly impressive results. Michael Gofman even refined the output, adding realistic food and drink stains to enhance the authenticity of his fake receipt , demonstrating the ease with which these AI-generated images can be manipulated to appear even more genuine. I think in the original image the letters are too perfect and they don‚Äôt bend with the paper. They look like hovering above the paper. Here is my attempt to make it more realistic. Let me know what you think. pic.twitter.com/EixRSHubeY ‚Äî Michael Gofman (@michaelgofman) March 29, 2025 Bitcoin World‚Äôs own investigation uncovered an even more convincing example originating from France, where a LinkedIn user showcased a crumpled, AI-generated receipt for a local restaurant chain. Intrigued, we put ChatGPT 4o to the test, successfully generating a fake receipt for an Applebee‚Äôs in San Francisco. However, our initial attempt wasn‚Äôt flawless. Subtle giveaways, such as the use of a comma instead of a period in the total and basic math errors, hinted at its artificial origin. While Large Language Models (LLMs) still grapple with arithmetic precision, these imperfections are easily rectified. A fraudster could swiftly correct these minor discrepancies using readily available photo editing software or by refining their prompts to the AI image generator . The Alarming Potential for AI Fraud: What are the Risks? The ease with which realistic fake receipts can now be generated presents significant opportunities for AI fraud . Imagine the implications: Expense Reimbursement Scams: Bad actors could effortlessly create fake receipts to claim reimbursements for fictitious expenses, targeting businesses and organizations. Insurance Fraud: Altered or entirely fabricated receipts could be used to inflate insurance claims, defrauding insurance companies. Tax Evasion: Fake receipts could be employed to create false records for tax deductions or to mask illicit transactions. E-commerce Scams: Fraudulent sellers could generate fake receipts to deceive buyers into believing items have been shipped or transactions completed. The potential for misuse is vast, and the implications for digital trust are profound. As verification processes increasingly rely on digital images, the ability to easily fabricate them undermines the integrity of these systems. OpenAI‚Äôs Response: Creative Freedom vs. Responsible AI Development In response to Bitcoin World‚Äôs inquiries, OpenAI spokesperson Taya Christianson stated that all images generated by ChatGPT include metadata indicating their AI origin. She added that OpenAI actively ‚Äútakes action‚Äù against users violating its usage policies and is committed to ‚Äúalways learning‚Äù from real-world applications and user feedback. When questioned about why ChatGPT permits the generation of fake receipts in the first place, particularly given OpenAI‚Äôs policies against fraud, Christianson explained that their ‚Äúgoal is to give users as much creative freedom as possible.‚Äù She suggested that AI-generated receipts could have legitimate, non-fraudulent applications, such as ‚Äúteaching people about financial literacy,‚Äù creating original art, and developing product advertisements. Navigating the Deepfake Era: Can We Still Trust Digital Images? The rise of sophisticated AI image generators like ChatGPT 4o forces us to confront a critical question: In a world where digital images can be so easily manipulated, can we still rely on them as proof? The ability to create convincing deepfakes , including fake receipts , challenges the very foundation of digital verification. While OpenAI emphasizes creative freedom and responsible use, the potential for malicious exploitation is undeniable. As technology advances, developing robust methods for detecting and mitigating AI fraud and deepfakes becomes increasingly crucial to maintaining trust in the digital age.

The network is struggling with dwindling demand and a shrinking user base, signaling deeper structural weaknesses. If the critical $130 support breaks, SOL could tumble toward $100‚Äîa psychological low last seen in broader market corrections. Meanwhile, Kaspa has surged 42% in March, making another run at the elusive $0.10 mark. But its trajectory depends on maintaining support and smashing through its long-standing resistance‚Äîstill a tough technical challenge. BlockDAG , however, isn‚Äôt playing the market‚Äôs short-term swings‚Äîit‚Äôs laying the foundation for sustained growth. Keynote 3 introduced the BlockDAG Academy, a structured learning hub catering to developers from beginners to advanced levels. This isn‚Äôt just for show‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategy to expand the ecosystem for years to come. Solana Price Forecast: Breaking Below $130 Could Trigger a Drop to $100 Solana‚Äôs rally has lost steam, with SOL currently trading at $131 after failing to crack the $146.5 resistance. This level aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the daily chart, a rejection that typically signals a continuation of downward momentum. If selling pressure intensifies, SOL could revisit $110 or even plunge to the psychological $100 level. Adding to the bearish case, Solana‚Äôs network activity is fading, with daily active addresses and transaction volumes in decline. This dip in demand is affecting both DeFi participation and meme coin trading, worsening the negative sentiment. Indicators like the MACD and RSI are also cooling off, reinforcing the downside risk. On the short-term chart, SOL is attempting to hold the $130 support, but this bounce may be temporary. Short-sellers could use this opportunity to enter positions near the 23.6% or 38.2% Fibonacci retracement levels. With market sentiment still leaning toward ‚ÄòFear,‚Äô SOL‚Äôs next move could determine whether a $100 test is imminent. Kaspa‚Äôs 42% Surge in March: Can It Break $0.10? Kaspa (KAS) has climbed 42% from its March 11 low of $0.056, fueling speculation of a potential trend reversal. The coin is now facing resistance near $0.10, aligning with the descending wedge pattern and key Fibonacci retracement levels. A decisive breakout above $0.107 could confirm a shift into bullish territory, signaling the start of a sustained uptrend. Momentum indicators like the RSI have recovered from oversold conditions, strengthening the case for further gains. However, if Kaspa fails to break resistance, it could retrace toward the $0.0485 region. For now, traders are watching the $0.078‚Äì$0.080 support range closely. Kaspa‚Äôs ability to push past $0.10 will determine its next big move. If volume remains strong and the market structure holds, the breakout could unlock another wave of upward momentum. BlockDAG Goes Beyond Fundraising‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Creating the Future of Web3 What truly sets BlockDAG apart from other Layer 1 projects is its proactive approach. Keynote 3 introduced the BlockDAG Academy, a structured program designed to cultivate the next generation of developers, Web3 pioneers, and blockchain innovators. While many crypto projects rely on hype, BlockDAG is methodically building a self-sustaining ecosystem. By training developers at every level‚Äîbeginners to advanced smart contract engineers‚Äîit ensures more dApps, greater utility, and long-term value for the BDAG coin. With funding mechanisms such as grants and global hackathons, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just another blockchain‚Äîit‚Äôs shaping the future of Web3 development. This approach supports its ambitious $600M presale target by driving demand beyond speculation. BlockDAG‚Äôs numbers speak volumes: $209.5 million raised, 19 billion BDAG sold, and over 800K app users. Currently in Batch 27 at $0.0248, early adopters still have a limited window to join. The BlockDAG Academy isn‚Äôt just a side project‚Äîit‚Äôs a growth catalyst that‚Äôs already in motion. Final Thoughts Solana‚Äôs inability to clear key resistance levels, combined with declining user engagement, adds to its bearish outlook. Kaspa‚Äôs impressive 42% rally shows promise, but until it successfully breaks past major resistance, it remains a high-risk play. BlockDAG, on the other hand, isn‚Äôt relying on price speculation to fuel its rise. The BlockDAG Academy‚Äînow fully operational‚Äîintroduces an entirely new dimension to its roadmap: a direct pipeline for developer talent, dApp creation, and real-world adoption. With over 19 billion BDAG sold and upcoming exchange listings, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just attracting volume‚Äîit‚Äôs generating it. Unlike most projects that raise capital first and build later, BlockDAG is delivering hardware, software, and education before its mainnet even launches. The momentum is already in motion‚Äîand it‚Äôs only getting started.

A 15-day upward streak, RSI reclaiming 50, and a decisive break past $2.45 point to renewed bullish sentiment, with a potential push toward $3.25. This momentum is reinforced by real catalysts like Canary Capital‚Äôs ETF filing and the SUI Overflow Hackathon, keeping investor enthusiasm alive. Meanwhile, HBAR is showing strength, with a Double Bottom pattern and climbing open interest signaling a potential rally toward $0.504. On-chain data supports further gains, fueled by key developments such as the USD1 stablecoin launch and SWIFT integration trials. While both tokens show promise in the short term, BlockDAG is shaping something much larger. Announced during Keynote 3, its ambition to power 1,000+ dApps by 2026 isn‚Äôt just a vision‚Äîit‚Äôs a structured path toward mass adoption. With WASM + EVM compatibility, a $209.5M presale, and over 19 billion coins sold, BDAG is aligning strong fundamentals with developer-centric tools. SUI‚Äôs 15-Day Rally Hints at a Bullish Breakout in April SUI is staging a strong comeback after a steep 64% decline from its January peak of $5.37. Finding support at $2.30, the token has been steadily climbing for 15 days. This rally is backed by catalysts such as Canary Capital‚Äôs ETF filing and the SUI Overflow Hackathon, both of which have reignited investor confidence. Technical analysis backs the bullish case. The MACD has turned positive, and RSI has surpassed 50 for the first time since January‚Äôs drop. Additionally, SUI has broken past a descending trendline and cleared resistance at $2.45, with the next key level at $3.25‚Äîa critical Fibonacci retracement zone and a long-standing resistance point. Should SUI successfully breach $3.25, the next target sits at $3.65. With positive sentiment shaping the market, SUI appears ready for a strong move if overall conditions remain supportive. HBAR‚Äôs Breakout in Sight? Traders Eye a 144% Surge to $0.504 HBAR is gathering momentum, with analysts predicting a potential surge to $0.504‚Äîequivalent to a 144% rally from its current price. A Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart supports this outlook, with resistance at $0.1968 being the key hurdle. A successful break above this level could propel HBAR to $0.40, and with sustained momentum, even $0.962. Technical signals reinforce the bullish narrative. RSI is climbing toward 50, while MACD has triggered a bullish crossover. Additionally, open interest has jumped 5% within 24 hours, reaching $101.8 million, signaling growing trader optimism. On-chain metrics show increasing net purchases and rising trading volume, further strengthening the breakout case. Institutional backing, including Hedera‚Äôs USD1 stablecoin launch and SWIFT blockchain trial initiatives, adds credibility to HBAR‚Äôs long-term growth prospects. Investors are closely watching the $0.504 level as a decisive turning point. BlockDAG‚Äôs 1,000+ dApp Strategy Positions BDAG for Explosive Growth BlockDAG‚Äôs Keynote 3 revealed an ambitious target: supporting over 1,000 decentralized applications (dApps) by 2026. This isn‚Äôt just a marketing claim‚Äîit represents a tangible plan to establish BlockDAG as a leading Layer 1 network. Its ecosystem aims to power DeFi projects, NFT platforms, real-world payment solutions, gaming applications, and even AI-driven systems. Equipped with EVM compatibility, WASM support, and user-friendly tools like the Token & NFT Wizard, BlockDAG is designed for seamless developer onboarding. This initiative is set to drive ecosystem engagement, fuel transaction volume, and significantly boost BDAG token utility. With a live Beta Testnet and more than 100 active nodes, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just outlining a vision‚Äîit‚Äôs already executing it. By Batch 27, its presale had soared past $209.5 million, with BDAG priced at $0.0248 and over 19 billion coins sold. As these 1,000+ dApps roll out, BlockDAG will evolve from a blockchain project into a thriving digital economy. The race to secure early positions is heating up. Final Thoughts SUI appears on track to surpass $3.25, while HBAR‚Äôs technical setup suggests a 144% rally could be on the horizon. However, both rely heavily on short-term trends and niche applications. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is laying the groundwork for a decentralized financial network. Its mission to host 1,000+ dApps isn‚Äôt just speculation‚Äîit‚Äôs an active strategy backed by innovative tools like the NFT Wizard, developer grants, and seamless WASM-EVM deployment. Add in a live Beta Testnet, a rapidly growing community, and upcoming listings on 10 centralized exchanges, and it‚Äôs clear BlockDAG is evolving beyond a simple Layer 1 solution‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a full-scale crypto economy.

Over the years, North Korea has been tied to high-profile cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, with stolen money believed to be used to finance the country‚Äôs military and nuclear‚ÄÇprograms. The United Nations estimated North Korea stole about $3 billion in crypto hacks from 2017 to 2023. However, in just 2024 and 2025 alone, they have already plundered a record $1.7 billion from two of the largest exchanges, WazirX and Bybit. Hackers use fake job offers to steal crypto, putting millions of users at risk There are several factions of North Korean hackers, each specializing in different kinds of cyberattacks. The most infamous one is the Lazarus Group, which has a history of targeting financial institutions and digital asset exchanges. Other groups, such as AppleJeus , Dangerous Password, and Spinout, use different methods (e.g., phishing attacks, fake job offers, malware masquerading as genuine software). The most shocking attack to date took place in February 2025, when crypto exchange Bybit was hacked for $1.5 billion ‚Äî the largest cryptocurrency hack to date. While it was first considered to be a phishing scheme, an in-depth investigation revealed that the exploit was based on a much more advanced strategy. The hackers, from North Korea‚Äôs Reconnaissance General Bureau, had stealthily compromised Safe{Wallet}, a digital wallet system used by many Bybit users, rather than launching an attack directly against the exchange. They infiltrated a backdoor into the software, letting them siphon cash without immediately being noticed. This method was far more sophisticated. Rather than targeting exchanges, it targeted the infrastructure supporting crypto exchanges. Once they steal the cryptocurrency, the hackers launder it and evade detection using off-the-shelf, well-established techniques. They first divide the loot into smaller amounts, pass them through hundreds of digital wallets, and eventually turn them into Bitcoin (BTC). This tactic makes it harder for authorities to trace the money. According to the security firm Chainalysis, Lazarus Group tends to hold stolen money for months, years, and even before spending it, maximizing its chances of avoiding detection. The FBI has identified three alleged members of the Lazarus Group and accused them of cybercrimes. In February 2021, the US Justice Department indicted two of those members for involvement in global cybercrimes. Yet, despite such efforts, North Korean hackers and cybercriminals have continued to adapt and find new methods for interfering with financial systems. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2.215 swing high to the $2.023 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.150 level. The next resistance is $2.1680. A clear move above the $2.1680 resistance might send the price toward the $2.20 resistance.

However, the cryptocurrency has struggled over the past week, closing in the red during six of the last seven daily trading sessions. This weakness comes amid a broader slump in the crypto market, where falling prices and investor uncertainty have put pressure on most digital assets. Currently, XRP‚Äôs price chart reveals a tug-of-war between bearish and bullish signals across different timeframes. On the 3-day chart, a strong bearish divergence remains active. This shows that although XRP‚Äôs price has been moving, the momentum behind those moves is not as strong as it appears. The situation has not changed significantly in the past day, suggesting that bearish pressure is still prevalent. Bullish Divergence Emerging on the 8-Hour Chart In contrast, the 8-hour chart shows signs of a bullish divergence. While XRP‚Äôs price has been posting lower lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI)‚Äîa key momentum indicator‚Äîhas been forming higher lows. This pattern suggests that despite the price declines, underlying momentum is strengthening. A stronger bounce in the RSI over the next day would provide additional confirmation of this potential reversal. For the short term, sideways price action is expected, with a slight bullish bias. Historical patterns suggest that such setups often lead to either modest upward moves followed by consolidation or, in favorable conditions, more significant bullish rallies. XRP‚Äôs price movements remain closely tied to Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. Unless Bitcoin experiences a substantial bullish breakout, XRP‚Äôs potential for a major price surge appears limited in the near term. Key support levels are identified between $1.95 and $2.05, where buying interest is likely to emerge if the price dips. Resistance is expected between $2.24 and $2.30, a zone where selling pressure tends to intensify.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 04:53:28

Speaking in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said the current regulations place an unfair burden on automakers and pledged to revisit the policy adopted during his first term in office. Trump revealed he discussed the matter with John Elkann, chairman of Stellantis NV, which owns Chrysler. During their meeting, the two talked about environmental regulations and how they affect car manufacturing. Trump told reporters the country will ‚Äúprobably‚Äù return to the emission levels applied in 2020. He said that the discussion revolved around. ‚Äúsome of the problems they have with the environment, which we‚Äôre going to clean up.‚Äù Trump announces going back to 2020 emission standards. Source: Real America‚Äôs Voice The president argued that Biden‚Äôs more rigorous standards do not ‚Äúmean a damn bit of difference for the environment‚Äù yet make car production very difficult. Under the previous policy favored by Trump, greenhouse gas pollution from passenger vehicles would be capped at 204 grams per mile for cars and 284 grams per mile for light trucks. That 2020 baseline was set to continue under an EPA plan proposed in Trump‚Äôs first term, but Biden later replaced it with rules that require 170 grams of carbon dioxide per mile in 2027 and only 85 grams per mile in 2032. Automakers have been pressed to expand their electric vehicle (EV) offerings under Biden‚Äôs standards. Trump has often criticized that approach, calling it an EV mandate because of how it forces manufacturers to focus on zero-emission models to meet the stricter limits. Environmental groups counter that major cuts in greenhouse gas pollution are needed to slow global warming, and they note the transportation sector remains the biggest source of these emissions in the United States. Trump says his approach is more manageable for carmakers while being environmentally friendly On Monday, Trump defended his preferred approach as both environmentally friendly and manageable for industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be bringing it back to a standard that is a very good environmental standard, but it makes it possible to build a car,‚Äù he said. He emphasized that 2020‚Äôs requirements were already robust enough without threatening vehicle production. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency have yet to comment. Trump has also instructed the agency to scrap what he calls the ‚Äúelectric vehicle mandate,‚Äù and the EPA has begun rolling back various environmental measures tied to Biden-era efforts. If Trump follows through, the return to these weaker emission rules would mark a significant shift away from the stricter guidelines meant to curb global warming.

Additionally, ETH is showing signs of bullish divergence on the daily chart, raising optimism among holders that a rally may be closer than expected. Ethereum Must Overcome These Levels For Further Upside Unlike rival cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP, ETH‚Äôs recent price action has disappointed most of its holders. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is down 49.2% over the past year, in stark contrast to BTC‚Äôs 18.5% gain over the same period. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Breaking Free from the Bear Trap? Analysts Weigh In Sharing the following daily chart, Martinez highlighted two critical resistance levels that ETH must surpass to reverse its price trajectory. The analyst stated: Ethereum $ETH needs to reclaim $2,100, and more decisively, $2,300, to confirm a bullish trend reversal. These are the levels to watch! To recall, ETH last traded at the $2,100 level earlier this month on March 9. Interestingly, the digital asset also plunged to as low as $1,754 on the same day, its lowest price in more than a year. After reclaiming $2,100, ETH will need to overcome the more significant $2,300 resistance level. A clear breakout above $2,300 could signal renewed bullish momentum. Meanwhile, altcoin analyst @altcoinrookie shared a bearish forecast for Ethereum, predicting that ETH will dip to $1,200 by June 2025 before reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). ETH Showing Signs Of Bullish Divergence While these analyses suggest short- to mid-term challenges for ETH, crypto trader Merlijn The Trade provided a more optimistic outlook. The analyst shared the following ETH daily chart, noting that the asset is displaying bullish divergence. For the uninitiated, the RSI is a momentum indicator that helps traders and investors to determine when the underlying asset may be overbought or oversold. RSI bullish divergence occurs when the RSI forms higher lows while the price forms lower lows, indicating weakening selling pressure and a potential trend reversal to the upside. Related Reading: Ethereum Gained 160% The Last Time This On-Chain Indicator Flashed ‚Äì Will ETH Soar Again? The trader further pointed out that although ETH‚Äôs price continues to make lower lows, its daily RSI is forming a contrasting trend. Merlijn also shared a two-week ETH price chart, highlighting how Ethereum has historically rebounded from a critical support level since early 2024, often posting significant returns after each bounce. That said, rising ETH reserves on crypto exchanges remain a concern, potentially extending ETH‚Äôs price suppression. At press time, ETH trades at $1,840, up 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Code vulnerabilities accounted for the most losses, at over $14 million, while wallet compromises were used to steal over $8 million, blockchain security firm CertiK said in an April 1 post to X. The most significant loss for the month was the $13 million March 25 smart contract exploit of the decentralized lending protocol Abracadabra.money. After accounting for returned funds, a total of $28.8 million was stolen through exploits, hacks and scams in March. Source: CertiK In a separate March 27 report, the blockchain security firm said , ‚ÄúThe attacker was able to borrow funds, liquidate themselves, then borrow funds again without repaying them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis was due to the liquidation process not overwriting records in RouterOrder that counted as collateral, allowing the exploiter to falsely borrow additional funds after liquidation,‚Äù CertiK said. The protocols team has offered a 20% bounty, double the standard 10%, in exchange for the return of the funds, according to CertiK. So far, no public updates have been given on whether any funds have been returned. The second highest monthly loss was restaking protocol Zoth after its deployer wallet was compromised and the attacker withdrew over $8.4 million in crypto assets. March crypto losses reduced after hacker returned some funds Some of the stolen funds in March were returned. In total, CertiK says over $33 million was stolen for the month, but decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch successfully recovered most of the $5 million stolen in a March 5 exploit after negotiating a bug bounty agreement with the attacker. The total figures, however, exclude an unknown Coinbase user who crypto sleuth ZachXBT claims lost 400 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth $34 million.

While Bitcoin‚Äôs year-to-date return reflects an 11.44% loss, and the asset is down nearly 25% from its all-time high, Wainwright says the recent post-acceleration phase performance is in line with BTC‚Äôs average drawdowns when compared to previous market cycles. Bitcoin historical downside after acceleration phases. Source: Fidelity Digital Assets Research Wainwright suggests that Bitcoin is still in an acceleration phase but is moving closer to the completion of the cycle, as March 3 represented day 232 of the period. Previous peaks lasted slightly longer before a corrective period set in. ‚ÄúThe acceleration phase of 2010 - 2011, 2015, and 2017 reached their tops on day 244, 261, 280, respectively, suggesting a slightly more drawn-out phase each cycle.‚Äù Related: MARA Holdings plans huge $2B stock offering to buy more Bitcoin Is another parabolic rally on the cards for Bitcoin? Bitcoin price has languished below $100,000 since Feb. 21, and a good deal of the momentum and positive sentiment that comprised the ‚ÄúTrump trade‚Äù has dissipated and been replaced by tariff-war-induced volatility and the markets‚Äô fear that the US could be heading into a recession. Despite these overhanging factors and the negative impact they‚Äôve had on day-to-day Bitcoin prices, large entities continue to add to their BTC stockpiles. On March 31, Strategy CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had acquired 22,048 BTC ($1.92 billion) at an average price of $86,969 per Bitcoin. On the same day, Bitcoin miner MARA revealed plans to sell up to $2 billion in stock to acquire more BTC ‚Äúfrom time to time.‚Äù Following in the footsteps of larger-cap companies, Japanese firm Metaplanet issued 2 billion yen ($13.3 million) in bonds on March 31 to buy more Bitcoin, and the largest news of March came from GameStop announcing a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering , a portion of which could be used to purchase Bitcoin. The recent buying and statements of intent to buy from a variety of international and US-based publicly listed companies show a price-agnostic approach to accumulating BTC as a reserve asset, and it highlights the positive future price exceptions held among institutional investors. While it is difficult to determine the impact of institutional investor Bitcoin purchases on BTC price, Wainwright said that a metric to keep an eye on is the number of days during a rolling 60-day period when the cryptocurrency hits a new all-time high. Wainwright posted the following chart and said, ‚ÄúBitcoin has typically experienced two major surges within previous Acceleration Phases, with the first instance of this cycle‚Äôs following the election.

They‚Äôre setting the stage for one of the most exciting meme coin seasons of 2025. BONK is reigniting the love for dog-themed tokens with its Solana-native charm. DOGS is flexing hard on Telegram thanks to the viral appeal of Spotty, its VK-born meme mascot. But stealing the spotlight right now? BTFD Coin‚Äîwith numbers that are making traders, bankers, and crypto bros do double takes. Meme coins aren‚Äôt just comic relief anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre cultural assets with real investor interest. From the rise of Dogecoin to community-fueled moonshots like PEPE, this sector has only grown stronger. BTFD Coin is taking that meme coin momentum and turning it into something with long-term teeth. With a full P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, a jaw-dropping 90% APY staking model, and 11,700 bulls running wild, this meme coin isn‚Äôt playing around. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs being called one of the top ICO presale projects to watch. BTFD Coin‚Äôs $6.45M Raise and 90% APY Make It a Top ICO Presale Star Is this the perfect dip to invest? BTFD Coin might just be that once-in-a-cycle shot. The presale is sitting at Stage 15, priced at $0.0002, with over 72 billion tokens sold and $6.45 million already raised. And with just one stage left, the time to run with the bulls is now. Once the presale ends, it lists at $0.0006, and if analysts are right, the moon price of $0.006 could deliver a wild 2900% ROI. That alone qualifies BTFD as one of the top ICO presale contenders this year. The game-changer? BTFD‚Äôs 90% APY on staking . That‚Äôs right‚Äîinvestors can earn nearly double just by locking in their BTFD tokens. Imagine scooping up 25 million BTFD coins for $5,000 at $0.0002. When the listing hits $0.0006, that flips into $15,000. But if BTFD surges to the $0.006 moon price like analysts predict, that same bag could become $150,000. Stack on the APY from staking and the numbers speak for themselves. Buying BTFD is also refreshingly simple. Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and head to the meme coin presale site . Connect your wallet, choose your investment, confirm, and you‚Äôre in. Once the presale wraps, claim your tokens, stake them, and let those 90% APY rewards roll in. The Bulls Squad is already doing it‚Äîwhy not join them? From American traders to Gen Z meme lovers and even retail investors, everyone‚Äôs eyeing this presale. It‚Äôs the combo of staking potential, play-to-earn integration, and meme-driven branding that‚Äôs making BTFD not just popular but profitable. With analysts forecasting a potential 2900% gain and only one stage left, there‚Äôs little debate‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the top ICO presale plays of 2025. BONK Brings Solana Back With Doge-Level Meme Energy Launched on Christmas Day 2022, BONK quickly carved out its lane as the first dog-themed meme coin built on Solana. But this wasn‚Äôt just another Doge clone. BONK flipped the script by airdropping 50% of its total supply to the Solana community, firing up engagement and pushing SOL itself up 34% in 48 hours. BONK‚Äôs doge-style branding didn‚Äôt just ride on nostalgia. It became a statement‚Äîa coin ‚Äúfor the people, by the people.‚Äù That grassroots buzz helped solidify BONK as one of the most exciting meme tokens to emerge from Solana‚Äôs ecosystem. Its post-launch growth and ability to spark a broader Solana rally gave it viral staying power. What sets BONK apart isn‚Äôt just the community drop. It‚Äôs the way it brings real network impact to Solana. BONK proved that the right meme coin can move ecosystems‚Äînot just charts. And with the spotlight back on meme tokens in 2025, BONK‚Äôs OG status keeps it relevant among the top meme coin watchlists for traders exploring fresh and established meme-driven projects. DOGS Finds Telegram Stardom Through Spotty the Mascot Telegram‚Äôs been the birthplace of countless meme moments, but DOGS is turning that influence into a full-on crypto movement. Inspired by Spotty, a mascot created by VK founder Pavel Durov during a charity auction, DOGS was launched in July 2024 and has rapidly become a symbol across social and crypto circles alike. What began as a doodle has become a badge of online identity. DOGS‚Äô strength lies in its relatability‚Äîborn from community, humor, and viral culture. The project didn‚Äôt go the traditional route, but instead rode the wave of organic virality through Telegram‚Äôs vast user base. DOGS is especially resonating with Native American and Asian crypto users on messaging platforms. The coin‚Äôs cultural roots and accessibility via Telegram make it a strong social-driven asset. As crypto continues to blend with Web3 social, DOGS is well-positioned to grow into something much bigger than a meme‚Äîand that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs being buzzed about in the same breath as the top meme coin names dominating the scene. Final Words Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, BONK, and DOGS represent three unique but equally viral facets of today‚Äôs meme coin explosion. Each has carved out a lane‚ÄîBONK through its Solana airdrop legacy, DOGS via a cultural mascot turned Telegram hit, and BTFD Coin with real utility and massive growth potential. With the BTFD Coin presale nearing its final stage, the window to score 25 million tokens at just $5K is closing fast. The projected $0.006 moon price and 90% APY on staking make it hard to ignore. Among all rising stars, BTFD stands tall as one of the top ICO presale gems of 2025. Own the dip. Stake your claim. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and start your bull run while there‚Äôs still time. FAQs What makes BTFD Coin one of the top ICO presale projects of 2025?

This historic round increased OpenAI‚Äôs value to $300 billion, which puts it among the most valuable private tech companies across the globe. This funding round was led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank which made an initial investment of $30 billion. Other new and existing investors include Microsoft, Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital and Thrive Capital among others. Stargate project takes center stage The largest amount, $18 billion, is allocated to Stargate, a plan unveiled in January by President Donald Trump. Stargate is a joint venture of OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, intended to build numerous large-scale data centers for AI computation in America. According to estimates, Stargate will require a total of $500 billion, which highlights the need for infrastructure to support rapidly developing AI tools. Stargate will receive $10 billion in investments, while another $30 billion will be targeted by the end of 2025. SoftBank plans to syndicate about $10 billion of the commitment to other yet unnamed investors. However, there is a condition related to the funding round: SoftBank‚Äôs total investment might be reduced to $20 billion in case OpenAI does not transform into a for-profit company by December 31 of this year. ChatGPT‚Äôs explosive growth The optimism towards OpenAI also grows from the rapid user adoption of its primary product, ChatGPT. The chatbot is reportedly reaching up to 500 million users weekly this month, up from 400 million the previous month. CEO Sam Altman noted this exponential growth trajectory in a post on X: ‚Äú The chatgpt launch 26 months ago was one of the craziest viral moments i‚Äôd ever seen.‚Äù the chatgpt launch 26 months ago was one of the craziest viral moments i'd ever seen, and we added one million users in five days. we added one million users in the last hour. ‚Äî Sam Altman (@sama) March 31, 2025 The recent increase in usage is also in line with the improvement in ChatGPT‚Äôs capabilities, especially in image generation. Redefining private tech investments Prior to OpenAI‚Äôs $40bn round, the biggest fundraising by a private tech company was completed by Ant Group at $14bn in 2018, Juul Labs at $12.8bn, and DiDi Global at $10.8bn. OpenAI secured $10 billion early in 2023, and Databricks followed by issuing its $10 billion in the same year. After this round of funding, OpenAI ranks behind only SpaceX, worth $350 billion, and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, at $300 billion per CB insights. OpenAI intends to spend the newly acquired funds strategically, focusing on the development of new AI technologies and the evolution of infrastructure scaling. The company predicts that it will generate revenue of about $12.7 billion by the end of the year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

But right now, the market is bleeding, and Bitcoin may drop below $80K, which has created panic in the market, especially for altcoins. The dump factor was Trump‚Äôs latest displeasure over the Russians‚Äô handling of the ceasefire. Already the market has suffered a lot with Trump‚Äôs dwindling Tariff war and his Bitcoin reserve plan , which failed to impress the investors. However, Ethereum is still moving in sync with riskier assets, but things aren‚Äôt looking great. Bloomberg‚Äôs senior commodity strategist, Mike McGlone, warns that if U.S. stocks keep falling, ETH could plunge to $1,000 this year. A climb back to $2,000 might be a sign of strength, but with Bitcoin already on shaky ground, altcoins could take an even bigger hit. Crypto‚Äôs Rocky Road Ahead McGlone points out that Bitcoin started in 2009 as a digital safe haven alongside gold and silver. Since then, it‚Äôs grown into a massive ecosystem, pulling Ethereum and other altcoins along with it. But the increasing speculation in crypto markets is raising red flags. When assets rely too much on hype and endless growth, regulators tend to step in‚Äîand that could put serious pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs future. Gold Shines While Crypto Struggles Unlike crypto, gold is having a stellar year. It‚Äôs up 26% in 2024, outperforming even the S&P 500. With inflation fears, global tensions, and investors looking for safer bets, gold has cemented itself as a reliable option. Meanwhile, the gold-to-copper ratio‚Äîoften a key signal for economic health‚Äîis climbing to levels not seen since 2009 and 2016. That could mean more economic trouble ahead. Where Does Ethereum Go From Here? For Ethereum, the road ahead isn‚Äôt clear. If economic conditions improve and risk assets bounce back, ETH might reclaim $2,000 . But if the market keeps tumbling, another steep drop could be coming. With Bitcoin already facing trouble, Ethereum investors are bracing for what comes next. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction For Next Three Months: $100000 When? , Crypto analyst Lekker Capital‚Äôs Quinn Thompson sees little chance that ETH will recover, calling it a ‚Äúdead investment‚Äù due to falling usage and fees.

Even with $4 billion in ETF inflows and the upcoming Pectra upgrade, BlackRock thinks staking-enabled ETH ETFs could be the real game-changer. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

April 1, 2025 05:34:35 UTC Coinbase CEO Pushes for Interest-Bearing Stablecoins Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says U.S. stablecoin laws need an upgrade.

The tech already exists to make it happen, but current laws haven‚Äôt caught up. Right now, stablecoins can‚Äôt legally pass on interest from their reserve assets to users because they don‚Äôt have the same exemptions as traditional securities.

The market had already priced in this move, as MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin buying strategy was well-known in advance. While Saylor is accumulating, other major players are cashing out after Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive 100% gain in 2024. Plus, $2 billion isn‚Äôt enough to move the needle in a $1.7‚Äì$2 trillion market. The bigger picture lies in global liquidity trends, which had been tightening.

Meanwhile, major corporations are doubling down on Bitcoin. Japanese firm Metaplanet issued $13.3 million in zero-interest bonds to fund further Bitcoin purchases. US-based Strategy also bought an additional 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion, bringing its total holdings to over 528,000 BTC. US Dollar May Lose Global Status to Bitcoin BlackRock CEO Larry Fink raised concerns that the United States could lose the US dollar‚Äôs global reserve currency status to Bitcoin or other digital assets if it fails to rein in its mounting national debt. In his Annual Chairman‚Äôs Letter to Investors , Fink talked about the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) as an extraordinary innovation that enhances market efficiency by making transactions faster, cheaper, and more transparent. However, he also warned that the same innovation could erode America's economic advantage if global investors begin to perceive Bitcoin as a safer and more reliable store of value than the US dollar. Fink‚Äôs warning came against the backdrop of a growing national debt crisis. According to Trading Economics , US debt amounted to 122.3% of GDP in 2023. This was a sharp increase from 105% in 2018. (Source: Larry Fink‚Äôs Letter to Investors ) Moody‚Äôs maintained the country‚Äôs AAA credit rating but changed its outlook to negative due to concerns over the fiscal trajectory. The Joint Economic Committee reported that as of early March 2025, the national debt stood at $36.2 trillion, growing at a pace of roughly $4.9 billion per day. The Bipartisan Policy Center also sounded the alarm, and projected that the US could default on its obligations as early as July 2025 if no action is taken. (Source: US Joint Economic Committee ) Thanks to these financial concerns, Bitcoin emerged as a safe haven asset for those looking to hedge against fiat currency risks like inflation and government debt. Some analysts suggest that the end of the US debt ceiling suspension could trigger a price surge for BTC. Others believe that fears surrounding America‚Äôs debt could accelerate mainstream Bitcoin adoption. In the same letter, Fink also mentioned his strong support for tokenization, and described it as a transformative force that could democratize finance. He argued that tokenizing assets will eliminate inefficiencies in current financial markets by enabling instant settlement and eliminating the need for excessive paperwork and waiting periods. This innovation could unlock billions of dollars that are currently trapped in settlement delays and reinvest them back into the economy. Fink explained that tokenization will improve access, streamline shareholder voting, and optimize yield generation. Currently, the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) market is valued at $19.6 billion, according to RWA.xyz . It includes around 93,000 asset holders and 174 issuers, with projections estimating that the market could balloon to between $4 trillion and $30 trillion by 2030. Metaplanet Wants to Buy More Bitcoin Many companies are already turning towards Bitcoin for economic growth and stability. Japanese firm Metaplanet recently strengthened its Bitcoin-focused strategy by issuing 2 billion Japanese yen, which is equivalent to $13.3 million, in zero-interest bonds to fund more Bitcoin purchases. According to a March 31 filing , the bonds were allocated through Metaplanet‚Äôs Evo Fund, with investors set to redeem the securities at their full face value by Sept. 30. The company‚Äôs CEO, Simon Gerovich, revealed in an X post that Metaplanet is capitalizing on Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price dip, with the cryptocurrency trading almost 20+% down from its all-time high of over $109,000. Metaplanet is currently recognized as Asia‚Äôs largest corporate Bitcoin holder and the tenth-largest in the world. The company holds approximately 3,200 BTC that is valued at around $1.23 billion. It is also often referred to as ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs MicroStrategy,‚Äù because the firm modeled its corporate strategy after US-based Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which is the world‚Äôs leading corporate Bitcoin holder. Metaplanet has been aggressively expanding its Bitcoin holdings over the past few months. Earlier in March, the firm bought 150 Bitcoin as part of its ambitious goal to accumulate 21,000 BTC by 2026. That purchase followed a $44 million Bitcoin acquisition earlier in the month, which triggered a 19% surge in Metaplanet‚Äôs stock price in less than a day. Additionally, the company shared plans to explore a potential US stock listing to make its shares more accessible to global investors. It made this announcement alongside another purchase of 156 BTC. Metaplanet is also making strategic moves to increase its influence in the global Bitcoin economy. In early March, the company appointed Eric Trump, son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly established strategic board of advisers . The company stated that Trump‚Äôs expertise in real estate, finance, and brand development, as well as his advocacy for digital assets, will help advance Metaplanet‚Äôs mission to become a global leader in the Bitcoin space. Strategy Buys Almost $2 Billion in Bitcoin Strategy also recently expanded its massive Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion, taking advantage of a recent dip in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. The acquisition was made at an average price of $86,969 per Bitcoin and was announced by the company‚Äôs co-founder, Michael Saylor, in a post on X on March 31. This latest purchase brings Strategy‚Äôs total Bitcoin holdings to over 528,000 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $35.63 billion at an average price of $67,458 per coin. The company is still the world‚Äôs largest corporate Bitcoin holder after crossing the 500,000 BTC milestone on March 24. Strategy‚Äôs unrealized profit on its Bitcoin holdings now exceeds $7.7 billion, which is¬†a gain of over 21%, according to data from Saylortracker . The company‚Äôs aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy is still taking place despite growing market concerns linked to an upcoming tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which is scheduled for April 2. The announcement is expected to outline reciprocal tariffs on top US trading partners, which could potentially impact inflation and investor sentiment toward risk assets like Bitcoin. Market analysts, however, see the recent price decline as a healthy correction rather than the end of the ongoing bull run. Andrei Grachev , managing partner of DWF Labs, pointed out that while markets tend to react strongly to tariff news and macroeconomic headlines, Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term fundamentals are still very much unchanged. In addition to market concerns, Strategy could soon face serious tax implications tied to its Bitcoin gains. Although the company has never sold any of its Bitcoin, it may owe taxes on its unrealized profits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The legislation introduced a corporate alternative minimum tax, applying a 15% rate based on adjusted earnings, which could affect Strategy‚Äôs tax liabilities. However, there is speculation that the US Internal Revenue Service may consider an exemption for Bitcoin under a Trump-led administration.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-01 05:28:55

As stated in a court filing on Monday, the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency has agreed to address the lawsuit alleging that he misled investors during his purchase of millions of dollars in Twitter stock in 2022, before acquiring the company. The SEC, under former chairman Gary Gensler, had filed a lawsuit in January 2025, accusing him of securities fraud related to his $44 billion takeover of Twitter, now known as X. The lawsuit alleges that Musk failed to timely disclose his ownership stake in Twitter before completing the purchase in 2022. According to the SEC, Musk‚Äôs failure to report his stake‚Äîwhich exceeded 5% of the company‚Äîbefore the March 24, 2022 deadline allowed him to undervalue the shares he acquired. Regulators claim this non-compliance resulted in Musk paying at least $150 million less than he should have for the shares purchased after his disclosure was due. The lawsuit states that Musk filed his ownership report after the deadline, causing Twitter‚Äôs stock price to surge 27% following the filing.

42734494,https://coinpaper.com/8299/trump-family-secures-majority-control-of-world-liberty-financial,1743485400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Trump Family Secures Majority Control of World Liberty Financial,https://coinpaper.com/8299/trump-family-secures-majority-control-of-world-liberty-financial,"US lawmakers are moving swiftly to establish a clearer regulatory framework for stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency market, following calls from President Donald Trump to provide more certainty for the growing digital asset industry. The legislative effort comes as the Trump family deepens its own involvement in the crypto sector, with direct financial interests in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, meme coins, NFTs, and recently announced Bitcoin mining operations. This intersection of policymaking and private sector engagement has added new layers of complexity to the ongoing discussions in Washington. Trump Family Consolidates Control Over World Liberty Financial Amid $550 Million Token Raise The Trump family is quietly tightening its grip over World Liberty Financial, the high-profile decentralized finance (DeFi) platform launched before Donald Trump's return to the presidency. According to a new report by Reuters, two of the project's original co-founders have been ousted from their leadership positions, paving the way for the Trump family to take full operational control over the ambitious crypto project. The move comes on the heels of World Liberty‚Äôs latest capital raise, in which the project secured an additional $250 million by selling more of its WLFI tokens. The token sale, conducted in January, saw the platform offer an additional 5% of the total WLFI token supply to investors after the first tranche of 20 billion tokens sold out in the days leading up to Inauguration Day. To date, World Liberty has generated $550 million through the sale of WLFI tokens to both US-based accredited investors and a global retail base of non-accredited buyers. Under the platform‚Äôs official documents, the Trump family stands to claim a substantial 75% of net revenue from these token sales, setting the stage for one of the largest financial windfalls ever associated with a political family‚Äôs venture into cryptocurrency. The project‚Äôs corporate restructuring now puts the Trump family firmly in the driver‚Äôs seat. In January, World Liberty launched a new parent company, WLF Holdco LLC, to oversee development of the WLF protocol. The holding company is majority-owned (60%) by DT Marks DeFi LLC ‚Äî an entity controlled by Trump family members. This restructuring resulted in the removal of co-founders Zak Folkman and Chase Herro as ‚Äùsole directors and members‚Äù of World Liberty Financial Inc., according to disclosures on the platform‚Äôs website. The site further confirms that the Trump family, via DT Marks DeFi LLC, now directly holds at least 22.5 billion WLFI tokens ‚Äî nearly a quarter of the maximum 100 billion token supply. When World Liberty was first unveiled in October 2024, the Trump family's involvement was more symbolic than operational, with Donald Trump himself named ‚ÄúChief Crypto Advocate‚Äù and his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. introduced as ‚ÄúWeb3 Ambassadors.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs youngest son, Barron Trump, was designated ‚ÄúChief DeFi Visionary.‚Äù Now, their roles have expanded far beyond titles. Eric Trump, in particular, is listed as a board manager of WLF Holdco LLC, solidifying the family's direct influence over the protocol‚Äôs development and treasury management. The project‚Äôs early contributors also include figures closely tied to Trump‚Äôs political and business circles. Zach Witkoff, son of former Trump Middle East envoy Steven Witkoff, is listed as a co-founder, along with Rich Teo, who previously co-founded blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos. The Trump family‚Äôs financial stake in World Liberty is far from minor. In addition to their 75% cut from token sale proceeds ‚Äî estimated at roughly $400 million of the $550 million raised so far ‚Äî Reuters reports that the family will be entitled to 60% of the protocol‚Äôs future revenues once the platform becomes fully operational. The terms leave just 5% of the raised funds earmarked for development, with the remaining shares allocated to early co-founders and contributors. World Liberty‚Äôs codebase, reportedly drawing heavily from open-source lending protocol Aave, is still under development. Two of its listed developers, Octavian Lojnita and Bogdan Purnavel, previously worked on Dough Finance ‚Äî an earlier DeFi project led by Folkman and Herro that collapsed after a major exploit. Despite concerns over the Trump family's sweeping financial interests, World Liberty has attracted significant capital from major crypto players. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that approximately 85,000 wallets participated in the two WLFI token sales, with over 70% of funds coming from large buyers spending at least $100,000 per wallet. One of the most notable participants is Tron founder Justin Sun, who purchased $75 million worth of WLFI tokens. The project has also established partnerships with Movement ‚Äî a scalable blockchain startup ‚Äî and Ondo Finance, a tokenization firm founded by former Goldman Sachs employees. Both companies have indicated plans to collaborate with World Liberty on blockchain infrastructure and tokenization initiatives. Additionally, World Liberty holds MOVE and ONDO tokens in its treasury, according to on-chain data. A Controversial DeFi Empire Since its inception, World Liberty has operated a large treasury of crypto assets. At its peak, the project controlled over $360 million in tokens, including major holdings in ETH, WBTC, USDT, and USDC. However, the project shocked observers when it liquidated over 90% of its crypto assets last year without clear explanation. It has since resumed buying back various digital assets, with current holdings exceeding $80 million. Several prominent voices in the crypto industry have raised concerns over the ethical and regulatory implications of World Liberty‚Äôs token sales and financial structure. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has previously cautioned that politicians launching token offerings or meme coins could use them as vehicles for influence-peddling, backdoor fundraising, or worse ‚Äî covert bribery. Despite mounting scrutiny, World Liberty shows no signs of slowing down. The project plans to launch its much-anticipated ‚Äùlend and borrow‚Äù DeFi market in the coming months, followed by the debut of a personal finance application designed to bring decentralized finance to mainstream users. Additionally, the team has revealed early plans to introduce a new stablecoin, USD1, which would be issued on both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks. The stablecoin would further expand the Trump family's influence in the DeFi space, adding a dollar-pegged product to World Liberty‚Äôs growing ecosystem. With $550 million in funding, high-profile investors, and political royalty at the helm, World Liberty Financial is shaping up to be one of the most controversial and closely watched projects in the decentralized finance sector ‚Äî a project where politics, money, and blockchain technology collide in unprecedented fashion. US Lawmakers Race to Pass Stablecoin and Crypto Market Structure Bills as Trump Pushes for Regulatory Clarity Meanwhile, US lawmakers are accelerating efforts to pass sweeping legislation that will finally establish clear rules for stablecoins and the broader digital asset market structure ‚Äî a regulatory push reportedly encouraged by President Trump himself. However, the legislative process is facing obstacles, not only from partisan disagreements but also from the growing and controversial involvement of the Trump family in the cryptocurrency space. Over the past several weeks, Capitol Hill has witnessed an intensified legislative sprint to bring two key bills to the president‚Äôs desk before the end of summer. The first, nicknamed the STABLE Act, focuses specifically on creating a framework for stablecoin issuers operating within US jurisdiction. The second aims to overhaul the country‚Äôs digital asset market structure, providing guidelines for exchanges, token classifications, and investor protections. Yet, as lawmakers make headway, Trump‚Äôs own crypto ventures are adding complexity to the process. During a press call on Monday, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R-Ark.) acknowledged the Trump family‚Äôs deepening engagement in the crypto industry. When asked by a reporter about the family‚Äôs involvement, which now includes investments in decentralized finance (DeFi), a meme coin empire, NFT collections, and ‚Äî as of Monday ‚Äî newly disclosed Bitcoin mining interests, Hill conceded that the Trump family's activities have made it harder for lawmakers to advance a neutral and balanced framework. One of the primary flashpoints is World Liberty Financial, the Trump-backed DeFi protocol that announced plans last week to launch its own stablecoin, dubbed USD1. The Trump family's direct financial interests in both the development of this stablecoin and other Web3 initiatives are prompting questions about potential conflicts of interest, particularly as the president publicly urges Congress to prioritize crypto legislation. Despite the political entanglements, the legislative machinery is moving forward. On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee will vote to amend and approve the STABLE Act, which seeks to establish baseline requirements for US dollar-pegged stablecoins. The bill includes provisions on how stablecoin issuers can operate at the state and federal level and introduces a two-year compliance window for foreign stablecoin issuers like Tether to meet US standards. Meanwhile, the Senate has already passed its version of stablecoin legislation, referred to as the GENIUS Act, earlier in March. The two versions differ primarily on regulatory treatment of foreign issuers and oversight responsibilities between state and federal agencies. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.), who leads the House Financial Services Committee‚Äôs digital asset panel, remarked that the two bills are ‚Äú80% aligned‚Äù and expressed optimism about reconciling the remaining differences. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, I think there‚Äôs recognition that we want to work with our Senate colleagues to get this across the line,‚Äù Steil said. Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at TD Cowen‚Äôs Washington Research Group, wrote in a note on Monday that he expects the House Financial Services Committee to pass the STABLE Act this spring, followed by a full House vote. The Senate is also likely to move forward with its stablecoin bill in the coming months, Seiberg added, predicting a final version could pass both chambers before the summer recess. A key sticking point will be how foreign stablecoins, particularly Tether's USDT ‚Äî the world's largest stablecoin by market cap ‚Äî are treated under the legislation. The legislation is poised to reshape not only how stablecoins operate in the US but also how foreign stablecoins interact with American markets. Lawmakers have long argued that a lack of clear regulatory oversight over stablecoins poses risks to financial stability, investor protection, and monetary policy enforcement. A Comprehensive Market Structure Framework Lawmakers are also working in parallel to pass a broader market structure bill that would regulate the issuance, trading, and classification of digital assets. Hill confirmed that a hearing on the House version of the market structure bill is scheduled for April 9. Both Hill and Steil stressed that the stablecoin and market structure bills are ‚Äúlinked‚Äù and essential to the future of US crypto regulation. President Trump himself is reportedly keen on seeing both pieces of legislation finalized and presented to him in the coming months, signaling a rare moment of bipartisan urgency on crypto regulation ‚Äî albeit clouded by questions surrounding the Trump family‚Äôs direct financial stake in the crypto industry. The crypto industry is watching developments closely. A clear and unified federal framework could unlock significant capital and institutional participation in the US crypto market, which has long been stifled by regulatory uncertainty and enforcement-driven oversight. However, the president‚Äôs overt involvement and the Trump family‚Äôs financial interests may complicate the narrative. Several lawmakers and commentators are raising ethical questions about whether the legislation is being shaped, directly or indirectly, to benefit private family interests. Still, with billions of dollars and the future of US crypto regulation hanging in the balance, the momentum toward passage of the STABLE Act and market structure legislation appears strong ‚Äî setting up what could be one of the most consequential crypto policy moments in US history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-01 05:30:00

Following the mainnet launch, Buterin was among the first to deposit ETH into the pool.

According to 0xbow, Privacy Pools had already processed more than 21 ETH from 69 deposits. The initial deposit cap is set at 1 ETH. However, as the system is tested further, the cap will be raised. In recent years, privacy tools have faced regulatory pressure due to concerns over illegal use. A major obstacle has been striking a balance between user privacy and legal compliance. Several countries have taken action to limit the use of privacy coins like Monero and Zcash due to their growing use in criminal activity. In the most well-known case, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions. However, a U.S. appeals court ruled in November 2024 that the sanctions were unlawful and reversed them. According to the court‚Äôs ruling, Tornado Cash‚Äôs immutable smart contracts do not qualify as ‚Äúproperty‚Äù that can be seized, and the penalties were unfairly imposed on a decentralized protocol. Whether 0xbow‚Äôs new strategy will meet global regulatory requirements is still unknown.

This would filter out low-effort inquiries and ensure that only serious requests get through. In his proposed model, if the KOL didn‚Äôt respond within five days, half of the fee would be refunded to the sender.

Its current DeFi coin price makes it appealing to investors looking for growth. Cardano Price: Stable Growth and ADA Price Forecasts Cardano, with its conservative approach and strong network, continues to generate interest. The latest Cardano news reports reveal that ADA has been growing steadily, but it may also face some challenges. Certain analysts have predicted Cardano Price to reach $5 during the fourth quarter of the year. Technical charts indicate a gradual and steady rise in ADA. Investors track Cardano Price fluctuations as a measure of long-term stability. The majority still consider ADA one of the best cryptos to invest in the long term. The continuous increase in Cardano has turned it into a favorite choice in the majority of portfolios. The Cardano price prediction today shows that it may increase by 3.49% and reach $0.7025 by April 28. Remittix: The Latest DeFi Project Addressing Real-World Problems Remittix is a fresh DeFi venture with a mission. It gives an infrastructure through which less costly and faster cross-border payments become possible. Remittix offers solutions to several who perform cross-border money transfer. For example, the majority of people, some 1.4 billion adults worldwide, do not have access to a bank account. They make use of services like Western Union to be paid. Using Remittix, customers get crypto in a wallet and pass it on to an agent who pays them in local currency. This method preserves the original purpose of cryptography. People own their own money and remain anonymous while accessing modern finance and banking. Remittix sold over 524 million tokens during its ICO. This strong sale shows that early adopters are sure of its vision. Remittix DeFi coin price today is around $0.0734, and most think that this is a good entry point. Other analysts see Remittix growing tens of times its value, so the targets are 10x to double that. Growth potential makes Remittix one of the best cryptos to invest in for astronomical returns. A New Era of Crypto Payments The majority of investors focus their attention on Cardano Price. Residual value safety stems from Cardano‚Äôs steady growth as the project keeps developing which makes it a good choice for long-term investments. The marketplace directs its attention to Remittix at present. Remittix delivers both substantial returns together with a solution to solve genuine international payment issues. The digital finance sector receives a new perspective with Remittix because it openly seeks to provide financial services to unbanked individuals while decreasing transaction costs.

Ethereum (ETH) price dropped over 9 percent last week to trade around $1,809 on Monday, March 31, 2025. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $218 billion, has continued to suffer a more macro bearish outlook. Ethereum Whales Signals Distress For the first time since October 2024, the U.S. spot Ether ETFs will record a monthly net cash outflow of nearly $409 million in March 2025. Amid the rising fear of further market volatility, on-chain data shows a major whale deposited 6,131 ETH, worth about $10.94 million, to the Binance exchange earlier today.

What Next? After experiencing a major resistance level of around $4,105, in the past 12 months, Ethereum price has been trapped in a bearish outlook. Following last week‚Äôs close below $1,907, which coincided with the 1.618 weekly Fibonacci Extension , Ether‚Äôs price has now confirmed a possible macro bear market, with a potential capitulation below $1,000. As more investors flee the crypto market to the gold and stablecoins market, Ethereum price faces major headwinds in the coming quarter. Ahead of the April 2, reciprocal tariff by the United States, the fear of further crypto selloff is palpable across global markets.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 05:37:42

On March 31, Xatarrer, the anonymous creator behind the Ethereum-based platform, made a direct on-chain plea to the hacker. In the message , they asked the attacker to keep $100,000, which accounts for roughly 28% of the stolen funds, as a ‚Äúfair share‚Äù for finding a critical vulnerability, vowing that no legal action would be pursued if the remaining funds were returned. Xatarrer said the project was built from scratch over four years with late-night coding sessions and $70,000 pooled from friends and supporters. With no backing from venture capital firms, the protocol had grown organically to around $400,000 in TVL before the exploit drained it all. ‚ÄúIf you keep 100% of the funds, there is no chance for us to survive,‚Äù they added. Xatarrer also acknowledged the skill involved in the exploit, calling the attack ‚Äúalmost beautiful if it wasn‚Äôt for all the funds people lost.‚Äù So far, there‚Äôs been no response from the attacker. According to Etherscan data, the stolen crypto has already been funneled through Railgun, a privacy protocol that obscures transaction trails.

The vulnerability was linked to a function in the protocol‚Äôs smart contract called uniswapV3SwapCallback, which is part of the Vault contract. According to experts, the vulnerability involved Ethereum‚Äôs transient storage, a feature introduced in the Dencun upgrade to help reduce gas fees. The attacker manipulated the transient storage before the transaction ended, using it to overwrite security data mid-process. This allowed them to trick the contract into accepting a fake Uniswap pool address controlled by the attacker. Following the incident, Xatarrer said they still hope to rebuild the protocol. In their latest message to the community on X, the founder added that the team had already started ‚Äúplanning‚Äù the next steps for the protocol.

When Dogecoin launched as a joke in 2013, no one thought it would become a multi-billion-dollar phenomenon. However, those who got in early made fortunes before Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and mainstream adoption. That‚Äôs the kind of opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin presents today‚Äîa rare chance to get in before the masses do. This isn‚Äôt just another meme coin. Arctic Pablo is rewriting the playbook by blending high-reward staking, an exciting presale journey, and a deflationary mechanism that guarantees increasing scarcity. Let‚Äôs dive into why Arctic Pablo is the next meme coin sensation and why waiting could be a costly mistake. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin Adventure In the heart of a frozen expanse, where myths and magic collide, Arctic Pablo embarks on a journey to uncover hidden treasures‚Äîglowing coins of untapped wealth. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn‚Äôt just another token; it‚Äôs an adventure, a legend in the making. The presale price climbs with every location Pablo reaches, mirroring his path through the icy unknown. Arctic Pablo Coin is breaking boundaries in crypto investing. With its 17th destination, Glacial Glade, the project has raised over $2 million, with APC at $0.000087. A $500 investment secures 5,747,125 APCs‚Äîpotentially worth $45,977 at launch. But Arctic Pablo isn‚Äôt just about hype‚Äîit‚Äôs designed for sustainability and long-term growth. The tokenomics ensure fairness, with 50% of the supply allocated to the presale and a robust staking program offering 66% APY. Investors can stake their tokens for two months post-launch, earning passive rewards while holding onto a coin that‚Äôs set to explode in value. The deflationary model further cements Arctic Pablo‚Äôs value. Unlike Dogecoin, which has an infinite supply, Arctic Pablo features weekly token burns, eliminating unsold presale tokens to maintain scarcity. This ensures long-term price stability and continuous demand‚Äîa formula that has worked wonders for previous crypto success stories. It is one of the Best New Meme Coins to Join Now. The key to meme coin riches has always been early entry. Those who recognized Dogecoin‚Äôs potential before it went mainstream walked away with six and seven-figure profits. Arctic Pablo presents that same chance but with an even stronger foundation, deflationary control, and high staking rewards. The adventure is only starting, and those who hop on now will be part of history. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin King That Took Over the World Dogecoin was never meant to be serious. It started as a joke‚Äîliterally. Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer created it as a fun alternative to Bitcoin, something lighthearted and community-driven. But as with all great stories, Dogecoin took an unexpected turn. By 2021, thanks to the backing of Elon Musk and a growing online. But here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîDogecoin‚Äôs peak was years ago. Could it still climb? Sure, but not with the same astronomical gains it once saw. Its massive circulating supply and lack of a strong deflationary mechanism make it more of a long-term community play than a high-growth opportunity. And that‚Äôs where Arctic Pablo steps in, offering a chance for new investors to capitalize on early-stage growth, just like Dogecoin did in its infancy. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the best new meme coins to join now. Crypto fortunes aren‚Äôt built on hindsight‚Äîthey‚Äôre made by those who recognize golden opportunities before the rest of the world catches on. With Arctic Pablo‚Äôs thrilling adventure narrative, strategic tokenomics, and a deflationary mechanism designed to increase scarcity, this isn‚Äôt just another meme coin‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. The time to act is now, before the next price increase and token burn take effect. Join the meme coin presale now.

In a surprising twist, the attacker unknowingly deposited the funds into a fake version of Tornado Cash‚Äîa popular crypto mixer‚Äîwhile attempting to launder them. This latest turn highlights a growing trend where even sophisticated cybercriminals are falling prey to scams within the same ecosystem they exploit. The loss was confirmed by De.Fi Antivirus Web3, a Consensys-backed cybersecurity project, which reported the incident on X on 31 March. Blockchain data supports the claim, showing a clear outflow of funds to the fake site, followed by a message sent by the hacker to zkLend‚Äôs deployer address in a bid for damage control. Attacker contacts zkLend On-chain evidence shows the hacker attempted to obfuscate the stolen funds by using what they thought was Tornado Cash. However, the mixer site was a spoof. The funds were instantly drained upon deposit. Soon after realising the blunder, the attacker sent a message on-chain to zkLend, admitting the mistake. In the message, the hacker acknowledged using a phishing site and losing everything. They expressed regret, and encouraged zkLend to focus on tracking down the phishing scam operators instead of themselves.

Following the 12 February exploit, zkLend had attempted to negotiate by offering a 10% bounty if the hacker returned the remaining funds by 14 February. That deadline passed without a response, prompting zkLend to involve law enforcement and cybersecurity experts from Starknet Foundation, StarkWare, and Binance Security. Among top Q1 2025 crypto hacks The zkLend breach was one of the largest of the year so far. According to Immunefi‚Äôs Q1 2025 report, the first three months of 2025 marked the worst quarter in crypto security history. A total of $1.64 billion was stolen across various platforms. Of that, decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols accounted for $106.8 million across 38 incidents. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the top two targets. Centralised platforms, although hit only twice, accounted for the vast majority of losses, with $1.5 billion stolen. The zkLend exploit alone saw 2,930 ETH siphoned off in a targeted smart contract attack. The loss of this ETH‚Äîcurrently valued at around $9.6 million‚Äîmakes the phishing blunder a significant moment in crypto theft history, as it not only erased the stolen funds but also highlighted vulnerabilities from both attackers and victims in the DeFi ecosystem. Fake mixers a rising threat The attacker‚Äôs failed laundering attempt sheds light on a newer layer of risk: fake versions of legitimate crypto tools. Tornado Cash, a well-known crypto mixing service used for privacy, has been targeted repeatedly by phishing scams. As security protocols ramp up to recover hacked assets, phishing sites are now capturing stolen funds before they can even be laundered. This trend raises broader concerns about the ecosystem‚Äôs security. Even experienced hackers using advanced methods are being deceived by convincingly spoofed tools. It also complicates efforts for law enforcement and recovery experts, as the destination addresses of phishing sites often vanish without a trace or are controlled by unknown operators. With losses mounting, industry analysts are urging DeFi protocols and crypto users alike to improve operational security. Meanwhile, the zkLend case adds to the mounting list of cautionary tales emerging from an already record-breaking quarter for crypto exploits.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is working on a plan to classify cryptocurrencies as financial products under the country‚Äôs Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If this happens, crypto would fall under insider trading laws, just like stocks. A bill could be introduced as early as next year, signaling a major shift in how Japan treats digital assets. A Global Shift in Crypto Regulation Japan isn‚Äôt alone in rethinking its approach to crypto. In the U.S., the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently announced that digital asset derivatives will now be treated like other financial instruments. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is making it easier for banks to engage with crypto as long as they properly manage risks. FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill called it a move away from the ‚Äúflawed approach‚Äù of the last three years, hinting at a more open stance on crypto. Banks Get More Freedom to Handle Crypto Moreover, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is also stepping in, making it clear that national banks and federal savings associations can explore crypto so long as they maintain strong risk controls. However, Acting Comptroller Rodney E. Hood emphasized that crypto-related activities should be treated no differently than traditional banking. This could mean fewer roadblocks for banks looking to dive into digital assets and blockchain. What This Means for Crypto Investors If Japan officially classifies crypto as a financial product, exchanges and investors could face stricter rules, especially around insider trading. While some see this as a necessary step to protect the market, others worry it could limit innovation and slow down crypto adoption.

Analysts suggest that these levels could ignite a potential trend reversal if reclaimed. Ethereum Faces Potential Decline To $1,155 In a recent update shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted two pivotal price points for Ethereum‚Äôs immediate future. The first, set at $2,100, is seen as a necessary threshold for initiating a new upward trend. However, the $2,300 mark is regarded as a ‚Äúmore decisive‚Äù level that Ethereum must breach to confirm a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles: Crypto Analyst Bucks Back Against Bearish Sentiment, Top Is Not In Martinez‚Äôs analysis, based on the one-day chart seen below, indicates that if Ethereum fails to reclaim these levels, it may lead to a further decline. The next target points to watch would be $1,600 and $1,155, levels that could indicate a new downtrend. Such a decline would represent additional losses of 12% and over 37%, respectively, marking a troubling continuation of Ethereum‚Äôs worst first quarter in its history. In another post, the analyst also pointed out that the Ethereum price is facing a significant resistance wall between $2,200 and $2,580. On-chain data from the analytics firm IntoTheBlock reveals that approximately 12.43 million investors have bought about 66.18 million ETH within this price range. A breakout above these levels could potentially generate bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, bullish catalysts that could trigger a move above these levels remain scarce among experts. ETH‚Äôs Largest Accumulation Zone Under Threat Market intelligence firm Glassnode has indicated that ETH‚Äôs Cost Basis Distribution shows limited support near current prices. Weekly data suggests that addresses with a cost basis around $1,800 have not re-engaged. Many investors are reportedly selling at a loss, further adding to the current price uncertainty. On March 28, several clusters of approximately 250,000 ETH with cost bases between $2,000 and $2,050 effectively vanished, indicating that some higher-cost holders are attempting to average down their positions. However, Glassnode asserts that the overall Ethereum accumulation zone appears limited at current price levels, raising questions about future stabilization for the second largest cryptocurrency.

The largest accumulation zone below the current market price now sits at $1,537, where nearly 994,000 ETH was acquired. If the downtrend continues, this level is expected to serve as structural support in the near term, potentially providing a buffer against further declines. ETH is currently trading at $1,830, down 12% for the week.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.5 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $196 million, has dropped over 68 percent in the past four weeks to trade about $0.723 on Monday, March 31, during the early Western financial markets. Pi Team Encounters Major Headwinds The Pi team has struggled to keep the network vibrant following the hyped token generation event and the notable pushback from top-tier centralized exchanges , led by Bybit. The Pi team has attempted to publish several network network updates, but none has stirred bullish momentum to date. Late last week, the Pi team announced an update on mainnet migration and account verification. The Pi team announced that it has shifted from relying primarily on phone numbers to using email-based two-factor authentication (2FA) verification . What Next? Since hitting its all-time high (ATH), of about $2.99 on February 26, Pi price has been trapped in a falling trend, characterized by lower lows and lower highs in the 4-hour and daily timeframes. From a technical analysis standpoint, PI price is currently retesting the last major support level of around 72 cents. A consistent breach of the current support level will result in a renewed selloff in the coming weeks. A potential rebound from the current support level will kickstart a fresh bull rally toward a new ATH. However, the accelerated PI coin selloff, by the early adopters in the past six years, has heavily weighed down on possible bullish sentiment in the near term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.02% to surpass 35,700, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.8% to reach 2,680 on Tuesday, recovering some of the losses from the previous session. The Japanese yen was little changed around 149.8 per dollar on Tuesday, struggling for clear direction as investors digested mixed economic data. Japan‚Äôs unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 2.4% in February from 2.5% in the previous month, defying forecasts for no change. Separate data showed, the Au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI was revised higher to 48.4 in March 2025 from 48.3 in the preliminary estimates, but below the prior month of 49, marking the ninth consecutive month of contraction. However, business sentiment weakened in the first quarter, reflecting mounting concerns over the potential impact of US tariffs on Japan‚Äôs export-driven economy. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.28% to surpass 3,350, while the Shenzhen Component edged up 0.4% to 10,550 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks rebounding after a two-day decline as investors reacted positively to strong factory activity data., and the offshore yuan fell to around 7.27 per dollar on Tuesday, as the looming implementation of President Donald Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariffs overshadowed positive manufacturing PMI data. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI expansion accelerated to 51.2 in March 2025, up from February‚Äôs 50.8, surpassing expectations of 51.1, reaching a four-month-high amid robust external demand. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.15% to 23,247 in morning deals on Tuesday, halting the bearish trend of the prior two sessions, supported by gains in tech, energy, and consumer services. India¬†( SENSEX ) fell 1.49% to 76,544 in early deals on Tuesday, retreating for the second consecutive day as traders took profits after returning from holiday amid global trade uncertainty. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.04% on Tuesday, surpassing 7,870. The Australian dollar remained steady around $0.625 on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept its cash rate unchanged at 4.1%, as widely expected . Separately, on the data front, Australian retail sales rose less than expected in February, indicating softening domestic consumption. The S&P Global Flash Australia Manufacturing PMI climbed to 52.1 in March 2025 from 50.4 in February, the final reading showed. The Reserve Bank of Australia‚Äôs Index of Commodity Prices fell 6.5% year-on-year in March 2025, slowing from an upwardly revised 8.9% drop in the previous month. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher kicking off the week on a positive note. However, the Nasdaq 100 lagged, falling 0.1% as investors navigated economic growth concerns and escalating trade tensions. U.S. stock futures declined on Tuesday as investors braced for President Donald Trump's upcoming tariff announcements: Dow -0.22% ; S&P 500 -0.28% ; Nasdaq -0.37% . Meanwhile, traders are closely watching key labor market reports, including job openings data on Tuesday, the ADP employment report on Wednesday, and the monthly payrolls report on Friday, which could provide fresh insights into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-cut trajectory.

The latest acquisition, which cost $735 million, expands Tether‚Äôs ( USDT ) total Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to 100,521 BTC, or roughly $8.29 billion, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The acquisition is part of Tether‚Äôs ongoing strategy to bolster its reserves by allocating 15% of its profits to Bitcoin purchases, a commitment the company made in May 2023.

Credit: Arkham Intelligence Tether‚Äôs expansion extends beyond cryptocurrencies. On Mar. 27, the company increased its stake in Adecoagro, a Latin American agricultural firm, to 70%. This is in line with Tether‚Äôs policy of supporting companies that promote economic freedom, especially in emerging markets. To further expand its investments across a variety of industries, Tether plans to purchase a 30% stake in the Italian media company Be Water. The company reported a record profit of $13.7 billion last year, according to its Q4 2024 report. It established itself as the biggest stablecoin issuer by issuing USDT totaling $45 billion. With a market valuation of $144 billion, USDT now accounts for 61% of the total stablecoin market, far outpacing competitors such as USD Coin ( USDC ), which has a market cap of $60 billion. To ensure that every USDT issued is completely backed, the company maintains $7 billion in excess stablecoin reserves. Tether also made big moves in traditional markets, becoming 2024‚Äôs seventh-largest buyer of U.S. Treasury securities with a $33.1 billion investment.

Following yesterday‚Äôs low at $2.03, the Ripple crypto has seen a brief bounce back above $2.11, however, it remains to be seen whether this bullish sentiment can sustain moving ahead from here onwards. XRP Price Faces Crucial Test as MVRV Indicator Tanks The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for XRP has dropped below its 200-day moving average, a key indicator that could suggest a macro trend shift in price action, reported crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Source: Ali Martinez This crossover is often seen as a bearish signal, indicating that XRP price may be entering a new phase of market movement. Analysts are closely observing whether this dip is the start of a broader downtrend or signals a potential accumulation phase for investors. However, market analysts are hopeful of the 125% in XRP options trading volumes , with some expecting a potential bounce back to $2.5. Ripple Crypto In A Make-or-Break Situation As of press time, the XRP price is showing signs of recovery from yesterday‚Äôs bottom at $2.03 with daily trading volumes pumping 35% to more than $4.0 billion. However, per the Coinglass data , the XRP futures open interest is showing mild movement at 0.7%, showing no clear directional signs. XRP has rebounded from the $2.03 support level and is moving upward, however, a sustained breakout above the trendline resistance of $2.30 is crucial to target $2.91. Source: Trading View If XRP fails to hold above $2.03, major support levels are positioned at $1.79 and $1.56, which could determine the next directional move. Traders are closely watching price action for confirmation of a bullish breakout or potential downside risk. If the Ripple crypto defends $2, some market analysts are predicting a 600% XRP rally from here. Will Ripple Lawsuit Delay Play the Spoilsport? Despite Ripple and US SEC agreeing on no further cross appeal in the XRP lawsuit, chances of an imminent settlement in this case seem low. An XRP advocate recently suggested that the SEC would not issue an official announcement regarding the XRP lawsuit until August 7, citing a court ruling as the basis for the claim. However, former SEC attorney Marc Fagel dismissed the assertion, calling it ‚Äústupid and wrong,‚Äù sparking debate within the crypto community.

Gold price has surged over 3 percent since Thursday to trade at about $3,113 per ounce on Monday, during the mid-London session. The capital flight from major global stock indexes and crypto assets has helped Gold‚Äôs price record five consecutive weekly bullish candlesticks. Furthermore, global markets have been preparing for a potential recession in the United States amid the reciprocal tariff issued by the Donald Trump administration. Expected Impact on Bitcoin Price By now, it is safe to say that Bitcoin is the digital gold, following the widespread adoption by institutional investors and nation-states. However, Bitcoin price has recorded a negative correlation with Gold price, especially since the second inauguration of the U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year. After the U.S. tariff-war storm gets to subsides in the near future, the fear of further crypto capitulation will significantly diminish. Consequently, more investors heavily banked on gold will rotate their capital to the Bitcoin market to capitalize on a potential v-shaped rebound. Moreover, Bitcoin price has not factored in the creation of the strategic BTC reserve in the United States and the clear regulatory outlook, which has attracted more institutional investors to date. Already, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs have recorded the second consecutive week of cash inflow, after bleeding in the past five consecutive weeks. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, massive token unlocks in March have been one of the prime factors that has contributed to the recent losses of the token. In addition, the lack of any major announcement from the Pi Core Team and the lack of listing updates from Binance has further weighed on the sentiment. However, Pi Coin price is expected to witness a recovery in April as token unlocks will hit their Low in April. According to PiScan data, April will see the lowest token unlocks from April to August. Only 124.32 million Pi tokens will be unlocked this month. In contrast, the following months will witness a surge in token unlocks, with 182.37 million in May, 222.68 million in June, 233.37 million in July, and 132.52 million in August. Besides, the token unlocks from April 7 to April 11 will be around 1.5 million tokens daily. Having said that, this low influx into the market might help in a strong recovery of the token, potentially pushing its price to above $1. What‚Äôs Next For Pi Network Price? As said, Pi Network is likely to be gearing up for a strong recovery with experts predicting a bullish future ahead. However, looking at the current volatile scenario in the broader market, investors should exercise due diligence before putting their bets. Besides, a Pi price prediction also hints towards a bearish picture, indicating a potential dip to $0.64 in April for the crypto. However, despite that, the market experts remained bullish on the future trajectory of the coin. For context, analyst Crypto Jex has shared a bullish outlook for Pi Coin, predicting a potential price surge to $1. According to Jex, Pi Network is forming an ABC Recovery Pattern within a key accumulation zone. With an entry zone of $0.64-$0.77 and a stop-loss at $0.60, Jex sets targets of $0.95-$1.00, $1.30-$1.50, and $1.80+ upon trend confirmation. Jex believes a strong liquidation move has led to accumulation, and with volume confirmation, the setup offers solid mid-term upside potential, making a $1 price point achievable.

Pseudonymous crypto strategist Rekt Capital tells his 542,600 followers on the social media platform X that BTC appears to be mirroring its price action in 2021 when Bitcoin consolidated between two key exponential moving averages (EMAs) on the weekly chart. According to Rekt, Bitcoin must convert the 21-week EMA into support to trigger the resumption of bullish price action. ‚ÄúEarlier this week, Bitcoin rejected from the 21-week EMA resistance (green). As a result, Bitcoin continues to consolidate between these two Bull Market EMAs, much like it did in mid-2021. Nonetheless, for the future, the key confirmation signal for a breakout will be a weekly close above the green EMA followed by a post-breakout retest of it into new support (light blue circle).‚Äù Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $82,536. Looking at the altcoin market, the trader says he expects alts to continue underperforming Bitcoin based on the BTC dominance (BTC.D) chart, which tracks how much of the total crypto market cap belongs to the flagship digital asset. According to Rekt, BTC.D could hit a crucial resistance level that has remained intact since 2017 before losing steam. Once that happens, Rekt predicts that a real altcoin season will come to fruition. ‚ÄúBTC Dominance. If history repeats, the real Altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin Dominance rejects from 71% (red).‚Äù Source: Rekt Capital/X A bearish BTC.D chart suggests that altcoins are growing in value faster than Bitcoin.

Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) was one of them. When it first launched, few paid attention, and those who did hesitated. Fast forward, and GOAT hit an all-time high that sent shockwaves through the market. The ones who got in early? They walked away with life-changing profits. The ones who waited? They were left watching from the sidelines, wishing they had moved faster. Now, history is repeating itself. This time, the opportunity is called BTFD Coin (BTFD) ; the top new meme coin to invest in now. With over $6.43 million raised, 72 billion coins sold, and a rapidly growing community of over 11,600 holders, BTFD‚Äôs presale is surging toward its final stages. Investors are already eyeing its projected moonshot price of $0.006‚Äîa staggering 2900% ROI potential from its current presale price of just $0.0002. This isn‚Äôt just another crypto launch. It‚Äôs a second chance for those who missed out before. Are you going to grab it this time? BTFD Coin: The Highly Praised Presale for Huge Gains in 2025 BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just riding the meme wave‚Äîit‚Äôs creating an entirely new movement. The name itself, ‚Äú Buy The Dip ,‚Äù reflects its core philosophy: taking advantage of market downturns to position for explosive gains. And the numbers don‚Äôt lie. Investors who enter now at $0.0002 have the potential to see their holdings skyrocket once BTFD reaches its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. That alone is a 200% gain before the real pump even begins. But the real target? The projected moonshot price of $0.006, which would mean a jaw-dropping 2900% return. What makes BTFD different? For starters, it‚Äôs not just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs an ecosystem. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game went live on January 1, 2025, allowing users to earn rewards while playing. Imagine a world where gaming isn‚Äôt just entertainment but a full-fledged passive income stream. On top of that, staking is offering an insane 90% APY, ensuring that long-term holders continuously grow their bags. And let‚Äôs not forget the Bulls Squad‚ÄîBTFD‚Äôs powerhouse community that thrives on market dips and turns volatility into opportunities. Beyond the hype, BTFD is designed to reward early adopters. With 15 presale stages nearly completed, the next price increase is just around the corner. The entry point today is one of the last opportunities before the real FOMO kicks in. Early adopters of GOAT know how that story played out‚Äîand those who hesitated still regret it. Are you going to make the same mistake with the top new meme coin to invest in now ? Goatseus Maximus: The One That You Missed Let‚Äôs talk about missed opportunities. When GOAT first launched, it was a low-cap meme coin with little attention. The early days saw a few believers, but many dismissed it as just another passing trend. The skeptics stood by while the bold ones stacked up their positions. What happened next? GOAT hit an all-time high that multiplied early investments by insane margins. The ones who took the risk saw their portfolios explode. The ones who waited? They missed their shot at financial freedom. For context, GOAT was trading at fractions of a cent when it launched. When it hit its peak, those who got in early saw exponential returns, easily turning small investments into six and seven figures. But by the time mainstream investors caught on, the best entry points were long gone. Now, the same scenario is unfolding with BTFD Coin. Except this time, you know what‚Äôs coming. This time, you have a chance to be on the winning side. The question is‚Äîwill you take it? Earn Big with BTFD‚Äôs Referral Program If stacking gains with BTFD wasn‚Äôt enough, there‚Äôs another way to amplify your rewards with this top new meme coin to invest in now. The BTFD referral program lets you earn extra BTFD coins just by bringing others into the presale. Here‚Äôs how it works: Step 1: Connect Your Wallet ‚Äì Visit the BTFD official site , connect your wallet, and get your unique referral code. Step 2: Share Your Referral Code ‚Äì Send it to friends, family, or your crypto network. Step 3: Earn Rewards Your referrals get 10% extra BTFD when they purchase $50 or more. You earn 10% of their purchase amount if you‚Äôre in the top 20 on the leaderboard. Step 4: Track Your Earnings ‚Äì Watch your BTFD holdings grow directly in your wallet. Get in Before BTFD Takes Off! Here‚Äôs the reality: the current BTFD presale price of $0.00016 isn‚Äôt sticking around much longer. With Stage 15 nearly complete, the final stretch is approaching fast. At launch, BTFD will list at $0.0006, handing early investors a 200% gain right out of the gate. And if the projected price of $0.006 hits, that‚Äôs a 2900% ROI waiting to happen. Imagine dropping $2500 into BTFD now‚Äîby the time it reaches its projected moon price, that investment would be worth a life-changing $75,000. You watched the GOAT take off. Don‚Äôt be the one watching this top new meme coin to invest in now from the sidelines again. This is your moment to make the move. The BTFD community is growing, the presale is gaining momentum, and the bulls are gearing up for the next big run. Join before it‚Äôs too late because once this dip is gone, it‚Äôs not coming back.

BTFD offers a 90% APY staking program, allowing holders to grow their holdings significantly over time. What makes BTFD different from other meme coins? BTFD has a live P2E game, high staking rewards, a strong community, and a clear roadmap for long-term success.

Why This Cheap Altcoin Should Be On Your Watchlist,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-solana-sol-price-in-trouble-why-this-cheap-altcoin-should-be-on-your-watchlist/,"Solana‚ÄÇ(SOL) sends mixed signals as it continues to tank after one particular whale dumped 60,289 tokens valued at $7.67 million, causing a 5% price drop to $125.19. Though network‚ÄÇgrowth continues to be robust‚Äîrecorded 11.12 million addresses now holding SOL‚Äîthe sale exposes weaknesses in its near-term stability. Now, traders are watching a key support level; a break‚ÄÇthere could amplify losses. When Solana experienced its recent turbulence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) became the focus for investors looking for different options. Over $6 million worth of presale buys has occurred alongside 7,700 holders during its current selling stage at $0.025. MUTM has become an attractive investment opportunity in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is‚ÄÇgaining a lot of attention as its fourth presale phase rises fast. Since the start‚ÄÇof the presale, more than $6 million has already been raised as demand accelerates. The present‚ÄÇ$0.025 price point gives early movers a short window before the following phase increases the token to $0.03 ‚Äî a 20% jump. Those that enter now‚ÄÇget to collect gains starting with Phase 5 but even lock in gains moving forward. The tokenomics system has determined an initial listing price at $0.06 which enables investors to obtain a 140% profit based on holding the coins until launch. Analysts predict that Mutuum Finance lending protocols increasing traction will push post-listing targets to $1.50 while reflecting the total 5900% price increase from the starting level. 7,700 holders have secured a lead position for the broader market recognition that threatens to push forward the current price levels. Calculated Gains Ahead With MUTM you receive a systematic method to generate profit opportunities. The initial purchase at $0.025 could generate up to +140% profit at inception while long-term value depends strongly on market adoption. The value of MUTM increases directly because of its unique decentralized lending structure which enables users to receive liquidity through asset collateralization while experiencing steady buying pressure absent from speculations. The collecting fees provide funds for token buybacks that simultaneously reward stakers while reducing the circulating number of tokens. A future Certik audit and this planned mechanism will work together to strengthen investor trust and confidence in MUTM tokens. Whale-induced volatility in Solana would fail to disturb the structured presale of MUTM that minimizes random value fluctuations. According to projections a $1,000 initial investment has the potential to evolve into $60,000 when launch expectations materialize. Positioning‚ÄÇStrategically In DeFi Unlike meme tokens, Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇ(MUTM) puts utility first. Its mtTokens system, whereby deposited‚ÄÇfunds earn interest in the form of interest-bearing assets can provide passive income whilst retaining liquidity. The platform also offers‚ÄÇovercollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending options which serve to further set it apart from the competition and draw participants who are risk-averse. While Solana‚Äôs neutral funding rates imply indecision from‚ÄÇtraders, the roadmap put forth by MUTM brings certainty: audits, lists on exchanges, and an upcoming stablecoin amplify its credibility. The team‚Äôs transparency surrounding security upgrades stands‚ÄÇin stark contrast to the opacity of sudden whale exits affecting larger cryptos. As Solana‚Äôs price tests crucial support, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on fixed path‚ÄÇof upward trajectory. Now Phase 4‚Äôs $0.025 entry‚ÄÇpoint is before 1) an imminent 20% presale gain and 2) a launch well-positioned to achieve three-digit profit. MUTM is one of those rare opportunities, especially with Certik verification in the‚ÄÇpipeline and buyback mechanisms ready to turn the supply-faucet off. For investors looking for Solana‚Äôs risks and‚ÄÇthose candidates that can be mapped out in the flesh, the math increasingly favors this altcoin. Time Is of the Essence The high fill rate of phase‚ÄÇ4 indicates growing FOMO, and the next price increase is getting closer. Follow Mutuum Finance‚Äôs official channels‚ÄÇfor news on the audit and presale. In a market swinging between doubt and euphoria MUTM offers a direct path to life-changing gains.

In response, a brief history of Ripple‚Äôs development was provided, tracing its beginnings in Canada and its later evolution under new leadership. Ryan Fugger‚Äôs Vision and the Early Days of Ripple Ryan Fugger started the Ripple project in 2004 as RipplePay, a system designed to facilitate secure and decentralized financial transactions. His goal was to create a peer-to-peer credit network that allowed users to issue and exchange credit without reliance on traditional banking institutions. Fugger, a web and decentralized systems developer, worked on this project, focusing on financial inclusivity and alternative payment solutions. The company originated in Vancouver, Canada, positioning it outside the jurisdiction of major American financial institutions. Fugger, however, eventually stepped away from the project, choosing not to develop it further himself. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Transition to OpenCoin and the Digital Currency Era In 2012, Fugger transferred the project to a group of developers, including Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. Under their leadership, the company shifted its focus from a credit-based payment network to a blockchain-inspired financial protocol. This transition marked the beginning of Ripple, with the new team establishing OpenCoin as the entity overseeing its development. McCaleb, previously known for founding the failed Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange, played a key role in this transition but departed in 2013. After leaving, he created a competing project, Stellar , which was based on a similar concept but with different technical implementations. The Rebranding and Evolution of Ripple In 2013, OpenCoin was rebranded as Ripple Labs. Two years later, the name was shortened to Ripple, aligning the company‚Äôs branding with its focus on financial technology solutions for cross-border payments. The company continued developing its technology, securing partnerships with financial institutions and central banks. Vandell‚Äôs tweet and the subsequent discussion reiterated that the origins of Ripple date back to 2004, several years before Bitcoin‚Äôs introduction in 2009. While the modern version of Ripple significantly differs from Fugger‚Äôs original vision, his early work laid the foundation for what later became a major player in digital payments.

Amid these gains, one popular market analyst has predicted that Ethereum (ETH) will play a pivotal role in the next SHIB rally. This article explores when Shiba Inu will rally and the role that Ethereum might have in the meme coin‚Äôs gains. How Ethereum Might Shape the Next Shiba Inu Price Rally According to analyst SHIB KNIGHT, the next Shiba Inu price rally will be influenced by Ethereum. The analyst noted that if the ETH price reverses from bearish trends and gains traction again, SHIB would be the first Ethereum-based token to rally. SHIB is the top meme coin on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, if investor and developer interest shifts back to ETH, tokens created on the blockchain including SHIB are bound to rally. During the first quarter of 2025, Shiba Inu price plunged as ETH recorded a 45% decline, However, data from Coinglass shows that the second quarter has often boded well for ETH, with average returns of 60%. If Ethereum repeats historical patterns, Shiba Inu price will rally this quarter. Ethereum may also play a role in the next Shiba Inu price rally because of the upcoming Pectra upgrade. This upgrade is slated to happen on April 30, and as ETH rallies, the top meme coin on the network will also register gains. The above factors highlight the role that Ethereum will play in the next SHIB price rally, which is likely to happen in Q2 2025. Other Factors That May Drive SHIB Price Rally Besides Ethereum gains, other factors may also drive an uptrend for Shiba Inu price in the coming months. One of these factors is the growth of the Shibarium layer 2 network. This network recently hit a 1 billion transaction milestone, highlighting rising adoption. X SHIB‚Äôs marketing lead LUCIE has also noted that Shibarium is looking to expand towards gaming and the metaverse. If this expansion happens in the coming months, it will bolster a massive SHIB price rally. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis as Bullish Pattern Emerges Shiba Inu seems to have formed a bullish double-bottom pattern on the weekly price chart, which might precede a 4x price rally. However, such a rally is contingent on support at the second bottom of $0.0000107 holding. If SHIB holds this support level and confirms this bullish reversal pattern, the first resistance to be tested lies at $0.000032. Once the meme coin breaks above this level, it will form a breakout rally to $0.0000458. The ADX supports this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction after flattening. This indicates that the recent downtrend is weakening, which might pave the way for recovery. Meanwhile, the CMF has reverted to the zero line, which suggests a slight uptick in buying activity. SHIB/USDT: 1-week Chart To sum up, Ethereum may influence the next Shiba Inu price rally. However, other factors like Shibarium‚Äôs usage and adoption alongside the double bottom pattern on the weekly chart also show that this meme coin eyes an uptrend in Q2 2025.

The future story of Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) is tethered to the success rate of the mainstream adoption of Telegram messenger and Toncoin blockchain.

For instance, Hamster Kombat has seen its daily active users drop from 31 million in mid-2024 to under 1 million by the end of the first quarter of 2025. The retention challenge of Telegram‚Äôs Tap-to-Earn mini-apps has seen HMSTR decline significantly since it began trading. Nonetheless, Telegram and Toncoin have advanced to global markets in the recent past led by the United States.

These experts have raised warnings that a meme coin crash is on the horizon for April which will cause top crypto holders to rush to secure profitable alternative investments with utility. Right now, many participants in the Dogecoin crypto market have been introduced to Remittix , a Defi platform that is increasingly drawing most of the investor attention through its promise of stability and aggressive growth opportunities. The constant market activity surrounding Dogecoin alongside its uncertain path raises the question if now is the perfect time to switch paths. Let us find out what Remittix has on offer. Dogecoin Crypto Price Predictions; Can Dogecoin Keep Up Its Meme Appeal In 2025? So far this year, Dogecoin (DOGE) has managed to maintain its position in the top 10 altcoins by market capitalization, while trading at approximately $0.166 with an FDV worth over $24.5 billion. Analysts are predicting an increase to at least $1 by the end of 2025 evidenced by significant long positions opened by 73.65% of Binance Futures traders as well as whale-purchases of almost 200 million Dogecoins in two successive weeks. This bullish news shows revived interest, with Elon Musk‚Äôs cryptic tweets and speculation of a U.S.-backed ‚ÄúDogecoin Reserve‚Äù fueling rumors. However, while these long-term predictions paint a bullish picture for Dogecoin crypto movement, technicals show DOGE has broken support at $0.20, and is sliding down to new support point at $0.14. Many are fearful that in the short term this price action could set Dogecoin crypto prices up for a 30% decline if its community hype fades. Analysts have questioned Dogecoin crypto‚Äôs reliance on meme popularity in a market where investor sentiment is migrating towards practical DeFi coins like Remitix. Consequently many analysts think that without new fundamentals, such as integration into Tesla payments or an ETF nod, Dogecoin‚Äôs meme-driven rally could falter against tokens offering tangible value and Dogecoin‚Äôs ability to remain culturally relevant will be crucial. Is Remittix Going To Give Investors The Kind Of Gains Not Seen Since 2021? The crypto world is witnessing Remittix (RTX) emerge as an absolute breakthrough that has meme coins struggling to keep up. The explosive 380% presale expansion has elevated RTX above mere hype in great part to its successful sales reaching over 524 million tokens. Investors can buy RTX at its current value of $0.0734 making investments prime to soar by at least 40x when the coin eventually reaches $3. The real-world use of RTX sets it apart from hype driven memes with an organic practicality that has secured its position as one of the top altcoins. The RTX platform provides users full integration of 40 supported cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin to initiate instant bank deposits of fiat currency. Remittix demonstrates higher investment potential among serious investors who seek growth prospects with real-world use because of its better fit in the evolving crypto industry of 2025. With the crypto market shifting toward utility-driven projects, Remittix is positioned to take center stage . While Dogecoin clings to its meme appeal, RTX is reshaping global transactions and providing a service with tangible benefits. Remittix Will Take Banking To Millions Of Underserved; Don‚Äôt Miss Out! As adoption accelerates, Remittix could soon dominate the PayFi sector, outpacing Dogecoin crypto growth and setting a new standard for remittance-focused cryptocurrencies. The race is on, and it‚Äôs clear that Remittix is not just another contender‚Äîit‚Äôs the future. Do not miss your chance to become a member of the community changing the face of finance.

According to a review of changes on the company‚Äôs website reported by Reuters on Mar. 31, two of the project‚Äôs co-founders, Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, were replaced by an organization in which the Trump family owns a majority stake. The Trump family‚Äôs company, DT Marks DeFi LLC, gained majority control of the platform in January 2025 by acquiring a 60% share through a new holding company, WLF Holdco LLC. These previously unreported changes mark a major shift in WLFI‚Äôs ownership and leadership. The Trump family will now control 60% of the company‚Äôs operating profits after the platform is fully operational, and they are also entitled to 75% of the token sales revenue under the new structure. You might also like: Trump pardons BitMEX founders, is ‚ÄòBitcoin Jesus‚Äô Roger Ver next? They are expected to receive about $400 million from the funds raised, as per Reuters‚Äô calculations. Just 5% of the $550 million raised so far will be available for platform development after the co-founders receive their share. World Liberty Financial was founded in 2024 to offer blockchain-based financial services and eliminate intermediaries like banks. By selling WLFI, its governance token that grants holders the ability to vote on platform decisions, the company was able to raise money, including a $75 million investment from Tron founder Justin Sun. Despite the company‚Äôs decentralized finance goals, the platform‚Äôs governance structure raises concerns. Critics argue that because of the Trump family‚Äôs political influence, the company‚Äôs structure creates possible conflicts of interest. In addition, it restricts meaningful financial involvement from outside investors. Meanwhile, the Trump family continues to deepen their involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. Together with the cryptocurrency infrastructure company Hut 8, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. launched American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining business, on Mar. 31. The Trump brothers own 20% of the venture, while Hut 8 holds the remaining 80%.

According to proponents, AI represents the most promising approach to enhancing blockchain technologies and decentralized applications, driving greater autonomy and efficiency across the ecosystem. The use of AI agents in crypto trading and interoperability between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) has been quite fruitful. They also help improve user experience within the ecosystem and play a key role in enhancing the scalability of blockchain networks as they grow. In December 2024, VanEck reported that AI agents were already numbering 10,000 and that they were expected to reach 1 million in 2025 . This projected growth shows how seemingly inevitable this future is for believers and skeptics alike. The current state of AI agents in the digital world It is easy to see why everyone is excited about integrating AI agents into nearly every digital process. They enhance several processes with no or less effort from humans. Current challenges, however, including the ethical concerns identified by the Vatican, do not allow for their full adoption. Crypto investors also felt the heat after DeepSeek‚Äôs release, which led to a massive market loss. This risk-to-reward analysis may well be used to discuss the necessity of AI agents in the crypto industry. The market capitalization of AI agents in crypto rose 322% in the fourth quarter of 2024, from $4.8 billion to $15.5 billion, indicating that more people in the crypto community are accepting AI. The phenomenon of the absolute autonomy of systems is not so far away if we look at the advantages. AI agents‚Äô trading, analysis and risk management capabilities are widely reported to be better than those of humans. Every decision made in the market is made quickly and is strongly supported by as much data as possible, reducing human errors that can cause losses. There are some good indications of this potential. Edwin is a project that aims to combine AI and decentralized finance, enabling the easy integration of AI agents built on top of frameworks like LangChain and ElizaOS to work with DeFi platforms, including Aave and Uniswap. This makes creating a single interface and securely performing blockchain operations easier, removing the need to learn different protocol integrations. Recent: Microsoft for Startups backed project: Web3 AI workforce on demand This allows for a utopia of financial automation, or ‚Äú DeFAI ,‚Äù where AI agents can control their financial destiny and manage and control their assets in a highly complex, dynamic environment. For example, ElizaOS offers a robust multi-agent simulation environment to develop, deploy and manage many autonomous AI agents. It‚Äôs a versatile platform that enables these agents to move between various systems while preserving their identity and knowledge toward fully active and self-directed entities in the crypto realm. AI agents can combine all the functions of TradFi and DeFi without issue. They can cut out the intermediaries in international transactions, improving the speed of handling crypto and fiat financial transactions. They can also enable liquidity providers to manage their stablecoin yields completely automatedly and maximize their yields according to current demand across all blockchains. These integrations are an indication of the endless possibilities in cross-border payment transactions. In a September 2024 report, the Global Digital Visionaries Council predicted that by 2025, 20% of all financial transactions would be crosschain due to the integration of TradFi and DeFi systems. Projects like Virtuals Protocol go further by enabling users to create, own and deploy autonomous AI agents. Although the initial application of Virtuals Protocol is the creation of AI-driven avatars, the protocol offers resources that can be used for autonomous crypto trading, showing the versatility of AI in blockchain ecosystems. Autonomous market and personalization is also improving with the help of AI. Crypto‚Äôs first AI agents index, Cookie.fun ‚Äî developed by Cookie DAO ‚Äî provides real-time analysis of agents‚Äô performance, mindshare and engagement across blockchains and social media. The platform lists their market caps and ‚Äúsmart following‚Äù to track market trends and provide vital information that investors and projects can use to make better decisions and identify the top-performing agents in the ecosystem. AlphaNeural provides a decentralized environment for the training, market share and effectiveness of AI models and agents. It also has a marketplace for AI assets and a GPU aggregation network that enables creators to tokenize their work and secure and scale the execution of AI solutions. In this manner, the current opportunities for developing advanced AI tools are open for everyone, which connects AI developers with the crypto ecosystem. The crypto analyst community is confident that AI technology can improve most blockchain performance metrics. The crypto ecosystem is also experiencing rapid user growth, which means that the level of personalization in customer interactions is also increasing due to the use of AI agents. The skeptic‚Äôs point of view Nevertheless, many still have different opinions regarding promoting digital autonomy in crypto through AI agents. One significant concern raised in a case study published by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania is the potential effect on the stock market from the increased risk of market manipulation. In theory, collusion between trading algorithms powered by AI could lead to price inefficiencies that might weaken the efficiency of financial markets. In such cases, the bots could manipulate prices up or down or cause a price surge or crash, eroding the market‚Äôs credibility. Many people have also expressed concerns over relying on AI agents to make decisions because they are prone to hacking. Poorly programmed agents may be unable to resist certain types of cyberattacks, resulting in capital loss. Without a drastic solution to such threats, risks, and legal and ethical issues, the skeptics will always have a valid argument against integrating AI agents in this area. AI-driven autonomy Cryptocurrencies and their supporters have been slow to warm up to AI agents, but they really should, given how useful they‚Äôve been in so many areas. These integrations will likely improve trading, help onboarding from TradFi to DeFi, and offer other features. The utopia of completely autonomous AI control crypto experts describe is just around the corner. The integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology unlocks the door to endless possibilities and may pave the path to a new digital era for humanity and its bots.

Analyst Points To 2017 Similarities,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-btc-poised-for-a-q2-recovery-analyst-points-to-2017-similarities/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) attempts to reclaim the $84,000 barrier again, the flagship crypto risks closing the Month in red numbers. Some analysts suggest that BTC‚Äôs Q2 performance could mimic its 2017 rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Confirms Breakout From Ascending Triangle, Target Set At $7,800 Bitcoin Retests $84,000 A week ago, Bitcoin saw a star-of-week pump to retest the $88,000-$89,000 resistance zone. The flagship cryptocurrency surged to a two-week high of $88,765, hovering between the $85,000 to $88,000 price range for most of the week. However, as the weekend approached, BTC lost its range, falling to $84,000 on Friday and continuing to dip over the next two days. Bitcoin saw an 8.2% weekly drop during the early Monday hours, hitting $81,278 before recovering. After hitting its lowest price in two weeks, the largest crypto by market capitalization bounced from the range lows, nearing the key $84,000 barrier again. This zone has been a crucial resistance level since Bitcoin lost its post-November breakout range a month ago. Since then, BTC has failed to maintain this level for significant periods. Amid the market correction, trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that Bitcoin has created another CME Gap, becoming the fifth consecutive week that a gap has been created due to price movement during the weekend, with all the previous ones being closed ‚Äúrelatively quickly.‚Äù This week‚Äôs CME gap, between $82,500 and $84,100, was almost filled after this morning‚Äôs rally. However, analyst Rekt Capital pointed out, ‚ÄúBTC will need to rally more than that to try to seriously challenge for a reclaim of the recently lost Higher Low,‚Äù at around $85,000. BTC To Consolidate For Longer? Ted Pillows suggested BTC‚Äôs performance could see a Q2 recovery based on its 2017 price action. The analyst highlighted that during US president Donald Trump‚Äôs first term, Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúreal rally‚Äù didn‚Äôt start until 2017‚Äôs second quarter. Per the post, ‚ÄúBTC‚Äôs real gains during Trump‚Äôs first presidency started after Q1 2027. For the first two months, BTC just consolidated in a range similar to now.‚Äù Then, it started to gain momentum in April, pumping from $1,400 to $20,000 until December 2017. Ted considers that if Bitcoin continues to follow its 2017 path, it could see a massive rally toward a new all-time high (ATH) later this year. It‚Äôs worth noting that Q2 has historically been mostly favorable for BTC, CoinGlass data shows. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital also suggested that Bitcoin will likely continue consolidating a little bit longer after the recent price correction. The analyst pointed out that BTC failed to confirm its breakout from its triangular market structure. He previously explained that, over the past six weeks, BTC has been consolidating between the two biggest bull market Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the 21-week and 50-week EMAs, in a ‚Äúvery similar fashion to mid-2021.‚Äù Related Reading: XRP & These Altcoins Share The Same TA Fate‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs Coming? The analyst added that in mid-2021, ‚ÄúBitcoin didn‚Äôt break from this similar triangular market structure right away either, upside-wicking towards and into the 21-week EMA but ultimately rejecting from there to experience additional consolidation between the two EMAs.‚Äù This could suggest that the flagship crypto ‚Äúis sentenced to a bit more consolidation between the two EMAs‚Äù before attempting to ‚Äúkickstart an uptrend continuation towards the Re-Accumulation Range Low of $93,500.‚Äù As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $83,297, a 1% increase in the daily timeframe.

The layer-one cryptocurrency lost about 10% in value during the previous week amid intense market selling pressure. Currently, SOL is trading below the significant $130 mark. Following a firm rejection at the $145 resistance level, there is uncertainty among traders regarding whether the next major target will be $200 or $100. Will Solana Price Bounce to $200 or Hit $100? The Solana price experienced an almost 57% decline from its peak value of $294, which occurred on January 19, 2025. The cryptocurrency shows potential for recovery since its broader market continues to grow positively. The current value of the worldwide crypto market stands at $2.69 trillion, which represents a small 1.30% rise over the past 24 hours. The increasing market capitalization creates positive signals for Solana‚Äôs potential price recovery. The total crypto market volume surpassed $76.09 billion during the last 24 hours because it experienced a significant growth of 35.83%. An increase in market activity suggests Solana could see price recovery alongside strengthening meme coin performance that is associated with Solana. The current value for BTC price hovers around $83,000 while stabilizing itself as an essential market-driving force. A further Bitcoin price gain might create a more positive movement for SOL because of this correlation. The market speculation surrounding Solana ETFs functions as an additional positive factor for the prices. Since the announcement of 2025 Solana ETF approval the market reacted favorably by boosting its value by 8% during the last 24 hours. According to polymarketcap data the upcoming growth rate of Solana token stands at 82% which might initiate a strong price rally. Source- Polymarket The price of Solana may fall back to $100 only if the entire market shows further declining trends. The market condition continues to weaken prices down when investors show negative market sentiment. The price trajectory of Solana during the arriving weeks will mostly rely on how the market operates. SOL Price Analysis The latest SOL price trends suggest significant levels to monitor as the cryptocurrency experiences ongoing fluctuations. Currently, the SOL price is $126, showing a slight increase of 1.65%the past 24-hours. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bearish signal as the histogram remains in the red zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another key indicator, currently standing at 42, which falls below the neutral 50 level, indicating a neutral trend. Source: TradingView If the Solana price prediction manages to break through the $150 resistance, SOL could test these levels: 170, 180, and the next significant level near $200. However, if the downward pressure persists, a drop toward the $120 support could be the next, and if the bear mounts more pressure, the SOL price could decrease to the $100 support level.

The intensity of struggles increased with Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff plan introduction and various other events, causing investors‚Äô sentiments to become bearish. As the Ethereum price crashed, multiple whales sold in fear of a further downtrend. However, experts believe in a different approach, as a few claim that April‚Äôs macroeconomic events will bring an ETH price rally. Crypto Whale Offloads ETH After Ethereum Price Crash 10% Despite being the second biggest cryptocurrency of the market, ETH was not immune to the market‚Äôs volatility and unpredictability. Amid the bear‚Äôs dominance, the Ethereum price lost 10% of its value in the week alone and 54% from the December 2024 peak, influencing investors‚Äô sentiments severely. As a result, reports reveal that the short-term holders have lost more than $400M, with the investors fearful sentiments amid the Trump administration‚Äôs reciprocal tariff event. One Ethereum whale alone offloaded 3,732 ETH, equivalent to $6.82M on the coinbase exchange. The whale will bear a staggering $1.8M loss if they sell these. Although the loss and seller‚Äôs activity have been high, ETH staking and exchange reserve reports suggest that long-term holders are maintaining bullish sentiments. With a 3% surge in price, currently trading at $1,859.51, experts anticipate complete recovery. Experts Advise Buying the Ethereum Price Crash Dip Ethereum‚Äôs status as a top cryptocurrency has kept the investors‚Äô bullish perspective alive. Soma analysts like CryptoELITES believe that the ETH is at its bottom and will rally 700% by the end of the year. Another added that the recovery is hard and fast despite Ethereum and other cryptos having the worst Q1 in seven years. He claimed that macroeconomic factors like Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs and inflation concerns drove this downtrend instead of a break in historic cycles. However, at the same time, the experts believe that upcoming macroeconomic investments, like tariff announcements and inflation reports, would assist in the recovery. In an X post, crypto analyst symbiote claims the rise in gold and inflation would lead to their fall, pushing investors to cryptocurrencies. With the rise of gold, tariffs, and inflation, inflation will eventually start to fall. And if investors believe inflation is under control, they will shift to more risky assets like crypto He believes these events could trigger a shift in digital assets if the inflation comes under control, before predicting an ETH price rally to $5,000. The analysts cited ETH‚Äôs 2017 rally, where it jumped from $30 to $1400, making 46x returns. Mixing historical performances and macroeconomic events, analysts ‚Äò Ethereum price prediction hints at an upcoming rally. Bottom Line The crypto market crash under the influence of U.S. key macroeconomic events has affected investors‚Äô sentiments significantly. As a result, Ethereum declined to the current level of $1,863.05 but is attempting recovery today before Trump‚Äôs new tariff announcement . Analysts anticipate that these macroeconomic events could bring significant recovery, even an ETH price rally, so investors must keep an eye on that.

The announcement, scheduled for April 2 at 3 p.m. Washington time. Trump and his administration will roll back trade practices that are ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to American businesses and workers. Members of the president‚Äôs Cabinet will join him at the event, which marks a key step in his push to implement reciprocal tariffs across multiple trading partners. Leavitt told reporters that Trump is ‚Äúcommitted to implementing‚Äù sectoral tariffs as well, though those are not the main focus of Wednesday‚Äôs plan. She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for reciprocity, and it‚Äôs time for a president to take historic change to do what‚Äôs right for the American people.‚Äù Leavitt declined to give specifics on the exact rates or which nations could be affected, but she indicated that no exemptions are in place yet for items used by American agriculture. Trump himself hinted that the reciprocal tariffs might apply to ‚Äúall countries,‚Äù suggesting an expansive approach. He has been open about his intention to mirror the duties other governments impose on U.S. exports, saying on Monday, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre reciprocal. So whatever they charge us, we charge them, but we‚Äôre being nicer than they were. They took advantage of us, and we are going to be very nice by comparison.‚Äù He noted that the numbers would be ‚Äúlower than what they‚Äôve been charging us, and in some cases may be substantially lower.‚Äù He has described these upcoming tariffs as vital to restoring fairness in global trade. Leavitt said that current trade practices have put Americans out of business During a Monday press briefing, Leavitt pointed to tariff rates from the European Union, Japan, India, and Canada as examples of barriers that have, in her words, ‚Äúput a lot of Americans out of business and out of work.‚Äù Trump has called April 2 the official start for wide-ranging duties meant to shift global trade in America‚Äôs favor, nurture manufacturing, and raise government revenue to support national programs, including what he describes as a ‚Äúmajor tax cut.‚Äù This move follows earlier tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China‚ÄîAmerica‚Äôs three largest trading partners‚Äîas well as on automobiles, steel, and aluminum. He has also floated additional levies on pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and lumber imports. Uncertainty surrounding the administration‚Äôs plans has caused anxiety in financial markets, with some worried that a large-scale tariff policy could disrupt supply chains and raise consumer prices. Average tariff levels. Source: US ITC, Customs, Census Bureau, Bloomberg Economics. A spell of volatility on Wall Street has been tied to such concerns, leading to a sell-off that continued through Monday. In response, Leavitt told reporters, ‚ÄúWall Street will work out just fine in this administration, just like they did in the first term.‚Äù Leavitt also mentioned that the president could extend these tariffs to other goods in the months ahead. The tariffs could potentially push rates to levels not seen since the 1800s, based on earlier remarks by Trump officials. There is speculation that Trump may adjust the final numbers, since he has sometimes changed course at the last minute. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

With the market heating up and altcoins prepping for liftoff, a few standout projects are flashing serious breakout signals. One name buzzing through the presale scene? Dawgz AI , a bold new contender blending AI-driven tech with meme-level community firepower. It‚Äôs already pulling in millions before even hitting exchanges. Ready to see which coins could rocket next month? These three are looking primed for takeoff. Best Crypto to Buy Now - 3 Coins With Huge Potential The crypto market‚Äôs waking up, and these three coins are showing serious signs of a breakout. From presale gems to rising stars, here‚Äôs who‚Äôs ready to run. 1. Dawgz AI First up is Dawgz AI , a presale gem making waves in the crypto space. With a price of just $0.004 it‚Äôs already raised $3.1 million in presale, and for good reason. Dawgz AI combines powerful AI trading tech with meme worthy branding and a community first mission. It‚Äôs not copying; it‚Äôs creating. As the market moves towards utility driven projects with viral appeal Dawgz AI is one of the cryptos to buy now before April brings the big momentum. Whales are sniffing it out and the Dawgz Army is growing fast. Features That Make Dawgz AI Stand Out When it comes to blending innovation, accessibility, and viral potential, Dawgz AI checks all the right boxes, here‚Äôs what makes this underdog truly stand out. Blackbox AI Trading Bots: Dawgz AI is powered by elite-level trading bots built by data scientists and Wall Street veterans. These bots scan live market data and execute trades in real-time, giving users an edge without lifting a finger. Built-in Staking (During Presale): Investors don‚Äôt have to wait for launch to earn. Dawgz AI offers instant staking after purchase, letting you earn rewards while the presale is still live. Meme Power With Utility: It‚Äôs got that meme energy, but this project actually does something. From staking to AI tools, Dawgz AI gives its token real-world value and the kind of viral potential meme coins dream of. Transparent & Audited: Dawgz AI has been fully audited by Solidproof, offering investor peace of mind from day one. The team is doxxed, the smart contract is secure, and the roadmap is bold but clear. Tokenomics Built for Growth: With 30% of tokens going to presale, 20% to staking rewards, and 24% allocated for marketing, Dawgz AI is set up to scale fast, without selling out the community. How to Buy Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Getting in early on Dawgz AI is simple, fast, and could be your smartest move before April‚Äôs action kicks off. Step 1: Visit the Official Dawgz AI Website - Head to the official Dawgz AI page to access the live presale and see the current price tier. Step 2: Connect Your Wallet - Use MetaMask or any Web3 wallet. Make sure you‚Äôre on the Ethereum network. Step 3: Choose Your Currency - You can purchase $DAGZ using ETH or USDT (ERC-20). Enter the amount you want and approve the transaction. Step 4: Stake Instantly (Optional but Rewarding) - Right after purchase, you‚Äôll be given the option to stake your tokens and start earning passive rewards immediately. Step 5: Claim Your Tokens Post-Presale - Once the presale ends, unstaked tokens can be claimed from the site using the same wallet you purchased with. 2. XRP XRP has been around for over a decade, and it‚Äôs still one of the most efficient and scalable cryptos in the space. Built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), it offers lightning-fast transactions, minimal fees, and massive real-world adoption. Whether you're bullish on DeFi, tokenization, or cross-border payments, XRP continues to be a go-to asset for enterprise-level solutions. Key Stats of XRP: According to CoinMarketCap , these are the current XRP stats: Price: $2.12 Market Cap: $123.91B 24h Volume: $4.44B (+53.27%) Circulating Supply: 58.2B XRP Max Supply: 100B XRP Transactions Speed: 3‚Äì5 seconds Fee per Transaction: $0.0002 Why XRP Still Stands Out With increased momentum following recent legal wins and ecosystem upgrades, many are wondering what‚Äôs next.

The Graph As crypto ecosystems grow more complex, The Graph is quietly doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Often referred to as the ‚ÄúGoogle of blockchains,‚Äù GRT powers decentralized data querying for major networks like Ethereum and IPFS. It enables developers to access blockchain data through open APIs called subgraphs, which have already surpassed 3,000+ deployments and support major DeFi players like Uniswap, AAVE, and Decentraland. With GRT‚Äôs core indexing protocol becoming critical infrastructure for dApps, this altcoin is gaining long-term strength, not from hype, but from real Web3 utility. Key Stats: According to CoinMarketCap, these are the current The Graph stats: Price: $0.08883 Market Cap: $868.42M 24h Trading Volume: $31.8M (+16.55%) Circulating Supply: 9.77B GRT Total Supply: 10.8B GRT Why Dawgz AI Has the Biggest Potential? Among all the altcoins gaining momentum, Dawgz AI stands out as the most explosive sleeper pick, and here‚Äôs why. It‚Äôs still in presale, meaning entry is dirt cheap at $0.004, yet it‚Äôs already raised over $3.1 million and building serious buzz. While XRP and GRT are strong in their own right, they‚Äôve already hit major milestones. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, is just getting started. It combines three power plays: AI utility, meme-powered virality, and staking rewards - all from day one. It‚Äôs fully audited, community-driven, and loaded with early-stage upside. If you‚Äôre looking for that ‚ÄúI got in early‚Äù moment before a coin goes parabolic, Dawgz AI might just be it.

Historically, the month has seen crypto prices rise by 12% to 30%, and with President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù just one day away, the excitement has doubled. Already, Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has surged past $83,000, recovering from a short decline over the past five days. Now the big question is, Will Trump‚Äôs tariff decisions have a big impact on the market? And could Bitcoin reach $100,000 soon, or will we need to wait a bit longer for that? Trump‚Äôs Liberation Day: A Turning Point for Crypto? The announcement of Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù initially caused a dip in the crypto market, with big players like Bitcoin (BTC) falling 5% and Ether (ETH) dropping 10%. The tariffs were seen as part of a strategy for trade deals and border security, but their impact on crypto is still unclear. Some analysts think the uncertainty could lead to a short rally if Trump changes or removes some tariffs. Perhaps, global economic factors like liquidity issues and rate cuts from central banks could limit any big gains. On the other hand, if the tariffs lead to a recession or increase economic tensions, the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates or introduce stimulus measures. This, in turn, could spark increased demand for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially starting a longer-lasting bullish trend. Bitcoin Eying $100K Mark Bitcoin‚Äôs recent movement suggests a recovery is already in progress. After dipping below $80,000, Bitcoin has surged back above $83,000 , now eyeing the $85,000 resistance level. Market analyst Enmanuel Cardozo believes the second quarter could see further gains, particularly if the Federal Reserve follows through on expected rate cuts and Trump‚Äôs policies favor the crypto market. According to Cardozo, if Bitcoin can break through the $88,668 resistance, it may surge toward the $100,000 mark. However, he warns that a dip is still possible if broader macroeconomic factors cause a slowdown. Despite the optimism, Presto Research Analyst Min Jung remains cautious, pointing out that the market is in a ‚Äúwait-and-see‚Äù phase as details about Trump‚Äôs tariffs remain unclear. Other Cryptos Join the Rally While Bitcoin is leading the charge, other major cryptocurrencies are also showing signs of recovery. XRP has edged up 2%, reaching $2.10, while Solana has gained 0.6% to hit $126. Other notable cryptocurrencies like BNB, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also seen slight price increases, suggesting that the entire market is catching the bullish wave.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 08:16:25

Upcoming token unlocks, though, may set the stage for another correction. The Bullish Forecasts Pi Network‚Äôs native token ‚Äì PI ‚Äì saw the light of day on February 20 when the project finally launched its Open Network. The asset has experienced severe volatility since then, with its price reaching an all-time high of almost $3 more than a month ago and later heading south to as low as $0.68 on March 31. Despite its turbulence and evident downtrend as of late, numerous analysts continue to envision a bull run in the short term. The X user Crypto King predicted a potential 2-2.5x price increase to around $2 once ‚Äúthe market volume returns.‚Äù MOON JEFF ‚Äì an analyst who often talks about Pi Network ‚Äì shared Coincodex‚Äôs forecast that PI could soar to $2.73 by the end of this month. The crypto tracking platform also set a massive target of $27 by 2050. Several days ago, MOON JEFF assumed that PI could plummet to $0.60, describing it as ‚Äúthe only support left.‚Äù Nonetheless, the market observer expects a huge resurgence to a new all-time high of $5 should this bottom be reached . As mentioned above, PI did not tank that low, and in fact, it rebounded to as high as $0.75 several hours ago. Currently, it trades at roughly $0.72 (per CoinGecko‚Äôs data), representing a 1% increase on a daily scale. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Further Correction Based on This? PI is designed to have a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. Currently, its circulating supply stands at less than 6.8 billion, which means that over 90% of the designated supply is yet to be distributed. Most naturally, some of the analysts have taken this into account and forecasted downward pressure on the price in the coming days. For instance, Whale .Guru revealed that over 121 million PI tokens will be unlocked in the next 30 days. Moreover, data from the Pi Network block explorer breaks down the distribution of migrated mining rewards, which is the de-facto current supply available on the network, as well as the balance of locked and unlocked mining rewards within this supply. The former stands at around 5 billion, while the latter is at 1.7 billion, meaning that the lion‚Äôs share of tokens is still locked, begging the question what will happen when it frees up.

The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, with XRP showing both sharp increases and declines. Understanding key support and resistance levels is crucial to predicting its next move. Weekly Overview XRP has been in an overall uptrend, recently hitting a high of $3.02 before pulling back. The 200-week moving average between $1.75 and $1.80 is a critical support level. If XRP stays above this zone, it is likely to continue its bullish path. However, a break below this support could signal a deeper correction. Daily Chart Analysis The daily chart reveals a developing head and shoulders pattern, often associated with bearish reversals. If XRP fails to hold above $2.00, the next possible support is near the $1.85 mark, aligned with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. If it breaks through the $3.00 resistance, the bearish signal would be invalidated, and XRP could resume its upward trend. 4-Hour Chart Insights On the 4-hour chart, a rounded bottom formation is emerging, indicating potential accumulation. After bouncing from $2.35 to $2.51, XRP could face resistance between $2.52 and $2.55 if the buying pressure holds. A drop below $2.38, however, could trigger a bearish shift, leading to a decline in price.

A bullish breakout above $2.65 could lead to a test of $2.80. On the downside, selling pressure might drive XRP back to the $2.30‚Äì$2.35 range. XRP‚Äôs movement in early April will depend on its ability to hold key support and resistance levels. With optimism from the SEC vs. Ripple case resolution, XRP could see further gains, but caution is advised as market conditions evolve.

Four years on, a‚ÄÇnew token is stealing the scene as analysts suggest it could even beat SOL‚Äôs epic run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the decentralized lending platform taking the presale world by storm, raising $6 million over 4 phases with 7,700‚ÄÇholders. Now on Phase 4 at $0.025, the project‚Äôs structured tokenomics and real-world utility have helped generate forecasts of a 140% gain at its $0.06 exchange listing ‚Äî and‚ÄÇmuch higher targets afterwards. Presale Takes Off‚ÄÇIn A Hurry The presale of Mutuum Finance has attracted attention among investors looking for access to high-yield opportunities early on. Tokens‚ÄÇare up for grabs for just $0.025 at the moment, as Phase 4 continues to pick up pace before a 20% price increase to $0.03 in the next round, so don‚Äôt wait too long to take advantage of this great deal. Those fortunate enough to secure MUTM now will accrue benefits as soon‚ÄÇas Phase 5 kicks in, cashing out their profits just before the token launches on exchanges. The project‚Äôs‚ÄÇlending model, which combines mtTokens for interest-bearing deposits as well as buybacks to stabilize demand, sets it apart from speculative peers. Precede rounds raised over $1.4 million and signified a growing‚ÄÇtrust in its decentralized borrowing framework. This momentum‚ÄÇis not for nothing. According to Mutuum Finance tokenomics rewarding long-term holding are evident:‚ÄÇA return of 140% will be offered to those who purchase in the early round, while price estimates post-listing should reach about $3.50 (a staggering 13,900% increase from the current Phase 4) Those estimates are based on its revenue-sharing model that steers platform fees into‚ÄÇpurchasing MUTM tokens and controllably generates sustained demand. Pairing this with overcollateralized loans and peer-to-peer lending functionalities, the platform‚Äôs utility-driven‚ÄÇmodel threatens to position it as a market leader. Tokenomics‚ÄÇthat Drives Demand In contrast to‚ÄÇSolana‚Äôs meteoric rise driven mostly by technical innovation, Mutuum Finance combines financial pragmatism with diva-based governance. The mtTokens that represent these collateralized deposits, whether in ETH or DAI, then continue to accrue value via interest, allowing for passive‚ÄÇincome without needing to liquidate assets. At the same time the‚ÄÇprotocol‚Äôs buy-and-distribute model redirects 20% of revenue into MUTM purchases, returning tokens to stakers and negatively impacting sell pressure. Such dual mechanism is not only‚ÄÇstabilizing the prices, but ensures an organic growth with user adoption on the rise. Phase 4‚Äôs $0.025 entry point provides a tight window before the‚ÄÇnext wave. With an anticipated listing price of $0.06, this means that investors‚ÄÇthat buy now would make a profit of 140%, with analysts agreeing on reasonable mid-term target price of around $3.50 ‚Äî based on percharge DeFi platforms. If these predictions come true, a $500 investment today could snowball into $70,000 ‚Äî a possibility supported by Mutuum‚Äôs 7,700 holder base and $6 million presale. Trust Builds Through Security and‚ÄÇTransparency Mutuum Finance is currently undergoing a smart contract audit with CertiK, a well-known leader‚ÄÇin blockchain security. After the process is completed, the results will be published across‚ÄÇsocial networks, further underscoring the project‚Äôs commitment to transparency. This step minimizes risk for investors,‚ÄÇunlike meme-driven tokens that have no real use cases. With a $100000 giveaway‚ÄÇfor early participants, the audit adds a sense of urgency as Phase 4 approaches capacity. The 2021 rally was a transformational moment for Solana, recalibrating market expectations ‚Äî but ultimately was predicated upon network growth, which left it vulnerable‚ÄÇto down markets. This creates a more educated‚ÄÇvalue proposition for users of the Mutuum Finance protocol. As the DeFi sector‚ÄÇmatures beyond speculation, only projects that balance utility with shareholder alignment will be driving the narrative forward.

Ethereum developers, in collaboration with 0xbow.io, have rolled out the new Privacy Pools protocol, offering a semi-permissionless solution for private transactions while incorporating compliance measures. Meanwhile, blockchain firm Peersyst Technology has announced the testnet launch of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain for the XRP Ledger, paving the way for decentralized finance applications within the XRP ecosystem. Ethereum‚Äôs New Privacy Pools Launch With Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs Backing, Aiming to Make Privacy Normal Again A new privacy-focused protocol has officially launched on the Ethereum blockchain, promising to strike a balance between financial privacy and regulatory compliance ‚Äî a goal that has proven elusive in the crypto space over the past several years. Privacy Pools, a semi-permissionless privacy tool developed by Ethereum builders 0xbow.io, was unveiled on March 31 with backing from some of the most prominent names in the industry, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who personally made one of the first deposits into the protocol. The launch of Privacy Pools comes amid years of heated debate between regulators, crypto privacy advocates, and law enforcement agencies over the fine line between user privacy and illicit financial activity. 0xbow.io‚Äôs new solution attempts to solve this conundrum by introducing a feature that allows users to prove their funds aren‚Äôt tied to criminal actors ‚Äî while still keeping their financial activity private. At the core of Privacy Pools is an innovation called Association Sets. This mechanism dynamically groups users‚Äô deposits into anonymous pools while enforcing a key feature ‚Äî screening transactions to ensure they are not linked to illicit activity such as hacking, phishing, or scams. If a transaction is admitted but later determined to be connected to criminal behavior, it can be removed from the Association Set without impacting other users‚Äô funds or privacy. For those whose deposits are disqualified, a ‚Äùragequit‚Äù function allows them to withdraw their funds and return them to their original address. The protocol‚Äôs creators say this dynamic model can allow Privacy Pools to offer a higher level of compliance and auditability compared to earlier privacy protocols, while still preserving individual privacy. The project is part of 0xbow.io‚Äôs broader mission to ‚ÄúMake Privacy Normal Again,‚Äù reflecting the belief that privacy in financial transactions is not just a luxury but a right ‚Äî a principle increasingly under threat in the digital age. Privacy Pools isn‚Äôt just a niche experiment ‚Äî it has earned support from some of the most influential figures in the Ethereum ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin not only praised the platform‚Äôs approach but also made an early deposit into the Privacy Pools smart contract, demonstrating his confidence in the project. In total, over 21 ETH has already been transferred into Privacy Pools from 69 individual deposits, according to 0xbow.io‚Äôs data. Buterin‚Äôs participation is seen as a major vote of confidence in the privacy-focused initiative. The project has also attracted investment from several leading venture capital firms and angel investors, including Number Group, BanklessVC, Public Works, and others. The concept behind Privacy Pools was originally outlined in a September 2023 white paper co-authored by Vitalik Buterin, Chainalysis Chief Scientist Jacob Illum, academics from the University of Basel, and 0xbow.io strategic adviser Ameen Soleimani. That paper has since garnered over 12,000 downloads and has been cited in nine other academic publications, reflecting the growing interest in compliant privacy solutions for blockchain transactions. The Privacy Pools smart contract underwent a successful audit by Audit Wizard, a security firm co-founded by former Apple engineer Joe van Loon, ensuring a degree of safety and transparency for early adopters. Currently, deposits on Privacy Pools are limited to 1 ETH per user to minimize risks and encourage gradual, responsible growth. 0xbow.io has stated that these limits will be increased once the platform becomes more battle-tested and stable. A Changing Privacy Landscape in Crypto The launch of Privacy Pools is taking place against a backdrop of growing tension between crypto privacy projects and regulators worldwide. Privacy-enhancing protocols like Tornado Cash have been at the center of this conflict. In August 2022, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) after it was linked to over $7 billion worth of laundered funds, allegedly connected to North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group. However, in a dramatic turn of events, those sanctions were ruled unlawful by a US appeals court in January 2025, and Tornado Cash has since been removed from the OFAC blacklist. The damage to the privacy protocol sector‚Äôs reputation, however, has lingered. Privacy Pools attempts to avoid this fate by integrating compliance features directly into its architecture. The importance of such innovation is underscored by data from the latest Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Crime Report, which estimated that over $41 billion worth of illicit cryptocurrency transactions occurred in 2024 ‚Äî accounting for 0.14% of total on-chain volume. While this figure was down 11% from 2023, Chainalysis warned that it could still rise to $51 billion as further criminal-linked addresses are identified. As the crypto industry continues its fight for privacy and legitimacy in the face of regulatory crackdowns, the arrival of Privacy Pools may mark a turning point. By blending user privacy, technical transparency, and compliance-friendly features, Privacy Pools has the potential to set a new standard for blockchain privacy solutions ‚Äî one that could encourage regulators to rethink their stance while giving users back their right to financial privacy. Peersyst Technology Launches Testnet for Ethereum-Compatible Sidechain on XRP Ledger In other news, blockchain development firm Peersyst Technology has officially launched the testnet version of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain for the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The move marks a major milestone in Ripple‚Äôs broader strategy to integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities and smart contract functionality into its blockchain ecosystem. The launch was completed in collaboration with key industry players, including RippleX ‚Äî the development arm of Ripple ‚Äî as well as Alexar Network, a prominent Web3 interoperability platform, and Common Prefix, a blockchain science and research firm. Peersyst Technology described the initiative as a ‚Äúfirst-of-its-kind‚Äù sidechain, designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between the XRP Ledger and Ethereum's thriving decentralized finance ecosystem. The testnet rollout is the latest step in an ambitious roadmap that began in October 2022 with the launch of the devnet version of the sidechain. An updated version followed in June 2023, with ongoing improvements leading to this testnet launch. By introducing Ethereum compatibility to XRPL through this sidechain, the project aims to tap into the massive DeFi ecosystem built on Ethereum, while leveraging the speed, scalability, and efficiency of the XRP Ledger. One of the key technical features of the sidechain is that it uses XRP as its native token, ensuring that transaction fees and network operations will continue to be powered by the Ripple-linked cryptocurrency. This model is expected to further embed XRP at the heart of decentralized finance applications that will run on the sidechain. Peersyst Technology stated that the initiative is designed to unlock the full potential of DeFi on the XRP Ledger without compromising the core security and scalability features of the main XRPL network. Following the successful testnet launch, Peersyst confirmed that it is now actively working on onboarding new partners and validators. These partnerships will play a crucial role in decentralizing the sidechain and ensuring its long-term security and resilience. Ripple Leadership Backs Sidechain Initiative The sidechain project has received vocal support from David Schwartz, Chief Technology Officer of Ripple and one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger. In September 2024, Schwartz expressed his hopes for the project‚Äôs success, stating, ‚ÄùI hope the XRPL EVM sidechain is extremely successful and competitive as a smart contract platform and will be another XRP ecosystem.‚Äù The testnet launch comes at a pivotal time for Ripple and the broader XRP community. As blockchain platforms increasingly compete to attract DeFi developers and liquidity, the addition of EVM compatibility could transform XRPL into a more versatile and competitive smart contract platform. By opening the door to Ethereum -based decentralized applications (dApps), the new sidechain can provide developers with access to familiar tooling and programming languages like Solidity, while also benefiting from the XRP Ledger‚Äôs fast and low-cost transaction infrastructure. For XRP holders, the sidechain promises new opportunities to engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi activities without needing to leave the XRPL ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MINING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-01 09:30:00
42743408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=721715,1743499809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42743408.jpeg,"Arthur Hayes Predicts $250,000 Bitcoin As Fed Caves To QE Pressure",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/arthur-hayes-250000-bitcoin-fed-caves-qe-pressure/,"In a new essay published on March 31, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes lays out a case for a $250,000 Bitcoin price target by year-end, grounded in his belief that the US Federal Reserve has effectively capitulated to fiscal dominance and resumed de facto quantitative easing (QE) for US Treasury markets. The essay, laced with vivid satire and underpinned by rigorous macroeconomic analysis, argues that the Fed‚Äôs recent shift in policy signals a structural return to fiat liquidity expansion‚Äîan environment historically beneficial to Bitcoin and other hard assets. ‚ÄúPowell proved last week that fiscal dominance is alive and well,‚Äù Hayes wrote. ‚ÄúTherefore, I am confident QT, at least regarding treasuries, will stop in the short to medium term‚Ä¶ Bitcoin will scream higher once this is formally announced.‚Äù QE Returns, Fiat Dies, Bitcoin Flies Hayes centers his argument on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs March FOMC meeting, during which Chair Jerome Powell suggested that balance sheet reduction‚Äîor Quantitative Tightening (QT)‚Äîwould slow considerably. Powell stated: ‚ÄúWe strongly want the MBS [mortgage-backed securities] to roll off our balance sheet at some point. We would look closely at letting the MBS roll off but keep the overall balance sheet size constant.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead This policy configuration, dubbed ‚ÄúQT Twist‚Äù by Hayes, implies that the Fed will reinvest MBS runoff proceeds into US Treasuries, thereby supporting bond prices while holding the nominal balance sheet steady. Hayes characterizes this as ‚Äútreasury QE,‚Äù even if not labeled as such. ‚ÄúIf the Fed balance sheet is kept constant, then they can buy: Max $35 billion per month of treasuries or annualized $420 billion,‚Äù Hayes calculated. In addition, the tapering of Treasury QT from $25 billion to $5 billion per month represents an annualized $240 billion positive shift in dollar liquidity. To frame the Fed‚Äôs political constraints, Hayes invoked a satirical dialogue in which Powell is subjected to humiliation by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äîa fictionalized dramatization that underscores the subordination of monetary policy to fiscal necessity. In this theatrical allegory, Powell is told by Bessent: ‚ÄúNext week at the FOMC, you are going to start tapering QT for my treasury bonds and announce that QE for treasury bonds will start in the near future. Do you understand?‚Äù Hayes reinforces his point by drawing historical parallels to Arthur Burns, Fed Chair during the inflationary 1970s, who admitted in his 1979 speech ‚ÄúThe Anguish of Central Banking‚Äù that political pressure rendered the Fed powerless to stop inflation. Burns wrote: ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve was itself caught up in the philosophic and political currents that were transforming American life and culture‚Ä¶ Monetary policy came to be governed by the principle of under-nourishing the inflationary process while still accommodating a good part of the pressures in the marketplace.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Accumulate as Short-Term Holders Capitulate‚ÄîWhat This Mean for BTC Hayes sees the same dynamic today, intensified by the government‚Äôs ballooning debt burden and the need to finance deficits at low yields. Trump‚Äôs Policy Agenda Hayes ties the Fed‚Äôs pivot to the political realities of a second Trump administration, particularly its industrial policy goals. Trump has pledged to reduce the US fiscal deficit from 7% to 3% of GDP by 2028, while reshoring manufacturing, sustaining military spending, and avoiding cuts to entitlements. However, Hayes argues that these objectives are mathematically incompatible without central bank support, given the scale of debt issuance required. ‚ÄúThe maths don‚Äôt add up unless Bessent can find a buyer of treasuries at an uneconomically high price or low yield. Only US commercial banks and the Fed have the firepower to buy the debt at a level the government can afford.‚Äù To unlock that capacity, Hayes anticipates the Fed will not only halt QT but also exempt banks from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR)‚Äîa key regulatory constraint limiting bank purchases of U.S. Treasuries. Bessent himself hinted at such a move on the All-In Podcast, stating: ‚ÄúIf we take [SLR] away‚Ä¶ we might actually pull treasury bill yields down by 30 to 70 basis points. Every basis point is a billion dollars a year.‚Äù Hayes maintains that Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to benefit from this shift in monetary regime. Unlike equities, which are entangled in the legal and political architecture of the state, Bitcoin is a bearer instrument native to the digital realm, with no counterparty risk. ‚ÄúBitcoin trades solely based on the market expectation for the future supply of fiat,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIf my analysis‚Ä¶ is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end.‚Äù Referencing gold‚Äôs reaction to QE1 in 2008‚Äì2009, Hayes highlights how liquidity injections can lead to delayed but explosive repricing of anti-fiat assets. In his view, Bitcoin is now playing the same role gold once did‚Äîonly faster and with more direct global exposure. Hayes also offered insight into Maelstrom‚Äôs capital deployment approach. ‚ÄúWe use no leverage, and we buy in small clips relative to the size of our total portfolio,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have been buying Bitcoin and shitcoins at all levels between $90,000 to $76,500.‚Äù At press time, BTC traded at $83,500.

Catslap Launched in the fourth quarter of 2024 when the cat-themed meme coin narrative was at an all-time high, Catslap offers a unique bouquet of perks. While its use cases are novel, they have social attributes that could put cat-themed meme coins front and center once again. Central to this ecosystem is the Slap-to-Earn mechanic, which users can engage with by simply visiting the website and pressing the slap button. Each slap triggers an animation of a cat slapping other memes, which could be anything from Donald Trump to Chuck Norris. The magic of this mechanic lies in the fact that each slap is counted, and when periodic airdrops, known as Slapdrops, occur, users with the highest number of slaps are rewarded with native SLAP tokens. Running parallel to this utility are token burns, meaning a proportional number of $SLAP tokens are burned depending on the total number of slaps. Catslap's price is currently undergoing recovery, reflecting the broader crypto ecosystem where prices have started to slowly rebound. However, with time and the introduction of more memes, Catslap could see explosive growth, as it is a meme coin offering far more than just a static image on the official website. Summary As Bitcoin is predicted to enter an acceleration phase, increased market volatility is highly likely. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to quickly focus on acquiring the best crypto to buy now, especially tokens that are low-cap and in presales, as they have a greater potential to grow during such a phase.

The company has not confirmed any date to publicly list its shares, but reports have it Circle is looking at a late April date. Other multinational companies have followed a similar path to solidify their market presence. Tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Meta expanded on a global scale and improved product development through their IPOs. Fintech firms such as Coinbase and Robinhood have also entered the public markets to establish themselves as staples of the financial sector. Circle‚Äôs attempts at public listing Circle initially attempted to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Concord Acquisition Corp., in 2021, which would have put its valuation at $9 billion. However, it abandoned those plans in late 2022 due to increased regulatory scrutiny and unfavorable market conditions following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. The company, unwilling to give up, confidentially filed for an IPO in early 2024. In Circle‚Äôs CEO, Jeremy Allaire‚Äôs words : ‚ÄúWe are very committed to the path of going public. We think we can be a really interesting company in public markets.‚Äù Circle announced plans to relocate its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in 2024 as part of preparations for its public debut. That move was expected to be finalized in early 2025, but it is yet to be confirmed. The proposed headquarters at the One World Trade Center would have positioned Circle in close proximity to major financial institutions and eased its integration with traditional financial firms. While Circle‚Äôs confidential IPO filing occurred over a year ago, the decision to make the paperwork public has created an opportunity for a deep look at Circle‚Äôs financials. It also marks the final step towards a public listing of its shares. The public filing also discloses the company‚Äôs proposed ticker symbol. Circle‚Äôs offering would be the biggest crypto IPO since Coinbase went public in 2021 using a direct listing. JPMorgan and Citi were also a part of the team that served as financial advisors for the Coinbase listing, according to regulatory filings. Market conditions and regulatory approval Circle‚Äôs IPO comes at an opportune time for the company as the market for new public listings has improved significantly from 2024. So far this year, 73 companies have gone public on U.S. exchanges, which shows a 70% increase from 2024. The total value of those deals was $11.8B, a 39% increase from the same time period in the previous year, according to data from Dealogic. Several well-known companies, including eToro, Stubhub and Klarna have also filed to go public. As crypto exploded in 2021, USDC became widely used for decentralized financial applications and crypto trading settlement, fueling an explosion of its market capitalization from under $1B in 2020 to over $60B in 2025. The SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance engaged in an extensive almost year-long correspondence with Circle, raising concerns about whether USDC should be considered a security and if Circle qualifies as an ‚Äúinvestment company,‚Äù which would subject it to additional regulatory requirements. While Circle has so far faced challenges on the path to becoming publicly listed, the company believes that fulfilling that goal will enhance its transparency, trust, and compliance, which aligns with its long-term strategy to solidify its position in the financial industry. Allaire often emphasizes the importance of this goal to the company. ‚ÄúWe believe becoming a U.S.-listed, publicly traded company is critical to our future,‚Äù he said. The Trump administration has so far delivered on its promise to progress crypto regulation, and legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act could provide comprehensive federal and state-level regulation for stablecoin issuers like Circle. That regulatory clarity and stability could explain why the stablecoin issuer is confident with advancing its IPO plans this year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The so-called block trade carried a premium of more than $1 million for 1,180 contracts of the $70,000 put option expiring April 25, according to data tracked by Amberdata . A put option gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put buyer is essentially bearish on the market, in this case, anticipating a price drop to below $70,000 from the current $84,000. A block trade is a large, privately negotiated transaction executed outside the public market,¬†typically by institutions, to avoid affecting the going market rate. Other notable trades included a put ratio spread, featuring long positions in the $75,000 strike put and double short positions in the $70,000 put; and a risk reversal, involving a long position in the $90,000 call and a short position in the $70,000 put, as Pelion Capital founder Tony Stewart noted. The bearish flow in the $70,000 put follows purchases of put options expiring April 4 in the $78,000 to $85,000 range last week and increased demand for the $76,000 put option expiring on April 25. Broadly speaking, BTC puts are trading at a premium to calls, exhibiting downside sentiment out to the May-end expiry, as evident from the negative values in risk reversals. The bias for puts offering downside protection likely reflects investor anxiety surrounding President Donald Trump's expected reciprocal tariffs announcement on Wednesday. An aggressive move could weigh on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Options|Deribit,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-01 09:31:17

Enter 0xbow, a privacy-focused infrastructure provider, making waves with its latest offering: Privacy Pools. Inspired by groundbreaking research co-authored by Ethereum‚Äôs visionary co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, Privacy Pools are poised to redefine how we think about onchain privacy . Are you ready to take control of your digital footprint in the crypto space? What are Privacy Pools and Why Should You Care About Onchain Privacy? Imagine a world where you can transact on the blockchain without revealing your entire financial history to prying eyes. This is the promise of onchain privacy , and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly crucial as blockchain technology matures. While blockchains offer unprecedented transparency, this transparency can also be a double-edged sword. Every transaction is recorded and publicly accessible, potentially exposing sensitive personal and financial information. This is where Privacy Pools step in as a game-changer. Privacy Pools are designed as a cutting-edge solution to enhance confidentiality in cryptocurrency transactions. They are not about enabling illicit activities; instead, they are about empowering individuals to maintain their financial privacy within the bounds of the law. Think of it as using encrypted communication channels in a world where everyone else is shouting their conversations in public. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: The Secret Sauce Behind Privacy Pools The magic behind Privacy Pools lies in the ingenious application of zero-knowledge proofs. But what exactly are these cryptographic marvels? In simple terms, zero-knowledge proofs allow you to prove something is true without revealing any information about the ‚Äòsomething‚Äô itself. It‚Äôs like convincing someone you know a secret password without actually telling them the password. Applied to Privacy Pools, this technology enables users to anonymously transfer ERC-20 tokens. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: Anonymity: Transactions are conducted without revealing the sender or receiver‚Äôs identities. Verification: The system can verify that transactions are legitimate and comply with rules without needing to see the transaction details. Prevention of Illicit Funds: A crucial aspect is the design to prevent the inflow of illicit funds into these pools, differentiating them from traditional mixing services often associated with money laundering. This innovative approach ensures that while privacy is enhanced, the integrity of the blockchain and the legitimacy of transactions are maintained. It‚Äôs a delicate balance, expertly engineered by 0xbow. ERC-20 Tokens and the Versatility of Privacy Pools Privacy Pools are initially designed to work with ERC-20 tokens , the workhorse token standard of the Ethereum network. Why is this significant? ERC-20 tokens are ubiquitous in the crypto ecosystem, representing a vast array of digital assets, from stablecoins to utility tokens and beyond. By focusing on ERC-20 compatibility, Privacy Pools immediately become relevant and usable for a large segment of the cryptocurrency market. This means users can now explore enhanced privacy for a wide range of their crypto holdings. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into the potential applications: Use Case Benefit for User Private DeFi Transactions Engage in decentralized finance activities without exposing your trading strategies or portfolio holdings. Anonymous Payments Make payments for goods and services with greater privacy, shielding your financial transactions from unnecessary scrutiny. Enhanced Security Reduce the risk of targeted attacks by obscuring your on-chain financial footprint. Addressing the Challenges of Blockchain Privacy Creating truly private transactions on a public blockchain is no easy feat. Blockchain privacy faces several inherent challenges: Transparency by Design: Blockchains are inherently designed to be transparent and auditable. Overcoming this fundamental characteristic requires sophisticated cryptographic solutions. Regulatory Scrutiny: Privacy solutions in crypto often face regulatory concerns due to fears of misuse for illegal activities. Balancing privacy with regulatory compliance is a critical challenge. User Experience: Privacy tools need to be user-friendly to ensure widespread adoption. Complex cryptographic processes must be abstracted away for the average user. Privacy Pools, with their foundation in academic research and focus on preventing illicit fund flows, aim to address these challenges head-on. By using zero-knowledge proofs and designing with regulatory considerations in mind, 0xbow is striving to create a privacy solution that is both powerful and responsible. Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs Influence: A Stamp of Approval for Privacy Pools The fact that Privacy Pools are inspired by a research paper co-authored by Vitalik Buterin , a towering figure in the crypto world, lends significant credibility to the project. Buterin‚Äôs involvement signals that this approach to privacy is not only innovative but also aligned with the broader vision for Ethereum and the future of blockchain technology. His research likely provided the theoretical underpinning and validation for the cryptographic techniques employed in Privacy Pools. This connection to Buterin‚Äôs work can be seen as a strong endorsement of the project‚Äôs potential and its adherence to sound principles of blockchain design. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for the Privacy-Focused Future As privacy pools and similar technologies mature, what can you do to stay ahead of the curve and prepare for a more privacy-centric crypto future? Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with developments in blockchain privacy technologies, including Privacy Pools and other emerging solutions. Educate Yourself on Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Understanding the basics of zero-knowledge proofs will help you appreciate the technical underpinnings of these privacy tools. Explore Privacy-Enhancing Tools: As Privacy Pools and similar solutions become more readily available, consider experimenting with them to understand their benefits and limitations. Advocate for Responsible Privacy: Support initiatives that promote privacy in crypto while also addressing legitimate regulatory concerns and preventing misuse. Conclusion: Embracing a New Era of Onchain Privacy 0xbow‚Äôs Privacy Pools represent a significant step forward in the quest for blockchain privacy . By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs and drawing inspiration from the research of thought leaders like Vitalik Buterin, they are paving the way for a future where users can enjoy the benefits of cryptocurrency transactions with greater confidentiality and control over their personal information. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, solutions like Privacy Pools will be crucial in shaping a more balanced and user-centric ecosystem. The era of truly private onchain transactions is dawning ‚Äì are you ready to embrace it?

This prediction has triggered a concern amongst investors. In the wake of this ADA price news, many investors are moving to Remittix (RTX) for better gains. Read on to learn more. ADA price set to rally in May after falling in April Experts say ADA price has been in a phase of consolidation that may cause a notable price surge in the next few months. Since ADA price behavior seems to be following that of 2024, the cryptocurrency, which is now trading at around $0.66, gives investors optimism despite recent declining pressure. With trade volume decreasing over 20% to $ Pence.32 million, the third-largest bitcoin by market capitalization has dropped around 3.5% in the last 24 hours. Though there is a temporary slump, on-chain data and historical trends point to a possible turnaround on hand. Master Kenobi on cryptocurrencies has found startling parallels between ADA‚Äôs present actions and price swings from Q3 2024. Cardano had a sharp drop in early August last year before going into a protracted consolidation period that finally produced a surge. The trend of this year is somewhat similar. ADA price has been stabilizing without noting any new lows after a plunge to $0.49 in early February. ‚ÄúADA is now in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August-September 2024‚Äù, noted Master Kenobi on social media platform X . Should history repeat itself, May may prove to be a critical month for Cardano investors. Following this consolidation period, Master Kenobi projects ADA may have ‚Äúa massive pump, maybe pushing the price towards $2.5.‚Äù Rising whale activity in the Cardano ecosystem helps to support this optimistic view. Data provided by analyst Ali Martinez indicates that during the previous week alone, big investors bought 240 million ADA tokens. Remittix eyes a massive rally By way of its innovative solution for traditional remittance systems, Remittix aims to address long-standing problems in international banking. Imagine being able to quickly convert cryptocurrencies into spendable money, free of sting and without KYC constraints. Remittix‚Äôs PayFi ecosystem provides users with an easy approach to quickly convert cryptocurrencies into fiat money, therefore enabling quick borderless money transfers at lowest cost. The platform provides actual value by facilitating flawless, virtually immediate crypto-to- fiat swaps, unlike many projects driven only by hype. Remittix not only simplifies global payments but also reduces the barrier between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional financial institutions. With a dedicated approach, robust security and compliance rules, and an emphasis on financial inclusiveness, Remittix is clearing the road for a new era of blockchain utility. Why you should buy $RTX now At $0.0734 pre-sale, the RTX currency shows high investment value. Forecasts point to significant increase; demand for original cross-border payment solutions is creating a 25x multiplier in the presale period and over 1,500% growth after launch.

EOS ( EOS ) price shot up for the third day in a row, hitting an intraday high of $0.707 on April 1 as its market cap climbed to over $1 billion when writing. The price surge was accompanied by an 87% increase in trading volume, with $371.6 million exchanged between traders. There are three main catalysts driving EOS crypto‚Äôs gains today. First off, there‚Äôs a lot of hype around EOS‚Äôs upcoming rebranding to Vaulta , expected to go live by the end of May 2025. The project is shifting its focus toward blockchain-powered banking solutions. As part of the rebrand, the EOS token will transition into Vaulta, with a fresh ticker expected to be revealed later this month. The new token will carry over all of EOS‚Äôs core tech, including its integration with exSat, the Bitcoin banking solutions. Second, the new Vaulta token will offer a staking yield of around 17% , backed by a reward pool of about 250 million tokens, placing it much higher than major players like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) at 2.03% and 5.14%, respectively. You might also like: REZ crypto soars over 35% ahead of Bithumb listing Lastly, traders in the derivatives market are clearly betting on EOS going higher. Da ta from CoinGlass shows that open interest in EOS futures surged more than 30%, hitting an 11-month high of $144.14 million. The funding rate has also flipped positive, a sign that more traders are now betting on the upside in the near term. Chart watchers are taking notice, as they believe the rally could just be getting started. Analyst CW pointed out that EOS has already cleared a key sell wall at $0.65 and now has its sights set on the $1 mark, a major psychological and technical level that the altcoin hasn‚Äôt reached since mid-December last year. Fellow analyst World of Charts echoed the same price target, noting that EOS still has plenty of momentum for a potential continuation of the ongoing rally. EOS technical analysis From a technical standpoint, things are lining up well for the bulls. On the 1-day/USDT price chart, EOS price recently broke out of a descending wedge pattern that had been holding it down for months. In technical analysis, the pattern is seen as a bullish reversal signal, especially after a long downtrend. EOS price, Supertrend and Aroon indicator ‚Äî April 1 | Source: crypto.news The move happened around the $0.45‚Äì$0.50 zone, which had acted as strong support in the past. Now, EOS is trading above $0.67 and looks to be heading toward the next key resistance near $1. The Supertrend indicator has flipped bullish, moving below the price and flashing green, a sign that the trend might be shifting in favor of the bulls. On top of that, the Aroon Up is at 100% while the Aroon Down is at 0%, showing that buying pressure is clearly dominating over any selling right now. EOS 50-day and 20-day SMA chart ‚Äî April 1 | Source: crypto.news Over on the 4-hour chart, EOS also formed a golden cross on March 25, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day SMA. The pattern hasn‚Äôt been invalidated yet and could set the stage for a longer-term move higher, with $1 as the next potential target.

Ahead of the tariff deadline ‚Äì also known as the ‚ÄòLiberation Day‚Äô ‚Äì Trump issued a stern warning that no country would be exempted from the proposed tariffs. Unsurprisingly, this has set off a market-wide sell-off, with stocks of prominent US companies closing in the red on Monday. In this article, we‚Äôll briefly touch upon the most important reasons for the current sideways/downwards sloping market, why buying the best presales is a cheat code in these conditions, and which ones should you actually consider investing in. Two Major Reasons for Current Market Uncertainty The world looked on in anticipation when Elon Musk joined Donald Trump in the latter‚Äôs historic presidential campaign. Fans of the duo were quick to call this a once-in-a-lifetime moment for crypto. Although $BTC and $ETH coughed up legendary rallies immediately after Trump‚Äôs victory, they were rather short-lived. Almost three months later and we‚Äôre now on the brink of a recession. This is primarily due to the larger macroeconomic conditions set in motion by Trump‚Äôs tariffs and Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). Trump‚Äôs Tariffs Slated to take effect from April 2, Trump‚Äôs tariffs measure will impose reciprocal tax rates on the goods imported by the US. Although Trump believes this would reduce America‚Äôs dependence on foreign goods and boost domestic production, the immediate reality is very different. These tariffs will, in fact, make goods costlier for regular folks in the US and send ease of doing business for American companies for a toss. Nvidia, for instance, imports its AI servers from Mexico, which is going to face the brunt of a 35% import tax thanks to Trump. As a result, Nvidia‚Äôs stock has fallen 22% in 2025 . Musk‚Äôs D.O.G.E Elon Musk formed D.O.G.E to reduce unnecessary federal spending. For example, the organization wants to save nearly $1T in federal expenses in 2025 alone. How does it plan to achieve this? Job cuts. And that‚Äôs a problem. The way Musk has gone about executing D.O.G.E‚Äôs mission has been preposterous, to say the least. Erratic and bulk layoffs at a federal level have led to a massive surge in job applications. And with the current market being not-so-ideal for job seekers, D.O.G.E‚Äôs extreme steps are adding fuel to the recession fire. In fact, Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway warned a while back that firing so many people and reducing the state‚Äôs budget by so much can trigger a recession on its own . Given the market scenario, it could be worthwhile checking out the best new meme coins on presale . These are projects that are yet to be listed on exchanges, which is why they‚Äôre immune to the current market instability. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Presale to Buy Right Now With Bitcoin looking poised to not only reclaim its all-time high of $100K but also scoot higher, the time is ripe to invest in a Bitcoin-themed meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It is, in fact, the ONLY crypto on the market right now that‚Äôs offering real (and completely free) $BTC to token holders. $BTCBULL owners who buy and hold their tokens in Best Wallet ‚Äì a non-custodial and easy-to-use crypto wallet ‚Äì will automatically receive their $BTC share every time the King Crypto reaches a new milestone. This includes important round figures such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the $BTCBULL team plans to keep the token‚Äôs market hype alive through regular token burn events. Furthermore, they‚Äôve also reserved a huge chunk (40%) of the total supply for PR and marketing purposes. After raising a whopping $1M within just a day after its launch, the BTC Bull Token presale now boasts over $4.3M in presale funding. One token is currently available for just $0.00244 ‚Äì here‚Äôs how to buy it . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì First-Ever L2 Protocol on Solana Solana‚Äôs inability to break the $260 level despite the token being included in Trump‚Äôs proposed US Crypto Reserve speaks volumes about its underlying problems. Essentially, the blockchain that was once the undisputed hub for meme coins is now riddled with network congestion, limited scalability, and tailed transactions. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . It‚Äôs a new cryptocurrency planning to build the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana. By processing transactions off-chain and by leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity, $SOLX will reduce Solana‚Äôs workload and make it faster and more efficient than ever. Additionally, Solaxy‚Äôs whitepaper suggests that it will also process transactions in bulk. This will further jack up Solana‚Äôs affordability ‚Äì something it‚Äôs already renowned for. Luckily for you, this revolutionary meme coin is currently in presale ($28.7M+ raised), meaning you can get it for an extremely low price. Check out Solaxy‚Äôs price prediction for a detailed insight into its future prices. 1 $SOLX is currently priced at just $0.00168, and here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to buy it . 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) ‚Äì New Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) plans to build a Solana-like ecosystem for meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. This has never been done before, which is why this project is being touted as the ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs ONLY Bitcoin Meme ICO.‚Äô It‚Äôs worth noting that BTC Bull Token, the #1 Bitcoin-themed meme coin right now, is actually based on Ethereum. Bitcoin Pepe, on the other hand, is based on the Bitcoin network. By combining Bitcoin‚Äôs class-leading liquidity and Solana‚Äôs speed and affordability, $BPEP will create a Layer-2 for meme coins on Bitcoin. Thanks to its unique mission, Bitcoin Pepe has already raised over $5.8M. It‚Äôs currently in presale, which is why each token is available for a low price of $0.0295. Conclusion Even though the above-mentioned altcoins are projected to list at a higher price than their current cost, after their listing, they‚Äôll have to work their way up in the same market ‚Äì which we can only hope reverses soon. Simply put, the crypto market guarantees no returns. This is why it‚Äôs important to only invest a small amount, irrespective of whether it‚Äôs in live tokens or presales. Also, kindly do thorough firsthand research before investing. None of the above is financial advice, after all.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-01 09:42:02

Investors and traders are closely monitoring its movements as broader market trends influence its trajectory. Below is a breakdown of XRP‚Äôs performance across different timeframes and what to expect in the coming weeks. Monthly Overview On the monthly chart, XRP has shown resilience despite market fluctuations. If XRP surpasses the key resistance of $2.56, it could push toward $3.00 or higher. However, if it fails to hold above support levels, downward pressure could increase. Weekly Performance The weekly timeframe indicates XRP is consolidating around the $2.10 level. There is a potential upswing to $3.78 by the end of April , though this will depend on breaking key resistance levels and overall market sentiment. A sustained bullish trend could pave the way for further gains. Daily Trends In the daily view, XRP has seen a 5.7% drop in the last 24 hours and a 15.8% decline over the past week, currently hovering near $2.10. While this suggests short-term bearish sentiment, a break above immediate resistance could shift momentum in a positive direction. 4-Hour Outlook Short-term analysis on the 4-hour chart reveals XRP testing crucial support levels while facing bearish pressure. The 50-day moving average is trending downward, signaling caution. However, if buyers step in at support levels, a rebound toward $2.50 could be possible. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 April 2025 Projections There is potential gains between 360% and 600% for XRP, backed by technical patterns and possible legal developments favoring Ripple. If XRP experiences a 360% increase, its price could reach around $9.66. In a highly bullish scenario with 600% growth, XRP may rise to approximately $14.70. Several factors will influence XRP‚Äôs trajectory this month: Regulatory Updates: Favorable legal outcomes for Ripple could boost investor confidence and buying pressure. Market Momentum: If Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies maintain an uptrend, XRP could benefit from increased market activity. Technical Breakouts: A decisive move above $2.56 could confirm a bullish trend and pave the way for further price surges.

As of April 1, the blockchain firm‚Äôs distribution strategy recorded the release of the first 500 million XRP , which has already been executed, according to on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from XRPScan. XRP escrow transactions. Source: XRPScan The month‚Äôs first tranche of XRP was moved from an escrow wallet to a Ripple-controlled wallet in a transaction executed at 00:00 UTC. The wallet in question has already scheduled 11 future escrow releases. Ripple‚Äôs escrow system was established to manage the controlled release of its XRP holdings. At the time, Ripple locked 55 billion XRP into escrow, with 1 billion XRP scheduled to be released monthly. These releases typically occur in phases throughout the month. After each unlock, Ripple often reallocates a portion of the XRP for operational purposes, such as supporting ecosystem development, partnerships, or market liquidity, while returning the remainder to escrow for future releases. For instance, on February 1, 2025, another 1 billion XRP unlock occurred from the Ripple (26) and Ripple (27) wallets. Of this amount, 400 million XRP and 100 million XRP were released from Ripple (26), while 500 million XRP came from Ripple (27). This release was valued at approximately $3.10 billion. On March 3, 2025, Ripple executed another 1 billion XRP unlock in three transactions. The remaining 500 million XRP from this month‚Äôs 1 billion unlock is expected to be released in the coming days or weeks, following Ripple‚Äôs typical phased approach. XRP price analysis Regarding XRP price movement, the unlocks can potentially introduce volatility for the token. However, at the moment, XRP does not seem to be significantly affected by the releases, as its price is moving in line with the broader cryptocurrency market . As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless the token remains 11% down on the weekly timeframe. XRP seven-day price chart.

All eyes are on former President Donald Trump as he gears up to unveil a new Trump tariff policy on April 2nd. The White House has confirmed the date, and whispers from CCTV News suggest senior officials have already presented proposals ‚Äì notably, without any exemptions. While Press Secretary Levitt is attempting to downplay concerns about the market impact tariffs might have, the cryptocurrency world is holding its breath. Could this be the next major catalyst for volatility, or a storm in a teacup? Let‚Äôs dive into what this April 2 tariff announcement could mean for the digital asset landscape. What‚Äôs the Buzz Around Trump‚Äôs April 2 Tariff Announcement? The anticipation surrounding Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcement is palpable, especially given his track record of using tariffs as a key tool in international trade negotiations. Remember the trade wars of the past? Those events sent ripples across global markets, and this new policy could very well do the same. The fact that proposals are on the table without exemptions suggests a potentially broad and impactful approach. But what exactly could this mean for your crypto portfolio? [img src=‚Äùimage-placeholder.jpg‚Äù alt=‚ÄùTrump Tariff Policy and Cryptocurrency Market‚Äù] Decoding the Potential Market Impact Tariffs: What to Expect? Tariffs, at their core, are taxes on imported goods. While they are designed to protect domestic industries, they often lead to a cascade of economic effects. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of potential consequences and how they could intertwine with the cryptocurrency market: Increased Inflation: Tariffs can drive up the cost of imported goods, leading to higher prices for consumers. In an inflationary environment, assets like Bitcoin are often viewed as a hedge, potentially increasing demand and price. Trade Tensions and Economic Uncertainty: New tariffs could reignite global trade tensions, creating economic uncertainty. In times of uncertainty, investors may seek safe-haven assets, and some see cryptocurrencies as a modern alternative to traditional safe havens like gold. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, impacting businesses across various sectors. This disruption can lead to market volatility, which, historically, has sometimes benefited cryptocurrency markets as traders seek alternative investments. Currency Fluctuations: Tariff policies can influence currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in major currencies can indirectly affect the cryptocurrency market, as crypto is often traded against fiat currencies like the USD. Cryptocurrency Market Reaction: How Might Crypto Respond? The cryptocurrency market reaction to Trump‚Äôs tariff announcement is far from predictable, but we can look at historical patterns and market dynamics to make informed guesses: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Why? Tariffs perceived as highly disruptive and inflationary Potential price increase in Bitcoin and some altcoins Investors seek inflation hedges and alternative assets amid economic uncertainty. Tariffs seen as targeted and limited in scope Minimal direct impact, broader market sentiment may drive crypto movements If the impact is localized, the global crypto market might be less affected directly by tariffs alone. Risk-off sentiment dominates broader markets due to tariffs Potential short-term dip in crypto prices alongside traditional markets In a widespread risk-off environment, even crypto can experience temporary sell-offs as investors reduce overall risk exposure. Global Trade Tensions: A Recurring Theme? The prospect of new tariffs brings back the specter of global trade tensions . During previous periods of trade disputes, we witnessed increased market volatility across the board. For the cryptocurrency market, which thrives on volatility and narratives, this could present both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, heightened trade tensions can contribute to a risk-averse environment, potentially leading to short-term corrections in the crypto market. On the other hand, it reinforces the narrative of cryptocurrencies as decentralized, borderless assets that are less susceptible to geopolitical headwinds compared to traditional financial systems. Navigating the Tariff Terrain: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do as we approach April 2nd? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news related to the Trump tariff policy announcement. Reputable financial news sources and crypto news platforms will be crucial. Manage Risk: Consider your portfolio risk levels. If you are risk-averse, you might want to reduce exposure or implement stop-loss orders to protect against potential downside volatility. Diversify: Diversification remains key. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified crypto portfolio, and even diversification across asset classes, can help mitigate risk. Prepare for Volatility: Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and tariff announcements can amplify it. Be prepared for potential price swings in either direction. Long-Term Perspective: Remember your long-term investment goals. Short-term market fluctuations driven by news events should ideally not derail your long-term strategy. Conclusion: Brace for Potential Waves in the Crypto Sea Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariff announcement is undoubtedly a significant event that could inject volatility into global markets, including the cryptocurrency sphere. While the exact cryptocurrency market reaction remains to be seen, understanding the potential market impact tariffs and the broader context of global trade tensions is crucial for navigating the coming weeks. Whether this tariff policy turns out to be a minor ripple or a major shockwave , being informed, prepared, and having a clear investment strategy will be your best assets in these potentially turbulent times. Keep your eyes peeled on April 2nd ‚Äì it could be a pivotal day for both traditional and digital finance.

In that time the $BTC price lost as much as $32,000, equating to around 30% of its overall value. Is Bitcoin about to start clawing its way back to the all-time high? U.S. trade tariffs about to take effect Wednesday 2 April is dubbed ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù by U.S. President Donald Trump. This is the day when the U.S. announces its plan for reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have standing tariffs imposed on U.S. goods, with an emphasis on countries with which the US has large trade imbalances. Not content with this, the U.S. will also impose a 25% tariff on all imported cars and auto parts that enter the country. This takes effect on 3 April. While there is still uncertainty as to how this will play out, not just for the U.S. domestic market, but also for global trade, at least the market will know the main extent of the U.S. strategy on tariffs by the end of this week, and then the market will have a better opportunity to price everything in. Has the S&P 500 dipped enough? The S&P 500 has lost as much as 10.6% from top to bottom during these last seven weeks since the talk of impending tariffs unsettled the market. This is the biggest dip since 10.8% in October 23, and is now more than the 9.7% reversal of the Japanese carry trade crash in August 2024. Could this current reversal continue on down as tariff reprisals start to come in from the likes of the European Union, Canada, and others? Yes, but the main thing is that these will shortly be known. The market will have the vast majority of its doubts clarified, and the current stock market dip may already have accounted for this. Gold tops as Bitcoin begins its rise With this crisis arguably about to subside, with liquidity entering the system from the likes of China, and a slackening of QT from the US, the stage could be about to be set for a resurgence from Bitcoin. With the gold price having reached $3,150, a top may be fast approaching, while the converse is true of Bitcoin, which has now perhaps found a bottom. Source: TradingView In the weekly chart above for BTC/GOLD, it can be seen that $BTC has now come down to the ascending trendline. This was a nearly 35% reversal against $GOLD, but should the bounce take place from here, it will be a very clear higher low, to add to the long sequence of higher highs and higher lows made since the beginning of the Bitcoin bull market which began in January 2023. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is also very much in Bitcoin‚Äôs favour. $BTC trend change taking place? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for the price of $BTC (BTC/USDT) shows that the price is currently trying to battle with a horizontal resistance level before moving up to the descending trendline once again. With the last vestiges of U.S. stock market uncertainty still to play out during this week, it may be that there is some further choppiness to contend with. However, if the bulls can push the price up to, and beyond the descending trendline, a higher high at $88,800 will be the next target on the road to a trend change. Of course, there is still the strong support at $80,000 to come back down to should things turn uglier than expected over the tariff wars. Bitcoin 2-week chart Source: TradingView In the 2-week chart, which shows the entirety of this bull market, it can be seen that perhaps the price is ready to break through that descending trendline. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI may be making its lowest bottom of the bull market. With 12 days left in this period, this is a possibility. It just remains to be seen whether the price will jump straight back up, or whether it will chop sideways like it did during the 8-month bull flag. How the indicators in the Stochastic RSI rise from the bottom will have a say in the strength of the next upswing. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, Remittix emerges as a leading choice for crypto investment. Remittix distinguishes itself as a solution that aims to resolve actual payment system problems. The combination of a low price with strong early market results makes Remittix an investment opportunity worth monitoring throughout 2025. Solana news: declining volume affects Solana price The recent Solana news shows that its price has recently fallen, and the volume in trading also reflects the weakness. SOL is reportedly trading at the price of around $125.21 now. Technical analysis demonstrates the downtrend of the volume, which concerns the traders. Volume downtrend typically means less availability of buyers in the market. Solana news shows that some experts anticipate a slow recovery if the levels of support continue. But the current data makes the majority of us doubt a quick recovery. The speed and low cost of Solana have helped make it well known. Recent history has given investors reason to be cautious about its future, though. Solana news suggests that if the volume is increased, the price can creep up slowly. Solana will likely go up within the next few weeks as the trading volume is expected to increase. It is said that SOL will go up by 11.01% and reach $140.10 by April 30. XRP price: current level and market predictions The XRP price stands as a leading interest point for financial investors. XRP functions to execute quick financial movements between countries at reduced costs. It serves banks in financial institutions as their main tool to transport funds across international borders. According to recent news articles XRP price achieved recovery following its recent decline by reaching the level of $2.10. XRP maintains its value because bankers continuously adopt its systems, according to experts. Technical experts predict XRP price will increase by 10-15% when worldwide payment activities gain momentum. A large number of institutions pay close attention to XRP price movements as they participate in strategic partnerships and major regulatory changes. Financial institutions which implement digital assets will continue utilizing XRP as a foundational asset, according to analysts. Industry analysts expect XRP to rise 76.42% by April 28 when it reaches a price of $3.78. Remittix is a revolutionary DeFi project solving real-world payment issues. Remittix presents a new solution for global finance. Most individuals don‚Äôt possess a bank account; around 1.4 billion individuals globally have no access to mainstream banks. Remittix is the solution for this since it facilitates crypto-to-fiat exchange with smoothness and security. Remittix operates on a framework that unites cryptocurrency and contemporary banking. The framework allows the user to transfer cryptocurrency funds directly to any bank account with minimal fees and quick processing.

That impressive start shows many people already believe in Remittix. Its current DeFi coin worth is approximately $0.0734. Several experts now cite Remittix as one of the best cryptos for long-term worth. Remittix is not only a token with elevated prices. Instead, it presents a long-awaited solution for making faster, less expensive international payments. Its mechanism is designed with the intention of cutting out excess commissions and lengthy waiting periods. With increasing numbers of entrepreneurs and individuals looking for easier ways of making payments, Remittix has a clear mission. Its user-friendly mechanism and robust early results make the token one that many shrewd investors believe. A promising future on the horizon: the next generation of FinTech As Solana news reveals that its trading volume is down, savvy investors look for alternatives with apparent utility.

Unlike previous privacy mixers like Tornado Cash, which faced sanctions for enabling illicit transactions, Privacy Pools use ‚ÄúAssociation Sets‚Äù to screen out bad actors while preserving user anonymity. The new privacy tool has garnered support from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself. Buterin, a co-author of the original Privacy Pools research paper, made one of the first deposits, expressing his confidence in the project. Market participants responded to this with enthusiasm, with Cryptolive calling it a ‚Äúprivacy breakthrough,‚Äù with sentiment suggesting it could ‚Äúmake privacy normal again‚Äù in the blockchain industry. ‚ÄúThis is huge; it‚Äôs got the backing of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin,‚Äù said DuckAI Agent, adding that it could be a sign of increased adoption and usage. ‚ÄúOverall, I'm bullish on ETH - this launch could be a game-changer for the ecosystem.‚Äù This development should increase Ethereum‚Äôs utility, potentially attracting more users and developers to the network, which in turn drives demand for ETH. Reducing ETH supply on exchanges Another factor supporting Ether‚Äôs performance today is reducing supply on exchanges. Key takeaways: ETH balance on exchanges has reached a 9-year low of 18.3 million ETH after dropping nearly 5% over the last 30 days. These are levels last seen in July 2016 when ETH was trading below $15. The amount of ETH supply on exchanges has resumed its downtrend, as shown in the chart below. ETH supply on exchanges.

ETH appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $1,900 and $2,000, where the 50-day, 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) sit. This suggests that bulls need to push the price above this area to increase the chances of reaching the neckline at $2,100 to complete the V-pattern. This would represent a 12% increase from the current price. ETH/USD daily chart.

This move is part of its efforts to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), a new set of rules designed to regulate digital assets in the region. Binance Stopped USDT Trading in EEA On March 3rd, the exchange has officially informed users about the planned delisting, setting a deadline of March 31 for non-MiCA-compliant tokens. Despite the removal of these trading pairs, users in the EEA can still hold and trade the affected stablecoins through perpetual contracts. In addition to the delisting af USDT, biancne includes other stablecoins such as Dai (DAI), First Digital USD (FDUSD), TrueUSD (TUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), Anchored Euro (AEUR), TerraUSD (UST), TerraClassicUSD (USTC), and PAX Gold. Perhaps, Binance had told its users to convert their holdings into MiCA-approved stablecoins like USDC or Eurite (EURI). Moreover, they have the Fiat trading options, such as the euro, remaining available as alternatives. Other Exchanges Follow Suit Following the Binance foot step Kraken has also delisted USDT and other stablecoins in the EEA, to comply with MiCA. The delisted stablecoins on Kraken‚Äôs exchange include PayPal USD (PYUSD), Tether EURt (EURT), and TrueUSD (TUSD). Meanwhile, Coinbase had already delisted USDT, anticipating MiCA‚Äôs impact, while a few other crypto exchange continues to trade the token as they wait for further regulatory updates.

He also vowed to take the necessary steps to mitigate the damage U.S. tariffs will cause to the economy and jobs. Japan expects a severe hit from the planned 25% tariff on automobile imports unveiled last week by U.S. President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump also promised to announce that reciprocal tariffs would target every country. Japan pushes for exemption from U.S. auto tariffs Japan will keep up a strong push for the United States to exempt it from auto tariffs, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Tuesday, while vowing to take the necessary steps to cushion the blow to the economy and jobs. ‚Äî Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) April 1, 2025 Japan‚Äôs Prime Minister revealed that the country was prepared to push for the United States to exclude it from auto tariffs. Ishiba also highlighted that Tokyo will take the necessary steps to prevent setbacks to the economy and jobs. President Donald Trump announced last week he will impose a 25% tariff on imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts, with processes to expand tariffs on additional parts if necessary. He noted that importers of automobiles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will have 25% tariffs applied only to the value of their non-U.S. content. Trump also promised to announce on April 2 reciprocal tariffs targeting every nation. The Prime Minister told a news conference that measures such as offers of funding support to cash-strapped firms were among those the government could consider to protect the economy from the higher tariffs. ‚ÄúThe government will negotiate with the ruling coalition at an early date specific measures we can take to respond.‚Äù ~ Shigeru Ishiba, Prime Minister of Japan. Ishiba acknowledged that government agencies were negotiating with U.S. counterparties to secure more details on Washington‚Äôs tariff plans. He also added that he ‚Äúwould not hesitate‚Äù to visit the United States again to voice a direct call for exemptions. Ishiba has also been grappling with sliding approval ratings ahead of an upper house election expected in July. The country‚Äôs PM has been under pressure to counter economic constraints from U.S. tariffs and shield households from rising costs of living. Japan‚Äôs inflation of 3.7% in February was among the highest in advanced economies, fueled by steady rises in food costs such as those of staple rice. Ishiba noted that the country‚Äôs big companies have offered bumper pay hikes in this year‚Äôs wage talks with unions, but it remains uncertain if smaller firms will follow suit, as Trump‚Äôs tariffs could threaten business expectations. The country‚Äôs senior official highlighted that the government would compile measures by May to push up Japan‚Äôs minimum wage. He also said a separate package by June will allow smaller companies to smoothly pass on rising costs. Ishiba noted that ‚Äúachieving wage hikes is at the core of our growth strategy.‚Äù He also stressed the need for pay hikes sufficient to compensate for the rising cost of living. Ishiba plans to mull what‚Äôs best for national interest Prime Minister Ishiba revealed on Thursday last week Japan will put ‚Äúall options on the table‚Äù in dealing with Washington‚Äôs announcement to impose a 25% tariff on automobile imports. He argued that Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment in the United States. Ishiba told parliament that ‚ÄúWe wonder if it makes sense for Washington to apply uniform tariffs to all countries.‚Äù The country‚Äôs official also said that Japan needs to consider what‚Äôs best for its national interest without elaborating on the possible steps Tokyo may take. The Ministry of Finance data revealed Japan‚Äôs automobile imports made up 28.3% of total exports to the United States in 2024, the biggest ratio among all items. The auto sector constitutes roughly 3% of Japan‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) and has been the driver of recent wage hikes. Executive economist at Nomura Research Institute (NRI) Takahide Kiuchi expects the 25% U.S. auto tariffs to push down Japan‚Äôs GDP by around 0.2%. Kiuchi maintained that the Trump tariff has the potential to immediately push Japan‚Äôs economy into deterioration.

Experts predict that certain digital coins priced under a dollar could see astonishing returns by the end of 2025. This article explores five such cryptocurrencies that analysts believe could yield gains up to 20,000%, offering insights into their prospects and why they might be poised for a significant surge. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token‚Äîit‚Äôs a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice‚Äîit has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It‚Äôs not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner‚Äùs podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $10 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Luna Classic: The Comeback of Terra‚Äùs Original Cryptocurrency Luna Classic (LUNC) is the original token of the Terra blockchain, a platform that blends traditional currencies with the world of cryptocurrency. Terra uses stablecoins pegged to various currencies like the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, and even the Mongolian tugrik. This means it aims to keep prices steady, making global payments easier and more predictable. Launched officially in April 2019, Terra offers fast and affordable transactions. In May 2022, after a significant event, the original Terra chain was renamed Terra Classic, and its native token became Luna Classic (LUNC). LUNC has the potential to make a mark in the current crypto market. While many cryptocurrencies face ups and downs, LUNC‚Äùs connection to stablecoins could offer more stability. This makes it stand out among other coins that often experience high volatility. As the market trends towards finding real-world uses for digital assets, LUNC‚Äùs focus on global payments could attract attention. In a time when investors are looking for coins with practical applications, Luna Classic might offer something unique. Stellar Lumens: Bridging Borders with Seamless Payments Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing how money moves across the world. Since its launch in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions, enabling quick and low-cost fund transfers without favoring any national currency. It‚Äùs a decentralized, open-source network that allows anyone to transfer funds globally, whether it‚Äùs digital representations of national currencies or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Companies can build blockchain applications on Stellar or use the network for payments and currency conversion, making it a versatile tool in the financial landscape. In today‚Äùs market, Stellar stands out by aiming to enhance existing financial systems rather than replace them. While many cryptocurrencies focus on overhauling finance, Stellar seeks collaboration and unification. Its partnerships with major companies demonstrate real-world adoption and trust. With the rising interest in blockchain technology and the need for efficient global payments, XLM looks attractive. It not only supports fast transactions but also embraces innovations like NFT minting and smart contracts through the Stellar Development Foundation. Compared to other coins, Stellar‚Äùs practical approach to improving financial connectivity makes it a promising option in the current market cycle. HBAR: The Fast and Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency Challenging the Norm Hedera Hashgraph is a new kind of decentralized network that‚Äùs different from traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of a blockchain, it uses something called hashgraph technology. This means it can handle more transactions at once, making it faster and more efficient. Since it doesn‚Äùt rely on mining, it‚Äùs better for the environment and has lower transaction costs. HBAR is the network‚Äùs currency, used to pay for transactions and keep the network secure through a Proof of Stake system. In a market crowded with cryptocurrencies, Hedera Hashgraph offers something unique. Its technology promises a more secure, speedy, and cost-effective way to handle transactions and smart contracts. While its patented approach might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects, it‚Äùs backed by major industry players who believe in its potential. As people look for greener and more efficient alternatives to existing cryptocurrencies, HBAR stands out as an attractive option. With its ambitious vision and innovative technology, Hedera Hashgraph could play a big role in the future of digital transactions. TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is changing the way we think about digital content. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, TRON started as a token on Ethereum but soon moved to its own network. The main idea behind TRON is simple: give full ownership to content creators. Instead of letting big companies like YouTube or Apple take a large cut, TRON allows creators to earn more by connecting them directly with their audience. Fans can reward creators without any middlemen, making the process fair and transparent. TRON‚Äùs platform supports smart contracts and decentralized applications, known as dApps. This means developers can build their own tools and services without heavy fees. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, so everything is open and trackable. In the current market, TRON stands out by focusing on decentralization and creator empowerment. While giants like Ethereum dominate the space, TRON offers a viable alternative with lower fees and a strong support for content sharing. With the growing interest in decentralized platforms, TRON presents an attractive option for both creators and consumers looking for more control and better rewards. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, HBAR, and TRX show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) is pioneering as the all-sport memecoin uniting fans, targeting 20,000% growth with a community-driven ecosystem.

42744405,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144985,1743501344,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Crypto Sell-off: Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Dumps Altcoins DHN and LEDOG,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vitalik-buterin-altcoin-selloff/,"In a move that has sent ripples across the altcoin market, a wallet address linked to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has reportedly offloaded its holdings of two lesser-known cryptocurrencies: DHN and LEDOG. On-chain analyst Onchain Lens first spotted the transactions on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting a significant sale of 5,000 DHN for 93,655 USDC and a massive 2 trillion LEDOG for 16,569 USDC. This unexpected crypto sell-off by such a prominent figure in the crypto world has sparked discussions and speculation within the community. What does this mean for the future of these specific altcoins and the broader meme coin landscape? Who is Vitalik Buterin and Why Does His Crypto Activity Matter? Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, often influences crypto market sentiment. For those new to the crypto space, Vitalik Buterin is not just anyone; he is a co-founder of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. His influence in the crypto world is immense. Often seen as a visionary and thought leader, Buterin‚Äôs actions and pronouncements can significantly impact market sentiment. When an address associated with such a figure makes notable transactions, especially a crypto sell-off , the market naturally pays attention. His moves are often interpreted as signals, rightly or wrongly, about the potential future of certain projects or the overall market direction. This latest activity involving DHN and LEDOG is no exception, prompting many to question the rationale behind this sudden divestment. Decoding the Crypto Sell-off: DHN and LEDOG Transactions in Detail Let‚Äôs break down the specifics of this notable crypto sell-off . According to on-chain data, the transactions occurred roughly around the same time. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what transpired: DHN Sale: 5,000 DHN tokens were sold for approximately 93,655 USDC. This translates to a price of roughly $18.73 per DHN at the time of the transaction. LEDOG Sale: A staggering 2 trillion LEDOG tokens were offloaded for 16,569 USDC. This sale price values each LEDOG token at an extremely minuscule fraction of a cent, highlighting the often volatile and speculative nature of these altcoins . To put these figures into perspective, while the USDC values might seem substantial in isolation, they are relatively small compared to the overall cryptocurrency market and even smaller in the context of Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. However, the significance here isn‚Äôt necessarily the monetary value, but rather the symbolic gesture of an address linked to a prominent figure like the Ethereum co-founder divesting from these particular tokens. Here‚Äôs a table summarizing the key details of the transactions: Token Amount Sold Received (USDC) Approximate Price DHN 5,000 93,655 $18.73 per DHN LEDOG 2 Trillion 16,569 ~$0.000000008 per LEDOG What Exactly are DHN and LEDOG Altcoins? Now, you might be wondering, what are DHN and LEDOG anyway? These are examples of altcoins , cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin and established giants like Ethereum. Within the vast universe of altcoins, there‚Äôs a subcategory known as meme coins . These are cryptocurrencies that often gain popularity due to internet memes, social media trends, or viral phenomena, rather than based on solid technology or fundamental value propositions. Think of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu ‚Äì they started as jokes but captured significant market attention and, at times, substantial valuations. DHN and LEDOG likely fall into this category of less established, potentially meme coins . Information about them might be scarce, and their communities are often driven by online hype and speculation. Investing in such altcoins carries significant risk. Their prices can be incredibly volatile, prone to massive pumps and dumps, and they often lack the robust ecosystems, development teams, or real-world applications that more established cryptocurrencies possess. Why Did Vitalik Buterin Initiate This Altcoin Sell-off? Speculations and Market Reactions The million-dollar question is: why did an address associated with Vitalik Buterin decide to sell these altcoins ? In the absence of an official statement, we are left to speculate. Here are a few plausible scenarios: Profit Taking: It‚Äôs possible the address acquired these tokens at a much lower price, and this crypto sell-off represents simple profit-taking. Even small amounts of initial investment in meme coins can sometimes yield significant returns if timed correctly. Portfolio Diversification/Risk Management: Perhaps the wallet is rebalancing its portfolio, moving away from higher-risk altcoins into more stable assets or other investment opportunities. This is a common practice in portfolio management to mitigate risk. Skepticism About Long-Term Viability: Buterin, known for his focus on technological innovation and the long-term vision of Ethereum, might simply be skeptical about the long-term viability and utility of meme coins like DHN and LEDOG. His action could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in these specific projects or the meme coin trend in general. Donation/Charity: While less likely given the nature of the tokens, it‚Äôs also within the realm of possibility that the proceeds from this crypto sell-off are intended for charitable purposes, something Buterin has been involved in before. As for market reactions, the immediate impact on DHN and LEDOG prices might be significant, especially if the news gains wider traction. Typically, when a prominent figure is seen selling a particular asset, it can create negative sentiment and potentially trigger further selling pressure. However, given the relatively small market cap of these altcoins , the broader market impact might be limited. It‚Äôs more likely to serve as a cautionary tale about the risks associated with investing in highly speculative meme coins and the importance of due diligence. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Altcoin Market After Buterin‚Äôs Move So, what can we learn from this event, especially if you are interested in altcoins ? Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence is Paramount: Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially altcoins and meme coins . Understand the project‚Äôs fundamentals, team, use case, and community. Don‚Äôt rely solely on hype or social media buzz. Risk Management is Key: Altcoins , by their nature, are riskier investments than established cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially not in highly speculative meme coins . Be Wary of Hype and FOMO: Meme coins often thrive on hype and fear of missing out (FOMO). Avoid making impulsive decisions driven by emotions. A celebrity endorsement or a viral trend doesn‚Äôt guarantee long-term success. Follow Smart Money, But Think for Yourself: While it‚Äôs informative to observe the actions of influential figures like the Ethereum co-founder , don‚Äôt blindly follow their moves. Develop your own investment thesis and make informed decisions based on your own research and risk tolerance. Understand Tokenomics: For altcoins , pay close attention to tokenomics ‚Äì the token‚Äôs supply, distribution, and inflationary/deflationary mechanisms. Large token supplies, like in the case of LEDOG, can inherently limit price appreciation potential. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Altcoin Market? Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs recent crypto sell-off of DHN and LEDOG, while not massive in monetary terms, serves as a potent reminder of the volatile and often unpredictable nature of the altcoin market, particularly the meme coin segment. It underscores the importance of caution, research, and sound risk management when venturing beyond established cryptocurrencies. Whether this signals a broader shift away from speculative altcoins remains to be seen, but it certainly provides food for thought for anyone navigating the exciting yet perilous world of crypto investments. The actions of key figures like the Ethereum co-founder continue to shape the narrative and direction of the crypto space, and paying attention to these signals, while remaining critical and informed, is crucial for every crypto participant.

This marks a stark contrast to February‚Äôs staggering $1.5 billion in damages, largely fueled by the Bybit exchange breach. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the primary culprits in March were code vulnerabilities, responsible for over $14 million in losses, followed by wallet compromises, which accounted for $8 million in stolen assets. One of the biggest attacks of the month was the smart contract exploit of the decentralized lending platform Abracadabra.money on March 25, resulting in a $13 million loss. CertiK‚Äôs analysis revealed that the attacker manipulated the platform‚Äôs liquidation process, repeatedly borrowing and liquidating funds without proper repayment. In response, Abracadabra.money‚Äôs team has offered a 20% bounty‚Äîtwice the standard amount‚Äîto the hacker in hopes of recovering some of the stolen funds. Another significant exploit in March involved Zoth, a restaking protocol, where a compromised deployer wallet led to an $8.4 million theft. The project has not yet made any public offers for fund recovery, leaving its losses unresolved. Some Stolen Funds Have Been Recovered Despite the overall losses, not all stolen funds disappeared for good. CertiK reports that while total losses exceeded $33 million in March, there were cases where victims managed to reclaim their assets. Decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch successfully negotiated with an attacker after a March 5 exploit, securing the return of a significant portion of the $5 million stolen . The agreement was framed as a bug bounty settlement, rewarding the hacker for disclosing the vulnerability. However, these figures exclude a mysterious case uncovered by on-chain detective ZachXBT, who reported that an unidentified Coinbase user may have lost 400 BTC‚Äîworth approximately $34 million‚Äîto an unknown exploit. Adding to the concerns, phishing scams impersonating crypto exchanges are becoming an increasing threat, with ZachXBT estimating over $46 million in potential losses from such schemes in March. Phishing Scams with Fake Exchange Messages While technical exploits saw a decline, phishing attacks remain a serious concern. On March 21, Australian federal police reported warning 130 individuals about sophisticated scams impersonating major crypto exchanges through SMS messages. These fraudulent messages spoofed legitimate ‚Äúsender IDs,‚Äù tricking users into believing they were receiving official communication. Reports on X also surfaced on March 14, revealing a new phishing tactic where scammers prompted users to set up wallets using pre-generated recovery phrases‚Äîgiving fraudsters full access to their funds.

Analyst Draws His Own Scenario: ‚ÄúPatience Will Be Tested‚Äù,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/where-will-bitcoin-price-be-at-the-end-of-the-year-analyst-draws-his-own-scenario-patience-will-be-tested/,"Bitcoin‚Äôs recent decline may be far from over, with some experts warning of a prolonged decline reminiscent of the 2022 bear market. Quinn Thompson, founder of cryptocurrency hedge fund Lekker Capital, predicts that Bitcoin could fall below $60,000 by the end of the year, signaling a slow and painful grind for investors. ‚ÄúI could see us back to five handles by the end of the year,‚Äù Thompson said in an interview. ‚ÄúFive handles‚Äù refers to a price between $50,000 and $59,999, a stark contrast to Bitcoin‚Äôs current shaky $83,000 level and a nearly 50% drop from its peak of $109,000 a little more than two months ago. Unlike past crypto market crashes marked by extreme volatility, Thompson expects a slow descent that could test investors‚Äô patience. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen quickly, so it‚Äôs going to be very painful and shocking for people because nothing about the current market conditions is very volatile with big liquidations and crashes,‚Äù he explained. The analyst has consistently maintained a bearish outlook, dismissing recent bullish rhetoric around crypto initiatives from the White House, including the U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, as ‚Äúempty talk‚Äù and ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù events. He also downplays the significance of MicroStrategy‚Äôs (MSTR) ongoing Bitcoin purchases, arguing that they represent one of the few consistent sources of demand in a weak market. At the core of Thompson‚Äôs bearish thesis is his belief that the Trump administration‚Äôs economic policies will create challenges for the market over the next six to nine months. Thompson highlights four key challenges: Government Spending Cuts: Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Productivity (DOGE) aims to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by cutting government spending, which has been a major driver of job growth in recent years. Musk has set an ambitious goal of cutting $1 trillion in government spending by May, and has a broader goal of reducing the federal budget by 15% ($7 trillion annually). Even if DOGE falls short, the cuts will likely impact consumer sentiment and economic growth in the near term. Fighting Immigration: The Trump administration‚Äôs renewed focus on border security and deportations could tighten the labor market. ‚ÄúImmigration is a positive growth driver because it puts pressure on wages,‚Äù Thompson said. Without a stable labor supply, businesses could struggle with rising wage costs, potentially leading to economic slowdowns. Tariff Uncertainty: The administration‚Äôs volatile stance on tariffs has created uncertainty for businesses, delaying investment and hiring decisions. While not all proposed tariffs are implemented, the unpredictability itself is a deterrent to market stability. Fed Policy: Despite a 100 basis point rate cut in late 2024, the Fed remains cautious about easing further amid ongoing inflation concerns. Thompson sees additional rate cuts of 25 to 75 basis points in 2025, but expects them to be spaced out in the second half of the year. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot more coordination between the Treasury and the Fed than people think,‚Äù Thompson said, suggesting that Trump, Treasury Secretary Bessent and Fed Chair Powell are aligned in their efforts to curb inflation, albeit at the expense of asset prices. Related News: Unlucky Whale Gave Up On This Altcoin: Sold It All at Fifty Percent Loss As these economic pressures mount, Thompson sees continued downside risk for Bitcoin and other risky assets. He also sees the White House‚Äôs lack of urgency in combating a potential recession as a bearish signal. While the administration appears committed to a strategy of fiscal tightening, Thompson suggests policy changes could come if the economic pain becomes too severe, especially ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. *This is not investment advice.

ADA price achieved a substantial increase on Tuesdays to reach the market value of $0.6783. The Cardano price shows a potential shift in sentiment with the recent 2.49% daily increase compared to the previous day. The cryptocurrency known as top altcoin has faced numerous obstacles during the past months yet has demonstrated positive market trends lately. The crypto market experienced a small rally during the period when market corrections occurred throughout the week. The market has shown a positive trend by restoring BTC and ETH prices. The BTC price could return to $90k if the market shows continued upward movement. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence Indicator (MACD) shows a minor bearish trend momentum. The MACD line keeps a position beneath the signal line, which points to restricted upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows ADA at 44, which indicates that the market position falls between overbought and oversold conditions. Key Levels To Watch A strong support area is located at $0.60 as traders observe initial support followed by another robust support level at $0.63. The traders will monitor the $0.55 price level as their main support target when the ADA price prediction continues to decrease. Source: TradingView The Cardano price prediction currently struggles to surpass $0.7 as this resistance point continues to halt its upward movement in recent weeks.

Imagine a future where your retirement savings aren‚Äôt just confined to traditional stocks and bonds, but can also tap into the exciting, albeit volatile, world of cryptocurrency. Well, that future might be closer than you think! News broke recently that a U.S. Senator is set to propose groundbreaking legislation that could fundamentally change how Americans plan for their golden years. Let‚Äôs dive into what this could mean for your financial future and the world of cryptocurrency retirement funds . What‚Äôs the Buzz About Cryptocurrency Retirement Funds? The crypto sphere is buzzing with news from Capitol Hill. According to a report by crypto media outlet Watcher Guru, shared on X (formerly Twitter), Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville is gearing up to introduce a bill that would permit Americans to allocate their hard-earned retirement savings to cryptocurrency investments. This isn‚Äôt just another day in crypto news; this is a potentially seismic shift in how retirement planning could evolve in the United States. For years, the idea of including digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum in retirement accounts has been a topic of fervent debate. Proponents argue it‚Äôs a way to diversify portfolios and potentially capture high-growth opportunities. Critics, however, voice concerns about volatility and risk, especially when it comes to something as crucial as retirement nest eggs. Senator Tuberville‚Äôs proposed legislation throws fuel onto this fire, pushing the conversation into the legislative arena and potentially paving the way for mainstream crypto investments in retirement plans. [img]Imagine a future where your 401(k) or IRA could hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies alongside traditional assets.[/img] This bill aims to make that vision a reality, giving individuals more control over their retirement savings and access to the burgeoning crypto market. But what exactly are the potential benefits and challenges? Unlocking the Potential: Why Include Crypto in Retirement Savings? The allure of crypto investments for retirement portfolios is multifaceted. Let‚Äôs break down some key potential advantages: Diversification: Modern portfolio theory emphasizes diversification to mitigate risk. Cryptocurrencies often exhibit low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. Including them could potentially enhance diversification and reduce overall portfolio volatility. Growth Potential: The crypto market, despite its volatility, has shown explosive growth over the past decade. For younger investors with a longer time horizon until retirement, allocating a portion to crypto could offer the potential for significant long-term growth. Inflation Hedge (Debated): Some argue that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, can act as a hedge against inflation due to their limited supply. While this is still a subject of ongoing debate, the narrative persists and attracts investors seeking alternatives to traditional inflation hedges. Modernizing Retirement Options: As the world becomes increasingly digital, incorporating digital assets into retirement plans could be seen as a necessary modernization to reflect the evolving financial landscape. Individual Control: The bill champions the idea of individual financial freedom, allowing individuals to decide how to allocate their retirement funds, including the option to invest in cryptocurrencies if they choose. However, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge that this is not a one-sided coin. The world of cryptocurrency comes with its own set of challenges, particularly when considering something as vital as retirement security. Navigating the Challenges: The Flip Side of Crypto Retirement While the potential benefits of cryptocurrency retirement funds are enticing, it‚Äôs essential to approach this with a realistic and cautious perspective. Here are some significant challenges and risks to consider: Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods. This volatility can be particularly concerning for retirement savings, where stability and long-term growth are paramount. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and in the U.S. Changes in regulations could significantly impact the value and legality of crypto investments. Security Risks: The crypto space is prone to scams, hacks, and fraud. Ensuring the security of retirement funds invested in cryptocurrencies would be a critical concern. Custodial solutions and security protocols would need to be robust and reliable. Complexity and Education: Understanding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can be complex. Investors would need adequate education and resources to make informed decisions about including crypto in their retirement portfolios. Lack of Track Record: Compared to traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies are relatively new. Their long-term performance and suitability for retirement savings are still being tested over time. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they highlight the need for careful consideration, robust regulatory frameworks, and investor education if crypto investments are to become a mainstream part of retirement planning. Tommy Tuberville‚Äôs Bold Move: The Investment Bill Explained So, what do we know about Senator Tommy Tuberville ‚Äòs proposed investment bill ? While details are still emerging, the core aim is reportedly to amend existing regulations to allow for the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in various types of retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. It‚Äôs important to note that this is just the beginning of the legislative process. The bill will need to be formally proposed, debated in the Senate, and potentially in the House of Representatives, before it can become law. There will likely be amendments, discussions, and potentially significant hurdles along the way. The level of bipartisan support and the stance of regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be crucial factors in determining the bill‚Äôs fate. The introduction of this bill, however, signals a growing recognition within political circles of the increasing importance and potential of the cryptocurrency industry. It also reflects a growing demand from some segments of the population for more diverse and modern retirement investment options. Actionable Insights: Is Cryptocurrency Retirement Right for You? The prospect of including cryptocurrency retirement funds in your long-term financial strategy is undoubtedly exciting for some and concerning for others. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Before even thinking about crypto in retirement, thoroughly educate yourself about cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and the associated risks and rewards. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments. Evaluate your own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Retirement savings are typically considered long-term, but the volatility of crypto needs to align with your comfort level. Start Small: If you‚Äôre considering crypto in retirement, start with a small allocation. Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile asset class. Diversification remains key. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek professional advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency market. They can help you assess your situation and make informed decisions. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape and the regulatory environment are constantly evolving. Stay updated on the latest news, trends, and regulatory developments related to cryptocurrencies and retirement investments. The potential for cryptocurrency retirement funds is undeniable, but so are the risks. Senator Tuberville‚Äôs bill is a significant step towards mainstreaming crypto in retirement planning, but it‚Äôs crucial to approach this evolving landscape with both optimism and caution. In conclusion, the news of Senator Tuberville‚Äôs proposed bill is a landmark moment for the crypto industry and for the future of retirement savings in the U.S. It opens up a realm of possibilities, offering the potential for diversification and growth, but also necessitates careful consideration of the inherent risks and challenges. As this legislation progresses, it will be vital for investors, regulators, and policymakers to engage in informed discussions and develop responsible frameworks to navigate this exciting and complex new frontier in retirement planning.

In a tweet, he noted that a close above $2.24, which aligns with the Fibonacci 0.888 level, is the next short-term target. His analysis suggests that XRP remains on track for higher prices, corroborating his previous predictions. #XRP Inverse Head & Shoulders (Update): A close above $2.24 (Fib 0.888) is our next minor target!

This structure consists of three troughs, the middle one (head) being lower than the other two (shoulders), and a breakout above the neckline indicating potential upward movement. In Egrag Crypto‚Äôs view, the price is progressing as expected, maintaining its position within a broader upward channel. Projected Price Levels and Key Resistance Zones The analyst previously projected a measured move between $3.7 and $3.9, backing his bullish stance on XRP. His chart highlights key levels, including the $2.00 support, the $2.65 mid-range target, and the upper boundary at approximately $4.60. The outlined trajectory suggests that if XRP maintains momentum and surpasses the $2.24 Fibonacci level, the next major resistance could align with the $3.28 region.

The image also emphasizes the filling of a fair value gap, which could contribute to a more stable price foundation for further upward movement.

One user, Revolution XChange, commented that they were hoping for a price drop to $1.85, suggesting that such a dip would offer a buying opportunity before a potential rally.

42748453,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145017,1743507600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking GUN Token Sell-Off: Is a Launchpool Bot Behind Binance Crypto Pressure?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gun-token-launchpool-bot-binance/,"The crypto markets are known for their volatility, but sometimes, unusual trading patterns catch the eye and spark intense speculation. Recently, the newly listed GUN token on Binance Exchange experienced a surge in high-frequency selling, leaving many investors scratching their heads. Could this rapid sell-off be the work of a sophisticated trading bot deployed by a Launchpool whale? Let‚Äôs dive into the on-chain analysis and unravel this intriguing crypto mystery. Unveiling the Suspicions: Launchpool Bot and GUN Token Sell-Off According to on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa, the intense selling pressure observed in the GUN token‚Äôs early trading days on Binance might not be organic market behavior. Instead, the analyst speculates that a Launchpool bot, configured by a deep-pocketed whale, could be the culprit. This speculation stems from the sheer volume and frequency of sell orders hitting the exchange shortly after the token‚Äôs listing. But what exactly is a Launchpool, and how could it be connected to this potential bot activity? Binance Launchpool Explained: Binance Launchpool allows users to stake their BNB and other tokens to farm newly launched tokens for free. It‚Äôs a popular way for projects to distribute tokens and build initial community engagement. The Whale Connection: In the case of GUN token, a significant BNB rewards pool was available. If the hard cap for this pool was reached, a single whale could have accumulated a massive 32 million GUN tokens over the three-day Launchpool period. The Alarming Coincidence: Interestingly, the analyst points out that the estimated 32 million GUN tokens potentially acquired by a whale is strikingly similar to the volume of the high-frequency sell-off witnessed on Binance. This alignment raises serious questions about whether a single entity, possibly a Launchpool participant, is behind the selling pressure. Earlier Speculation: Market Maker or Launchpool Bot? Initially, the on-chain analyst considered the possibility that a market maker for GUN token might be responsible for the selling activity. Market makers are entities tasked with providing liquidity to a trading pair, often through automated trading strategies. However, further investigation and data points shifted the analyst‚Äôs focus towards the Launchpool bot theory. Why the shift in perspective? Binance‚Äôs New Coin Report Insights: Binance‚Äôs official report on the GUN token launch states that 2% of the total token supply (200 million GUN) is earmarked for liquidity and market making purposes. This allocation is a standard practice to ensure smooth trading and price discovery. Delayed Market Maker Token Distribution: Crucially, the report also indicates that these tokens intended for market makers had not yet been distributed at the time of the observed high-frequency selling. This detail weakens the market maker explanation, as they wouldn‚Äôt have had the token supply to engage in such large-scale selling. The Launchpool Whale Theory Gains Traction: With the market maker scenario becoming less likely due to the delayed token distribution, the Launchpool bot theory becomes more compelling. A whale who accumulated a substantial amount of GUN tokens through the Launchpool would have the tokens readily available to sell immediately upon exchange listing. Analyzing the Crypto Selling Pressure: What Does It Mean for GUN Token? The potential involvement of a Launchpool bot in generating significant selling pressure raises several important questions and implications for the GUN token and its investors. Potential Benefits of a Launchpool Bot Strategy (for the Whale): Profit Maximization: Selling early and aggressively, especially if acquired tokens were essentially ‚Äúfree‚Äù through Launchpool staking, can lead to quick profit realization. Capital Recoupment: Whales might use bot-driven selling to quickly recoup the capital initially staked in BNB for the Launchpool, effectively minimizing risk. Market Manipulation (Potentially Unintended): While not necessarily malicious intent, large-scale automated selling can inadvertently create downward pressure on the token price, potentially benefiting the seller at the expense of other holders. Challenges and Risks for GUN Token and Investors: Price Volatility and Instability: High-frequency selling, especially from a large single source, can create extreme price swings and instability, making it risky for new investors. Negative Sentiment and Trust Erosion: If the market perceives that a whale is manipulating the price or dumping tokens, it can damage investor confidence and long-term prospects for the GUN token. Decentralization Concerns: Large token holdings concentrated in the hands of a few, particularly if they engage in aggressive selling, can undermine the principles of decentralization often touted in the crypto space. On-Chain Analysis: A Powerful Tool for Crypto Transparency This situation with the GUN token highlights the increasing importance of on-chain analysis in the cryptocurrency world. On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available blockchain data to gain insights into transaction patterns, token movements, and network activity. Tools and analysts specializing in this field can: Track Large Transactions: Identify significant token transfers that might indicate whale activity or market manipulation. Monitor Exchange Flows: Observe token inflows and outflows from exchanges to gauge buying and selling pressure. Identify Smart Contract Interactions: Analyze how tokens are interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts to understand underlying usage and adoption. Enhance Market Transparency: On-chain analysis contributes to greater transparency in the often-opaque crypto markets, helping investors make more informed decisions. For investors and participants in the crypto space, understanding the basics of on-chain analysis and following analysts like @ai_9684xtpa can be incredibly valuable in navigating market complexities and identifying potential red flags. Actionable Insights: Navigating Crypto Selling Pressure and Market Volatility So, what can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this GUN token scenario? Exercise Caution with New Listings: Be particularly cautious when investing in newly listed tokens, especially those launched through mechanisms like Launchpool where early selling pressure might be higher. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency before investing. Understand its tokenomics, use case, team, and community. Don‚Äôt rely solely on hype or initial price pumps. Follow On-Chain Analysts: Stay informed by following reputable on-chain analysts who provide insights into market dynamics and potential anomalies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Understand Market Volatility: Accept that crypto markets are inherently volatile. Be prepared for price swings and avoid investing more than you can afford to lose. Conclusion: Decoding Crypto Mysteries and Staying Informed The speculation surrounding the GUN token‚Äôs high-frequency selling and the potential involvement of a Launchpool bot serves as a compelling example of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the analyst‚Äôs theory remains speculative, it underscores the importance of on-chain analysis, market transparency, and diligent research in the crypto space. By staying informed, utilizing available analytical tools, and exercising caution, investors can better navigate the exciting yet challenging world of digital assets and make more informed decisions.

The claimed breakthrough could be a major blow to U.S. government employees found guilty of public funds embezzlement among other financial-related crimes. ‚Äú The US Government deleted a terabyte of financial data to cover their crime.

The disturbance caused by Musk and the DOGE team has attracted significant attention on both sides. On one hand, Musk is largely celebrated for attempting to save the U.S. dollar as a global currency, through the initiatives by DOGE. Moreover, experts believe the U.S. Dollar could lose its status as a global reserve currency in the next decade, especially fueled by the rise of the BRICS movement . On the other hand, Musk and his DOGE team have been accused of operating contrary to federal law. For instance earlier this year, a federal Judge blocked Musk‚Äôs DOGE from accessing the personal financial data of millions of Americans in Treasury Department records. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: SEC Moves Forward with $150 Million Lawsuit Against Elon Musk , Notably, Judge Paul A.

This surge in heavyweight investor activity comes as Bitcoin‚Äôs prices fluctuated between $81,000 and $84,000 in the past few days. Whale Accumulation on Multi-month High According to data from market intelligence platform Santiment, the rise in whale wallets is seen as a sign of growing confidence from institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. These large holders have increased by 2.6% in the past five weeks. Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility in 2025, with the flagship cryptocurrency reaching an all-time high of $109,225 on January 20, followed by a 20% correction. The first quarter of the year also marked BTC‚Äôs worst Q1 performance since 2019, accompanied by a 25% decline from its peak. The asset has continued to show weakness in price movement, with limited upside momentum over the past several weeks. At the time of writing, it was trading at $83,770, marking a 1.9% increase over the past 24 hours. Tracking Bitcoin whales is important because their large positions can impact price movements. An increase in such addresses often indicates rising confidence among key stakeholders in the crypto space. With the current count at a multi-month high, Santiment suggests that despite the ongoing market instability, these players may be preparing for a potential upward price movement. Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Distress On the other hand, short-term holders (STHs) are showing signs of distress. A recent analysis by CryptoQuant‚Äôs Darkfost highlighted that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has remained below 1.0 for over two months. ‚ÄúWhen this ratio drops below 1, it signals capitulation among STHs, often leading to short-term price declines,‚Äù said the CryptoQuant analyst. This trend is often seen as a sign of capitulation, suggesting that many are offloading Bitcoin amid the ongoing market upheaval. Meanwhile, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently highlighted that this is the best time in history to buy Bitcoin. He explained five key factors driving support for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price growth in 2025, including a bullish falling flag pattern, Trump‚Äôs tariff pivot in March, and the resurgence of spot Bitcoin ETFs. He also pointed to positive social sentiment around the asset and news that the White House is considering selling gold to purchase the digital asset.

Goldman Sachs thinks inflation, excluding food and energy prices (core PCE inflation), will hit 3.5% this year, a point and a half higher than the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target, CNBC reports . That number was at 2.8% in February, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . The financial services firm also thinks economic growth will be weak and unemployment will rise from 4.1% to 4.5%. Goldman Sachs estimates that there is a 35% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, a 15% jump from its most recent forecast. Trump says this Wednesday, April 2nd, will be ‚Äú Liberation Day in America ,‚Äù when he‚Äôll slap tariffs on countries around the world. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods paid for by the importing country. However, the Trump Administration has sent mixed signals about the severity of those upcoming tariffs. Goldman Sachs predicts Trump will announce tariffs that average 15% across all US trading partners, though the firm expects ‚Äúproduct and country exclusions to ultimately whittle the addition to the average US tariff rate down to 9pp (percentage points).‚Äù In an interview on Sunday Morning Futures earlier this month, Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a recession. ‚ÄúI hate to predict things like that.

Data reveals that Vitalik donated 274 ETH to Isla, a Web3 researcher working on Zuitzerland. This comes in when Ethereum recorded an almost 5% surge in the last 24 hours after battling with the increased selling pressure. The global crypto market printed green indexes all around on Tuesday morning. The cumulative digital assets market cap surged by 3% over the last day to stand at $2.73 trillion. However, the fear and greed index still suggests that the ‚ÄúFear‚Äù sentiment is prevailing among the investors. Vitalik‚Äôs $500K ETH donation As per the data shared by SpotOnChain, Buterin sent 500K worth of Ethereum as a donation or grant to a multi sig deployed by Isla. The recipient is a researcher developing Zuitzerland a project inspired by Vitalik‚Äôs Zuzalu experiment. Back in 2023, Zuzalu, a funded project initiated by Vitalik Buterin gathered tech enthusiasts, longevity researchers, and decentralized governance in Montenegro. Zuitzerland has taken some notes from this. This is no big surprise that Buterin is always been a big supporter of decentralized, community-driven projects. Data shows that he sent 250 ETH (approx. worth $456K) to the privacy protocol Railgun, 5 days ago. This move is most likely to be taken for donation purposes, as he had frequently claimed. But here‚Äôs the kicker, Vitalik sold 5,000 Dohrnii tokens for $93k minutes before transferring the 274 ETH. It came right after he sold 2 trillion LEDOG tokens for $16.5k. It turns out to be a quick liquid swap before the donation. Vitalik Buterin ( @VitalikButerin ) just sent 274.1 $ETH ($500K) as a donation or grant to a multisig deployed by @0xisla , the developer behind @zuitzerland . 5 days ago, he also sent 250 $ETH ($456K) to the privacy protocol #Railgun , most likely for donation purposes, as he had‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/I73oUp8xXW ‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 1, 2025 The Ethereum founder has received these tokens as donations from Dohrnii Labs (10,000 DHN) and LEDOG founders (10 trillion DOG) in late 2024 and early 2025. It looks like he is been offloading them in batches since October. Meanwhile, Buterin is still holding around 2 trillion DOG tokens and has been slowly liquidating for other purposes. Are ETH bulls back? After a long running decline, Ether price finally saw a recovery rally as Bitcoin tried to regain the $85K mark. ETH price has dropped by 43% in the last quarter depicting low investor interest in the crypto. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $1,883 but it is still down by a massive 61% from its all time high of $4,891, recorded on November 16, 2021. Data shared by CoinGlass shows that more than $61 million worth of long and short bets set on Ethereum price got liquidated over the last 24 hours. Around $37.7 million worth of liquidated bets (61%) turns out to be short positions. This suggests that traders were hoping ETH price to decline but it made a green comeback. Finally, US ETH spot ETFs recorded 2 days of back to back inflow after a very long halt. ETH spot ETFs posted $6.41 million of inflow on March 31. Fidelity ETF FETH single handedly registered the largest net inflow in a single day of $6.4 million. The total net inflow of FETH reached $1.414 billion now.

Act I, the Prophecy (ACT) slumped 50%, DeXe (DEXE) dropped 30% and dForce (DF) fell nearly 20% within minutes after 1100 UTC on Tuesday, data from Binance shows, with no immediate catalyst or explanation behind the sudden fall. The drop led to $6.28 million worth of longs being liquidated on ACT-tracked futures across exchanges, Coinglass data shows, with a single trader hit with a $3.2 million liquidation. Meanwhile, HIPPO, BANANA31, TST and LUMIA posted similar declines shortly after 1100 UTC, though not as large as ACT, with dips in some tokens like KAVA getting quickly purchased by fast-fingered traders. The tokens are not related or in the same sector. Data showed a surge in selling volumes roughly around the same time, with no other tokens on Binance seeing similar spikes in selling volumes. The stage for volatility was likely set by Binance's announcement at 10:30 UTC, which introduced changes in leverage requirements and margin tiers for perpetual contracts for several tokens, including ACT/USDT. The announcement said the new rules will be applicable to existing positions. That likely spurred position adjustments by trading bots, leading to price volatility in perpetuals, which quickly spilled over to spot prices. The cascade spread over to other exchanges, with these tokens down equivalent amounts on other centralized exchanges as well as on decentralized exchanges. Early reactions on X ranged from surprise to speculations of a market-making bot possibly causing the declines due to a misconfiguration on how they trade, though CoinDesk could not independently confirm the allegations as of writing time. ""Seems someone has been hacked or banned or idk,"" Andrei Grachev, founder at DWF Labs said on X. ""Otherwise I cannot explain why too many unrelated assets dumped."" ""Even though the update was on perps, the impact spilled into spot. Traders using cross-margin setups or running arb strategies were likely forced to unwind both sides. Panic from the perp cascade also spread, algos and discretionary players alike started exiting spot just to stay ahead of the move,"" pseudonymous observer Game said in an X post.

42749749,https://invezz.com/?p=2648731,1743508009,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto experts reveal the new project leading 2025 ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not DOGE or SHIB,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/01/crypto-experts-reveal-the-new-project-leading-2025-and-its-not-doge-or-shib/,"As the crypto space matures, investors are starting to shift focus away from meme-driven hype and toward protocols built on real value. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) may still dominate headlines from time to time, but the spotlight is moving. While these tokens thrived on culture and community, a new class of projects is emerging‚Äîones that offer real use cases, sustainable tokenomics, and long-term functionality. One such name quietly gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), and experts say it‚Äôs the one to watch heading into 2025. From memes to mechanisms DOGE and SHIB have shown how powerful community-driven coins can be. However, when it comes to long-term returns and meaningful utility, both struggle to deliver beyond speculation. While some traders still hold out for the next hype cycle, others are adjusting their strategies‚Äîopting to enter projects with stronger fundamentals, earlier entry points, and clear paths for adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is increasingly being seen as the project setting itself apart in this new wave of DeFi-focused investments. Rather than selling a narrative, Mutuum is building a working system designed to let users lend and borrow crypto assets directly on-chain. It‚Äôs non-custodial, fully transparent, and entirely governed by smart contracts. In other words, users stay in control of their funds while putting them to work. Through the platform, users can supply digital assets and earn interest or borrow by locking up collateral. This opens opportunities not just for passive income, but also for strategic liquidity access‚Äîwithout needing to sell existing holdings. When users supply assets to Mutuum‚Äôs protocol, they receive mtTokens in return. These are tokenized versions of their deposit that grow in value over time as interest accrues. For example, depositing ETH results in mtETH, which reflects both the original ETH value and earned interest. These tokens remain flexible and can be used within other parts of the DeFi ecosystem. This system not only rewards participation but also simplifies yield tracking and encourages longer-term holding. Mutuum Finance is currently in its presale phase, and the numbers say a lot. Over 7,600 users have already joined, with more than $5.9 million raised so far. The token is priced at $0.025 in its current phase, but the previous stages sold out rapidly. This has created a sense of urgency, as the next phase will increase the price to $0.03. Many see this as the final opportunity to buy MUTM at its lowest entry point before broader exposure and exchange listings. What separates Mutuum Finance from many other new tokens is that it‚Äôs not just planning for launch‚Äîit‚Äôs planning to go live with functionality. The team has confirmed a beta version of the platform will be available when the token launches. This kind of readiness attracts more serious investors who are looking for protocols that offer something from day one‚Äînot just a promise. In addition, a revenue-sharing model is in place that redistributes a portion of platform fees by buying MUTM tokens from the market and rewarding mtToken holders. This mechanism introduces consistent buy pressure and supports the token‚Äôs long-term value. The project is also working on releasing its own overcollateralized stablecoin‚Äîanother step toward creating a full DeFi suite that goes beyond basic lending. With growing investor interest and a utility-packed roadmap, many are beginning to compare MUTM‚Äôs early potential to other breakout projects from previous market cycles. To further engage its growing base, the project has also launched a $100,000 giveaway, drawing even more attention and solidifying its early momentum. As demand rises and the presale progresses, more traders are locking in their positions. While DOGE and SHIB will always hold a place in crypto history, the future appears to be favoring tokens like Mutuum Finance‚Äîprojects with strong mechanics, real-world use, and thoughtful token design. As 2025 approaches, all signs point to MUTM being more than just another altcoin. It‚Äôs positioning itself as the DeFi project to watch.

42750023,https://cryptonews.com/?p=346627,1743508136,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/42750023.jpeg,Vanuatu Passes Crypto Licensing and Regulation Act,https://cryptonews.com/news/vanuatu-passes-crypto-licensing-and-regulation-act/,"Vanuatu has officially enacted its crypto regulation and licensing framework, joining a growing list of nations implementing oversight for virtual asset service providers. According to a report from Finance Magnates , the country‚Äôs Parliament passed the Virtual Asset Service Provider ( VASP ) Act on March 26. Source: parliament.gov.vu The act grants the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) the authority to issue licenses and regulate crypto businesses. The new law defines virtual assets as ‚Äúdigital representations of value that may be traded and function as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value.‚Äù However, it explicitly excludes digital representations of fiat currencies, securities, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Despite the establishment of a regulatory framework, cryptocurrencies are still not recognized as legal tender in Vanuatu. The VFSC has mentioned that while cryptocurrencies depend on market demand and supply, they hold value due to their exchangeability for other assets. With this legislation, the island nation aims to establish a structured digital business environment that fosters competition, attracts investment, and ensures consumer protection. Additionally, it seeks to facilitate faster, lower-cost cross-border transactions and enhance financial inclusion. A Move Towards Stringent Oversight Vanuatu‚Äôs decision to regulate the crypto industry comes after years of deliberation. The VFSC first initiated discussions in 2020, but delays due to political changes, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed its passage. However, in June 2024, VFSC Commissioner Branan Karae reaffirmed the government‚Äôs commitment to finalizing the bill, which ultimately led to its enactment in March 2025. The legislation sets out strict licensing and compliance requirements for virtual asset exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and custody providers. Even banks may now obtain licenses to offer crypto exchange and custody services. Notably, the VFSC has been granted sweeping investigative and enforcement powers, allowing it to ensure compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations. Any violations of the act can result in severe penalties, including fines of up to 250 million vatu ($2 million) and prison sentences of up to 30 years. To further encourage innovation while maintaining oversight, the VFSC has introduced a regulatory sandbox. This provision allows companies to operate as virtual asset service providers for an initial period of one year, with the possibility of renewal. This measure is expected to allow businesses to test their operations in a controlled environment before obtaining a full license. You might also like UN:BLOCK 2025 to Spotlight MiCA Licensing and Crypto Regulation in Europe Offshore Jurisdictions Competing for Crypto Businesses Vanuatu‚Äôs move to regulate crypto services mirrors recent actions by other offshore financial hubs. Earlier this month, the Cayman Islands updated its crypto licensing framework , requiring virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating within its jurisdiction to obtain licenses from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority starting April 1, 2025. The Cayman Islands introduces new crypto licensing rules for 2025, demanding detailed disclosures from VASPs. #CryptoRegulation #CaymanIslands #VASPs https://t.co/wrha1khzCu ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Similarly, Taiwan and Turkey have recently introduced or tightened their crypto regulations to align with global AML and investor protection standards. Vanuatu has long been regarded as an offshore financial center and tax haven. Its around 2,300 registered institutions offer banking, insurance, legal, and trust services. In 2023, the country mandated that brokers operating from Vanuatu must have an onshore presence. The new crypto regulations reinforce this approach by ensuring that digital asset service providers are held to high compliance standards. As it stands now, Vanuatu‚Äôs proactive stance may enhance its attractiveness as a destination for legitimate digital asset businesses while deterring illicit financial activities. The success of Vanuatu‚Äôs crypto regulatory framework will depend on effective implementation and enforcement. With the VFSC now overseeing the sector, the next few years will be crucial in determining whether the country can attract quality crypto businesses while ensuring financial integrity and security.

For context, the Shiba Inu creator has recently mentioned ‚ÄúCracking The Chrysalis‚Äù, which has sparked discussions among investors. Some see this cryptic update as a hint towards something big ahead for the SHIB ecosystem. So, here are three likely hidden meanings behind this move. Shytoshi Kusama Location Hints Bullish Signal For SHIB Ecosystem Shytoshi Kusama‚Äôs latest location update hints at major updates ahead for the broader SHIB ecosystem. Notably, a chrysalis is a cocoon stage before a butterfly emerges, often representing transformation. This change in Shiba Inu creator‚Äôs location suggests that SHIB might be on the verge of a major breakthrough. Meanwhile, an X user and SHIB enthusiast KURO SHIBARMY JPN was among the first to highlight this mysterious update. The shift from listing a real-world location to this cryptic phrase hints at something significant brewing behind the scenes. Many in the community interpret it as a bullish signal for upcoming developments. Layer-3 Shibarium Upgrade Another speculation surrounding Shytoshi Kusama‚Äôs update is the long-awaited Layer-3 solution for Shibarium, called Shib Alpha. The project, in development since early 2024, aims to enhance the network‚Äôs speed, security, and transaction efficiency. Earlier this year, the Shiba Inu creator revealed that he had traveled globally, securing $12 million in funding for the Layer-3 network. The funds were raised through the sale of the TREAT token. TREAT serves as the backbone of this new upgrade, bringing more functionality and scalability to Shibarium. If the location update is linked to this development, it could mean the Shiba Inu ecosystem is nearing a major milestone, with Shib Alpha potentially set for an imminent release. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Growing Vision The Shiba Inu aims to evolve into a fully decentralized ecosystem apart from being only a mere project. The Layer-3 upgrade, hinted at by the latest Shytoshi Kusama location update, will prioritize user protection while allowing them to control what information they share. In addition, the Shib Alpha is expected to integrate SHI, the ecosystem‚Äôs long-awaited stablecoin. With lower gas fees and improved transaction speeds, this upgrade could make SHIB a strong contender in the broader digital assets space. In other words, the latest location update hints that the Shiba Inu ecosystem is currently in a transitioning state. With bullish speculations hovering after Shytoshi Kusama‚Äôs update, the market participants anticipate major updates ahead for the SHIB ecosystem. Shiba Inu Price Soars Amid the soaring speculations, SHIB price today surged nearly 5% and exchanged hands at $0.00001269. However, the crypto has lost around 8% over the last 30 days. Despite that, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis hints at a strong rally ahead for the crypto with Ethereum playing a crucial role in it. On the other hand, TREAT price today surged around 20% to $0.0003297.

42748790,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145018,1743508203,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Asian FX Braces for Impact as Trump Tariffs Loom Post-RBA Hold,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asian-fx-trump-tariffs-rba/,"Navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency and forex requires staying ahead of global economic shifts. Right now, all eyes are on Asia as Asian FX markets are showing signs of weakness. Why? The shadow of former US President Trump‚Äôs impending tariff hikes is casting a long shadow, just as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decided to hold steady on interest rates. Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for the forex landscape and what you need to watch out for. Why is Asian FX Under Pressure? The Trump Tariffs Factor The primary driver behind the current unease in Asian FX markets is the looming threat of increased tariffs. Former President Trump‚Äôs April 2 tariffs are fast approaching, and the anticipation is sending ripples through global markets, particularly impacting Asian economies heavily reliant on exports. These tariffs, if implemented, are expected to: Increase Import Costs: Tariffs essentially act as taxes on imported goods. Higher tariffs mean increased costs for businesses importing goods into the US, potentially leading to reduced demand for Asian exports. Disrupt Supply Chains: Global supply chains are intricately linked. Tariffs can disrupt these chains, causing uncertainty and impacting manufacturing and trade across Asia. Weaken Asian Currencies: Anticipation of reduced exports and economic slowdown often leads to a weakening of Asian currencies against the US dollar, as investors seek safer havens and anticipate reduced economic activity in the region. Fuel Trade Tensions: These tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures and further instability in the global trade environment, negatively impacting Asian FX . For crypto enthusiasts and traders, understanding these forex movements is crucial. Cryptocurrency markets often react to broader economic trends, and weakness in Asian FX can sometimes signal shifts in global risk sentiment that can indirectly impact digital assets. Aussie Dollar Flat After RBA Hold: What Does it Mean? In the midst of this tariff storm, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decided to hold interest rates steady. This decision has left the Australian dollar (AUD) relatively flat. But what‚Äôs the bigger picture here? Let‚Äôs break it down: RBA‚Äôs Cautious Stance: Holding rates steady suggests a cautious approach by the RBA. They are likely monitoring global economic uncertainties, including the potential impact of Trump tariffs , before making further moves on interest rates. Balancing Inflation and Growth: Central banks like the RBA must balance controlling inflation with supporting economic growth. Holding rates might indicate a concern about dampening growth too much in an already uncertain global environment. Limited Immediate Impact on AUD: The ‚Äòhold‚Äô decision was largely expected, which is why the Aussie dollar remained relatively flat. However, the currency‚Äôs future direction will heavily depend on how the tariff situation unfolds and future RBA decisions. Opportunity or Caution for Traders?: A flat Aussie dollar in a volatile forex market can present both opportunities and challenges for traders. It might signal a period of consolidation before a larger move, but also requires careful monitoring of global economic news and RBA statements. Decoding the Forex Market Jitters: Beyond Tariffs and RBA While Trump tariffs and the RBA‚Äôs decision are significant factors, the broader forex market sentiment is influenced by a complex interplay of global economic indicators and geopolitical events. What else is contributing to the current jitters? Factor Impact on Forex Markets Global Inflation Concerns Persistent inflation in major economies is keeping central banks on their toes, influencing interest rate expectations and currency valuations. Geopolitical Instability Ongoing conflicts and geopolitical tensions create uncertainty, driving investors towards safe-haven currencies like the US dollar and impacting riskier assets, including some Asian FX . Economic Data Releases Key economic data from major economies (e.g., GDP growth, employment figures) can trigger significant movements in the forex market as they shape expectations about future economic performance and central bank policies. Central Bank Communication Statements and signals from central banks regarding their future policy intentions are closely watched by the market and can significantly influence currency valuations. Navigating Currency Weakness: Actionable Insights for Crypto and Forex Traders So, what can you do to navigate these turbulent currency weakness waters? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on global economic news, particularly updates on trade policies, Trump tariffs developments, and central bank announcements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile markets. Consider diversifying your crypto and forex portfolio to mitigate risks associated with Asian FX weakness. Monitor Risk Sentiment: Pay attention to indicators of global risk sentiment. Increased risk aversion often strengthens the US dollar and can put further pressure on Asian currencies . Use Technical Analysis: Employ technical analysis tools to identify potential trading opportunities in both crypto and forex markets , considering the current volatility and uncertainty. Manage Risk Prudently: Always use appropriate risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders, to protect your capital in these uncertain times. The Road Ahead for Asian FX: Resilience or Further Decline? The future trajectory of Asian FX hinges on several factors. The actual implementation and scope of Trump tariffs will be crucial. Furthermore, how Asian economies respond to these challenges and the future policy decisions of central banks in the region will play a vital role. While the current outlook presents challenges, Asian economies have shown resilience in the past. Whether they can weather this storm and rebound remains to be seen. For traders and investors, staying vigilant and adaptable is paramount in this evolving landscape.

The cryptocurrency‚Äôs price surged by nearly 98% over the last 30 days, capturing the attention of both short-term traders and long-term investors. However, despite this impressive growth, the future direction of VET will depend on several key factors, including broader market conditions, technological developments, and investor sentiment. Recent Price Action VeChain has demonstrated resilience amid market fluctuations, recently trading between an intraday high of $0.0234 and a low of $0.0222. The token‚Äôs recent growth, particularly a 98% increase in the last month, has showcased its potential for significant returns, though the price remains volatile and susceptible to shifts in market sentiment. Expected Next Move While predictions for VET‚Äôs price vary, there is general optimism about its future prospects. Short-Term Projection: VeChain is expected to experience modest growth over the coming weeks, potentially reaching $0.031 by mid-April 2025. This increase would represent a significant short-term gain, driven by continued adoption of VeChain‚Äôs blockchain solutions and the broader cryptocurrency market‚Äôs performance. Mid-Term Outlook: VET could rise to $0.02897, indicating a steady, more conservative growth trajectory. Though this may appear more gradual, it reflects the cryptocurrency‚Äôs potential to see consistent gains if it maintains its current growth pattern. Long-Term Projections: Long Forecast provides a wider range for VET‚Äôs 2025 price movement, predicting a fluctuation between $0.021 and $0.05785. This suggests substantial growth potential but also highlights the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Over the long term, VeChain could benefit from greater adoption, leading to price surges if the right conditions align. Key Influencing Factors Several factors will influence VeChain‚Äôs price action moving forward: Market Sentiment: Positive news about VeChain‚Äôs expanding use cases and partnerships could spark increased demand for VET, pushing its price higher. Regulatory Landscape: Regulatory decisions, particularly in key markets like Asia and the European Union, will significantly impact investor confidence and adoption. A more favorable regulatory environment could lead to wider institutional investment in VeChain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technological Progress: VeChain‚Äôs ability to continually improve and expand its blockchain technology, particularly in supply chain management and other industries, will be crucial to its long-term value. As more businesses adopt VeChain‚Äôs solutions, demand for VET could rise accordingly. VeChain‚Äôs future looks promising. However, investors should keep in mind the inherent market volatility and the influence of regulatory and technological factors on its price. As VeChain continues to establish itself as a leader in blockchain solutions, VET could see significant price appreciation in the months and years to come.

This year, ETH is already showing positive signs, rising by 3% on the first day of April. Meanwhile, prominent crypto analysts say if this trend continues, Ethereum could surge above $3,000 by May. Worst Q1 For ETH Since Existence Despite Ethereum‚Äôs promising outlook for the coming months, the first quarter of 2025 has been one of its most challenging yet. ETH ended Q1 in the red, making it the worst-performing first quarter in its history. January saw a modest decline of 1.28% , but February was especially rough, with a staggering drop of 31.95%. March didn‚Äôt offer much relief either, as Ethereum lost another 18.69% in value, marking the first time all three months in Q1 ended in losses for ETH . However, historical trends suggest that Ethereum tends to recover strongly after difficult quarters. With April now underway, many traders are hopeful that ETH will stick to its seasonal trend of double-digit percentage gains. Bullish Month For ETH: April & May Looking at Ethereum‚Äôs price performance over the years, April has consistently delivered an average return of 20%, making it the second-best month for ETH. Meanwhile, May stands out even more, with an average return of over 30%. Meanwhile, these trends suggest that Ethereum could be heading for a strong rally in the coming weeks.

Ethereum Price Movement As of now, Ethereum is trading at $1,874, showing a 3.5% increase in the past day. While the price is still far from its recent high of $2,104, ETH appears to be gaining momentum. The altcoin‚Äôs market cap is around $225 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $15.23 billion, indicating strong interest from traders and investors.

The Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions filed a joint stipulation of dismissal on March 31, ending its case against Coinbase for offering unregistered securities through its staking program. Source: ctfassets.net This follows a growing trend of state-level regulatory reversals. Vermont withdrew its lawsuit against Coinbase on March 14 , citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) own decision to drop its federal case in February. South Carolina quickly followed suit , dismissing its case on March 27 after local users reportedly lost around $2 million in staking rewards due to the ban. Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, responded to Kentucky‚Äôs move on social media, urging Congress to implement a unified federal market structure for crypto. @GovAndyBeshear ‚Äôs Department of Financial Institutions has followed suit by dismissing Kentucky's staking lawsuit against @coinbase ‚Äî just as Vermont and South Carolina recently did.

While three states have now reversed their stance, seven others, including California, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington, Alabama, Maryland, and Wisconsin, still have pending legal actions against Coinbase. Kentucky‚Äôs Bitcoin Rights Bill Kentucky‚Äôs decision to drop the lawsuit against Coinbase aligns closely with its recent legislative push toward pro-crypto policies. Just days before the case was dismissed, Governor Andy Beshear signed House Bill 701, also known as the ‚ÄúBitcoin Rights‚Äù bill , into law. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has officially signed House Bill 701, known as the ‚ÄúBitcoin Rights‚Äù bill, into law. #Kentucky #Bitcoin https://t.co/YQjxgcHiEV ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 This bill, which passed unanimously in both the House and Senate, provides significant protections for crypto users and businesses in the state. Among its key provisions, HB701 enshrines the right for individuals to self-custody digital assets, run blockchain nodes, and conduct transactions without the threat of discriminatory regulation. Additionally, the bill shields mining operations from restrictive zoning laws and prevents crypto staking from being classified as a securities offering. Kentucky is also considering another bill that would allow the State Investment Commission to allocate up to 10% of the state‚Äôs excess reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets. This move would position Kentucky alongside states like Oklahoma, Missouri , and Arizona , which are exploring similar crypto investment strategies. Oklahoma, for instance, recently advanced its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203) , which authorizes state investment in Bitcoin. Oklahoma moves closer to Bitcoin adoption with the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act approval. #Oklahoma #Bitcoin https://t.co/8uMp7IYMrD ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 26, 2025 Missouri and Arizona have also introduced bills that seek to establish digital asset reserves, reflecting a growing nationwide trend of state-level crypto adoption. Broader Implications for U.S. Crypto Regulation Kentucky‚Äôs dismissal of the lawsuit and the passage of its Bitcoin Rights bill are part of a larger shift in how states approach crypto regulation. The move shows increasing resistance to the SEC‚Äôs aggressive enforcement tactics, with multiple states opting instead for legislative clarity rather than punitive actions against crypto firms.

South Carolina‚Äôs decision to drop its case coincided with the introduction of the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Act, which proposes that the state allocate up to 10% of certain funds into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This bill, filed by Rep. Jordan Pace, authorizes the state treasurer to hold up to one million BTC in reserves, marking a significant step toward state-level crypto adoption. With several state legislatures now actively considering bills to integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies, the legal battles against Coinbase and similar companies may continue to weaken in favor of clearer, more structured crypto regulations at both state and federal levels.

Despite high market capitalization, Bitcoin has zero intrinsic value, and declining transaction volumes and active addresses indicate waning adoption. Comparisons to precious metals are flawed; cryptocurrencies lack tangible value and diverse applications, being primarily used for speculation. The current data suggests Bitcoin is a bubble propped up by fewer users, leading me to reaffirm a 'strong sell' rating. Those who follow my work closely know that I am no fan of cryptocurrency. My own professional opinion is that most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC-USD) , are very nearly worthless. Over the years, the markets have disagreed with me. But it's not uncommon for markets to behave irrationally, sometimes for many years. Those who have speculated on Bitcoin specifically moving higher have been well rewarded. Back in December of last year, Bitcoin hit an all-time high price of over $109,000. It has since fallen to $87,543. But in all fairness, markets in general have taken a beating, especially almost anything related to the technology space. Cryptocurrency has been particularly volatile during its lifetime, with prices soaring and plummeting from time to time. As I have made clear in previous articles, such as here and here , I don't know what the future holds for Bitcoin. In the near term, we very well could see significantly higher prices than what we have seen in the past. For those who like to gamble instead of invest, this can be a very profitable thing to focus on. The value investor in me, however, eschews from this. And while this might mean that I could be wrong in the near term, I maintain my view that Bitcoin only deserves, and may always deserve, a ‚Äòstrong sell‚Äô rating. A bubble being propped up There is no doubt that cryptocurrency is currently being valued by the world rather highly. As of this writing, Bitcoin itself is being priced at about $1.73 trillion. When you add all other cryptocurrencies into the mix, this collective price shoots up to $2.86 trillion. Frankly, I find this to be outrageous. It has zero intrinsic value and it produces nothing. It does, admittedly, have some utility as a medium of exchange. But as Warren Buffett indicated, the market is valuing the check that the money is being delivered with, and nothing more. In his own words : ‚ÄúBitcoin has no unique value at all. It doesn‚Äôt produce anything. You can stare at it all day and no little Bitcoins come out or anything like that. It‚Äôs a delusion, basically... If you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, you know, it may be a couple tenths of a percent. It basically is not going to deliver anything other than a supposed scare out of people. I‚Äôll tear off a button here. What I have here is a little token... I‚Äôll offer it to you for $1,000, and I‚Äôll see if I can get the price up to $2,000 by the end of the day... But the thing is, it‚Äôs not investing.‚Äù He continued with: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a check: it‚Äôs a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is not worth a whole lot of money just because it can do that. I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way to do it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view.‚Äù To put in perspective the sheer enormity of the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, consider that if this price stood as the equivalent to a nation's GDP, it would make cryptocurrency as a whole larger than the 8th largest country on the planet. It would sandwich it between France and Italy , with the latter being smaller, with GDP for this year being forecasted by the IMF of $2.46 trillion. It's crazy to think that a digital ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô with no underlying asset to back it is considered to be worth more than the entire annual economic output of the 59 million people that currently reside in Italy. Ultimately, I believe that when the history of this era is written, economic historians will view cryptocurrency as perhaps the largest bubble the world has ever known. Data by YCharts [object HTMLElement] At this time, cracks do appear to be forming in the bullish narrative. In the chart above, you can see the price that Bitcoin has traded at over the past few years. Recently, we have seen a downturn. But as I mentioned earlier in this article, extreme volatility in this space is not unheard of. The cracks that I speak of focus on deeper matters. As an example, we need only look at the chart below. In it, you can see a blue line and green bars. The blue line represents the US dollar value of all Bitcoin transactions each month from March 2020 through February 2025. Author - Data from Bitcoin City After plunging in 2021, volume seemed to be declining. However, it has seen a resurgence since then. Those looking only at that data might think that the worst is over. However, the total volume of Bitcoins being traded has continued to drop. In fact, the green bars that show this show a very clear trend of ever lower volume. This indicates to me that something is awry. Keep in mind that the entire narrative that the bulls in the space promote centers around the idea of this being the currency of the future. It's all about adoption and becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is true that if Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general becomes accepted by the masses, it could very well remain relevant for the foreseeable future. But you don't see declining volumes and growing acceptance occur simultaneously. Author - Data from Glassnode Studio This is not the only data that I have in my arsenal. If you look at the table above and the chart below, you will see monthly data for the last five years that details out the number of active addresses in the space. Active addresses are unique wallet addresses that are involved in transactions using blockchain technology over a span of time. A wallet is considered to have an active address if it either sends cryptocurrency or receives cryptocurrency in that timeframe. Again, if this was a technology that is on its way to mass market acceptance, you would expect the number of active addresses to increase. But the exact opposite is happening. Author - Data from Glassnode Studio In 2024, the number of active addresses was lower than it had been in previous years. In fact, if we average this data out, the average number of active addresses in 2024 came out to 14.44 million. That's 19.8% lower than the 18 million averaged during 2023. In fact, it's lower than any of the other years that I looked at dating back to 2020. We do also have data for January 2025. The 14.19 million active addresses experienced during that month ended up being 21% lower than what was achieved in January 2024. As the second chart below illustrates, it is also substantially lower than any January of the last six years. Author - Data from Glassnode Studio Author - Data from Glassnode Studio This, to me, looks like a bubble that is being propped up by ever shrinking activity. Fewer people are utilizing Bitcoin today than they were in any of the last five years. Of course, this doesn't mean that fewer people own it. One analysis found that 28% of American adults, which translates to roughly 65 million people, currently own some form of cryptocurrency. But this does not necessarily mean that cryptocurrency is going to remain relevant. In fact, the ownership percentage in the US is down from the 30% seen back in 2023 and the 33% seen back in 2022. Furthermore, while data is hard to come by, it is generally accepted that a vast majority of cryptocurrency is owned for investment or speculative purposes. Those who are bullish on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies sometimes liken it to precious metals like gold and silver. But these comparisons are tenuous at best. One obvious difference is that precious metals are truly tangible and will exist forever. Cryptocurrency is nothing but code. Another difference is that precious metals are used for far more than just investment or speculative purposes. In 2024, only 23.7% of gold was used for investment purposes. Another 21% was used by central banks. However, other major categories included jewelry and technology. Jewelry accounted for 40.3% of demand, while technology accounted for 6.6%. Central banks have not come even close to fully accepting cryptocurrency. In fact, the US and China combined own less than 2% of all Bitcoin that will ever be issued. It has no use for jewelry or technology either. At the end of the day, it can only be used for transactions or speculative purposes. And at this time, most of it seems to be for speculation. Takeaway The data right now does not look particularly pleasant for those who are bullish about Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency appears to be propped up by nothing more than a shrinking number of ardent supporters. While it is possible that we could see further price spikes in the near term, a dwindling number of users utilizing the faux currency less and less does not bode well for the bubble that I believe exists in this market. At the end of the day, this leaves me with no choice but to reaffirm Bitcoin as a ‚Äòstrong sell‚Äô at this time.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-01 11:55:33

Ethereum is facing resistance near $1,808, while Solana continues to hold steady above $126 despite recent volatility. Pepe (PEPE) remains a meme coin favorite with speculative momentum, but it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that‚Äôs turning heads. It launched its fourth phase of funding during its altcoin presale where investors bought it at $0.025 while contributing over $6 million. More than 7700 investors have entered at the current price levels because they expect a projected 20% price surge before the upcoming stage to $0.03. The launch price at $0.06 gives investors who enter during this period the potential to receive a 140% profit. Mutuum Finance presale Mutuum Finance attracts significant investor attention because it implements decentralized finance solutions for crypto loans together with decentralized finance funding mechanisms for its financial service development. The project grows steadily because it acquired more than $6 million from investors and now engages a growing number of 7700 investors. Investors face limited entry choices given a $0.025 Phase 4 token price because of a 20% price boost next stage to $0.03. Investors who participate in the current presale period will receive 140% profits from their investment because the platform already set a future price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance steers the decentralized market ahead using its innovative lending solution and its established market position. The Mutuum Finance team is working on getting its smart contract audited by certik and once that will be finalized it will be announced on social media. The dual-model system of crypto lending Mutuum Finance operates a contemporary lending platform which combines Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models to enable better access to assets and transparency for user empowerment.

42749161,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145000,1743508805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Algorand Water Credits: Portugal‚Äôs Indaqua Leads Sustainable Tokenization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/algorand-water-credits-portugal/,"In an exciting development bridging environmental sustainability with blockchain innovation, Portugal‚Äôs leading water management company, Indaqua, is taking a plunge into the world of cryptocurrency. Imagine a world where conserving water not only benefits the environment but also translates into tangible digital assets. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality as Indaqua collaborates with Hypercube‚Äôs Wateract (WRT) to introduce tokenized water credits on the energy-efficient Algorand blockchain. Let‚Äôs dive into how this groundbreaking initiative is set to reshape corporate water footprint management and champion environmental responsibility. What are Algorand Water Credits and Why are They Revolutionary? At the heart of this initiative lies the concept of water credits , a novel approach to quantifying and incentivizing water conservation. Think of them as environmental offsets, but specifically for water usage. For every unit of wastewater Indaqua successfully treats and converts, an equivalent amount of Wateract (WRT) credits are issued. These credits, built on the robust and eco-friendly Algorand blockchain , can then be purchased by companies looking to neutralize their water footprint. But why is this revolutionary? Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain technology ensures that every water credit is transparently recorded and easily traceable. This eliminates ambiguity and fosters trust in the system. Efficiency and Speed: Algorand, known for its speed and low transaction fees, provides an efficient platform for issuing and trading these water credits. This makes the process seamless and cost-effective. Incentivizing Sustainable Practices: By creating a market for water credits, Indaqua and Hypercube are directly incentivizing companies to reduce their water consumption and support sustainable water management practices. Global Applicability: The digital nature of tokenization and blockchain allows this system to be potentially scaled and adopted globally, addressing water scarcity challenges on a larger scale. The Power of Tokenization for Environmental Impact Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. In this case, the asset is ‚Äòsaved water‚Äô or ‚Äòtreated wastewater‚Äô. Why is this approach so powerful for environmental initiatives? Traditional methods of environmental offsetting can often be complex, opaque, and lack verification. Tokenization , especially on a public blockchain like Algorand, addresses these issues head-on: Increased Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be easily traded on digital exchanges, creating a more liquid market for environmental credits compared to traditional, often bureaucratic, systems. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization allows for the fractionalization of water credits, making it accessible for businesses of all sizes to participate in offsetting their water footprint. Automated Verification: Smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the verification and issuance of water credits based on pre-defined criteria, reducing manual intervention and increasing accuracy. Enhanced Security: Blockchain‚Äôs inherent security features ensure the integrity and immutability of water credit transactions, preventing fraud and double-counting. Indaqua and Hypercube: Pioneering Sustainability in Portugal Sustainability is no longer a buzzword; it‚Äôs a business imperative. Indaqua, a leading water and wastewater management company in Portugal, recognizes this and is taking proactive steps to integrate sustainable practices into its operations. Their collaboration with Hypercube‚Äôs Wateract (WRT) is a testament to their commitment. Indaqua‚Äôs expertise in water management, combined with Hypercube‚Äôs blockchain proficiency, creates a powerful synergy. By leveraging Algorand‚Äôs technology, they are not just issuing water credits ; they are building a robust and transparent ecosystem for corporate water stewardship in Portugal and potentially beyond. Key aspects of this partnership include: Aspect Description Company Collaboration Indaqua (Water Management) & Hypercube (Blockchain Technology) Technology Platform Algorand Blockchain ‚Äì known for speed, security, and environmental friendliness. Credit Type Wateract (WRT) ‚Äì Utility token representing water credits. Objective Enable companies to offset their water footprint by purchasing WRT credits. Geographic Focus Initially Portugal, with potential for global expansion. Navigating the Challenges and Embracing the Future of Water Credits While the potential of water credits on the blockchain is immense, some challenges need to be addressed for widespread adoption: Regulatory Framework: Clear regulatory guidelines for environmental tokenization and trading are crucial to provide legal certainty and encourage participation. Standardization: Establishing industry standards for measuring and verifying water savings is essential to ensure the credibility and comparability of water credits. Market Education: Educating businesses about the benefits of water credits and how they can effectively integrate them into their sustainability strategies is vital. Scalability and Adoption: Ensuring the system can scale to accommodate growing demand and encouraging broad adoption across various industries are key to long-term success. Despite these challenges, the Indaqua-Hypercube initiative represents a significant step forward in leveraging blockchain for environmental good. It showcases how innovative technologies can be used to create market-based solutions for pressing global issues like water scarcity. Actionable Insights: Are Water Credits the Next Frontier in Corporate Responsibility? For businesses looking to enhance their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) profiles, exploring water credits presents a compelling opportunity. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Your Water Footprint: Understand your company‚Äôs water consumption across your operations and supply chain. Explore Water Reduction Strategies: Implement water-efficient technologies and practices to minimize your water usage. Consider Water Credit Offsetting: Investigate purchasing water credits to offset unavoidable water consumption and support water conservation projects. Engage with Blockchain Initiatives: Stay informed about developments in environmental tokenization and explore opportunities to participate in blockchain-based sustainability initiatives. Communicate Your Commitment: Publicly communicate your efforts towards water stewardship and sustainability , including your involvement in water credit programs. Conclusion: A Transformative Step Towards Water-Positive Future Indaqua‚Äôs pioneering collaboration with Hypercube to issue water credits on the Algorand blockchain is more than just a news story; it‚Äôs a glimpse into a future where environmental responsibility and technological innovation converge. By tokenizing water conservation efforts, they are creating a powerful incentive system that can drive real change in how businesses manage and value water. This initiative not only positions Portugal as a leader in sustainable innovation but also sets a precedent for other nations and industries to follow. As we face increasing environmental challenges, such innovative approaches offer a beacon of hope, demonstrating how we can leverage technology to build a more sustainable and water-positive world.

A joint court filing by the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions and the crypto exchange disclosed this on March 31. The filing shows that both parties agreed to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. This adds Kentucky to the growing list of states that are dropping their legal action against Coinbase after they sued the exchange for its staking service in 2023 which they said amounts to unregistered securities. Vermont and South Carolina have also dismissed. Kentucky and Coinbase court filing. Source: Coinbase Coinbase is one of the biggest staking-as-a-service operators in the US, with 3.84 million ETH staked and 120,000 validators under its control. The exchange is also the largest node operator, with 11.42% of staked ETH. However, staking has attracted concerns from state and federal regulators for years, with some exchanges, such as Kraken, even paying fines for offering staking service. All that has changed since President Donald Trump was sworn in. Regulators have become more receptive to the crypto industry at the state and federal levels. This was what influenced Vermont to drop its own action on March 14, with the state noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had dismissed its lawsuit against the exchange. Nevertheless, seven states, including California, Washington, Maryland, Alabama, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Illinois, still have enforcement actions pending against Coinbase. It is likely that these states will eventually dismiss their lawsuits as well. In the meantime, Coinbase chief legal counsel Paul Grewal took to X to complain about the state-driven regulatory approach to issues such as crypto staking, noting that Congress needs to step in with federal legislation. He said: ‚ÄúCongress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law ASAP.‚Äù Before now, Grewal had described the several lawsuit dismissals as a win for the crypto industry, innovation and consumers. According to him, the lawsuit that made Coinbase suspend its staking service in South Carolina cost the state residents $2 million in staking rewards. Kentucky‚Äôs new Bitcoin Rights law led to Coinbase lawsuit dismissal While Grewal is calling for federal legislation on issues such as staking, it is local laws that made Kentucky dismiss its lawsuit. The dismissal comes less than a week after Governor Andy Beshear signed the Bitcoin Rights Bill into law. The law, which grants state residents the right to self-custody, use digital assets, and operate nodes, also provided legal clarity for the crypto industry. Under the law, mining and staking are no longer considered securities, and node operators are no longer classified as money transmitters. The bill was introduced on February 19, which means it took less than two months for legislators to pass it through the two chambers of the state legislature and for the governor to assent to it. Besides its clarity on staking and mining, it also bans any zoning changes that will discriminate against crypto mining. Meanwhile, Kentucky also has a bill on establishing a Bitcoin reserve that could see the state allocate up to 10% of its portfolio to digital assets. That proposed legislation is still undergoing review. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The order entails the establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile with the goal of considering Bitcoin a key national asset. The upcoming disclosure will reveal what the government owns at the moment and its plan regarding digital assets in the future. The US government is considering holding Bitcoin long-term Under the executive order signed by Trump, federal agencies were asked to submit their balance sheets on cryptocurrencies within one month. The Treasury Secretary¬†is required to create two new executive offices to oversee the government‚Äôs digital properties. This initiative aims to make the U.S. Treasury hold Bitcoin in the same way it holds gold, having a vault-like ‚Äúdigital Fort Knox.‚Äù The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is for Bitcoin acquired from the seizure of properties related to criminal and civil litigation, and the government has agreed not to dispose of these assets. According to BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey, the price volatility in the last couple of months is due to the audit results. However, this decline came about even while the Bitcoin Reserve was established. April 5th (this Saturday) the USA must complete a full audit of the nation‚Äôs bitcoin holdings. Depending on what we learn, might answer many of the open questions about the recent price action. ‚Äî David Baileyüáµüá∑ $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) March 31, 2025 Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the US Government currently possesses 198,012 Bitcoin, worth about $16 billion. The government sold around 50% of the 400,000 mined over the last decade, garnering $366 million. These assets would now fetch a valuation exceeding $17 billion. Proposed $200 billion ‚Äò‚Çø Bonds‚Äô could save U.S. taxpayers billions Further elevating the strategic shift towards cryptocurrency even higher, the Bitcoin Policy Institute presented the government with a proposal to purchase Bitcoin without using the money from the taxpayers. Accordingly, the Institute advises the issuing of ‚Äú$2 trillion worth of Bitcoin-Enhanced Treasury Bonds‚Äù referred to as ‚Äú‚Çø Bonds‚Äù. These ‚Çø Bonds would allocate 90% of the proceeds to traditional government funding while using the remaining 10% to purchase Bitcoin. They would have a relatively lower 1% interest rate which is much lower than the current 10-year treasury yield that averages 4.5%. Investors, on the other hand, receive exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs returns through structured payoff at maturity. The bond structure provides full repayment while adding even more Bitcoin-based returns into the mix to entice investors with a blend of security and crypto-related income streams. Financial modeling by the Institute indicates that the changes will save taxpayers huge sums of money. Despite having an unchanging Bitcoin price for the past 10 years, the government could still save around $354 billion even if it spends $200 billion to buy Bitcoin. If Bitcoin follows historical performance, large parts of the national debt could be offset by 2045. Furthermore, ‚Çø Bonds‚Äô costs include tax-exempting status for interest and Bitcoin profits, which enhances their utility as consumer-welfare stores of value. Over 132 million households in the United States are expected to take part, at an average of $3,025 per household. Institutional and international investors would absorb 80% of the bonds, while U.S. households would take 20%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Tabichain, the Cosmos-based Layer-1 blockchain that‚Äôs been generating significant buzz, has announced a strategic shift in its roadmap. The team has decided to postpone its highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE), initially slated for the first quarter. This news, delivered via an official X (formerly Twitter) announcement, has sparked conversations across the crypto community. But what‚Äôs behind this decision, and what does it mean for the future of Tabichain and the broader Cosmos ecosystem? Let‚Äôs dive into the details. Understanding Tabichain: A Consumer-Centric Cosmos-Based Layer-1 Blockchain For those just tuning in, Tabichain is designed as a cutting-edge Layer-1 blockchain built on the robust and interoperable Cosmos blockchain network. Imagine a blockchain specifically tailored for the everyday consumer ‚Äì that‚Äôs Tabichain‚Äôs vision. It aims to simplify blockchain technology, making it more accessible and user-friendly for a wide range of applications, from decentralized social media to next-gen gaming and beyond. By leveraging the power of Cosmos, Tabichain seeks to create a seamless and interconnected blockchain experience. Key Aspects of Tabichain: Cosmos Ecosystem Foundation: Built on the Cosmos SDK, Tabichain benefits from the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling interoperability with other Cosmos chains. This positions Tabichain within a vibrant and growing ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. Consumer Focus: Unlike some blockchains geared primarily towards developers or enterprises, Tabichain is explicitly designed for consumer applications. This focus drives its development choices, aiming for ease of use and intuitive interfaces. Layer-1 Architecture: As a Layer-1 blockchain, Tabichain provides its own foundational infrastructure. This allows for greater control over scalability, security, and customization compared to building on existing platforms. Vision for Decentralized Applications (dApps): Tabichain aims to be the go-to platform for developers building consumer-facing dApps. Its architecture is optimized to support high transaction volumes and user-friendly experiences. Why the TGE Postponement? Unpacking Tabichain‚Äôs Challenges The announcement of the Token Generation Event postponement cited a combination of factors. It‚Äôs not uncommon in the fast-paced world of crypto for projects to adjust timelines. Tabichain pointed to challenges across four key areas: Technical Development: Building a robust and scalable Layer-1 blockchain is a complex undertaking. Unforeseen technical hurdles or the need for further optimization can necessitate timeline adjustments. This is a common reality in blockchain development, where innovation is constantly pushing the boundaries of technology. Market Preparation: The crypto market is notoriously volatile and influenced by numerous external factors. Projects often need to carefully time their TGE to coincide with favorable market conditions to maximize success and community engagement. Perhaps Tabichain is waiting for a more opportune moment in the market cycle. Token Economics: Crafting a sustainable and effective tokenomic model is crucial for the long-term health of any blockchain project. Refining token distribution, utility, and incentives can be a complex process that requires thorough analysis and potentially, adjustments based on evolving market dynamics and community feedback. Strategic Direction: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Projects must be agile and adapt to new trends and opportunities. A postponement could indicate a strategic pivot or refinement in Tabichain‚Äôs overall direction, ensuring it aligns with the current and future needs of the market and its users. It‚Äôs important to note that while a delay might initially seem like negative news, it can often be a sign of a project prioritizing quality and long-term success over rushing to market. A well-considered postponement can allow Tabichain to address challenges comprehensively and emerge stronger. The Significance of a Token Generation Event (TGE) in Crypto For those newer to the crypto space, understanding what a Token Generation Event entails is crucial. The TGE , also sometimes referred to as an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial DEX Offering (IDO), is a pivotal moment for a blockchain project. It marks the public launch of the project‚Äôs native token. Key Aspects of a TGE: Token Distribution: The TGE is when the project‚Äôs tokens are first distributed to the public, often in exchange for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This distribution can occur through various mechanisms, including public sales, private sales, and airdrops. Funding and Community Building: TGEs are a primary means for blockchain projects to raise capital to fund development, marketing, and operations. They also serve as a crucial step in building a community around the project. Token Utility and Ecosystem Growth: The TGE introduces the project‚Äôs native token, which typically plays a vital role within the blockchain‚Äôs ecosystem. Tokens can be used for transaction fees, governance, staking, accessing platform features, and more. A successful TGE can kickstart ecosystem growth and adoption. Market Entry and Price Discovery: Once tokens are distributed through the TGE, they typically become tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges. This marks the project‚Äôs entry into the broader crypto market and allows for price discovery based on supply and demand. Therefore, the timing and execution of a TGE are critical for a project‚Äôs trajectory. A delay, while potentially causing short-term disappointment, can be a strategic move to ensure a more successful and impactful launch in the long run. Navigating the Token Generation Event Landscape: Lessons from Tabichain‚Äôs Delay Tabichain‚Äôs decision to postpone its TGE offers valuable lessons for both projects and participants in the crypto space. It highlights the complexities involved in launching a successful blockchain and the importance of strategic decision-making. Key Takeaways: Realistic Timelines are Crucial: The crypto industry is known for ambitious timelines, but building robust technology takes time. Tabichain‚Äôs delay underscores the need for realistic development schedules and the flexibility to adjust as needed. Market Conditions Matter: External market factors play a significant role in the success of a TGE . Projects must be attuned to market sentiment and be prepared to adapt their launch plans accordingly. Tokenomics Refinement is Ongoing: Creating effective token economics is not a one-time task. Continuous evaluation and refinement are necessary to ensure the token model remains sustainable and aligned with the project‚Äôs goals. Strategic Agility is Key: The ability to adapt to changing circumstances and make strategic adjustments, even if it means delaying a highly anticipated event, is a sign of a mature and responsible project team. The Future of Tabichain and the Cosmos Ecosystem While the TGE postponement is a change in the immediate timeline, it doesn‚Äôt diminish the long-term potential of Tabichain . As a Cosmos-based Layer-1 blockchain focused on consumers, Tabichain addresses a significant need in the crypto space ‚Äì making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. The strategic decision to delay the TGE suggests a commitment to ensuring a stronger and more successful launch when the time is right. The Cosmos blockchain ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, and Tabichain is poised to be a valuable addition. By taking the time to address technical, market, tokenomic, and strategic considerations, Tabichain is positioning itself for long-term success and contribution to the decentralized future. Keep an eye on Tabichain ‚Äì this strategic pause could very well set the stage for an even more impactful entry into the crypto landscape. In conclusion, Tabichain‚Äôs TGE postponement, while initially surprising, appears to be a calculated move aimed at strengthening the project‚Äôs foundation and ensuring a more successful launch. It‚Äôs a reminder that in the dynamic world of crypto, strategic patience and adaptability can be powerful assets. The future remains bright for Tabichain and its vision for a consumer-centric blockchain experience within the Cosmos ecosystem.

March 2024 turned out to be another rollercoaster month in the digital currency world, but not in a good way. While we often celebrate the gains and innovations, it‚Äôs crucial to face the harsh realities too. A recent report from blockchain security firm PeckShield reveals a sobering statistic: 20 crypto hacks occurred in March alone, resulting in a staggering $33.46 million in total losses . This news serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present risks in the cryptocurrency space and underscores the critical need for robust cryptocurrency security measures. Unveiling the March Crypto Hacks: A Detailed Breakdown PeckShield, a reputable name in blockchain security, broke the news via their PeckShieldAlert X account, painting a concerning picture of the crypto landscape in March. Twenty separate incidents of crypto hacks were recorded, each contributing to the hefty $33.46 million loss. Let‚Äôs delve deeper into some of the major breaches that headlined this month of turmoil: Abracadabra.money: Topping the list with a jaw-dropping $13 million loss, this decentralized finance (DeFi) platform suffered a significant blow. The specifics of the hack are still being analyzed, but the sheer scale of the theft is a major concern for users and investors in the DeFi sector. Zoth: Following closely behind, Zoth experienced a painful $8.32 million exploit. Details surrounding this DeFi hack are also emerging, but the substantial amount lost highlights the vulnerabilities that can plague even projects aiming to innovate in the decentralized finance arena. 1inch: A well-known name in the decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator space, 1inch was also targeted, with hackers making off with approximately $5 million. This incident is particularly noteworthy as it impacts a platform widely used for its security and efficiency in aggregating DEX liquidity. Why are Crypto Hacks on the Rise? Understanding Cryptocurrency Security Challenges The increasing frequency of crypto hacks raises a crucial question: why are these digital heists becoming so common? Several factors contribute to this worrying trend, highlighting the ongoing challenges in cryptocurrency security : Complexity of Smart Contracts: DeFi platforms heavily rely on smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements written in code. However, the complexity of these contracts can introduce vulnerabilities if not rigorously audited and tested. Hackers are constantly searching for loopholes in these intricate systems. Open-Source Nature: While transparency is a core tenet of blockchain, the open-source nature of many crypto projects can also be a double-edged sword. Malicious actors can scrutinize the code for weaknesses, potentially identifying exploits before developers can patch them. Human Error: Even with the most secure technology, human error remains a significant factor. Mistakes in code, weak security practices by users (like poor password management or phishing susceptibility), and insider threats can all create openings for crypto losses . Evolving Attack Vectors: Hackers are constantly refining their techniques, developing new and sophisticated methods to breach security protocols. As blockchain technology evolves, so too do the attack vectors, demanding continuous adaptation and innovation in security measures. Decentralized and Less Regulated Space: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency, while empowering, also means less centralized oversight and regulation compared to traditional financial systems. This can make it harder to track down and prosecute cybercriminals involved in crypto hacks , emboldening malicious activity. The Devastating Impact of Crypto Losses: Beyond the Dollar Amount While the $33.46 million figure is substantial, the impact of crypto losses extends far beyond just the monetary value. These incidents can have profound consequences for individuals and the wider crypto ecosystem: Erosion of Trust: Each major hack chips away at the trust that users and investors have in the cryptocurrency space. When platforms touted for their security fall victim to exploits, it can breed skepticism and hinder wider adoption. Financial Hardship for Individuals: For individuals who lose their crypto holdings in these hacks, the financial impact can be devastating. Unlike traditional banking, recovering stolen cryptocurrency is often extremely difficult, if not impossible. Reputational Damage for Projects: Projects that suffer DeFi hacks or other security breaches face significant reputational damage. Recovering from such incidents and regaining user confidence can be a long and arduous process. Setback for Innovation: The constant threat of hacks can stifle innovation in the crypto space. Developers and entrepreneurs may become more cautious and less willing to push boundaries if security concerns overshadow the potential for progress. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased instances of crypto hacks often lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Governments and regulatory bodies may feel compelled to impose stricter rules and oversight to protect consumers and maintain financial stability. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Hacks: Actionable Insights for Security While the news of March crypto hacks is concerning, it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. There are proactive steps that individuals and projects can take to bolster cryptocurrency security and mitigate risks: For Individuals For Crypto Projects/Platforms Use Hardware Wallets: Store your crypto offline in hardware wallets for enhanced security against online threats. Enable 2FA: Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA) on all crypto exchange and platform accounts. Be Vigilant Against Phishing: Exercise caution with emails, links, and messages, and verify the authenticity of websites before entering credentials. Diversify Holdings: Don‚Äôt keep all your crypto eggs in one basket. Diversify across different platforms and wallets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date on the latest security threats and best practices in the crypto space. Conduct Regular Security Audits: Engage reputable security firms to conduct thorough audits of smart contracts and platform infrastructure. Implement Robust Security Protocols: Adopt industry-leading security measures, including encryption, intrusion detection systems, and multi-signature wallets. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize white-hat hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities in your code through bug bounty programs. Incident Response Plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to effectively handle security breaches and minimize damage. Transparency and Communication: Be transparent with users about security measures and communicate promptly in case of any incidents. Conclusion: Turning Setbacks into Stepping Stones for a Secure Crypto Future The revelation of 20 crypto hacks in March, culminating in millions of dollars lost, serves as a harsh but necessary wake-up call. It underscores the persistent vulnerabilities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the critical importance of prioritizing cryptocurrency security . While these crypto losses are undoubtedly setbacks, they also present an opportunity for growth and improvement. By learning from these incidents, strengthening security protocols, and fostering a culture of vigilance, the crypto community can work towards building a more resilient and secure future for decentralized finance. The journey towards mainstream adoption hinges on establishing trust, and robust security is the cornerstone of that trust.

Is the Expected Return Coming? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-reclaims-top-as-leading-dex-chain-is-the-expected-return-coming-here-are-the-details/,"Ethereum has reclaimed its position as the top blockchain for decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, surpassing Solana for the first time since September 2024. Ethereum Reclaims Top as Leading DEX Chain, Surpasses Solana for First Time Since September This shift comes amid a broader market downturn, particularly in the memecoin sector, which has seen a decline in speculative activity. According to DefiLlama, Ethereum-based DEXs recorded a cumulative trading volume of $64.62 billion in March, surpassing Solana‚Äôs $52.62 billion by 22%. This signals a return to dominance for Ethereum, which had lagged behind Solana in recent months. Market Conditions and Declining Solana Activity The leadership change comes as total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 4.2% to $2.63 trillion, continuing the 20% decline from February. The market downturn was affected by macroeconomic uncertainty and investor frustration over the lack of new Bitcoin purchases in the US strategic reserve, sending Bitcoin prices falling below $80,000. The downtrend has significantly impacted Solana‚Äôs ecosystem, especially its leading DEX, Raydium, which is a hotspot for memecoin trading. Throughout March, Raydium did not record a single day with trading volume exceeding $1 billion, a sharp decline from the record $13 billion on January 18. Additionally, daily volumes on Solana‚Äôs memecoin launchpad have fallen below $100 million from a peak of $390 million in mid-January. Much of Solana‚Äôs previous dominance was attributed to the frenzy surrounding memecoin trading, including the launch of the TRUMP token in January, which briefly caused a spike in activity. The Resurgence of Ethereum Ethereum‚Äôs return to the top was largely driven by Uniswap, which accounted for over $30 billion in trading volume, while Fluid, another Ethereum-based DEX, followed with $9 billion in trading volume. *This is not investment advice.

An unauthorized party withdrew about $70 million in digital assets from open-source payment platform UPCX, according to a security alert issued on April 1. The blockchain security firm Cyvers flagged suspicious activity involving 18.4 million UPC tokens, estimating the value of the compromised funds at $70 million. Cyvers said someone accessed a UPCX address and upgraded its ProxyAdmin contract. The attacker then executed a function that allows admins to withdraw, leading to fund transfers from three different management accounts. At the time of writing, the stolen tokens had not been swapped for other crypto assets. Cointelegraph contacted UPCX for comment but did not receive an immediate response. UPC price dips by 7% amid unauthorized transfer UPCX acknowledged it had detected ‚Äúunauthorized activity‚Äù involving its management accounts. The team suspended deposits and withdrawals for UPCX in response to the incident. It said user assets are unaffected by the issue and it is actively investigating the matter. UPC‚Äôs token price dropped amid news of the incident. According to CoinGecko, UPC‚Äôs token prices dropped 7%, from a high of $4.06 to a low of $3.77 during the incident. UPCX 24-hour price chart. Source: CoinGecko Related: Hacker steals $8.4M from RWA restaking protocol Zoth UPC hack mirrors previous attack patterns In a statement, Cyvers co-founder and chief technology officer Meir Dolev told Cointelegraph that while the root cause of the attack remained under investigation, these types of incidents often stem from compromised credentials or flawed access control mechanisms. Dolev told Cointelegraph that both of these vulnerabilities have been the predominant cause of Web3 losses in 2024. The executive said the same causes were responsible for over 80% of the stolen funds during the year. The cybersecurity executive also said the attack pattern was similar to previous exploits. Dolev told Cointelegraph: ‚ÄúThis incident mirrors attack patterns we‚Äôve documented in prior exploits, where access to critical administrative roles enabled malicious upgrades and fund drainage.‚Äù The executive added that the hack underscored an urgent need to enhance security around wallet permissions, multisignature implementations and runtime transaction validation.

The historical crypto market reveals that every time March had a bearish end, April turned out to be super bullish for digital assets. Interestingly, April is also an important month, especially the first week, as Donald Trump‚Äôs Liberation Day falls on Wednesday, where right macroeconomic events could push the cryptocurrencies to new highs while the wrong ones could crash the crypto market once again. In such a volatile market, let us discuss the strongest crypto token investors must keep this week and why. Strongest Crypto to Hold This Week As Donald Trump‚Äôs new tariff decision will be revealed on April 2, experts are anticipating high volatility this week. At this time, the investors‚Äô sentiments can significantly affect the top crypto‚Äôs performance, especially those like XRP, which face a heavier impact. At the same time, crypto assets like Pepe Coin and others could become the perfect crypto to hold due to the limited impact of the situation. More importantly, the historical stats reveal that PEPE‚Äôs price has surged multiple times when the crypto market‚Äôs trends were unfavorable. PEPE is the market‚Äôs third biggest and most popular meme coin . Its performance has driven the entire meme-themed cryptos market. Additionally, it is often among the first few tokens to witness recovery due to high crypto whale and investors‚Äô demand. Besides, experts anticipate PEPE will slip Shiba Inu, which has a market cap twice its, indicating its high potential and investors‚Äô trust. Even if this week brings volatility, this is a safe asset with high recovery odds, making this the perfect crypto to hold. How‚Äôs Pepe Coin Performing Today, and What‚Äôs Next? After losing nearly 74% of its performance in the market downtrend, the Pepe Coin price is attempting recovery today. Its value has surged 7% today, currently trading at $0.00000752 with a market capitalization of $3.16B. This surge came amid the broader crypto market recovery and rising investor confidence, as its trading volume has surged 20% to $681.35M. However, this is just the beginning, as crypto analysts anticipate a 2x rally. This Pepe Coin price prediction assumes it breaks the descending trendline and closes the candle above its 50-day EMA. Experts believe this possibility would bring bullish results, catering to a 25% rally and achievement of its February high of $0.00001. Another anticipated 300% surge from the current levels, and PEPE reaching a new ATH of 0.00003466. Conclusion: PEPE is the Crypto to Hold This Week Although the trajectory is not always as predicted, there‚Äôs a certain possibility that Pepe Coin finds better support in the ongoing week, making it the strongest crypto to hold. However, Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff updates may bring different results, calling for further research on the matter. More importantly, ups and downs are part of the market. Investors should focus on diversifying their portfolios, building risk management strategies, etc. The post Strongest Crypto to Hold in the First Week of April appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|crypto to buy|crypto tokens|PEPE price rally,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-01 13:39:39

The token is trading close to its key support level, with another drop seeing it risk dropping below the $1 mark in the coming weeks if the bears continue. Analysts have also warned that with no new catalyst and investor interest, XRP could witness a downtrend. As confidence fades, traders are moving to tokens offering clearer utility and potential on the upside. Ripple Faces Growing Pressure With No New Catalysts in Sight XRP price action has continued to show warning signals, with the token presently trading below its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) while barely holding above its 200-day EMA. The support at $1.85 has acted as a big shield in the past market drop, but current development shows that this level may not hold for much longer. If XRP eventually breaks through this price, analysts have warned that the token could witness a fast drop to $1.50 which could be easily followed by a drop to $1.25 if the sellers continue their activities. Trading volume has also dropped by 75%, worrying the bulls who have been hopeful for a rebound. Analysts point to this drop in volume as confirmation that confidence in XRP has been dropping. With no fresh trigger after resolving the SEC case, XRP is struggling to attract investors who are considering the wider market that has been weighed down by geopolitical uncertainty and economic issues. Some experts have even suggested that the XRP price may even drop below the critical $1 level in the coming weeks, especially if buyers continue to step back and volume remains unmoved. The lack of huge inflows in addition to the persistent downward pressure is leaving the token exposed to the bears. Unless the token discovers new fuel to push its bullish sentiment, it may continue to suffer as traders continue to move their funds into better alternatives. Remittix Raises $14.2 Million as Demand for Instant Fiat Access Grows As Ripple continues to face downward selling pressure in addition to its volume collapsing by over 75%, investors have now started moving to tokens created for utility, a sector that Remittix (RTX) excels greatly. With XRP‚Äôs price now threatening to fall under $1 and no clear trigger for a bullish sentiment in sight, investors have now started moving toward projects offering immediate, real-world solutions. Remittix stands out in this aspect, solving one of the biggest problems in the crypto sector, which is turning crypto into fiat. This platform does this without the usual friction that most platforms suffer from. The main mission of Remittix is to provide users with fast, reliable, and low-cost conversions from crypto to bank deposits. Unlike the complicated systems that demand high fees from users despite their slow processing speed, Remittix delivers access to liquidity in an instant. The platform supports an array of digital assets and fiat currencies, making it the best tool for individuals and businesses looking for fast settlement. The project has also raised about $14.2 million in its presale, showing that users are hungry for the kind of efficiency the project offers. Many traders remember the problems that come with taking out cash during high volatility periods, including slow networks, unclear rates, and multiple platforms to navigate. Remittix takes all that away, simplifying the experience and turning a process that would normally cause headaches into a seamless one. Remittix Becomes a Top Pick as Market Prioritizes Practicality In a market that has been dominated by urgency and practicality, Remittix offers users speed, clarity, and utility‚Äìqualities that many traditional platforms are struggling to acquire right now. As XRP continues to stay around the $1.85 support zone and shows signs of dropping further, investors are rethinking where they place their bets. Also, with the market now favoring tokens that have functionality in the real world, speculative tokens are being relegated to the side. That is why Remittix is the perfect choice for traders seeking sustainable value in 2025. With rising adoption and a user-first model, RTX is proving that it is more than a presale darling by cementing itself as the next challenger in the crypto payment sector.

As a result, the Bitcoin bulls have managed to elevate the levels above $84,000 at the moment, but it does not appear to prevail for long as the bulls seem to have invested most of their strength. Despite the token‚Äôs uncertainty, the institutions remain highly optimistic. BlackRock‚Äôs CEO believes Bitcoin could replace the dollar, while MicroStrategy accumulates more BTC. Regardless of the growing optimism around the token, the bulls are failing to attract the required buying pressure, keeping the price consolidated. Does this suggest the fear of market corrections among market participants has been outweighed by the bullish projections laid by excessive accumulations by the institutions? Will Bitcoin‚Äôs price remain consolidated and fail to rise above $90,000? The investors continue to remain fearful as key metrics point to a potential cooling-off phase. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening right now: Sharpe Ratio Dips to Neutral Sharpe ratio accesses the risk-adjusted return of Bitcoin, displaying the average return after eliminating the risk-free rate per unit of volatility. A good Sharpe ratio is considered when the levels are greater than 1.0. Levels higher than this range are considered excellent. Meanwhile, the Sharpe ratio has dropped back below 0 after recovering from -3.064. This suggests reduced risk-adjusted returns. Similar patterns were seen in 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2023 that preceded consolidations or corrections. Short-Term Holders in Panic Mode Bitcoin SPOR or Spent Output Profit Ratio, is calculated by dividing the realized value by the token‚Äôs value during its creation. It indicates whether the sellers are in profit or loss, assuming every moved token on the blockchain is being sold. A SOPR value above 0 usually indicates that coins moved between wallets during that period are in profit. However, the levels have dropped below 0, meaning many short-term traders are selling at a loss. Historically, this metric dipping signals capitulation but also the potential recovery once selling pressure fades. Technical Indicators Suggest Weak Momentum The price of Bitcoin is trying hard to rise above the ascending trend line that it lost during the first fortnight of March. Meanwhile, the bearish clouds continue to hover over the BTC price as the technicals do not support a bullish narrative. The MACD is heading for a bearish crossover while being within a negative range. This suggests a drop in bullish strength while the 50/200-day MA is close to experiencing a bearish crossover. This hints towards a potential pullback to be on the horizon. Moreover, the reducing OBV, or on-balance volume, also signals a drop in buying interest. Therefore, the Bitcoin price may continue to face upward pressure, but until it holds the support at $83,000, the bullish narrative may remain active. A breakdown below may drag the levels to $80,000, while a rise may help the BTC price break above $85,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 13:44:41

42753080,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/why-following-the-smart-money-could-be-a-gamechanger-for-newbie-crypto-investors,1743515140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/42753080.jpeg,Why Following the Smart Money Could be a Gamechanger for Newbie Crypto Investors,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/why-following-the-smart-money-could-be-a-gamechanger-for-newbie-crypto-investors,"Following ‚Äòsmart money' is one of the ways that newbie crypto traders and investors can avoid the pitfalls that come with actively participating in this volatile market. But what exactly is smart money in crypto and where can one track their execution strategies? The Smart Money Concept (SMC) is based on the idea that there are some well-informed investors who tend to make more strategic decisions. This group of market participants often has access to more accurate or real-time data, advanced analytic tools and insights that offer a deeper understanding of market trends and future opportunities. In traditional finance, smart money mostly comprises established financial institutions such as banks, fund managers, hedge funds and high networth individuals. These are the players that markets are keen on when they announce quarterly earnings, outlook on specific stocks or allocate significant capital towards a specific industry as was the case during the dotcom era and more recently with the AI boom. Back to the digital asset market; although still a new area of investment, there are quite a number of stakeholders that seem to have performed exceptionally well over the years. These include crypto VCs, investment firms and retail investors that caught the 2017 ICO boom, 2020/2021 DeFi summer, among other major bull runs. So, how can one leverage the insights or data that these players have already analyzed to invest like smart money? Real-Time Analytics and Wallet Tracking One of the ways that newbie crypto investors can approach the smart money concept is by using some of the available analytics platforms to track the associated wallets. For example, Nansen, one of the leading on-chain analytic platforms has gone a step further to label smart wallets based on unique factors such as hitting a cumulative minimum of $1.5 million in profits, among other relevant metrics. It is also possible to track customized dashboards through queryable crypto analytics platforms such as Dune. Just recently, a dashboard was created to track Murad‚Äôs wallet (a memecoin enthusiast and investor). With this type of insight, anyone whether a newbie or veteran can simply replicate Murad‚Äôs buys and sells in the memecoin space, giving them access to already expert analyzed executions. Decentralized Asset Management Platforms Thanks to the decentralized and permissionless nature of crypto markets, new investors can leverage a platform like Mosaic Alpha to seamlessly invest alongside smart money. This DeFi application (DApp) removes the complexity of investing for beginners and experts who don‚Äôt have the time to consistently keep tabs on the market by introducing what are known as token baskets. Instead of a newbie struggling to curate an optimal portfolio, Mosaic Alpha provides an ecosystem where smart money (asset managers and experienced crypto investors) can partner with the platform to create and list strategic token baskets made up of several crypto assets. The newbies can then invest in these token baskets, giving them the same exposure as smart money. To further democratize access to expert strategies, Mosaic Alpha has just launched its Basket Manager Combine‚Äîa three-month competition running from April to June‚Äîinviting crypto influencers, asset managers, and investors to showcase their investment strategies and attract others to participate in their exact strategy. Participants build their own token baskets using whitelisted assets, compete on the leaderboard, and earn performance-based fees from those who subscribe to their strategy. For new investors, this creates a transparent, gamified environment to follow and benefit from expert portfolio managers‚Äîmaking the smart money concept actionable and rewarding. More importantly, it‚Äôs a win-win for both parties. The new investors get to follow smart money while the smart money can generate passive income as more newbies buy into their baskets through a one-time buy fee or performance fee. Monitoring DeFi Protocols Another alpha for new crypto market entrants would be to analyze inflows, outflows and other relevant metrics through DeFi monitoring protocols. For instance, a simple glance of DeFi Llama would show a surge in activity in more nascent areas of innovation such as restaking; the sector‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) jumped from $1.3 billion at the beginning of 2024 to $16 billion as of writing. While it may not necessarily mean that smart money is investing in restaking, the trend is a good indicator of where capital is flowing into. DeFi protocols could also come in handy in the identification of outstanding protocols given that some of the platforms provide important metrics such as the number of active users, daily trading volumes, number of transactions and the native token market price over different periods. Social Media and Community Signals The crypto market tends to operate in the very ‚Äòcult like‚Äô way. At one time, everyone was investing in DeFi, NFTs and now memecoins seem to be the flashy assets; the question is how the market manages to achieve this type of synchrony? It‚Äôs all coordinated through social media platforms, mostly X, while more under the hood projects are first announced on Discord or Telegram channels. Curating one‚Äôs social media feed to follow some of the top accounts in crypto and scouting for these ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô communities is part of following the smart money. In fact, most of airdrops or initial community incentives have been announced through social media or community channels. Of course, there is the risk of getting too clouded with all the shilling but one thing is for sure; the core community is always among the first to be rewarded. Conclusion Whether one is new to crypto or holds some experience badges, there‚Äôs always another player who will likely outperform you. The goal is not to engage in a zero sum game but rather find the cutting edge; in this case, following smart money increases one‚Äôs probability of winning compared to going through the hassle of research or experimenting with one‚Äôs hard earned money. The aforementioned strategies are just a few of the examples of how to approach the smart money concept. There are more options, including tracking the buying and selling patterns by institutional investors such as Blackrock or Microstrategy; it is more likely than not that these players have a better understanding or rather resources to analyze the crypto market.

The regulatory environment globally is converging, and it is converging on an operating model that permits a wider range of products and services. Companies that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping in and those already in are working through how to bring a range of new products to market. In most technology markets, the early winners are determined long before mass-market adoption. As we‚Äôre now entering the mass adoption era for blockchain (my opinion), the options facing some companies now are either act quickly or spend the next few decades playing catch-up. If your CEO says, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no hurry, it‚Äôs early days yet,‚Äù your company has already given up the fight. For those staying in the fight, speed kills. It‚Äôs true on the road and it‚Äôs true in business. People are always forgetting that ‚Äúmove fast‚Äù came with ‚Äúbreak things.‚Äù That‚Äôs why for those rushing ahead in this market, risk management has never been a more critical skill. Done correctly, there are several ways for companies that want to sprint ahead in this market to minimize the risk of catastrophic failure. There are three I have in mind. The first step is to put in place controls and operations that close the door on past problems that other firms have experienced. This may strike you as bolting the barn door after the horse has already left, but it is necessary because if you don‚Äôt, you risk repeating history and that‚Äôs way more humiliating than committing entirely novel mistakes. Nor are the basics particularly difficult: external auditors, business controls, and standard best practices. We are also fortunate to live in an era where, for the first time, we have a good supply of experienced blockchain and crypto people who can apply real-life lessons learned. Secondly, I think it is critical for companies to think strategically and explicitly about the kind and number of risks they want to take. There is technology risk (very relevant with smart contracts and DeFi). There is market risk. And there is counter-party risk. You can learn critical lessons from all three, but it often makes sense to have controlled learning environments. One of my frustrations has been watching people jump to wildly incorrect conclusions when things go wrong, sometimes because they took too many risks at the same time and cannot separate out what the causes were. Lastly, it makes a lot of sense to be strategic about what you do internally and what gets done externally. In technology companies, especially when the engineers are in charge, the temptation is always to build. I know. I have an engineering team. It‚Äôs more fun than managing a vendor. ‚ÄúI built it‚Äù is a million times more satisfying than telling someone ‚ÄúI bought it.‚Äù I never thought I‚Äôd be quoting Mr. Beast in business, but as he said, ‚ÄúConsultants are a cheat code.‚Äù It‚Äôs that simple: someone else has done it before. Take advantage of that to reduce your risk and complexity. There is no path to growth without risk and that risk increases with the speed of growth. Therefore, for firms seeking accelerated growth, particularly in ecosystems powered by emerging technologies, good risk management policies are a must. Please buckle up for your own safety and keep your eyes on the road.

Coinbase shares started 2025 trading at just over $257 on Jan. 2 and ended the quarter at a little over $172 on March 31, a dip of 33%, according to market data. This makes the first quarter of 2025 the worst for Coinbase‚Äôs stock performance since the collapse of FTX in November 2022. In Q4 of that year, its share price went from nearly $66 on Oct. 3 to $35.4 on Dec. 30, a loss of 46.4%. Coinbase shares year-to-date price chart.

While Coinbase has not yet released its Q1 profit figures, MarketBeat analysis estimates them to be around $1.87 billion. A large-scale crypto downturn Most publicly traded crypto companies reported similar results in the first quarter of 2025. Major crypto mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings started Q1 at nearly $17.50 and closed it at $11.00, a loss of over 37%. Competing crypto mining firm Riot Platforms opened Q1 2025 at just under $10.50 and closed it at $7.12, a loss of over 32%.

Lastly, mining hardware producer Canaan Creative started the quarter at $2.11 and ended at $0.8778 for a loss of nearly 58.4%. Geopolitics plays a role The broader stock market, not just the crypto industry, has also taken a significant hit widely attributed to recent geopolitical shifts.

Per Bloomberg, the Nasdaq 100 Index posted its biggest quarterly drop in nearly three years on Monday, plunging 8.3%. The decline is troubling for tech investors, many of whom had placed their bets on AI-driven growth in data centers and computing infrastructure. Last week, a series of declines signaled the potential for a pullback in the massive flow of capital into this sector. These warnings set off a chain reaction, leading to a sharp decline in major tech stocks like Nvidia and Amazon, which had once been among the biggest drivers of market growth. Tech stocks count losses in 2025 Q1 Shares in Nvidia, the chipmaking giant, have tumbled 28% since reaching a peak in January. Other tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta have seen their stock prices fall by 20% or more. According to Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners, these stocks were initially ‚Äúpriced for perfection‚Äù and are now highly vulnerable because of the growing market uncertainty and tensions across the West and Europe. ‚Äú That makes them an extremely obvious place for investors who are broadly nervous to take profits ,‚Äù Mullaney explained. Another economist, Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, told Bloomberg that what would have been a ‚Äúfeeding frenzy‚Äù in 2024 is now seen as ‚Äútoo many dollars chasing too little computing center demand.‚Äù The IPO market is also not doing as well as most had expected, even with US President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed cloud-computing provider, debuted last week with much fanfare but saw its stock falter by 10% at one point on Monday, its second day in the stock market. Tariff woes on markets continue The Trump administration is well on course to unveil new tariffs on April 2, and no one is arguably angrier at that than Wall Street. Investors have the gist of which countries will be affected by the levies, but no one, except the White House, knows the specifics of what goods they will have to balance out to alleviate some of the economic pressure. ‚Äú The best way to summarize this trading environment is frustration and fatigue ,‚Äù said Joe Gilbert, portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. His sentiment was reflected in the S&P 500 Index swinging wildly, dropping as much as 1.7% early in the session of Monday, but clawing back some losses during the day, closing up 0.6%. In the Tuesday pre-market trading period, the benchmark equities index was up 0.5% from yesterday‚Äôs close. Still, the S&P 500 is down 4.37% year-to-date, its worst quarter start since 2022. The woes have forced analysts to adjust their forecasts for the broader market heading into the second quarter of 2025. Goldman Sachs lowered its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,700 from 6,200, citing their suppressed predictions to concerns about both the tariff issue and the global economic environment. This year‚Äôs market conditions are poles apart from the optimistic outlook many had at the start of the year. US stocks were riding high towards the end of 2024, buoyed by expectations of a continued pro-business environment under Trump. Carley Garner, senior strategist and founder of DeCarley Trading, said that the market has shifted from ‚Äúa mindset of focusing on greed and how much money can I make‚Äù to one centered on ‚Äúhow much money can I lose.‚Äù The change in investor sentiment has led to an uptick in demand for safer, recession-resistant stocks, with some traders opting to sell off more volatile positions in favor of the special metal gold, which has historically performed well during downturns.

While large-cap tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum are consolidating, some smaller-cap DeFi tokens are quietly building momentum‚Äîand delivering the kind of growth that larger players can‚Äôt easily replicate. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a candidate that many are watching closely. At a presale price of just $0.025, the opportunity for upside is clear. But how far could it really go? And what might a $1,500 investment turn into by the end of the year? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the current presale price of $0.025, a $1,500 investment would give you 60,000 MUTM tokens. Analysts covering the project have floated year-end price targets as high as $5, citing strong demand, protocol mechanics, and utility-driven growth. If that scenario plays out, those same 60,000 tokens would be worth $300,000‚Äîrepresenting a 20,000% gain. Even if MUTM reached just $1 by December, your $1,500 would grow to $60,000, which is a return that few other assets in the market could match in that timeframe. Mutuum Finance isn‚Äôt just another presale token banking on hype. The project is actively building a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol. It allows users to supply crypto assets to earn passive income or borrow funds without giving up ownership of their holdings. This is all executed through permissionless smart contracts‚Äîremoving intermediaries and putting users in full control of their assets. A key part of the protocol is its dual lending model. One side offers peer-to-contract lending, where users supply assets to shared liquidity pools. Interest rates here fluctuate based on real-time supply and demand. On the other side is a peer-to-peer model, allowing users to negotiate loan terms directly with each other. This model gives the protocol more flexibility‚Äîmaking it attractive to both conservative lenders and active traders. It also supports a broader range of assets, including tokens like PEPE or SHIB, which wouldn‚Äôt typically be allowed in standard liquidity pools. For those supplying assets, Mutuum issues mtTokens‚Äîdeposit receipts that grow in value as interest accrues. These tokens represent the user‚Äôs position in the protocol and can be redeemed for the original asset plus earned yield. This mechanism makes it easy to track returns and even use mtTokens in other DeFi ecosystems. But beyond these core features, Mutuum‚Äôs tokenomics are what‚Äôs really drawing in experienced investors. A portion of the protocol‚Äôs revenue is set aside to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken holders. This creates consistent buy pressure and rewards long-term engagement‚Äîmaking the token not just useful, but valuable to hold. The presale itself has already passed some impressive milestones. With over $5.8 million raised and more than 7,500 holders, investor confidence is clearly growing. The token is currently in its fourth presale phase at $0.025, and the next pricing tier will push it to $0.03. As previous phases sold out quickly, time is limited for those who want to secure MUTM at its lowest available price. Adding to the momentum, the team is preparing to launch a beta version of the platform around the same time as the token hits public markets. This means investors will not only hold a token with upside potential, but also gain access to a functioning protocol with real utility‚Äîsomething many presale projects delay for months or even years. If Mutuum Finance achieves even a fraction of what its roadmap suggests, the return potential is significant. With working mechanics, an engaged community, and a structure built for sustainable growth, MUTM is positioning itself as a token to watch‚Äînot just for short-term flips, but for long-term portfolio value. For investors who act early, this could be the kind of opportunity that changes their year‚Äîand possibly much more.

The grants aim to support open-source Bitcoin development, mining decentralization, privacy tools, and educational initiatives for individuals living under authoritarian regimes, with a focus on Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The latest cohort includes diverse projects advancing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a financial and human rights empowerment tool. NetBlocks , a digital rights watchdog organization, monitors and reports on internet shutdowns in real-time. Authoritarian regimes often use these shutdowns to suppress protests, throttle dissent, and restrict access to financial tools. HRF‚Äôs support will enhance NetBlocks‚Äô monitoring, documentation, and research capabilities to reinforce internet and financial fredom. TollGate , a project developed by ISP c03rad0r, transforms ordinary WiFi routers into decentralized internet service providers using Bitcoin and ecash.

Rather than relying on centralized entities, miners are rewarded with ecash tokens, enabling instant, private payouts. HRF‚Äôs support will further Hashpool‚Äôs development and promote a more distributed and censorship-resistant mining landscape. Cashu KVAC is a protocol upgrade for Cashu, a Chaumian ecash system that enables extremely strong financial privacy. Developed by lollerfirst , this improvement enhances privacy by reducing data storage and hiding transaction amounts. HRF‚Äôs grant will support further development, reinforcing financial privacy protections for vulnerable users. Self-Custody Research: Brandon Black (Rearden) is conducting research into the challenges of self-custody for Bitcoin users in authoritarian regimes. His findings will inform new tools and education that make secure, private Bitcoin usage more accessible. HRF‚Äôs grant will fund this research and the development of educational resources.

Mothers receive weekly Bitcoin stipends and training to achieve long-term financial security. HRF funding will scale the program‚Äôs reach to more families in need. East Asia Bitcoin Developer Apprenticeship Program : Led by Calvin Kim , this program trains Korean and Japanese developers in open-source Bitcoin development. Apprentices gain hands-on experience and contribute to major projects. HRF‚Äôs support will expand access and mentorship opportunities, helping bridge the regional talent gap and supporting defectors from authoritarian governments. Bitcoin Week at TalentLand 2025 : At TalentLand, Latin America‚Äôs largest tech conference, Bitcoin Week will introduce thousands of attendees to Bitcoin through workshops and hackathons. Organized by Super Testnet and the Bitcoin and Lightning Guadalajara community, the initiative highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs role in financial empowerment. HRF‚Äôs grant will help expand the program. Base58‚Äôs Bitcoin Live Action Role Play (LARP), created by Lisa Neigut and David Rodriguez, offers an immersive learning experience where participants simulate the Bitcoin network. By acting out transactions and node operations, learners gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin. HRF‚Äôs support will fund facilitator training and global expansion, particularly in underserved regions. BTCenEspa√±ol is a leading source of Spanish-language Bitcoin education. With a goal of reaching over one million learners and training 100 instructors, the platform is expanding across South America. HRF‚Äôs grant will support teacher training, course development, and outreach in authoritarian-affected regions. Increasing Nonprofit Adoption of Bitcoin: Researcher Daniel Batten is studying how nonprofits can use Bitcoin to overcome financial censorship. His project provides data-driven insights and practical guidance for NGOs operating in hostile environments. With HRF‚Äôs funding, the initiative will support NGOs adopting Bitcoin in regions where traditional banking is compromised. Bitcoin for Good, led by activist Hadiya Masieh , offers hands-on training to nonprofits on how to accept Bitcoin. The goal is to enable NGOs to bypass financial restrictions and maintain independence. HRF‚Äôs grant will fund workshops, technical assistance, and organizational integration support.

Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory is the focus for institutional investors, many of whom are predicting it will hit new all-time highs in 2025. However, a rapidly rising contender, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , is making waves in the altcoin space. As BTC gets big money, more and more investors are looking at Yeti Ouro as the next big money maker. Investors Are Betting High On Bitcoin Price Surge Bitcoin has once again become the clear king of the crypto world. With prices having reached over $100,000, institutional interest is at an all-time high. With multiple Bitcoin ETFs approved, big money has a regulated way to get in and demand is going up. At the time of writing Bitcoin price is currently around $81,757 and is showing signs of a decline, however, experts are still very bullish on the future performance of this asset. Analysts are eyeing Bitcoin price to run to $180,000 to $200,000 as hedge funds and corporations continue to accumulate. The recent political climate has also played a big role in Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption. Additionally, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) under Michael Saylor has become a Bitcoin investment giant. It holds almost 500,000 BTC (2.38% of total supply) and isn‚Äôt done yet. Their latest move? A $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering of STRK, a convertible perpetual preferred stock to add more Bitcoin to the coffers. Meanwhile Bhutan has been quietly accumulating Bitcoin by leveraging their cheap hydroelectric power to mine. Though small compared to their overall economy, Bhutan‚Äôs Bitcoin is a strategic move to diversify national assets and tap into the digital economy. With a pro-crypto administration in office, pro-blockchain and pro-digital asset policies are boosting investor confidence. Big financial institutions are adding to their Bitcoin positions, treating it as digital gold in an uncertain macro environment. While Bitcoin is looking good, its size means it‚Äôs less likely to deliver the kind of rapid, life changing gains that smaller, high growth altcoins can. That‚Äôs why investors who got in early on Bitcoin are now looking for the next big thing and Yeti Ouro is emerging as the front runner. A Closer Look At Yeti Ouro While Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition is as a store of wealth, Yeti Ouro is building an entire ecosystem to fuel active user engagement and sustained token demand. The presale has already hit $3.1 million, with investors rushing to get YETIO tokens before they hit the exchanges. With a well structured tokenomics model, deflationary supply mechanism and real world utility through its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming platform it‚Äôs one of the most exciting altcoins of 2025. The Yeti Ouro ecosystem is built around Yeti Go, a high intensity P2E racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Unlike most speculative altcoins that rely on hype, Yeti Ouro has a working product that integrates blockchain gaming with real earning potential. Players can race, win YETIO tokens as rewards and engage in a fully functional in-game economy where tokens are used for upgrades, purchases and trading. This continuous cycle of demand ensures long term sustainability, something many meme coins and purely speculative assets lack. The game development team has joined forces with a leading game asset studio, known for its work on blockbuster titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space. To elevate the experience, the game‚Äôs audio is being produced by seasoned sound engineers who‚Äôve worked with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Below, you‚Äôll find the official debut of the game‚Äôs central character, paired with an exclusive glimpse at its stunning visuals. Yeti Ouro‚Äôs tokenomics are designed for long term growth. With a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and a 5% burn mechanism the total supply will decrease over time, increasing scarcity and potentially driving prices higher as adoption grows. Security conscious investors will be pleased to know that Yeti Ouro has passed a comprehensive audit by SOLIDProof , the smart contract is safe and free from vulnerabilities. This level of transparency and security is rare in the crypto space. Financial projections for Yeti Ouro are looking good, with analysts predicting YETIO could reach $5 by the end of 2025. Given the current presale price of $0.024 per token, this is a huge upside for early backers who are already seeing a 100% ROI since buying at $0012 in Stage 1. To put it into perspective, someone investing $1,000 in YETIO now could see their holdings grow to $208,333 if these forecasts materialize. That‚Äôs almost impossible with Bitcoin at this stage, making Yeti Ouro one of the most exciting altcoin opportunities out there. Investing in YETIO is straightforward. Investors need a Defi wallet on the correct network, i.e. Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase etc, place an order on the official Yeti Ouro website with the desired amount of YETIO tokens and complete the transaction with a single click. Conclusion Bitcoin is the king of crypto and is climbing towards new all time highs and institutional money is flowing in. But for those looking for bigger gains, Yeti Ouro is quickly becoming the investment of choice. With a hot presale, an active gaming ecosystem and tokenomics designed for long term value it‚Äôs no wonder investors are getting in before the price takes off. As the crypto market heads into its next big bull run those who spot the high growth opportunities first will benefit the most. Yeti Ouro is a rare chance to invest in a project with strong fundamentals before mainstream adoption kicks in.

That narrative has been attractive to big money holders, but Ethereum has not experienced the same kind of interest. Technical Issues Mar Ethereum Upgrade Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade has encountered a number of setbacks. Reports said several test runs failed before the recent rollout of the Hoodi testnet. These technical issues have contributed to market jitters. The transition to proof-of-stake, a significant shift in the way Ethereum operates, hasn‚Äôt provided the market uplift many had hoped for. High gas prices remain an issue for users, and other blockchain networks become more appealing. ETF Success For Bitcoin Hasn‚Äôt Helped Ethereum Bitcoin ETFs have attracted billions of dollars since being approved earlier this year. According to market observation, Ethereum has not been spared this trend, with institutions remaining hesitant on its long-term worth. Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply makes it a more secure option for large investors seeking protection against inflation, market analysts pointed out in recent comments. This has enabled Bitcoin to remain at the top despite adverse overall market conditions.

Based on CoinMarketCap data as of publication time, Ethereum was at $1,84, having climbed 1.35% within the last 24 hours. This minor daily increase hasn‚Äôt altered the larger context of Ethereum‚Äôs woes. The coming weeks will be decisive, explained analysts tracking the cryptocurrency market.

By 2025, more than 560 million people worldwide own cryptocurrencies, therefore presenting a significant consumer base for crypto payment systems. The recently introduced Visaenabled card for crypto transactions, WhiteBIT Nova , has already processed more than 1 million transactions at WhiteBIT, Europe‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of traffic, hence validating the increasing importance of digital assets in daily spending. Crypto Cards vs. Traditional Payment Methods While global debit and credit card transactions continue to dominate financial markets, crypto cards are emerging as strong competitors. They offer unique benefits such as enhanced privacy, borderless transactions, and cryptocurrency-based rewards. The global crypto credit card market, valued at USD 1.3 billion in 2024, is projected to skyrocket to USD 220.46 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. The convenience of crypto cards lies in the ability to instantly convert crypto to fiat at the point of sale, making digital assets more practical for everyday purchases. How Consumers Are Using Their WhiteBIT Nova Crypto Card WhiteBIT‚Äôs latest data shows that its crypto card users are engaging in spending patterns similar to conventional cardholders, with purchases spanning everyday essentials, entertainment, and luxury goods. WhiteBIT‚Äôs latest data shows that its crypto card users are engaging in spending patterns similar to conventional cardholders, with purchases spanning everyday essentials, entertainment, and luxury goods. Most popular cryptocurrencies for spending: USDC, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) lead transactions. Top brands for crypto payments: WhiteBIT Nova owners are using their crypto to shop at brands such as Spotify, YouTube, Booking, KFC, Ryanair, Farfetch, and PlayStation.

Top spending categories: Subscriptions, groceries, meals and coffee, and everyday expenditures account for the majority of cryptocurrency payments. Cashback Incentives: A Major Factor in the Adoption of Crypto Cards Customers regularly choose cash back as their favorite credit card benefit. Crypto cashback is becoming a key incentive for WhiteBIT Nova card users as well. The top categories for cashback benefits include: Food & Caf√©s (20.4%), groceries (22.8%), and subscriptions (14.1%) are necessities. Recreation & Entertainment: Gaming (7.3%), entertainment (8.2%), and taxi services (10.7%). Travel & Lifestyle: Airlines (4.2%), Auto expenditures (4.9%) Purchases pertaining to pets (3.9%) and medications (3.5%) are examples of wellness and daily necessities.

Pi Network ( PI ) dropped to a low of $0.7012, its lowest level since Feb. 25, and is now down 76% from its all-time high. This decline has led to a $14 billion wipeout, with its market cap crashing from nearly $20 billion to $4.76 billion. The Pi coin sell-off continued as traders focused on the upcoming token unlock, which is expected to lead to further dilution. According to PiScan , over 124 million Pi coins will be unlocked this month. Pi Network unlock schedule | Source: PiScan These unlocks will increase over the next three months, peaking at 233 million in July. Altogether, the network expects to unlock more than 1.53 billion tokens over the next 12 months, bringing total circulating supply to 8.2 billion. Pi Network has become one of the most inflationary cryptocurrencies, a trend likely to continue. That‚Äôs because the maximum supply is capped at 100 billion Pi coins, while current circulation stands at 6.7 billion. Token unlocks contribute to inflation by increasing the number of tokens in circulation. Some cryptocurrencies offset these unlocks with a burning mechanism, where tokens are sent to a dead address to reduce supply. It‚Äôs unclear whether Pi has plans to implement such a burning mechanism. One option could be to incinerate all tokens not moved to the mainnet by the June deadline. Another possibility is to burn ecosystem fees. Perhaps Nicolas Kokkalis, Pi‚Äôs co-founder, will address these concerns during the project‚Äôs first X Space. He is expected to share the roadmap and outline upcoming features. Pi Network price has also struggled due to a lack of exchange listings. No major tier-1 exchange has listed the token since its mainnet launch in February. Pi Network price technical analysis PI price chart | Source: crypto.news The four-hour chart shows that Pi coin has been in a persistent downtrend over the past few months and is slowly approaching its all-time low. It remains below the 50-period moving average, a sign that bears are in control for now. On the positive side, Pi Network has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. With the two trend lines nearing convergence, it could rebound in April and potentially retest the psychological level at $1. All Pi needs is a single catalyst, such as a major exchange listing.

Only one stock, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), outperformed bitcoin ( BTC ) last month, the report noted. Miners with high performance computing (HPC) exposure underperformed pure-play miners for the second month in a row. ""We note valuations today are at the lowest levels relative to the block reward since the collapse of FTX in the Fall of 2023,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The average network hashrate inched higher during the month to 816 exahashes per second (EH/s), the report said. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. Mining revenue and profitability both fell. ""We estimate bitcoin miners earned an average of $47,300 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in March, down 13% from February,"" the bank said. Daily block reward gross profit dropped 22% month-on-month to $23,000 per EH/s. Stronghold Digital outperformed the sector last month with a 2% decline. Cipher Mining (CIFR) underperformed with a 45% slump.

The analytics firm suggested that Bitcoin is nearing the zone of asymmetric demand as BTC exchange inflows approach 2-year low. Macro researcher at CryptoQuant Axel Adler argued that the digital asset market had successfully absorbed waves of profit-taking following its break above $100K. Adler also suggested that sellers had dried up, and buyers seemed comfortable with current price levels. He believes that BTC‚Äôs current level has set the stage for a structural supply shortage. On-chain data showed that Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands at $84,357 at the time of publication, a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. BTC also recorded a daily volume of $27.3B, a 37.55 increase in the past 24 hours. Adler also argued that April to May could turn into a consolidation zone, ‚Äúa calm before the next impulse.‚Äù Total Bitcoin inflow in all exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant. CryptoQuant analyst Ibrahimcosar posted on March 28 that Bitcoin may be on the verge of a significant price rally. He noted that since February 6, the digital asset has experienced a persistent negative net flow across trading platforms. The analyst argued that when a large quantity of BTC is withdrawn from exchanges, it often indicates that investors are expecting a price rally. He believes that investors move their holdings to cold wallets in anticipation of long-term gains and pay network fees to secure their assets. Ibrahimcosar acknowledged that the behavior results in a negative net flow of BTC across exchanges, which is a bullish indicator. ‚ÄúHistorically, such high outflows have led to significant price increases in Bitcoin. This suggests that market volatility to the upside could be on the horizon.‚Äù ‚Äì Ibrahimcosar , analyst at CryptoQuant. Crypto investment products record positive inflows On-chain data from CoinShares also noted that Bitcoin drew roughly $195 million in inflows last week. The firm also acknowledged that BTC saw $2.5 million in outflows for the fourth consecutive week, which suggested that bearish bets were fading. The analytics firm also showed that altcoins posted a notable turnaround, with $33 million in inflows after four consecutive weeks of outflows totaling $1.7 billion. Ethereum led with $14.5 million inflows, followed by Solana with $7.8 million, and XRP and Sui with $4.8 million and $4M inflows, respectively. CoinShares maintained that it marked the first week of positive flows for digital assets in over a month, which highlighted renewed confidence in the sector. The firm also revealed that global crypto investment products recorded $226 million worth of net inflows last week. CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill argued in a Monday report that the second consecutive week of inflows suggested a ‚Äúpositive but cautious‚Äù investor. He also noted that ETPs had seen 9 consecutive trading days of inflows, last Friday being the exception after recording outflows totaling $74 million. Butterfill believes it was likely in reaction to core personal consumption expenditure in the U.S. coming in above expectations. He added that the economic data implied the Federal Reserve was likely to remain hawkish despite recent data alluding to weak growth. Research analyst Ryan Lee mentioned that President Trump‚Äôs proposed tariff hikes including a 25% levy on Mexican and Canadian goods effective April 2 ‚Äì had resumed trade war anxieties. Lee argued that such protectionist measures trigger risk aversion across asset classes, ‚Äúand crypto has not been immune.‚Äù Butterfill also revealed that Bitcoin ended up falling around 6% over the past week and the recent price falls had pushed global BTC investment products‚Äô total assets under management to their lowest level since the U.S. presidential election in November at $114 billion. CoinShares data also showed that U.S. investors led regionally, accounting for $204 million of last week‚Äôs net inflows.

Whereas, the price charts continue to showcase support for the buyers. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.466 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE‚Äôs price increased to $0.1710 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1919 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.300041 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It‚Äôs expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin‚Äôs current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2030. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3002.18 DOGE in April; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it‚Äôs trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.30 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Resistance limits upward momentum, and even a potential rally might not help Pepe hit the elusive $1 mark. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces selling pressure, erasing recent gains as the broader crypto market pulls back. Amidst this market turbulence, Panshibi ($SHIBI), a new crypto presale, is gaining momentum as Pepe and Shiba Inu investors flock to the next big meme coin. Set to be the biggest Asia-inspired memecoin of 2025, Panshibi will launch on Uniswap and multiple CEXs. Early adopters joining in Q2 stand to benefit from explosive gains as excitement builds. Pepe Coin Faces Market Reality as Whale Sell-Offs Intensify Pepe Coin (PEPE) struggles to regain its former highs, trading at $0.0000073‚Äîdown from its peak. Despite an ascending triangle pattern hinting at accumulation, resistance at $0.00000750 caps upward momentum for Pepe. Recent whale activity has further dampened sentiment, with a key investor offloading 150 billion Pepe tokens worth $1.14 million. This whale initially purchased 1.5 trillion Pepe for just $2,000, seeing its value peak at $43 million before selling 1.02 trillion tokens for $6.66 million in profit. Such large-scale exits indicate declining confidence in Pepe, triggering further selling pressure. Pepe‚Äôs downward trajectory has persisted despite occasional buy-ins from other whales attempting to stabilize the price. Beyond whale movements, leveraged traders are also facing heavy losses amid Pepe‚Äôs price volatility. With whale sell-offs and margin pressures compounding bearish sentiment, PEPE faces an uphill battle reversing its current downtrend. Shiba Inu Faces Selling Pressure Amid Market Downturn but Hints at Possible Rebound Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles under selling pressure as the broader crypto market experiences a pullback. Investor concerns have grown due to macroeconomic factors and profit-taking, causing Shiba Inu to drop below key resistance levels. Despite the downturn, a rise in its burn rate and total value locked (TVL) in Shibarium indicates potential for recovery. However, competition in the meme coin space remains fierce, requiring Shiba Inu to attract fresh interest for a sustainable comeback. Investors are closely watching market conditions to determine whether Shiba Inu can stabilize and stage a potential recovery. Panshibi (SHIBI) Gains Momentum as Investors From Pepe and Shiba Inu Fuel the Next Big Meme Coin Surge Panshibi ($SHIBI) is rapidly gaining traction as a crypto project that unites three massive communities: Asia, pandas, and meme coin enthusiasts. Inspired by the beloved panda, Panshibi integrates social-Fi and AI-driven quests, allowing token holders to compete for rewards. Panshibi is positioned to become the next dominant meme coin with its unique approach and strong community backing. Experts predict it could be the biggest Asia-inspired crypto asset, attracting retail and institutional interest. At the heart of the ecosystem is $SHIBI, the native token offering multiple use cases, including high-yield staking with APYs of up to 1,200% per annum. Presale holders gain exclusive access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, enhancing community engagement. Panshibi‚Äôs listing strategy includes major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap, with token price projections suggesting a potential 145,000% surge post-launch. Early investors are already positioning themselves to capitalize on the expected price explosion. Security and transparency remain a top priority, as Panshibi has undergone a full smart contract audit by blockchain security firm Coinsult, passing with no issues. To ensure stability, the liquidity pool will be locked for 10 years, while team tokens will remain locked for two years. With Pepe and Shiba Inu investors joining the wave, Panshibi is shaping to be one of the most anticipated meme coin launches, fueling excitement and massive buys ahead of its debut. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Ultimate Q2 Bet as Meme Coin Investors Seek the Next Big Win With Pepe Coin (PEPE) struggling and Shiba Inu (SHIB) facing selling pressure, investors are turning to Panshibi ($SHIBI) as the next major crypto presale. Experts predict it could dominate 2025, fueled by its unique blend of Social-Fi, AI-driven rewards, and strong community backing. $SHIBI is poised for an explosive breakout, with listings planned for Uniswap and top CEXs. Early adopters in Q2 stand to benefit from Panshibi‚Äôs aggressive growth trajectory and high-yield staking rewards.

You‚Äôre not alone. A lot of crypto fans stood on the sidelines as Floki Inu rode the viral wave of Elon Musk‚Äôs pup and the SHIB community, turning early buyers into overnight legends. But guess what? The next breakout might already be brewing‚Äîand it‚Äôs called BTFD Coin. There‚Äôs a new crew entering the arena of meme coins, and they‚Äôre not here to play small. BTFD Coin is gearing up to become one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend , not just with hype‚Äîbut with a rock-solid meme coin presale, immersive utility, and actual ways to earn through gaming and staking. If you‚Äôre still wondering whether you missed your window, maybe it‚Äôs time to realize that window just reopened. BTFD Coin Bulls Squad Powers Its Meme Coin Presale Momentum Here‚Äôs a question: what if your missed chance at Floki could be your setup for BTFD Coin ? The presale performance of BTFD is making serious noise. At Stage 15, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.0002‚Äîand more than $6.45 million has already been raised. Over 72 billion tokens are sold and 11,700+ bulls have joined the stampede. The community isn‚Äôt just growing‚Äîit‚Äôs charging full speed toward what many are calling the next meme coin moonshot. BTFD isn‚Äôt just living off hype. It has utility and engagement that early-stage projects dream of. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game officially launched on January 1, 2025, and it‚Äôs bringing crypto gaming into the meme coin space like never before. Players can earn, climb ranks, and build on-chain influence just by playing the game. It‚Äôs one of the reasons why BTFD Coin is constantly popping up in lists of the top new meme coins to join this weekend. Then there‚Äôs staking. If passive income is more your vibe, BTFD‚Äôs 90% APY staking reward system is probably one of the best offers in the space. Stake your tokens during the presale, let them work for you, and unlock value over time. When combined with the P2E experience and the growing Bulls Squad‚Äîan exclusive community of BTFD backers‚Äîthis project isn‚Äôt just about flipping tokens. It‚Äôs about building long-term engagement with real upside. Let‚Äôs talk ROI. A $4,000 investment at today‚Äôs price of $0.0002 gets you 20 million BTFD tokens. When the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, that bag becomes $12,000‚Äîtripling your money before it even hits exchanges. And if BTFD reaches its predicted moon price of $0.006, you‚Äôre looking at $120,000. That‚Äôs a 2900% ROI from presale to moon. Imagine turning that into a year‚Äôs rent, a dream vacation, or even the seed for your own crypto project. Buying BTFD is a no-brainer for those chasing the top new meme coins to join this weekend. Start by setting up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, then connect it on the BTFD meme coin presale page . Pick your amount, hit buy, and confirm. Stake your tokens right after and watch the Bulls Squad grow. This meme coin presale has already become a rallying cry, and it‚Äôs clear‚Äîthe bulls are taking over. Floki Inu‚Äôs Viral Ascent Was Just the Beginning Floki Inu didn‚Äôt just ride the meme wave‚Äîit helped shape it. Inspired by Elon Musk‚Äôs pup and rooted in the SHIB community, FLOKI quickly became the people‚Äôs token. It built an ecosystem around education, NFTs, and global campaigns‚Äîone that captured millions of eyeballs and made believers out of skeptics. FLOKI didn‚Äôt wait around to be taken seriously. It launched, it surged, and it proved meme coins could do more. Since its rise, Floki Inu has managed to hold its ground, consistently showing that viral roots can be the beginning of something bigger. The token found ways to branch into real-world use cases like school building campaigns, metaverse partnerships, and social media domination. It‚Äôs no surprise it earned its place among the top new meme coins to join this weekend, but for most people, the best entry price is long gone. That‚Äôs the point. The golden entry for FLOKI is already in the rearview. Its breakout showed the crypto world how powerful a community-driven memecoin could be. But the space doesn‚Äôt wait. And if FLOKI taught traders anything, it‚Äôs this: catch the wave early‚Äîor be left watching from the shoreline. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Is the Second Chance Everyone‚Äôs Talking About Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is more than just hype‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement in motion. The bulls are forming.

A malicious actor gained access to a smart contract, causing the startup to lose $70M in UPC tokens. UPCX, a Web3 payment service, lost $70M in UPC tokens after unauthorized access to one of the project‚Äôs smart contracts. The platform registered unusual activity around one of its main smart contracts. The system detected multiple suspicious transactions originating from some of the project‚Äôs wallets. After gaining access to one of the project‚Äôs addresses, the hacker upgraded the ProxyAdmin contract and used the privileges to withdraw 18.4M UPC, valued at $70M. According to Cyvers, the attacker used the ‚ÄòwithdrawByAdmin‚Äô function‚Äô to order a single large-scale transaction of about 2.36% of the total token supply. The affected wallets belonged to the management of the UPCX project. User funds are safe, but the protocol stopped deposits and withdrawals. üö®Security Notice: Unauthorized Activity Detectedüö® UPCX has identified unauthorized activity involving our management account. As a precautionary measure, we are taking immediate action to ensure platform security. üîπ UPCX deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. üîπ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî UPCX¬Æ Official (@Upcxofficial) April 1, 2025 The UPCX team is still investigating the exact nature of the hack and the movement of funds. After the exploit, the UPC tokens were parked in one address. UPC is still only traded on Gate.IO and Mexc, with limited liquidity pools. The project has been developing since late 2023 but only saw a boost in activity in the first quarter of 2025. However, it remains relatively unknown compared to other Web3 payment services. Following the news of the exploit, the native UPC token fell by 5.1% to $3.52. The token recently traded near an all-time high, as the project aimed to attract attention to its products and newly launched main net. The product started trading on more niche markets in just the past week. UPCX targets the Southeast Asian market and aims to gain listings in Japan. The major part of the losses from the hack are due to the recent UPC token rally. Based on its current valuation, this made the asset more attractive to hackers. UPC only started rallying in March, peaking at $5.31. The loss of token value additionally broke down the project. Despite having a native wallet and chain, UPCX still mostly relies on the Ethereum ecosystem. The token is spread to over 40K wallets, with the UPCX blockchain still aiming to gain more users. The flawed smart contracts and project wallets are also based on Ethereum. The recent hack led to an outflow of users, with hundreds of wallets emptying out their UPCX balance. UPCX may see major selling pressure The recent hack has affected the UPC token, which has an extremely low float. Only around 4.14M tokens were in circulation at the time of the hack. More than 50% of tokens are held in one cluster, with other large-scale wallets belonging to the team. Most of the UPC tokens are not yet in circulation, held through a long-term vesting schedule. | Source: Bubblemaps The total supply of tokens is 780M, to be released over the next few years. This makes the recent hack especially influential if the attacker tries to swap out the funds. Most of the team, early backers, and ecosystem tokens are still vested, with slow unlocks coming in 2025. Following the exploit, the hacker‚Äôs wallet is the seventh largest among all owners. All the stolen UPC were still held in the wallet for hours after the initial transaction, as the token offered limited opportunities for swapping or trading. The hacker sent a small test transaction before the main transfer of 18.4M UPC tokens. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The hacker‚Äôs wallet is newly created, and the UPC transaction is the only inflow of funds, with the exception of a test transaction for 10 UPC minutes before the main exploit. The wallet did not even add ETH for gas fees. It directly interacted with the token contract and simply assigned the transfer of UPC, with no intermediary steps and a minimal gas fee.

42756777,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145076,1743520850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Drop: Canadian Dollar Plunges to 2-Week Low Amid US Tariff Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/canadian-dollar-us-tariffs-drop/,"Are you keeping a close eye on the crypto markets? You should also be watching the Forex market closely, especially when traditional currencies like the Canadian dollar experience significant shifts. Just recently, the Canadian dollar has taken a notable dip, hitting its lowest point in two and a half weeks. What‚Äôs the culprit? The shadow of impending US tariffs is looming large, casting a pall over the Canadian economy and sending ripples through the global Forex market . Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for you and the broader financial landscape. Why is the Canadian Dollar Under Pressure? The primary driver behind the Canadian dollar‚Äôs recent weakness is the increased anxiety surrounding potential tariffs from the United States. As one of Canada‚Äôs largest trading partners, any trade disputes or tariff implementations by the U.S. can significantly impact the Canadian economy. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key factors contributing to this pressure: Trade Tensions: Ongoing trade negotiations and the ever-present threat of new tariffs create uncertainty. Markets dislike uncertainty, and this often translates to a weaker currency. Economic Interdependence: The Canadian economy is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S. Therefore, policies impacting this trade relationship directly affect the Canadian dollar‚Äôs valuation. Investor Sentiment: When tariffs are anticipated, investors may become wary of the Canadian economy‚Äôs prospects, leading to reduced investment and a weaker currency. Commodity Prices: While less direct in this instance, fluctuations in commodity prices (like oil, a major Canadian export) can also indirectly influence the Canadian dollar. Decoding the Impact of US Tariffs on Currency Devaluation Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can trigger a chain reaction leading to currency devaluation . Here‚Äôs how it unfolds in the context of the Canadian dollar and US tariffs : Reduced Exports: If the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canadian goods, these goods become more expensive for American consumers. This can lead to a decrease in demand for Canadian exports. Lower Trade Surplus (or Increased Deficit): Reduced exports can shrink Canada‚Äôs trade surplus or even push it into a deficit. A weaker trade balance generally puts downward pressure on a country‚Äôs currency. Economic Slowdown Fears: Businesses might scale back investments and hiring in anticipation of reduced trade and economic activity, further weakening the Canadian dollar. Capital Outflows: Investors may move their capital out of Canada, seeking safer or more profitable markets, which decreases demand for the Canadian dollar and lowers its value. Essentially, the anticipation of tariffs acts as a signal of potential economic headwinds for Canada, causing the currency to depreciate. Navigating the Forex Market During Economic Uncertainty For those involved in the Forex market , periods of economic uncertainty like this can present both challenges and opportunities. Here‚Äôs how traders might navigate these turbulent waters: Strategy Description Potential Benefits Potential Risks Hedging: Using Forex instruments to protect against potential losses due to currency fluctuations. Reduces risk exposure, stabilizes portfolio value. Can limit potential profits if the anticipated negative event doesn‚Äôt fully materialize. Speculation: Taking positions based on anticipated currency movements. For instance, betting against the Canadian dollar if further tariff announcements are expected. High potential for profit if predictions are accurate. High risk of losses if market moves unexpectedly. Diversification: Spreading investments across multiple currencies to reduce reliance on a single currency‚Äôs performance. Reduces overall portfolio volatility, mitigates currency-specific risks. May dilute potential gains from exceptionally well-performing currencies. Monitoring Economic Indicators: Closely tracking economic data releases, trade policy announcements, and central bank statements to anticipate market movements. Informed trading decisions, potentially higher accuracy in predictions. Requires significant time and analytical skills, data interpretation can be complex. What are the Broader Economic Impact of a Weaker Canadian Dollar? A weaker Canadian dollar has wide-ranging implications for the Canadian economy and beyond: Inflation: Imported goods become more expensive, potentially leading to higher inflation rates in Canada. Exports (Potentially Boosted): Canadian goods become cheaper for foreign buyers, which could theoretically boost exports. However, this benefit might be offset by tariffs. Tourism: Canada becomes a more attractive tourist destination for those holding stronger currencies. Corporate Earnings (Mixed Bag): Canadian companies with significant U.S. revenues may see increased earnings when converted back to Canadian dollars. However, companies reliant on imports may face higher costs. Consumer Spending: Increased import costs and potential inflation can reduce consumer purchasing power. Could This Currency Devaluation Be an Opportunity? While currency devaluation often sounds negative, it can present certain opportunities. For example: Boost for Canadian Exporters (in theory): A weaker Canadian dollar makes Canadian exports more competitive internationally, assuming tariffs don‚Äôt negate this advantage. Attractiveness for Foreign Investment: Canadian assets become relatively cheaper for foreign investors. Potential for Tourism Growth: A weaker dollar can make Canada a more affordable travel destination, boosting the tourism sector. Possible Inflation Hedge: In some scenarios, a weaker currency can act as a hedge against deflationary pressures. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that these potential benefits are often contingent on other economic factors and policy responses. The impact of US tariffs adds a layer of complexity that can diminish or even reverse some of these potential upsides. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? Staying informed is key in navigating these market fluctuations. Here are some actionable insights to keep in mind: Monitor Trade Negotiations: Pay close attention to news and announcements related to trade discussions between Canada and the U.S. Any indication of easing or escalating tensions can significantly impact the Canadian dollar. Track Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators from both Canada and the U.S., such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and employment figures. These data points can provide clues about the economic outlook and currency direction. Follow Central Bank Announcements: Statements and policy decisions from the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve can influence currency valuations. Assess Global Risk Sentiment: Broader global economic trends and risk appetite can also play a role. Periods of heightened global uncertainty often lead to shifts in currency valuations. In Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Forex The recent dip in the Canadian dollar , driven by the looming threat of US tariffs , serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the sensitivity of the Forex market to geopolitical and trade policy developments. While currency fluctuations can present challenges, they also offer opportunities for informed traders and businesses that are prepared to adapt. By staying informed, understanding the underlying drivers, and employing sound risk management strategies, it‚Äôs possible to navigate these shifting sands and potentially capitalize on market movements. The situation remains dynamic, and continuous monitoring is crucial for anyone with exposure to the Canadian dollar or the broader Forex landscape.

Data from the crypto futures trading and information platform CoinGlass shows that last quarter was the worst Q1 BTC and ETH have posted since 2018. On a monthly basis, March witnessed the highest losses BTC and ETH have seen since 2020. Bitcoin‚Äôs Worst Q1 Since 2018 Bitcoin began 2025 strongly, surging to its all-time high (ATH) of $109,590 due to optimism about United States President Donald Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly administration. Since peaking, the cryptocurrency has steadily declined, erasing almost every gain made between December and January. This correction was fueled by several factors, including macroeconomic uncertainty and the failure of Trump‚Äôs administration to make any substantial policy shifts to sustain the market‚Äôs bullish momentum. BTC fell as low as $76,700 within the last 30 days, and the past week has seen the asset trade in a tight range capped at the $89,000 resistance level. Q1 2025 closed with an 11.82% decline for BTC, a significant deviation from the asset‚Äôs average 51.28% gain observed across past years dating back to 2013. The last time BTC saw such negative quarterly returns was in 2020, when it fell 10.83%; however, a much worse plunge of 49.7% was recorded in 2018. For the month of March, BTC recorded negative returns for the first time in four years ‚Äì the asset lost 2.3% of its value. Bitcoin has not seen a negative March since 2020. So far this year, only January has posted positive returns; February ended with a 17.39% decline. Analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex mentioned that last quarter‚Äôs correction is historically significant because it featured a 29% peak-to-trough plunge from the ATH of $109,590 to the March lows of $76,700. ETH, Altcoins Worse Than BTC Ether‚Äôs performance last quarter was even worse than bitcoin‚Äôs. The asset plummeted by a whopping 45.41%, posting monthly negative returns of 18.69% in March. Notably, ETH has recorded negative returns consistently for the past three months, with the worst seen in February (31.9%). Unlike BTC, ETH has posted only one negative first quarter since 2018 ‚Äì in 2022, when its returns were -10.75%. Every other quarter since Q1 2018, when ETH closed with -46.61%, has been positive. The recent negative quarterly close can be attributed to ether‚Äôs underperformance in this bull cycle and over the past few months. Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts revealed that the most popular altcoins, especially meme coins, performed even more poorly than BTC and ETH; many are 80% down from their ATHs.

Here is the Critical Date,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-treasury-department-and-other-federal-agencies-reveal-the-amount-of-crypto-assets-they-hold-here-is-the-critical-date/,"The U.S. Treasury Department and other federal agencies are set to disclose their holdings of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on April 5, following President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile. US Government to Complete Bitcoin Audit on April 5, Crypto Stockpiling Details Awaited The audit will clarify whether the assets XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) previously mentioned by Trump are included in the government‚Äôs crypto assets. On March 6, Trump issued an executive order requiring all federal agencies to report Bitcoin and crypto assets to the Treasury Secretary within 30 days. A March 11 document also stated that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would store Bitcoin obtained through legal or criminal seizures and would not be sold, positioning it as a ‚Äúdigital Fort Knox‚Äù for long-term value storage. Additionally, the Treasury is expected to establish two offices to manage the government's crypto assets, as outlined in the order. Bitcoin Price Fluctuates Amid Reserve Speculations The impending disclosure has sparked speculation about Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price action, with BTC Inc CEO David Bailey suggesting the audit results could explain Bitcoin‚Äôs recent 10% price drop that saw the asset fall from $92,000 to $82,000 amid the ongoing trade war and recession concerns. ‚ÄúDepending on what we learn, this could answer many of the open questions about the recent price action,‚Äù Bailey said. According to Arkham Intelligence data, the US government currently holds 198,012 BTC worth around $16 billion. White House crypto chief David Sacks revealed that the government has held up to 400,000 BTC from civil and criminal seizures over the past decade. However, only 195,000 BTC were sold, generating $366 million. If the entire amount had been retained, its current value would exceed $17 billion. As the audit nears completion, investors and analysts are waiting for more details on the government‚Äôs crypto hoarding strategy and its potential market impacts. *This is not investment advice.

Panshibi (SHIBI) Emerges As Best New Investment Pick This Easter! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News According to historical footprints in the global crypto market, festive seasons are always important for investors. From exponential growths for some projects to disappointing plunges for others, investors should figure out the best altcoins to invest in during these periods. This easter, there‚Äôs a new fast-growing project coming for the place of top meme coins like Shiba Inu and DOGE! Compared to this new crypto called Panshibi ($SHIBI) , what do Shiba Inu price prediction and Dogecoin price performances suggest? Keep reading to find answers. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Amid Market Challenges Shiba inu active community backing plus its periodically high volatility has left SHIB struggling to maintain value stability. According to recent market data, Shiba Inu price prediction is under intense selling pressure, causing investors to seek high-growth alternative opportunities for more promising profit potential. While there‚Äôve been strategic moves like the Shibarium Layer 2 solution and improving DeFi adoption, Shiba Inu price prediction is hindered by price fluctuations, leaving all traders with tricky assessments of sustainable development. This uncertainty around Shiba Inu price prediction has begun to push SHIB investors to consider moving their holdings to some of the best altcoins to invest in, with the strongest contender being Panshibi ($SHIBI). Bolstered by tokenomics and a determined core development team, Panshibi is growing fast among the best altcoins to invest in and dominating the meme coin space. Dogecoin‚Äôs Uncertain Future Leaves Investors Worried Beyond the reputation of being the very first meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE) has not cemented its importance in the crypto space lately. Leveraging periodic support from Elon Musk, plus integration into payment systems, Dogecoin‚Äôs price still seems tricky to predict. Previous Dogecoin predictions suggest continued volatility, with DOGE failing to break out of its price zone. Hence, investors find it hard to record constant rises for positive investment returns. Hence, Dogecoin‚Äôs additional adoption into merchant payments and tipping services had a limited impact as it lacked any other significant technical upgrades. Dogecoin investors have found interest in other meme coins, especially Panshibi, a project rapidly stealing the spotlight. With a unique technique for community-driven rewards and fundamentally sound security procedures, Panshibi is set to compete with top meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Is Panshibi One of The Best Altcoins To Invest In This Year? The tension in the meme coin market disturbing the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu communities hardly affects Panshibi ($SHIBI) , which is positioned to become the next massive sensation in meme coin investing. With innovation, robust community backing, and value-adding tokenomics, Panshibi is built on pillars forging it to transform the meme coin sector and establish new standards for investor trust and security. Panshibi locks liquidity for 10 years and team tokens for 2 years. That is the core of gaining market stability. Early buyers will continue to get well-rewarded as they accumulate the $SHIBI token at discounted pre-sale prices and are well-positioned for exponential growth. $SHIBI trades for $0.005 per token, and the listing price is $0.026, an attractive growth potential. Therefore, it isn‚Äôt surprising that the presale has attracted attention from thousands of investors, including many Shiba Inu and Dogecoin traders, seeking to profit from a project with solid fundamentals and high growth chances. Market analysts are confident that Panshibi will break from the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu price trends, thus establishing itself as one of the best altcoins to invest in for higher returns.

Amid this, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), indicating that the meme coin is facing resistance at two key levels: $0.18 and $0.21. Meanwhile, the expert further noted that if DOGE breaches these resistance levels, a massive bull rally could follow. Current Price Momentum As of now, the meme coin is trading near $0.17, having recorded a 2.75% price surge over the past 24 hours. However, during intraday trading, it reached a high of $0.175 but faced strong resistance, leading to a price reversal. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset‚Äôs trading volume dropped by 10%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish as it is retesting the breakdown of an ascending trendline. Based on recent price action, if DOGE declines and closes a four-hour candle below the $0.162 level, there is a strong possibility of a significant price drop in the coming days. At present, DOGE is trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a strong bearish trend and weak price action, which may be contributing to lower participation.

By leveraging state channels, Hydra enables near-instantaneous transactions with minimal fees, making it a crucial upgrade for Cardano‚Äôs long-term scalability. Bitcoin‚Äôs Lightning Network: Instant and Low-Cost Payments The Lightning Network is Bitcoin‚Äôs Layer-2 scaling solution, allowing users to conduct transactions off-chain before settling on the Bitcoin mainnet. It significantly reduces congestion and transaction fees while maintaining Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralization and security. By integrating these two technologies, Cardano and Bitcoin will be able to interact seamlessly, opening the door to faster cross-chain transactions, enhanced liquidity, and greater adoption of both networks. The Role of Aiken and BitVMX in Cross-Chain Smart Contracts Another key element of this integration is the porting of Aiken to BitVMX, a move that will enable developers to write both Bitcoin Script and Cardano smart contracts. This advancement brings several advantages: Trustless and Secure Interoperability: Users will be able to interact across both blockchains without relying on centralized bridges or custodians. Expanded Smart Contract Functionality: Developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the strengths of both ecosystems, combining Bitcoin‚Äôs security with Cardano‚Äôs smart contract capabilities.

Isla, a Web3 researcher developing the project, received the 274 ETH , equivalent to around $500,000, from Buterin, according to reports. The donation was identified by Onchain Lens, a blockchain monitoring site that tracks fund transfers. This step is not surprising to anyone who has known about Buterin‚Äôs charitable activities and experimental associations. Zuitzerland is said to be a product of Buterin‚Äôs previous Zuzalu experiment , whose purpose was to unite like-minded people and engage into proposals on technology, longevity, and decentralized regimes. Ethereum Donation: What Is Zuitzerland? The Zuitzerland initiative is based on the ideas launched in the Zuzalu experiment, a short-term community project initiated by Buterin between March and May 2023, in Montenegro.

The platform emphasizes the development of collaboration between ‚Äúthinkers and builders.‚Äù Although Buterin is not among the founders of the project, he is mentioned as a speaker and curator on its official site, indicating his support and engagement. Funding Through Token Sales Buterin‚Äôs contribution was partly financed by selling tokens he had earlier received as gifts from other crypto projects. According to on-chain statistics, Buterin sold 5,000 Dohrnii (DHN) tokens for $93,882 and 2 trillion LEDOG (DOG) tokens for $16,569 on March 31, 2025. The proceeds from these sales were aggregated and then sent as 274 ETH to Isla. This is not the first time that Buterin has sold tokens gifted to him for a cause. In 2022, he sold some Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens gifted to him in order to donate to an Indian COVID-19 relief fund. Buterin has also publicly urged token issuers to give directly to charities instead of donating tokens to him. A History Of Token Donations Dohrnii Labs, the developers of the DHN token, had sent 10,000 tokens to Buterin in January 2025. Likewise, LEDOG‚Äôs developers sent 10 trillion DOG tokens to him in August 2024. Although these tokens are usually given as a token of appreciation, they are also a marketing strategy for visibility. Buterin has been selling these tokens gradually over time, using the funds for donations and other things. As of now, Buterin still retains 2 trillion DOG tokens, as per data on the blockchain. Nevertheless, his actions reveal a distinct orientation towards leveraging such assets to help initiatives such as Zuitzerland, which align with his belief in decentralized governance and innovation led by community.

The analyst also revealed the implications of this development and how exactly it could impact these crypto assets. Bitcoin And Altcoins Fischer Transform Indicator Turns Bearish In an X post, Severino revealed that the total crypto market cap 12-week Fisher Transform has flipped bearish for the first time since December 2021. Before then, the indicator had flipped bearish in January 2018. In 2021 and 2018, the total crypto market cap dropped 66% and 82%, respectively. This provides a bearish outlook for Bitcoin and altcoins, suggesting they could suffer a massive crash soon enough. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fischer Transform Returns To 2022 Bear Levels, Why Max Pain Could Continue For 4 Months In another X post, the technical expert revealed that Bitcoin‚Äôs 12-week Fischer Transform has also flipped bearish. Severino noted that this indicator converts prices into a Gaussian normal distribution to smooth out price data and filter out noise. In the process, it helps generate clear signals that help pinpoint major market turning points. Severino asserted that this indicator on the 12-week timeframe has never missed a top or bottom call, indicating that Bitcoin and altcoins may have indeed topped out. The expert has been warning for a while now that the Bitcoin top might be in and that a massive crash could be on the horizon for the flagship crypto. He recently alluded to the Elliott Wave Theory and market cycles to explain why he is no longer bullish on Bitcoin and altcoins. He also highlighted other indicators, such as the Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) and Average Directional Index (ADX), to show that BTC‚Äôs bullish momentum is fading. The expert also warned that a sell signal could send BTC into a Supertrend DownTrend, with the flagship crypto dropping to as low as $22,000. A Different Perspective For BTC Crypto analyst Kevin Capital has provided a different perspective on Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. While noting that BTC is in a correctional phase, he affirmed that it will soon be over. Kevin Capital claimed that the question is not whether this phase will end. Instead, it is about how strong Bitcoin‚Äôs bounce will be and whether the flagship crypto will make new highs or record a lackluster lower high followed by a bear market.

The analyst added that Bitcoin‚Äôs price action when that time comes will also be trackable using other methods, such as money flow, macro fundamentals, and overall spot volume. The major focus is on the macro fundamentals as market participants look forward to Donald Trump‚Äôs much-anticipated reciprocal tariffs, which will be announced tomorrow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $83,000, up around 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The unexpected decline was triggered by large sell orders executed within a short time frame, leading to a significant increase in spot trading volume. Benson Sun, a former FTX community partner, analyzed the situation and attributed the price crash to Binance‚Äôs recent adjustments to ACT‚Äôs leverage position limits. The platform had introduced a rule that limited maximum open positions at 1x leverage to $4.5 million. According to the analyst, some market makers had positions exceeding this limit, which led to automatic liquidations in the market prices. The forced sale caused the contract price to fall, creating a large disparity between futures and spot prices, which in turn pushed the spot price down. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Adds 4 Surprise Altcoins to its Pre-Listing Altcoin Pool Sun also noted that Binance announced this leverage adjustment at 10:32 AM on April 1st and that it would be implemented at 1:30 PM on the same day, giving traders less than three hours to react. Notably, Binance made a similar adjustment on March 31st and reduced position limits by another 50% for lower leverage levels on April 1st. *This is not investment advice.

With global trade tensions escalating and tariffs looming, it‚Äôs more crucial than ever to understand how to navigate these turbulent waters. Just like in the crypto world where volatility is the name of the game, the traditional forex market is bracing for potential shocks. UBS, a leading global financial institution, is highlighting the growing trend of forex de-risking . But what does this mean for you, and how can you strategically position yourself to weather the storm? Let‚Äôs dive deep into the world of currency risk management and uncover the essential strategies you need to know right now. Decoding Forex De-Risking: Your Shield Against Market Uncertainty Forex de-risking , in simple terms, is the process of reducing exposure to potential losses in the foreign exchange market. Think of it as building a robust defense for your portfolio against unexpected currency fluctuations. Why is this becoming increasingly important, especially now? The answer lies in the rising tide of global trade tensions and the specter of tariffs. When tariffs are implemented, they can significantly impact currency valuations. For instance, if a country imposes tariffs on imported goods, its currency might strengthen due to increased demand for domestic products, or it could weaken due to retaliatory tariffs and reduced trade flows. These shifts create volatility and uncertainty in the forex market, making forex de-risking a strategic imperative for businesses and investors alike. Consider these key aspects of why forex de-risking is gaining momentum: Geopolitical Instability: Global trade relations are becoming increasingly unpredictable. Tariffs are just one tool in a larger toolkit of economic and political maneuvering that can trigger rapid currency swings. Economic Slowdown Concerns: Tariffs can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for businesses, and ultimately contribute to slower economic growth. This economic uncertainty naturally translates into forex market volatility. UBS‚Äôs Perspective: UBS, as a major player in global finance, recognizing and highlighting forex de-risking underscores the seriousness of the current market environment. Their insights are valuable because they are based on deep market analysis and client behavior. Proactive Risk Management: Waiting for tariffs to be implemented and then reacting is a reactive approach. Forex de-risking is about being proactive, anticipating potential risks, and implementing strategies to mitigate them *before* the storm hits. The Looming Threat: Understanding Tariff Impact on Forex Markets Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods. While they are intended to protect domestic industries, they have far-reaching consequences for the global economy and, crucially, for the forex market. The tariff impact on currencies can be complex and multifaceted. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how tariffs can shake up the forex landscape: Tariff Scenario Potential Forex Market Impact Example Country A imposes tariffs on imports from Country B Country A‚Äôs currency might initially strengthen (due to expectations of increased domestic production), but could weaken later due to retaliatory tariffs and reduced trade volume. Country B‚Äôs currency may weaken. US-China trade tensions: Initial US dollar strength followed by periods of weakness and Yuan volatility. Global tariffs increase across multiple economies Increased forex volatility across the board. Safe-haven currencies (like the Swiss Franc or Japanese Yen) may strengthen. Currencies of export-dependent nations might weaken. Broad escalation of trade wars leading to widespread currency fluctuations and risk aversion. Unexpected tariff announcements Sudden and sharp currency movements. Increased market uncertainty and risk premiums. Surprise tariff announcements causing flash crashes or spikes in currency pairs. As you can see, the tariff impact isn‚Äôt always straightforward. It‚Äôs not just about one currency strengthening and another weakening in a predictable manner. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that tariffs can create ripple effects, leading to unexpected and sometimes dramatic shifts in currency values. This is why understanding and implementing effective currency risk management strategies is paramount. Navigating the Storm: Essential Currency Risk Management Techniques So, how can businesses and investors effectively engage in currency risk management amidst tariff uncertainty? Here are some proven strategies to consider: Hedging with Forex Derivatives: Forward Contracts: Lock in a specific exchange rate for a future transaction, providing certainty and protection against adverse currency movements. Options: Give you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell currency at a predetermined rate. This offers flexibility and limits potential losses while still allowing for potential gains. Swaps: Exchange principal and/or interest payments in one currency for equivalent amounts in another currency. Useful for managing long-term currency exposures. Diversification: Currency Diversification: Hold assets and liabilities in multiple currencies to reduce overall exposure to any single currency‚Äôs volatility. Geographic Diversification: Expand business operations and investments across different countries and regions to mitigate risks associated with specific geopolitical events or tariff policies. Natural Hedging: Match revenues and expenses in the same currency whenever possible. For example, if you have significant expenses in Euros, try to generate revenue in Euros as well. Establish operations or subsidiaries in countries where you have significant business activity to create a natural currency balance. Dynamic Currency Risk Management: Continuously monitor market conditions and adjust your hedging strategies as needed. Forex volatility is not static, and your risk management approach shouldn‚Äôt be either. Use sophisticated risk management tools and models to assess and quantify currency risks more accurately. Choosing the right currency risk management strategy depends on various factors, including your risk tolerance, the nature of your business, the currencies you are exposed to, and your market outlook. It‚Äôs often beneficial to consult with financial experts to develop a tailored strategy that aligns with your specific needs and objectives. Riding the Waves of Forex Volatility: Opportunities and Challenges While forex volatility driven by tariffs and trade tensions presents significant risks, it also creates opportunities. For astute traders and investors, volatility can be a source of potential profit. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach this environment with caution and a well-defined strategy. Here‚Äôs a balanced view of the opportunities and challenges: Opportunities: Trading Volatility: Skilled traders can profit from short-term currency fluctuations by using strategies designed to capitalize on forex volatility . Strategic Currency Positioning: Identifying currencies that are likely to benefit or suffer from tariff changes can lead to profitable long-term investments. Hedging as a Profit Center: Sophisticated hedging strategies, when executed effectively, can not only protect against losses but also generate profits in volatile markets. Challenges: Increased Market Uncertainty: Forex volatility makes forecasting currency movements more difficult and increases the risk of unexpected losses. Complexity of Risk Management: Developing and implementing effective currency risk management strategies in a volatile environment requires expertise and resources. Emotional Trading: Volatility can trigger emotional responses, leading to impulsive and potentially detrimental trading decisions. Disciplined risk management is essential to avoid emotional pitfalls. Global Trade Risks: A Broader Perspective The current focus on tariffs is just one aspect of broader global trade risks that are impacting the forex market. Other factors contributing to uncertainty and volatility include: Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs and geopolitical tensions can disrupt global supply chains, affecting businesses‚Äô profitability and currency valuations. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs can lead to higher import costs, potentially fueling inflation and influencing central bank policies and currency values. Geopolitical Events: Beyond tariffs, other geopolitical events, such as political instability, conflicts, and sanctions, can also trigger significant forex volatility . Shifting Global Power Dynamics: Changes in the global balance of power and evolving trade relationships can create long-term shifts in currency valuations and trade flows. Understanding these broader global trade risks is crucial for developing a comprehensive and resilient forex de-risking strategy. It‚Äôs not just about reacting to tariffs; it‚Äôs about anticipating and preparing for a range of potential disruptions in the global economic landscape. Actionable Insights: De-Risk Your Forex Strategy Today Ready to take control and de-risk your forex strategy? Here are some actionable steps you can take right now: Assess Your Currency Exposure: Identify all your current and potential future currency exposures. Understand which currencies you are most vulnerable to and the potential impact of adverse movements. Develop a Risk Management Plan: Create a formal currency risk management plan that outlines your objectives, risk tolerance, and specific hedging strategies. Explore Hedging Options: Research and evaluate different hedging instruments, such as forward contracts, options, and swaps, to determine which are most suitable for your needs. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor global trade developments, tariff announcements, and geopolitical events that could impact the forex market. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with financial professionals who specialize in forex risk management to get personalized guidance and support. Conclusion: Navigating Forex Uncertainty with Confidence The forex market is undoubtedly facing a period of heightened uncertainty due to escalating trade tensions and the widespread implementation of tariffs. However, by understanding the dynamics of forex de-risking , the tariff impact on currencies, and implementing effective currency risk management strategies, you can navigate this volatile landscape with greater confidence. Embrace proactive risk management, stay informed, and adapt your strategies to the evolving global economic environment. Just as in the crypto space, where resilience and adaptability are key, mastering forex de-risking is your essential tool for protecting and potentially growing your investments in these challenging times.

42758024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=145071,1743522641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exclusive: Falcon Finance Unveils Governance Token Plans, Confirmed by DWF Labs Co-founder",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/falcon-finance-governance-token-launch/,"Exciting news is brewing in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space! Falcon Finance, a synthetic dollar protocol, is gearing up to launch its own governance token and a points program. This development was revealed by none other than Andrei Grachev, co-founder of DWF Labs, in a recent announcement on X (formerly Twitter). Let‚Äôs dive into what this means for Falcon Finance, its users, and the broader DeFi ecosystem. Falcon Finance‚Äôs Bold Move: Introducing a Governance Token So, what‚Äôs the big deal about a governance token ? In the world of DeFi, governance tokens are more than just digital assets; they are keys to community ownership and decision-making power. By introducing a governance token, Falcon Finance is essentially handing over the reins, at least partially, to its community. This move towards decentralization is a significant step for any DeFi protocol, signaling a commitment to user empowerment and long-term sustainability. Think of it like this: traditionally, in centralized finance, decisions are made behind closed doors by a select few. But DeFi flips this model on its head. With a governance token, holders get a say in the protocol‚Äôs future direction. This could include voting on crucial aspects such as: Protocol upgrades and modifications: Deciding on new features, improvements to existing mechanisms, or even adjustments to the synthetic dollar protocol itself. Treasury management: Having a voice in how the protocol‚Äôs funds are allocated and utilized. Parameter adjustments: Influencing key settings within the protocol, like interest rates, collateral ratios, and more. Partnerships and integrations: Potentially voting on collaborations with other projects or expansions to new platforms. In essence, a governance token transforms users from passive participants into active stakeholders, fostering a more engaged and invested community. For Falcon Finance, this could translate to stronger user loyalty, more robust protocol development driven by community insights, and a more decentralized and resilient ecosystem overall. The Points Program: Rewarding User Engagement Alongside the exciting news of a governance token, Falcon Finance is also rolling out a points program. Points programs are a popular mechanism in the crypto world to incentivize user activity and reward early adopters. While details are still emerging, we can anticipate that the Falcon Finance points program will likely reward users for various forms of engagement with the protocol. This could include: Providing liquidity: Users who contribute assets to Falcon Finance‚Äôs liquidity pools might earn points. Staking: Staking assets within the Falcon Finance ecosystem could be another way to accumulate points. Trading activity: Engaging in trading activities on the platform might also be rewarded with points. Community participation: Contributing to the community through forums, providing feedback, or participating in governance discussions could potentially earn points as well. These points are often convertible to various benefits, and in the context of Falcon Finance‚Äôs announcement, it‚Äôs highly probable that these points will play a crucial role in the distribution of the upcoming governance token . Points programs are an effective way to bootstrap initial token distribution, rewarding early supporters and active users who have contributed to the protocol‚Äôs growth. It‚Äôs a win-win situation: users are incentivized to engage with the protocol, and Falcon Finance benefits from increased activity and a more vibrant community. DWF Labs‚Äô Endorsement: A Strong Vote of Confidence The involvement of DWF Labs, a prominent global digital asset market maker and Web3 investment firm, adds significant weight to Falcon Finance‚Äôs announcement. Andrei Grachev, co-founder of DWF Labs, publicly sharing this news on X indicates a strong endorsement and likely some level of support from DWF Labs for Falcon Finance‚Äôs initiatives. DWF Labs is known for its strategic investments and support for promising crypto projects. Their backing can provide Falcon Finance with several advantages: Increased visibility and credibility: DWF Labs‚Äô reputation in the crypto space can bring more attention and trust to Falcon Finance. Potential funding and resources: While not explicitly stated, DWF Labs‚Äô involvement could imply potential financial backing or access to resources that can help Falcon Finance in its development and growth. Market making expertise: DWF Labs‚Äô core expertise in market making could be invaluable for ensuring healthy liquidity and price discovery for the upcoming governance token . Strategic partnerships and network: DWF Labs‚Äô extensive network within the crypto industry could open doors for strategic partnerships and collaborations for Falcon Finance. Having DWF Labs in their corner certainly strengthens Falcon Finance‚Äôs position and suggests a promising future for the protocol and its newly planned governance token . Understanding the Synthetic Dollar Protocol To fully grasp the significance of these developments, it‚Äôs important to understand what Falcon Finance‚Äôs core offering is: a synthetic dollar protocol . In simple terms, a synthetic dollar aims to mimic the value of the US dollar on the blockchain, but without relying on traditional banking systems. These protocols are crucial in DeFi as they provide stable and predictable assets that can be used for trading, lending, borrowing, and various other financial activities within the decentralized ecosystem. Different synthetic dollar protocols employ various mechanisms to maintain their peg to the US dollar. These mechanisms can range from: Collateralization: Using cryptocurrencies as collateral to back the synthetic dollar. Algorithmic stabilization: Employing algorithms and smart contracts to adjust the supply and demand of the synthetic dollar to maintain its peg. Seigniorage shares: Using a dual-token system where one token is pegged to the dollar and the other absorbs volatility. Falcon Finance, as a synthetic dollar protocol , likely utilizes one or a combination of these mechanisms. The introduction of a governance token can further enhance the stability and robustness of such protocols by allowing the community to participate in fine-tuning these mechanisms and responding to market fluctuations. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the launch of a governance token and points program is undoubtedly positive news for Falcon Finance, it‚Äôs essential to acknowledge the potential challenges and considerations that lie ahead. Launching a successful governance token and ensuring its effective utilization requires careful planning and execution. Some key challenges include: Ensuring active governance participation: A governance token is only effective if token holders actively participate in voting and decision-making. Falcon Finance will need to implement mechanisms to encourage participation and prevent governance apathy. Preventing governance attacks: Decentralized governance systems can be vulnerable to attacks if a malicious actor accumulates a significant portion of the governance tokens. Robust security measures and thoughtful token distribution strategies are crucial. Balancing decentralization and efficiency: While decentralization is a core principle of DeFi, governance processes can sometimes be slower and less efficient than centralized decision-making. Finding the right balance is key. Regulatory landscape: The regulatory landscape for DeFi and governance tokens is still evolving. Falcon Finance needs to navigate this evolving landscape carefully to ensure compliance. Furthermore, the success of the points program will depend on its design and implementation. It‚Äôs crucial to ensure that the points program effectively incentivizes desired user behavior and contributes to the long-term growth and sustainability of the Falcon Finance ecosystem. Actionable Insights: What Should Users Do? For users interested in Falcon Finance and its upcoming governance token , here are some actionable insights: Stay informed: Keep a close eye on Falcon Finance‚Äôs official communication channels, including their X (Twitter) account, website, and community forums, for further announcements and details about the governance token and points program. Understand the points program: Once details of the points program are released, understand how you can participate and accumulate points. This could involve providing liquidity, staking, or engaging in other activities on the platform. Prepare for the governance token launch: If you are interested in participating in governance, start learning about decentralized governance models and how governance tokens function. Do your own research (DYOR): As with any crypto project, conduct thorough research on Falcon Finance, its team, technology, and roadmap before making any investment decisions. Understand the risks involved in DeFi and synthetic dollar protocols. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Falcon Finance Falcon Finance‚Äôs plan to introduce a governance token and points program, with the backing of DWF Labs, marks an exciting new chapter for the synthetic dollar protocol . This move towards greater decentralization and community engagement has the potential to strengthen the protocol, enhance user experience, and foster a more vibrant ecosystem. While challenges remain, the commitment to governance and user incentives positions Falcon Finance as a project to watch closely in the evolving DeFi landscape. The launch of the governance token is poised to be a significant event, and the crypto community is eagerly awaiting further details. This exclusive announcement signals a powerful step forward for Falcon Finance and the future of decentralized finance.

Certain digital assets hold promise for those eyeing medium-term gains. Uncover why XRP , Cardano , and SUI stand out as strong contenders for investors in 2025. These coins might be poised for significant growth, offering potential rewards in a widely fluctuating market. XRP Price Recap: Long-Term Surge with Short-Term Dips XRP experienced a massive surge over the last six months with a 294% gain, while the past month saw a slight decline of 3%. The coin‚Äôs journey has been volatile, marked by impressive mid-term bullish momentum alongside minor short-term corrections. Long-term buyers have fueled a dramatic rise, while short-term traders adjust positions during a brief pullback. XRP currently trades between $1.66 and $2.77, resting near a resistance level at $3.45 and support at $1.23. Bears and bulls are in balance, with slight bearish signals from momentum indicators and oscillators. Trading ideas include monitoring the $3.45 resistance level for potential short-term reversal opportunities while considering accumulation near $1.23 support. Attention to the extended levels at $4.56 resistance and $0.115 support may provide further strategic entry or exit points. Cardano's Surge and Key Levels Amid Short-Term Dips Cardano gained 2.73% over the last month, adding to a substantial 97.38% rise over the past six months. A one-week decline of 7.64% indicates short-term corrections after the prolonged rally. The price action maintains long-term gains, and brief pullbacks suggest market adjustments. This historical performance highlights strong investor interest and indicates that past accumulation phases may lead to future movements. Trading currently ranges from about $0.47 to $1.02, with support around $0.27 and resistance near $1.37, while a secondary resistance level appears at $1.92. Bears have some control due to weak momentum indicators, and a clear trend is not yet established. Bulls must push through resistance levels for further gains. Traders could look for breakout opportunities near resistance or buying possibilities at support, applying tight risk management. Upward Momentum and Volatility in the Sui Market Sui experienced a drop of about 16% over the past month, contrasting with a robust half-year gain of nearly 27.6%. This recent price action shows vulnerability but highlights a long-term rebound potential, indicating shifting market dynamics. The blend of short-term pullback and strong growth over the last six months suggests that the coin is working to build upward momentum despite recent declines. Currently, prices are trading between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at around $3.79 and secondary resistance near $5.07. Support is located at approximately $1.21, while momentum indicators suggest a cautious balance between bulls and bears, with the RSI near 46. Traders may consider buying on dips while monitoring these key levels for clearer trends ahead. Conclusion XRP , ADA , and SUI offer strong potential for mid-term growth. XRP benefits from its focus on fast transactions. ADA stands out with its commitment to sustainability and innovation. SUI, though newer, shows promise with its unique features. These coins present solid options for those looking to invest over the next few years. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Now waning buy pressure threatens to pull its price below this psychological floor,‚ÄÇraising the prospect of a 5% drop to $1.95. Technical indicators point to a faltering bullish momentum, with the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) dipping below -0.05. At the same time, the Awesome Oscillator turns red‚Äîan antipode‚ÄÇto the tentative sentiment following Ripple‚Äôs partial legal win against previously SEC. While XRP struggles, investors are turning attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol whose ongoing presale has already crossed $6 million, with phase four filling up fast before‚ÄÇa price 20% increase. XRP‚ÄÇFaces Bearish Signs, But Where to Next? XRP‚Äôs recent performance‚ÄÇis a sign of a trapped market. The token had been holding $2 for weeks, but its failure to capitalize on positive‚ÄÇlegal developments has disappointed traders. Bitcoin wobbling around $83,000 also adds‚ÄÇpressure, with correlated drops commonly reverberating across altcoins. On-chain metrics exacerbate the gloom: the Accumulation/Distribution is in‚ÄÇa downward trend, indicative of capital flight, while dropping buy orders suggest lassitude among institutions. Analysts caution that a‚ÄÇclose below $2 could prompt algorithmic sell-offs, driving losses faster. The only question for XRP holders now is recovery versus damage control and much of‚ÄÇthe virtual crowd has already migrated towards the high-growth alternatives such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum‚ÄÇFinance Presale Accelerating The emerging coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts a stampede of investors,‚ÄÇwith token holders expanding to 7,700 since its presale went live. Now in its fourth phase, MUTM is currently priced at $0.025 ‚Äî a price expected to jump 20% to $0.03 as soon as the next phase is‚ÄÇunderway. Tokens are‚ÄÇset for launch at $0.06 so early buyers are looking at 140% returns at launch. Outside of that baseline, forecasts indicate a rise to $3.50 following launch, propelled by revenue-driven buybacks from Mutuum Finance and a mtTokens system that encourages‚ÄÇlong-term holding. The protocol‚Äôs lending model merges overcollateralized loans with peer-to-peer flexibility,‚ÄÇenabling users to borrow assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE) while earning yield on deposits. A hundred thousand dollars giveaway for participants of the presale has also driven demand sky high with‚ÄÇurgency as phase four nears capacity. In contrast to XRP, which finds itself in a realm of regulatory shadows, Mutuum Finance leads with transparency ‚Äî its smart contracts are currently undergoing a Certik audit, with results‚ÄÇon the way. Shifts in Strategic‚ÄÇDirection Paint Picture of Crypto Market Trend The juxtaposition of XRP‚Äôs volatility and Mutuum Finance‚Äôs rise speaks to a wider‚ÄÇmarket shift towards utility-focused initiatives. Though XRP‚Äôs‚ÄÇlegal fears represent a substantial risk, at its core it is still an asset exposed to Bitcoin volatility ‚Äî meaning price action and market momentum determine the winners and losers, as data shows the fragile state of XRP, in contrast to Mutuum Finance‚Äôs structured tokenomics with 16x ROI potential. Uncertainty shies away from the arms of MUTM, a presale for a new currency which raises its price periodically, creating deliciously clear windows of now‚ÄÇand profit for the investor. Last Chance‚ÄÇfor Early Entry Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a rare marriage of‚ÄÇaccessibility with explosive growth. With‚ÄÇphase four reaching its limit, the amount of time to snag tokens at less than $0.03 is quickly ending. Post-audit announcements could‚ÄÇcatalyze another bid, leaving latecomers scrambling for inflated prices. Amidst existential support tests on XRP, the trajectory of MUTM‚Äîanchored‚ÄÇby genuine real-world DeFi applications and unceasing buy pressure‚Äîuniquely low-risk became the best-positioned breakout in 2025.

According to their X post, a significant 50,000 COMP tokens, valued at approximately $3.19 million, were transferred from an address linked to Robert Leshner to Galaxy Digital on March 12th. What makes this noteworthy? Galaxy Digital is known to facilitate large crypto transactions, often for institutional clients or significant holders looking to sell their assets. The plot thickened when these same 50,000 COMP tokens were subsequently deposited into the Binance crypto exchange just an hour after the initial transfer to Galaxy Digital. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key events: March 12th: 50,000 COMP tokens are moved from an address associated with Robert Leshner to Galaxy Digital. Within an hour of the Galaxy Digital transaction: The same 50,000 COMP tokens are deposited into Binance. Source: On-chain data analysis and public post by @ai_9684xtpa on X. Value: Approximately $3.19 million based on current COMP prices. While direct confirmation from Robert Leshner is still awaited, the on-chain evidence is compelling enough to spark debate and speculation within the DeFi community. The timing and the use of Galaxy Digital as an intermediary raise eyebrows, leading many to suspect a token sale is indeed underway. Why is a Potential Robert Leshner COMP Token Sale Significant? For those unfamiliar, Compound is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. It‚Äôs a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their crypto assets or borrow against them. Robert Leshner, as the founder, is a prominent figure in the crypto space, and his actions are closely watched. A large token sale by a founder can have several implications: Market Sentiment: Founder token sales can sometimes be interpreted negatively by the market. It can raise questions about the founder‚Äôs confidence in the project‚Äôs future, although this is not always the case. Price Impact: A sale of this magnitude could potentially exert downward pressure on the price of COMP , at least in the short term, due to increased supply in the market. Community Perception: Transparency is paramount in DeFi . The community will be keen to understand the reasons behind such a significant transfer. Open communication from Robert Leshner would be crucial to maintain trust and address any concerns. Project Fundamentals: While token sales by founders are not inherently negative, it‚Äôs essential to assess whether it reflects any changes in the project‚Äôs fundamentals or long-term strategy. In this case, Compound remains a robust protocol with significant adoption. Let‚Äôs consider a table to further illustrate the potential impact: Factor Potential Impact Market Confidence May temporarily decrease if the sale is perceived negatively. COMP Price Possible short-term price decline due to increased supply. Community Trust Could be affected if communication is lacking; transparency is key. Compound Protocol Fundamentally, the protocol‚Äôs operations remain unchanged. What Does This Mean for COMP Holders and the DeFi Market? For existing COMP holders, this news might be unsettling. It‚Äôs natural to wonder about the implications for your investment. Here are some points to consider: Volatility is Expected: News like this can introduce volatility into the market. Be prepared for potential price fluctuations in COMP. Monitor the Situation: Keep an eye on official announcements from Compound and statements from Robert Leshner . Clarity on the situation will be crucial. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that Compound is a well-established DeFi protocol with a strong track record. Short-term price movements don‚Äôt always reflect long-term value. Diversification: As always, consider diversification in your crypto portfolio to mitigate risks associated with individual token movements. The broader DeFi market is also watching closely. Events like these highlight the importance of on-chain transparency and the impact that key individuals can have on token valuations. It serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the crypto space. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed in the Crypto World This situation underscores the importance of staying informed and utilizing on-chain data to understand market movements. Here are some actionable steps you can take to navigate such events: Follow On-Chain Analysts: Keep track of reputable on-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa on platforms like X. They often provide early insights into significant token movements. Utilize Blockchain Explorers: Learn to use blockchain explorers to track transactions and understand token flows.

SOL price initially jumped to a high of $295 in January and then erased most of those gains to the current $126. This article explores whether you should sell popular Solana rivals like Polkadot (DOT), Binance Coin (BNB), and Tron (TRX). SOL Price is at Risk of Falling to $100 Solana price is at an increased risk of falling to $100 in the coming weeks. The daily chart below shows that a bearish flag pattern has slowly formed. This is a popular continuation pattern made up of two key parts: a vertical line and a rectangle continuation sign. It often leads to a strong bearish breakout. SOL price has formed a death cross pattern, and is now hovering above the key support at $120, where it has failed to move below since early last year. Therefore, these patterns point to a strong sell-off to the key support level at $100. A move above the upper side of the flag at $146 will invalidate the bearish outlook. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is one of the top Solana rivals to watch in April. Like SOL, it has crashed to a crucial support level at $3.6, where it has failed to move below in the past few years. On the positive side, the coin has formed a falling edge pattern, and is slowly forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. That is a sign that it may stage a strong comeback in the coming weeks. This means that it is not ideal to sell this SOL rival this month. Binance Coin (BNB) The BNB coin has done better than other Solana alternatives. It remains just about 20% below its all-time high. The main bullish case for the coin is that the developers are working on two separate upgrades that will boost its speeds. Their goal is for the BSC chain to become the top alternative for Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum is known for its slow speeds, while the Solana ecosystem has become toxic because of its meme coins. BNB price has also formed a cup and handle pattern, pointing to more gains later this year. As this CoinGape article noted , there are signs that the Binance Coin will jump to $1,000 later this year. BNB Price Chart Tron (TRX) Tron is one of the top Solana rivals to consider. The daily chart shows that the TRX price has been in a consolidation phase in the past few months. It is consolidating at the 50-day moving average. On the positive side, the coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, with the two trendlines nearing their meeting point. That is a sign that it will have a strong bullish breakout in the coming weeks. Such a move would see it rise to $0.30, up by 30% above the current level. A drop below the lower side of the wedge will invalidate the bullish TRX price forecast . Tron Price Chart Is it Safe to Sell These Solana Rivals? Technicals suggest that these three SOL rivals have formed strong technicals. That is a sign that these tokens will bounce back even if the Solana drops and stalls at the key support at $100.

Fidelity Digital Assets Predicts Bull Market Surge Continues,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/unstoppable-bitcoin-rally-fidelity-predicts/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Just when you thought the Bitcoin rollercoaster might be slowing down, think again. Fresh insights from Fidelity Digital Assets are making waves, suggesting that the Bitcoin rally we‚Äôve been witnessing is far from over. Buckle up as we dive into the details of this exciting prediction and explore what it could mean for the future of BTC and the broader crypto landscape. Is this just wishful thinking, or is there solid ground beneath this optimistic outlook? Let‚Äôs unpack the research and find out. Is the Bitcoin Rally Really Still On? Fidelity Digital Assets Says Yes According to a recent report highlighted by Cointelegraph, Fidelity Digital Assets, a division of the financial giant Fidelity Investments, is doubling down on its bullish stance on Bitcoin. Their research suggests that the current acceleration phase of the Bitcoin bull market hasn‚Äôt reached its peak yet. This is a bold claim, especially considering the market‚Äôs inherent volatility and recent price fluctuations. But what exactly does Fidelity‚Äôs analysis entail? Analyst Zack Wainwright from Fidelity Digital Assets sheds light on this perspective, explaining that acceleration phases in Bitcoin‚Äôs price history are typically characterized by: High Volatility: Expect to see significant price swings, both upwards and downwards, as the market navigates this phase. Substantial Gains: Historically, acceleration phases have been periods of considerable price appreciation for Bitcoin. Comparisons to Past Cycles: Wainwright draws parallels to December 2020, a period when Bitcoin spectacularly broke through the $20,000 barrier, signaling the start of a major bull run. To put things in perspective, despite experiencing an 11.44% drop this year and a nearly 25% pullback from its all-time high, Wainwright argues that these corrections are not unusual within the context of past market cycles. In fact, he views them as par for the course, suggesting that the current market behavior is aligning with historical patterns. Understanding Bitcoin Market Cycles: What History Tells Us To truly grasp the significance of Fidelity‚Äôs analysis, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the concept of Bitcoin market cycles. Bitcoin, like many other assets, doesn‚Äôt move in a straight line. Its price action is characterized by cycles of booms and busts, often influenced by factors such as: Halving Events: The periodic reduction in the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks, historically leading to supply shocks and price increases. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest and investment from institutional players can inject significant capital into the market, driving up prices. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rate policies can all play a role in Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements. Technological Advancements: Developments in blockchain technology and the broader crypto ecosystem can impact investor sentiment and market dynamics. Wainwright‚Äôs analysis leans heavily on historical patterns within these cycles. He emphasizes that corrections, even significant ones, are a normal part of the crypto market analysis landscape. These pullbacks can be viewed as periods of consolidation before the next leg up in the bull run. Think of it like a breather for the market before it gathers momentum for another surge. Fidelity‚Äôs Insight on Bitcoin‚Äôs Future Price: Could $110,000 Be the Next Target? Here‚Äôs where things get really interesting. Wainwright points out a recurring pattern in Bitcoin‚Äôs acceleration phases: the occurrence of two major surges. In the current cycle, he identifies the first surge as happening after the U.S. election. Now, the burning question is: when could we see the second surge, and what could be its potential target? According to Fidelity‚Äôs research, if history is any guide, a new all-time high for Bitcoin could be on the horizon. And if this second surge materializes, Wainwright suggests a potential target of around $110,000. Key Takeaway: Fidelity Digital Assets isn‚Äôt just saying the Bitcoin bull market is ongoing; they‚Äôre hinting at a potentially significant price appreciation in the future, with $110,000 as a possible target for the next major surge. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that this is a prediction based on historical analysis and market patterns. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously unpredictable, and various factors could influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. It‚Äôs not financial advice, but rather an expert interpretation of current market dynamics. Navigating the Bitcoin Rally: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what does this all mean for you, the crypto enthusiast or potential investor? Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate this potentially ongoing Bitcoin rally: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market analysis from reputable sources like Fidelity Digital Assets and Cointelegraph, but always cross-reference information and form your own informed opinions. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and diversify your portfolio to mitigate potential losses. Prepare for Volatility: As Wainwright highlights, acceleration phases come with volatility. Be prepared for price swings and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Fidelity‚Äôs analysis emphasizes long-term cycles. Consider adopting a long-term investment perspective rather than trying to time short-term market movements. Further Research: Dive deeper into Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycles, historical price action, and the factors influencing its price. Resources like Fidelity Digital Assets‚Äô research reports and reputable crypto news outlets can be invaluable. Conclusion: The Bitcoin Bullish Narrative Continues Fidelity Digital Assets‚Äô research offers a compelling narrative: the Bitcoin bull market is not over, and we may still be in the midst of a significant acceleration phase. While past performance is not indicative of future results, historical patterns and expert analysis can provide valuable insights into potential market trajectories. The prediction of a possible surge towards $110,000 is certainly attention-grabbing, and while it should be taken with a grain of salt, it underscores the optimistic sentiment surrounding Bitcoin within certain segments of the financial industry. Whether or not Bitcoin reaches $110,000 remains to be seen. However, Fidelity‚Äôs analysis serves as a potent reminder that the Bitcoin story is still being written, and the potential for further growth and innovation in the crypto space remains substantial. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, staying informed, managing risk wisely, and maintaining a long-term perspective are crucial as we navigate the exciting, and often unpredictable, world of digital assets.

On April 1, Grayscale submitted an S-3 regulatory filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is required to convert the non-listed fund to an ETF. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which was created in 2018 but is not yet exchange-traded, holds a crypto index portfolio comprising Bitcoin ( BTC) , Ether (ETH) , Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ). As of April 1, the fund has more than $600 million in assets under management (AUM) and is only available to accredited investors (entities or individuals with high net worth), according to Grayscale‚Äôs website. The filing follows an Oct. 29 request by NYSE Arca, a US securities exchange, for permission to list the Grayscale index fund.

In December, the SEC greenlighted the first batch of mixed crypto index ETFs .¬†However, the funds ‚Äî sponsored by Hashdex and Fidelity ‚Äî hold only Bitcoin and Ether. They have seen relatively modest inflows since debuting in February. In February, the SEC acknowledged more than a dozen exchange filings related to cryptocurrency ETFs, according to records.

According to industry analysts, crypto index ETFs are a main focus for Wall Street's issuers after ETFs holding BTC and ETH debuted last year. ‚ÄúThe next logical step is index ETFs because indices are efficient for investors ‚Äî just like how people buy the S&P 500 in an ETF.

Ripple ( XRP ) has entered a bear market after dropping over 35% from its January high. It was trading at $2.1564 on Tuesday, just above the crucial support level at $1.9120. XRP declined even after achieving several major milestones during the quarter. The most important Ripple news was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs decision to end its litigation. The conclusion of Ripple‚Äôs five-year legal battle means the company now has a clearer path to making deals with large U.S. firms. According to CEO Brad Garlinghouse , many US companies avoided partnering with Ripple while it was entangled in legal proceedings. Ripple aims to become the leading alternative to SWIFT, the global messaging network that handles over $150 trillion in transactions each year. To reach that goal, it needs to establish partnerships with thousands of banks. XRP also dropped despite Ripple securing money transmitter licenses in New York and Texas. It additionally received authorization to offer financial services in the United Arab Emirates.

Ripple hopes the stablecoin will be widely adopted in decentralized finance and other industries. RLUSD has outpaced larger stablecoins in terms of daily trading volume, surpassing USDS, PayPal USD, and Honey. Further, Ripple has attracted multiple XRP ETF applications from firms like Grayscale, WisdomTree, Canary, and CoinShares. An ETF approval would likely lead to increased inflows from Wall Street investors. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XRP is at risk of a strong bearish breakdown. It has formed a head and shoulders pattern, with the neckline at $1.9117. This pattern is one of the most widely recognized bearish formations in technical analysis. Notably, this neckline aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. XRP is also on the verge of forming a death cross, as the gap between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages continues to narrow. A break below the neckline at $1.9117 would signal further downside, with the next key support level at $1.5370, the 61.8% retracement, which is about 30% below the current level. A drop below that level could push the price toward $1.

The stock exchange made the following statement: The declines in ACT prices have led to some users liquidating their futures positions and other low-market tokens also seeing declines. We are currently conducting further investigations into the causes of the declines in other tokens. So far, we have not identified any accounts that have profited significantly from this event. Since the ACT token supply is currently fully circulating in the secondary market, Binance cannot restrict or interfere with users‚Äô selling behavior. However, rest assured that we will continue to investigate this incident and will provide further updates if there are any new developments. A preliminary investigation found that: Three VIP users sold approximately 514,000 USDT worth of ACT tokens on the Binance spot market, transferred a large amount of ACT to a non-VIP user account, and then sold approximately 540,000 USDT worth of ACT on the Binance spot market. Binance regularly adjusts the leverage levels of all futures pairs based on liquidity, market sentiment, and trading volume. In order to proactively prevent potential fluctuations and risks, we took precautionary measures to reduce the leverage ratio of the ACTUSDT USD‚ìà-M perpetual contract, and no market abnormalities were experienced during the adjustments. Considering the significant market volatility recently and to reduce risks for the protection of users, Binance will continue to adjust the leverage ratios of different pairs according to market conditions. Binance would like to take this opportunity to remind all users to take appropriate risk management measures when trading digital assets. It was claimed that the reason for the decline was that market makers were not given enough time to adapt after Binance changed the limit on low leverage positions, and therefore market makers were liquidated.

Despite the recovery, BTC remains down by almost 5% this week as it struggles to reclaim $85,000, registering a decline after reaching a day high of $84,456. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading just above $83,000, a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. Analysts are divided over BTC‚Äôs immediate price movement with some believing a drop below $80,000 is inevitable, while others predict a recovery and move past $90,000. Bitcoin (BTC) Could Slip Below $80,000 This Week Research firm 10x Research has predicted that Bitcoin could fall below $80,000 this week thanks to growing uncertainty around tariffs and rising inflation. The firm‚Äôs research report cited hotter-than-expected US core Personal Consumption Expenditures data that suggested inflation remains a concern. President Donald Trump‚Äôs inconsistent rhetoric about tariffs has further increased market uncertainty. 10x Research also cited the upcoming US ISM Manufacturing PMI as a potential trigger for further downside in the coming days. If the data is weaker than expected, it could intensify risk aversion among investors and impact the crypto market. Additionally, better-than-expected inflation data could delay any Federal Reserve intervention and delay a market recovery. ‚ÄúTariff Shock and Hot Inflation Data Derail Bitcoin Rally The Bitcoin rebound over the past three weeks has faltered, as hotter-than-expected core PCE data signaled rising inflation‚Äîdriven in part by Trump‚Äôs tariff implementation‚Äî which appears to be weighing on consumer sentiment.‚Äù Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree Strategy (Previously MicroStrategy) has announced the purchase of 22,048 BTC for a staggering $1.9 billion. The purchase was financed with equity sales and a new issue of the company‚Äôs preferred stock. The latest purchase comes after the company purchased $600 million worth of BTC last week. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin with 528,185 BTC , according to an 8-K report released on Monday. Strategy funds its BTC purchase by issuing equity, debt, and preferred stock. The firm has been on a Bitcoin buying spree since October and has more than doubled its holdings since September 30. Strategy sold 3.6 million shares of common stock between March 24 and Sunday through ongoing at-the-market equity offerings, raising $1.2 billion. The company also issued 8.5 million shares of its new 10% Strife preferred stock at $85 each, raising $711 million. Bitcoin Could Replace US Dollar As Global Reserve Currency BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes the US national debt could create a crisis, allowing Bitcoin to replace the US Dollar as the global reserve currency if investors see the asset as a safer alternative. Fink emphasized strong support for Bitcoin and other digital assets, calling them an extraordinary innovation. However, he stated that digital assets like Bitcoin could offset America‚Äôs economic advantage if investors view it as a safer bet than the US Dollar. According to Fink, while the US Dollar has been the world‚Äôs reserve currency for decades, its status could be threatened by a burgeoning national debt. Fink stated, ‚ÄúIf the US doesn't get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.‚Äù Fink also discussed the importance of real-world asset tokenization, stating that it makes investing significantly more democratic. BlackRock is the largest issuer of tokenized real-world assets, with its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity (BUIDL) fund nearing a staggering $2 billion. The asset manager also holds the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, which holds over $39 billion in assets under management (AUM). BlackRock has also launched the iShares Bitcoin ETP in Europe to expand its fund exposure in the region. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis While 10x Research believes BTC could drop below $80,000 this week, Fidelity analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for the next leg of its acceleration phase. According to Zack Wainwright, analyst at Fidelity, BTC‚Äôs acceleration phases are characterized by ‚Äúhigh volatility and high profit.‚Äù The analyst compared it with BTC‚Äôs price action in 2020 when it crossed $20,000. BTC‚Äôs year-to-date return has reported a decline of 11.4%, with the flagship cryptocurrency down almost 25% from its all-time high. However, Wainwright believes the recent post-acceleration phase performance matches BTC‚Äôs average drawdowns compared to previous market cycles. The analyst suggested BTC is still in an acceleration phase but is moving closer to the completion of the cycle. ‚ÄúThe acceleration phase of 2010 - 2011, 2015, and 2017 reached their tops on day 244, 261, 280, respectively, suggesting a slightly more drawn-out phase each cycle.‚Äù BTC slipped below $100,000 in February after the momentum and positivity following Trump‚Äôs election victory and inauguration dissipated. Markets are now wary and anxious thanks to volatility induced by Trump‚Äôs tariffs and fears the US economy could be heading into a recession. However, despite recent struggles, institutions have continued adding BTC to their reserves. The latest is Strategy, which announced the purchase of 22,048 BTC worth $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per coin. Bitcoin miner MARA has also announced plans to sell up to $2 billion in stock to fund BTC acquisition. Japanese firm Metaplanet has also issued 2 billion yen ($13.3 million) in bonds to purchase Bitcoin while GameStop announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering, a part of which could be used to fund Bitcoin acquisition. While institutional investors have positive expectations from BTC , it is difficult to determine the impact of these purchases on the asset's price. According to Wainwright, a key metric to watch is the number of days in a rolling 60-day period when the asset hits a new all-time high. The analyst stated, ‚ÄúBitcoin has typically experienced two major surges within previous Acceleration Phases, with the first instance of this cycle following the election. If a new all-time high is on the horizon, it will have a starting base near $110,000.‚Äù BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, registering an increase of almost 3%, moving past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $86,116. The price surged to an intraday high of $88,839 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $87,523, ultimately registering an increase of almost 2%. BTC lost momentum after reaching this level as it encountered volatility and selling pressure. As a result, the price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell below $87,000 after a marginal decline and settled at $86,942. BTC registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. Source: TradingView However, BTC was back in the red on Friday, registering a substantial drop of over 3%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and settling at $84,422. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a fall of over 2% on Saturday, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $82,704. A marginal decline on Sunday saw BTC settle at $82,404. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $82,511. BTC has rallied during the ongoing session, with the price up over 3%. The flagship cryptocurrency has moved past the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and is currently trading at $85,300. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

These indicators enable market participants to know when it is safe to inject more capital into their portfolio in anticipation of future rallies. According to a Santiment report , the metrics include social trends, key stakeholder accumulation, a drop in Mean Dollar Invested Age, and social dominance fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) signals. When Market Bottom? The crypto community is constantly talking about coins and predicting which direction their prices are heading. Santiment said these social trends are significantly influenced by the momentum that markets have shown over a timeframe, so this makes traders‚Äô decisions emotion-based on most occasions. A slight drop in an asset‚Äôs price‚Äîbitcoin ( BTC ), for instance‚Äîcould trigger a sudden bearish narrative, with social media posts depicting negative sentiment. The opposite is often seen after a sudden spike in a cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. Hence, traders can predict future price movements by paying attention to the vocal majority on social media. While paying attention to social trends, the dominance of positive or negative commentaries could signal a good time to buy or sell. Santiment noted that a high level of fear or missing out (FOMO) would lead to prices topping soon; however, major FUD could lead to great bottoming opportunities. As a result, projects with high levels of negative sentiment present good buying opportunities, as prices often move in the opposite direction of the crowd‚Äôs expectations. Old Coins Returning to Circulation As the crypto community often gets predictions wrong, whales move prices the way they fit due to their large capital, which controls the market. Santiment says traders should watch key stakeholders no matter what asset they are analyzing. The best times to buy are when crypto prices drop, and whale wallets accumulate aggressively. When whales start accumulating, there is often a surge in transactions valued above $100,000 or $1 million, so Santiment insists a spike in large transaction volumes is often a bullish sign. Finally, a decline in the Mean Dollar Invested Age also signals a market bottom. This metric tells the average of the dollars invested in an asset. When this indicator drops, it means that a healthy level of dormant tokens is returning to regular circulation, which could trigger a market rally. Notably, the Mean Dollar Invested Age works in tandem with another metric, Age Consumed, which indicates the number of tokens changing addresses on a certain date multiplied by the last time they moved. A huge spike in Age Consumed helps predict market bottoms.

Since then, the price has been on a decline, leading some investors to consider selling. As the price approaches its all-time low (ATL), many are now exploring where and how to sell their Pi Coins. This shift in sentiment highlights the ongoing volatility of the Pi Network market. The price of Pi Network stands at $0.7118, following a 20% decrease during the past seven days. Over the last month, Pi Network‚Äôs price experienced a substantial 60% reduction. Most token owners eliminated their assets from their portfolios because of this bear market trend. Market participants persist with their lack of enthusiasm because the currency‚Äôs value remains on a downward trend. Market participants are deeply concerned because of token unlock uncertainty which has resulted in a big sell-off. A big reduction in market value resulted in Pi Network‚Äôs loss of $14 billion. The market capitalization reduced dramatically to drop from its original $20 billion figure down to the current value of $4.76 billion. Will the Pi Network price prediction revisit above $1 mark soon? Pi Network currently encounters multiple obstacles while trying to obtain exchange listings. Binance, along with Coinbase, joined the list of exchanges that show no willingness to list the token. Many barriers hinder the market‚Äôs recovery speed thus maintaining potential buyers at bay while generating more worries about the token‚Äôs upcoming performance. How to Sell Pi Coin as Pi Network Price Approaches ATL The cryptocurrency exchange platforms Gate.io, along with Bitget, OKX, and MEXC Global, currently support the sale and purchase of Pi Coin. Users can exchange Pi coins through various currency combinations available on these platforms. The Pair trading between Pi Coin and USDT has produced high trading volumes on the Gate.io exchange. The mainnet launch from Pi Network will make Pi Coin accessible on open public trading exchanges. Before selling Pi Coin, you need to move your mined coins from the Pi Network app into a suitable wallet. The selection of wallets available to Pi Network users depends on the blockchain technology the network implements along with possible provisions built-in by Pi Network itself. Users can start selling their Pi Coins after transferring them to compatible wallets so they can use exchanges that support trading of Pi Coin. When Pi Coin gets listed by mainstream exchanges including Binance and Kraken alongside Coinbase users will gain access to buying other cryptocurrencies and fiat currency. You can sell Pi Coin prices by sending tokens to appropriate wallets and exchanging them through supported trading platforms.

Tuberville, the sitting Senator since 2021, spotlighted his ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äôs Act,‚Äù a policy that would allow Americans to invest their retirement funds in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other altcoins . Tuberville introduced his act in 2022 and 2023 but it failed to make any notable progress. He hopes that now with the backing of President Donald Trump his vision can become a reality. ‚ÄúPresident Trump has become the crypto president and we want to help him with this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis would be something good for everybody‚Ä¶ diversify.

After a strong bullish run, XRP has hit a rough patch, with technical indicators suggesting the possibility of further declines. But what‚Äôs next for XRP‚Äôs price, and how low could it go? An analyst focused on Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and revealed that XRP experienced what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù‚Äîa bearish indicator where the short-term moving average dips below the long-term moving average. This typically means the start of a downtrend, and XRP‚Äôs price responded accordingly, falling 37% since the signal, with the current dip standing at around 31%. This isn‚Äôt the first time XRP has faced such a critical juncture. Back in February 2018, after a similar death cross, XRP‚Äôs price plummeted by a staggering 90%, dragging it from over $3 to below $0.30. Source: Stephiscrypto In May 2021, the coin dropped 53% following another bearish crossover, and by November of the same year, it saw another 76% decline. These patterns suggest that death crosses aren‚Äôt just fleeting signals‚Äîthey often mark the beginning of prolonged bearish phases. So, where does that leave XRP now? If history repeats itself, XRP could experience another significant drop. A 53% decline from its current price would take it down to around $1.40. If the downturn mirrors the severity of the 2021 drop, we could be looking at a price around $0.71. In the worst-case scenario, if XRP follows the trajectory of the 2018 crash, the price could fall below $0.30. However, it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. If XRP holds above important support levels like $2, it could prevent a deeper decline. But if that level breaks, the next support could be much lower, potentially opening the door to the worst-case scenario. Many experts believe XRP is nearing a bottom, supported by strong whale accumulation and signs that the market may have overreacted to recent price movements. The question remains: Will XRP bounce back like it has in the past, or is this the start of a deeper correction? The answer lies in how the market reacts in the coming weeks.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 17:13:07

Not in the ‚Äúwe forgot something‚Äù sense, but in the core architectural sense. It doesn‚Äôt have a real memory layer. Blockchains today don‚Äôt look completely alien compared to traditional computers, but a core foundational aspect of legacy computing is still missing: A memory layer built for decentralization that will support the next iteration of the internet. Muriel MeÃÅdard is a speaker at Consensus 2025 May 14-16. Register to get your ticket here. After World War II, John von Neumann laid out the architecture for modern computers . Every computer needs input and output, a CPU for control and arithmetic, and memory to store the latest version data, along with a ‚Äúbus‚Äù to retrieve and update that data in the memory. Commonly known as RAM, this architecture has been the foundation of computing for decades. At its core, Web3 is a decentralized computer ‚Äî a ‚Äúworld computer.‚Äù At the higher layers, it‚Äôs fairly recognizable: operating systems (EVM, SVM) running on thousands of decentralized nodes, powering decentralized applications and protocols. But, when you dig deeper, something‚Äôs missing. The memory layer essential for storing, accessing and updating short-term and long term data, doesn‚Äôt look like the memory bus or memory unit von Neumann envisioned. Instead, it's a mashup of different best-effort approaches to achieve this purpose, and the results are overall messy, inefficient and hard to navigate. Here‚Äôs the problem: if we‚Äôre going to build a world computer that‚Äôs fundamentally different from the von Neumann model, there better be a really good reason to do so. As of right now, Web3‚Äôs memory layer isn‚Äôt just different, it‚Äôs convoluted and inefficient. Transactions are slow. Storage is sluggish and costly. Scaling for mass adoption with this current approach is nigh impossible. And, that‚Äôs not what decentralization was supposed to be about. But there is another way. A lot of people in this space are trying their best to work around this limitation and we're at a point now where the current workaround solutions just cannot keep up. This is where using algebraic coding, which makes use of equations to represent data for efficiency, resilience and flexibility, comes in. The core problem is this: how do we implement decentralized code for Web3? A new memory infrastructure This is why I took the leap from academia where I held the role of MIT NEC Chair and Professor of Software Science and Engineering to dedicate myself and a team of experts in advancing high-performance memory for Web3. I saw something bigger: the potential to redefine how we think about computing in a decentralized world. My team at Optimum is creating decentralized memory that works like a dedicated computer. Our approach is powered by Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), a technology developed in my MIT lab over nearly two decades. It‚Äôs a proven data coding method that maximizes throughput and resilience in high-reliability networks from industrial systems to the internet. Data coding is the process of converting information from one format to another for efficient storage, transmission or processing. Data coding has been around for decades and there are many iterations of it in use in networks today. RLNC is the modern approach to data coding built specifically for decentralized computing. This scheme transforms data into packets for transmission across a network of nodes, ensuring high speed and efficiency. With multiple engineering awards from top global institutions, more than 80 patents, and numerous real-world deployments, RLNC is no longer just a theory. RLNC has garnered significant recognition, including the 2009 IEEE Communications Society and Information Theory Society Joint Paper Award for the work ""A Random Linear Network Coding Approach to Multicast."" RLNC's impact was acknowledged with the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award in 2022. RLNC is now ready for decentralized systems, enabling faster data propagation, efficient storage, and real-time access, making it a key solution for Web3‚Äôs scalability and efficiency challenges. Why this matters Let‚Äôs take a step back. Why does all of this matter? Because we need memory for the world computer that‚Äôs not just decentralized but also efficient, scalable and reliable. Currently, blockchains rely on best-effort, ad hoc solutions that achieve partially what memory in high-performance computing does. What they lack is a unified memory layer that encompasses both the memory bus for data propagation and the RAM for data storage and access. The bus part of the computer should not become the bottleneck, as it does now. Let me explain. ‚ÄúGossip‚Äù is the common method for data propagation in blockchain networks. It is a peer-to-peer communication protocol in which nodes exchange information with random peers to spread data across the network. In its current implementation, it struggles at scale. Imagine you need 10 pieces of information from neighbors who repeat what they‚Äôve heard. As you speak to them, at first you get new information. But as you approach nine out of 10, the chance of hearing something new from a neighbor drops, making the final piece of information the hardest to get. Chances are 90% that the next thing you hear is something you already know. This is how blockchain gossip works today ‚Äî efficient early on, but redundant and slow when trying to complete the information sharing. You would have to be extremely lucky to get something new every time. With RLNC, we get around the core scalability issue in current gossip. RLNC works as though you managed to get extremely lucky, so every time you hear info, it just happens to be info that is new to you. That means much greater throughput and much lower latency. This RLNC-powered gossip is our first product, which validators can implement through a simple API call to optimize data propagation for their nodes. Let us now examine the memory part. It helps to think of memory as dynamic storage, like RAM in a computer or, for that matter, our closet. Decentralized RAM should mimic a closet; it should be structured, reliable, and consistent. A piece of data is either there or not, no half-bits, no missing sleeves. That‚Äôs atomicity. Items stay in the order they were placed ‚Äî you might see an older version, but never a wrong one. That‚Äôs consistency. And, unless moved, everything stays put; data doesn‚Äôt disappear. That‚Äôs durability. Instead of the closet, what do we have? Mempools are not something we keep around in computers, so why do we do that in Web3? The main reason is that there is not a proper memory layer. If we think of data management in blockchains as managing clothes in our closet, a mempool is like having a pile of laundry on the floor, where you are not sure what is in there and you need to rummage. Current delays in transaction processing can be extremely high for any single chain. Citing Ethereum as an example, it takes two epochs or 12.8 minutes to finalize any single transaction. Without decentralized RAM, Web3 relies on mempools, where transactions sit until they‚Äôre processed, resulting in delays, congestion and unpredictability. Full nodes store everything, bloating the system and making retrieval complex and costly. In computers, the RAM keeps what is currently needed, while less-used data moves to cold storage, maybe in the cloud or on disk. Full nodes are like a closet with all the clothes you ever wore (from everything you‚Äôve ever worn as a baby until now). This is not something we do on our computers, but they exist in Web3 because storage and read/write access aren‚Äôt optimized. With RLNC, we create decentralized RAM (deRAM) for timely, updateable state in a way that is economical, resilient and scalable. DeRAM and data propagation powered by RLNC can solve Web3‚Äôs biggest bottlenecks by making memory faster, more efficient, and more scalable. It optimizes data propagation, reduces storage bloat, and enables real-time access without compromising decentralization. It‚Äôs long been a key missing piece in the world computer, but not for long.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-01 17:14:40

Kaspa and Hyperliquid are showing remarkable resilience, capturing the attention of investors. What factors are driving the unexpected surge of KAS and HYPE today? Discover the key elements propelling these cryptocurrencies forward amidst widespread decline. Kaspa Copes with Sharp Price Declines and Key Technical Levels Kaspa experienced a 14% drop over the past month and a more than 50% decline in the last six months. A one-week slowdown of 13% underscores consistent selling pressure throughout these periods. The data points reveal a coin moving away from earlier higher price levels, reflecting a challenging market sentiment that has persisted over time. Currently, Kaspa tests key levels with support at $0.03 and resistance near $0.11, while a secondary barrier sits at $0.15. Bearish signals dominate, given weak momentum indicators and an RSI around 40. The trend remains unclear, suggesting traders could look to buy on dips near support and sell as the price approaches resistance levels. Hyperliquid Swings: From Monthly Slide to Half-Year Rally Last month, Hyperliquid dropped nearly 30%, contrasting with a rally of about 38% over the past six months. This price action highlights a short-term setback amid a longer-term recovery. Recent trading sessions revealed volatile swings, as the coin faced challenges in the near term before regaining some momentum in the medium term. Overall, despite experiencing a turbulent monthly performance, the coin managed to recover over time. Currently, the coin trades between approximately $9.68 and $18.69. A key support level is near $6.38, with immediate resistance around $24.40 and a secondary resistance at $33.41. Indicators show a mild bearish sentiment, with negative momentum and an RSI close to mid-level. Traders may consider entering long positions near support while devising exit strategies as prices approach resistance. Conclusion Despite the broader market decline, KAS and HYPE have shown resilience. Their unique features and strong community support are key factors in their recent performance. Investors are taking note of their potential for growth. These coins have managed to attract interest and perform well even as the market faces challenges. This highlights their strength and appeal in the current climate. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Or snagged Ethereum when it was just a few bucks? The truth is, finding the next big crypto before it explodes is tough‚Äîbut not impossible. Right now, three projects are standing out: Qubetics, Internet Computer, and Injective. Each is tackling different corners of blockchain innovation, from Web3 interoperability to AI-powered marketplaces and DeFi domination. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äînot all crypto projects are built to last. The ones that stick around solve real problems and create massive opportunities for early buyers. So, the question is: Is Qubetics the best crypto to buy today before it skyrockets? Is Internet Computer‚Äôs Web3 vision a game-changer? And is Injective about to dominate DeFi? Let‚Äôs break it all down. Qubetics‚ÄîThe Web3 Aggregator That‚Äôs About to Change Everything Imagine a blockchain that connects all the best features of Web3, making it easier, faster, and smarter for businesses and individuals to transact, build dApps, and protect their privacy online. That‚Äôs Qubetics. Unlike traditional blockchains that operate in isolation, Qubetics acts as a Web3 aggregator, seamlessly integrating multiple blockchains into one interconnected system. Online privacy is getting worse every day. Centralized VPN services claim to keep your data secure, but many secretly log user activity, store personal information, and even sell data to third parties. Qubetics‚Äô Decentralized VPN (dVPN) flips the script, offering a true privacy-first solution built entirely on blockchain technology. hink of it this way: Instead of relying on a single company to route your internet traffic, Qubetics‚Äô dVPN spreads it across a decentralized network of nodes. This means: No central servers storing your data‚Äîever. No logs, no tracking, no censorship‚Äîfull anonymity. Better speeds and reliability since it‚Äôs powered by a distributed network. Who Needs a dVPN? Pretty Much Everyone. Remote Workers & Digital Nomads: Working from different countries? Bypass government censorship and access your favorite sites anywhere in the world. Crypto Traders & Web3 Users: Protect your transactions, wallets, and sensitive data from prying eyes. No more targeted hacks. Journalists & Activists: Keep your communication safe in regions where privacy isn‚Äôt just a luxury‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. Everyday Internet Users: Because who actually trusts Google, Facebook, or your ISP with your data? With governments cracking down on internet freedoms and corporations monetizing every click, Qubetics‚Äô dVPN is a must-have tool for the Web3 era. Qubetics Presale‚ÄîTime is Running Out Now, here‚Äôs where things get crazy exciting. The Qubetics presale is moving at lightning speed, currently in its 28th stage, priced at $0.1430 per $TICS token. Over 504 million tokens have already been snapped up by more than 23,900 holders, pushing the total presale tally past $15.5 million. And here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîeach presale stage lasts only 7 days. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the price jumps 10% higher, meaning the longer you wait, the more you pay. But that‚Äôs just the beginning: $TICS at $1 post-presale ‚Üí 599.21% ROI $TICS at $5 post-presale ‚Üí 3,396.06% ROI $TICS at $10 after mainnet launch ‚Üí 6,892.12% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch ‚Üí 10,388.18% ROI That means if you invested just $1,000 today, and $TICS hits $5, your investment could be worth over $33,000. If it reaches $15, you‚Äôre sitting on a $103,000+ bag. Internet Computer‚ÄîThe Web3 Future Is Already Here The promise of Web3 is exciting‚Äîdecentralized apps, censorship resistance, and full control over data. But let‚Äôs be real: Web3 is still clunky. Most dApps rely on centralized cloud services like AWS, which completely defeats the point. That‚Äôs where Internet Computer (ICP) comes in. Internet Computer isn‚Äôt just another blockchain. It‚Äôs a full-scale decentralized internet, letting developers build dApps and smart contracts that run entirely on blockchain-based infrastructure‚Äîno Amazon, no Google, no corporate overlords. Think about how the modern web works: Social media platforms own your data, cloud providers control your hosting, and Big Tech decides who gets access to what. ICP removes these bottlenecks, offering a self-sufficient, censorship-resistant alternative to the traditional internet. And let‚Äôs not forget‚ÄîICP has one of the most advanced blockchain architectures out there, enabling speeds that rival traditional internet services while keeping costs low. If the world truly moves toward a decentralized internet, ICP will be leading the charge. Injective‚ÄîThe Future of DeFi is Here DeFi has come a long way, but it‚Äôs still riddled with high fees, slow transactions, and security risks. Enter Injective (INJ)‚Äîa next-generation DeFi blockchain designed to fix everything holding decentralized finance back. Injective isn‚Äôt just another Ethereum competitor. It‚Äôs a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain for trading, lending, and financial dApps, offering zero gas fees, ultra-fast transactions, and full interoperability across multiple chains. Instant finality‚ÄîNo more waiting for confirmations. Transactions settle instantly. On-chain order books‚ÄîUnlike centralized exchanges, Injective‚Äôs DEX (decentralized exchange) operates fully on-chain, making it transparent and tamper-proof. Interoperability with Ethereum, Solana, and Cosmos‚ÄîUsers can trade assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly. With major partnerships and a growing ecosystem of DeFi applications, Injective is quickly becoming a key player in on-chain trading, derivatives, and synthetic assets. The days of relying on centralized exchanges may be numbered, and Injective is leading the charge toward a fully decentralized trading future. Final Verdict‚ÄîWhich Crypto Should You Grab First? The crypto market is heating up, and the window of opportunity is closing fast. All three projects‚ÄîQubetics, Internet Computer, and Injective‚Äîare pushing the boundaries of Web3, DeFi, and blockchain-based privacy. But if you‚Äôre looking for the best crypto to buy today with the biggest upside, Qubetics stands out as the strongest play. Its presale is selling out fast, its decentralized VPN is a real-world solution that people actually need, and analysts are calling for an insane 6,892% ROI post-mainnet. With ICP revolutionizing Web3 and Injective reshaping DeFi, the future of blockchain looks brighter than ever. But if you want to lock in gains before the next big breakout, joining the Qubetics crypto presale now could be the smartest move you make all year. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. How do I join the Qubetics presale? Joining the Qubetics presale is easy. Just head to the official Qubetics website, connect your Web3 wallet, and grab $TICS tokens before the next 10% price increase. With each presale stage lasting only 7 days, the sooner you get in, the better. 2. What makes Qubetics‚Äô decentralized VPN better than traditional VPNs? Unlike centralized VPNs that log data, track usage, and can be blocked, Qubetics‚Äô dVPN is fully decentralized, meaning no central authority can control or censor your internet access. It provides true anonymity, enhanced security, and better speeds by leveraging a blockchain-powered node network. 3. How high can $TICS go after the presale? Analysts are eyeing a potential 10,388% ROI post-mainnet, with price targets of $5, $10, and even $15+ after launch. Considering the $15.5M+ already raised and growing demand for Web3 privacy solutions, Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the biggest movers of 2025.

Previously really roughed up crypto majors like ether (ETH), dogecoin (DOGE) and cardano (ADA) had put in gains of roughly twice that amount.

Speaking to Business Insider , executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets Raj Dhamodharan explained that Mastercard wants to make it easy for money to ‚Äúflow between the two worlds,‚Äù traditional finance and decentralised finance. According to Dhamodharan, the market currently lacks a ‚Äúfully compliant framework and consumer experience offered on chain,‚Äù something that mirrors the simplicity of using widely popular apps like Venmo or Zelle. Rivaling traditional alternatives Mastercard‚Äôs answer to filling this void is its Multi-Token Network , a blockchain-powered infrastructure launched in 2023 that enables banks and financial institutions to access and build on-chain solutions securely. One key function of the network is its round-the-clock settlement capability. In November 2024, Mastercard integrated the system with JPMorgan‚Äôs blockchain unit to streamline cross-border transactions, a process that often takes days under traditional infrastructure. The company has teamed up with major institutions like JPMorgan and Standard Chartered alongside blockchain platforms such as JPMorgan‚Äôs Onyx, Ethereum, and fintech partners like Ondo Finance to explore real-world applications such as cross-border payments, tokenized deposits, and carbon credit transactions. On the consumer side, Mastercard has introduced over 100 crypto-focused card programmes around the world. These include credit, prepaid, and rewards cards where users are paid in cryptocurrencies instead of cashback. With 3.5 billion cardholders globally, Dhamodharan believes that ‚Äúcapital and spending power from the consumer side‚Äù will be essential to drive the success of digital assets. Regulatory clarity is supporting innovation Dhamodharan stressed that many traditional financial players are increasingly curious about the space, but they‚Äôve been held back by regulatory uncertainty and fragmented infrastructure. With clearer rules now emerging, particularly in the US, he expects more institutions to step in. Still, adoption won‚Äôt happen overnight. He stressed the need for strong partnerships, technical groundwork, and regulatory backing. As previously covered by Invezz on multiple occasions, the company has been investing heavily in these areas, from filing over 250 blockchain-related patents since 2015 to backing more than 40 blockchain startups and expanding its internal crypto and digital asset teams. ‚ÄúMastercard has made a sizable bet on this,‚Äù said Dhamodharan, adding that it‚Äôs a fast-moving and dynamic time to be in crypto. In comments to Invezz, Komodo CTO Kadan Stadelmann called Mastercard‚Äôs crypto Venmo competitor ‚Äúanother example‚Äù of how fast fintech is evolving. While blockchain native startups got an early lead in online payments, he noted that big players like Mastercard are now ‚Äúcatching up‚Äù fast. The intention of MasterCard‚Äôs app is to increase adoption so that the payments company can profit from the new and exciting sector. They will also leverage the lessons they learn on future projects, including in the realms of stablecoins, decentralised finance, central bank digital currencies, and more. Mastercard‚Äôs upcoming platform will face competition from several crypto-native players already active in the space , offering digital wallets, crypto payment gateways, or peer-to-peer transaction features that bridge fiat and blockchain networks.

Eric Trump is part of the Trump-family backed World Liberty Financial, a crypto project he teased in August 2024 ahead if its launch. World Liberty Financial has since bet on multiple altcoins, including Ethereum ( ETH ), which gained after Eric‚Äôs bullish comments in early February. Meanwhile, Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The president also held the first ever crypto summit at the White House in March.

Find Out More,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/has-doge-whale-started-a-bull-run-after-buying-big-into-unknown-meme-panshibi-shibi-presale-find-out-more,"Most of the memes are trading in reverse already, but it's worse for Dogecoin, as news updates and Bitcoin's price movements have forced the DOGE price into further decline. More Dogecoin traders are selling out their tokens to start investing in newer, more viable projects. The Panshibi meme coin is one of the new tokens with massive potential for a spike this year. SHIBI coins are already quite the sensation, thanks to the presale, and everyone wants some now that they know just how much profits they can make from Panshibi investments. Watch out for more on the new meme project. Why Is the Dogecoin Price Down? The meme sector started with Dogecoin's launch in 2013, when the token was only one for traders to laugh with. Dogecoin supplied memes only for laughs and that was how the token built its following. Now, the objectives have shifted, as Dogecoin seems a lot more concerned with the price movements and rallies instead of meme creation. The lack of utility from the Dogecoin token also makes it quite difficult for a rally to spring up randomly. In the same vein, the Dogecoin price closely follows Bitcoin's price movements, meaning that a DOGE price spike can only come after Bitcoin surges. Now that Bitcoin is dealing with resistance at the $90,000 mark, the Dogecoin price is trading below its $0.21 support level. DOGE is trading at $0.1636, with 7.4% weekly losses in tow. Where Is the Dogecoin Price Headed? Dogecoin's latest resistance levels appeared after the token slumped from its seven-day peak at $0.2045 on Wednesday. The DOGE token has been slipping to further lows ever since, and the most immediate resistance level is at $0.175. For now, it's up to the bulls to save the Dogecoin price from falling even lower to $0.15. However, the DOGE whales will need convincing to stay and sway the token price, as some of them are already purchasing tokens on other more vibrant meme projects. Panshibi is seeing an influx of other meme coin traders on its presale website as the revenue only keeps rising. With Elon Musk‚Äôs statement that the US government won‚Äôt be using Dogecoin in its Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE), there's no hype in sight for the pioneer meme coin. Panshibi (SHIBI) could be the only hope for meme traders. Panshibi: Community at the Center of the Ecosystem Every now and again, a meme coin launches with apparently no utilities to offer users and manages to strike a great presale/launch. Here we have a new meme coin that is offering memes and a fun time as well as passive income streams for its users. The tokenomics on Panshibi are suggestive of a transparent, reliable blockchain, as the Devs are planning to have about 75% of the 2 billion tokens in the hands of the community. There's1.2 billion tokens assigned to the ongoing presale, and an extra 15% of the total supply will go to the rewards. More than that, there's staking on Panshibi , where users deposit their tokens to strengthen the network and provide liquidity for operations on the blockchain. The staking rewards are on par with the best in the crypto-verse‚Äìand that‚Äôs probably why investors are interested. And as for fun time, Panshibi sports an AI-enhanced virtual world, one with avatars for the users and a mimic of the natural environment in Asia. Users can complete solo quests for SHIBI coin rewards at their own pace. On the SHIBI platform, there is something for everyone. Join the presale today. Get your SHIBI tokens today! The SHIBI coins are the rave in the meme coin space now, and even Dogecoin traders want a bit of Panshibi in their portfolios. The presale offers SHIBI coins at $0.005 for now, and that's about 400% in presale ROI, but only if you invest now. The target is the post-launch rally, tipped to be about 100x. That's the one everyone is hunting for.

Despite the ongoing bearish trend, the analyst believes historical market patterns suggest a significant price recovery within the next few months. Two-Peak Pattern in Bull Runs According to EGRAG , XRP typically experiences two major price surges within a single bull market. The first peak is often followed by a period of correction before the asset rallies again to a higher level. Drawing from past market cycles, he argues that the current downturn is consistent with the token‚Äôs historical behavior and that a second peak could still emerge. #XRP ‚Äì 90 to 120 Days Until ATH! The RSI chart below shows important historical patterns! I was one of the first to notice that #XRP usually has two peaks during #Bull Runs. Reviewing past cycles, we see that in 2021, the second peak occurred after 90 days, while in 2017,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/MgPpbwnmS3 ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 28, 2025 Currently, the asset is trading just above the $2 mark, facing strong resistance after its drop from $3.4 in January. This decline mirrors similar corrections seen in previous bull cycles before the cryptocurrency surged to new highs. EGRAG suggests that the present market conditions align with past patterns, reinforcing the possibility of another rally. Analyzing Token‚Äôs RSI Trends To determine when XRP might reach a second peak, EGRAG examined the asset‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the monthly chart. The RSI measures price momentum and often signals trend reversals. In past bull runs, the token‚Äôs RSI followed a distinct pattern: an initial spike during the first peak, followed by a period of decline before another surge aligned with the second peak. This pattern was evident in both the 2017 and 2021 market cycles. In 2017, XRP‚Äôs RSI climbed to 95 when the price hit $0.3988 in June. Following a correction, the RSI dropped to 66 by September, remaining in this range for about three months before the price surged to $3.8 in January 2018‚Äîroughly 91 days later. In 2021, XRP first peaked at $0.79 in November 2020, with its RSI reaching 65. However, a market downturn in December, compounded by the SEC lawsuit against Ripple, caused the RSI to drop to 47.24. Despite this setback, the token eventually climbed to $1.96 in April 2021, about 120 days after its initial peak. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Projected Timeline for XRP‚Äôs Second Peak EGRAG‚Äôs latest analysis indicates that XRP‚Äôs RSI has once again dropped to the 66 range, similar to what occurred in 2017. When it reached $3.4 in January 2025, the RSI spiked to 84 before declining. Based on historical trends, the analyst anticipates that XRP could remain in a consolidation phase for 90 to 120 days before rallying again. This suggests that a second peak may occur between May and June 2025. Although the analyst did not specify a target price for this anticipated peak in his latest analysis, he previously speculated that XRP could eventually reach $27. This projection was based on a separate market pattern he referred to as the ‚ÄúKangaroo phase.‚Äù Current Market Outlook At present, the token is priced at approximately $2.07, reflecting a 3% decline for March. Market analysts, including Dom, have noted that the $2.2 price level, which previously acted as a support zone, has now become a resistance point. Until XRP reclaims this level as support, the overall market structure remains bearish. While uncertainty persists in the short term, historical data suggest that XRP‚Äôs past performance could provide valuable insights into its future trajectory. If the pattern identified by EGRAG holds, the asset could be on track for another surge within the coming months.

42762625,https://thecoinrise.com/trump-family-now-own-majority-of-world-liberty-financial-report/,1743528440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/42762625.jpeg,Trump Family Now Own Majority of World Liberty Financial: Report,https://thecoinrise.com/trump-family-now-own-majority-of-world-liberty-financial-report/,"The Trump family has gained a major share of World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and revenue from token sales and future fees in a new development. This has led to talks that President Donald Trump‚Äôs family has taken over the blockchain-based financial project. This change was first noticed in a review of the company‚Äôs website, reported by Reuters on March 31. The report revealed that the company‚Äôs original co-founders, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro, were removed from their leadership positions. They are reportedly replaced by an organization in which the Trump family holds a majority stake. This marks a major shift in WLFI‚Äôs ownership and leadership. How the Trump Family Took Over World Liberty Financial According to Reuter‚Äôs report, the Trump family gained control of WLFI through their company, DT Marks DeFi LLC. In January 2025, this company acquired a 60% share in WLFI through a new holding company called WLF Holdco LLC. Under this new structure, the Trump family now controls WLFI‚Äôs finances, with the majority of control over the platform and its revenue. They are entitled to 60% of the company‚Äôs operating profits and 75% of the revenue from token sales. According to Reuters, the Trump family is expected to earn about $400 million from the funds raised. Meanwhile, after the co-founders take their share, only 5% of the total $550 million raised is left for platform development. This has raised concerns about whether World Liberty Financial is truly focused on building a decentralized financial system or has become a profit-driven venture for its new owners. Growing Concerns Over WLFI‚Äôs Decentralization WLFI was launched in 2024 to offer blockchain-based financial services and cut out traditional banks. The platform raised funds by selling its governance token, WLFI, which lets holders vote on key decisions. One of its major investors is Tron founder Justin Sun, who contributed $75 million to the project. Although WLFI was designed to support decentralized finance (DeFi), its new leadership structure raises questions. Critics believe the Trump family‚Äôs political ties could lead to conflicts of interest, making the platform less open to outside investors. Some argue that WLFI is now too centralized, contradicting the original DeFi vision. The Trump Family‚Äôs Expanding Crypto Interests The Trump family‚Äôs growing involvement in cryptocurrency does not stop with WLFI. On March 31, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump launched American Bitcoin, a mining company. The Trump brothers secured a partnership with crypto infrastructure firm Hut 8, a well-known Bitcoin mining company. Hut 8 owns 80% of American Bitcoin, while Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump own the remaining 20%. This move signals the Trump family‚Äôs deeper involvement in the crypto industry, suggesting they see blockchain and crypto assets as key financial opportunities.

It brings together several elements of the entertainment world, including the relative crypto industry. The power of blockchain technology has propelled into the gaming world and has led us to hundreds of gaming tokens that are now available for players to invest in. Let's take a closer look at five gaming tokens that are currently causing a stir and which value could hit a rise in 2025. 1. Beam (BEAM) You may think that gaming tokens are all about the excitement and flashiness, but BEAM‚Äôs more about privacy for its users. The token uses a privacy-centric blockchain, which is designed to carry out secure and confidential transactions. This comes following an increasing demand for data protection within burgeoning in-game economies and calls for robust encryption. The BEAM platform features impressive technology, which is easy-to-learn for anyone with a fair bit of developing knowledge, However, BEAM‚Äôs widespread adoption may be held back due to the token‚Äôs relatively low market visibility and liquidity, which are dwarfed by some of the market caps of cryptocurrencies . Beginners may find some of the tech a little confusing, too. 2. Flow (FLOW) Flow is a blockchain built to handle the heavy traffic of online games and digital collectibles, like the famous NBA Top Shot moments . It‚Äôs designed to let lots of people use it at the same time, without slowing things down. Developers find it easy to work with, and even people new to crypto can get started without too much trouble. The idea is to make online gaming and collecting smoother and faster. The Flow token is, of course, what people use to buy, sell, and participate in the platform. However, Flow isn't the only player in this space; it has to compete with well-known options like Ethereum and Solana. Whether or not it really takes off while depending a lot on the success of the big projects using it, and like any crypto, its value can go up and down. Some people also have questions about how decentralized it really is. That said, some experts are saying that the token‚Äôs value has bottomed out over the last year and could be about to go up again. 3. Decentraland (MANA) MANA-powered Decentraland is a blockchain-based virtual world on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2017, Decentraland serves as a platform for multiplayer game creation using the intuitive Decentraland Builder. This offers a vast library of 3D items for building and creating in-game tokens, which you can then trade freely with other players in the form ofvirtual land parcels. The virtual world nature of Decentraland allows for many different game designs, and some of those designs may include mini-games or discovery systems. These games use mechanics like a Random Number Generator RNG ensuring that outcomes are unpredictable and purely based on chance, like what you get in free slots games. The MANA token¬¥s value has dipped dramatically over the past year, but there are signs that it is now stabilizing and could be about to take off again. 4. Sandbox (SAND) The Sandbox: ditch the landlord, own your digital empire. Sandbox has soared in popularity in recent years, giving players the chance to build their own world inside this decentralized metaverse. SAND is the utility token made to emerge from this. It¬¥s a golden ticket that unlocks trading, staking, and even a democratic manner in whichthe Sandbox metaverse evolves. Users get creator-friendly tools that let them craft their own virtual assets with ease. And it‚Äôs not just players: big brands, celebrities, and artists are jumping in, fuelling the hype and expanding its reach. The only downside may be the fees. Ethereum's gas fees can mount up with SAND, so anyone getting involved should account for these. Still, SAND‚Äôs popularity means that it‚Äôs currently one of the top gaming tokens around. 5. Enjin (ENJ) Enjin is approaching an exciting new frontier in crypto gaming with the Ethereum-based ERC-1155 token standard. Developers acquire this blockchain-based gaming coin and mint it into in-game items, so that players can earn $ENJ through gameplay and without the need to visit traditional cryptocurrency exchanges . The Enjin Marketplace is already well established place, where users trade ERC-1155 digital assets, all backed by ENJ tokens. In terms of development, the token is also attractive to some of the brightest minds in the industry, drawn in by the easy token creation and integration tools. Keep an eye on this token which is the ‚ÄúEnjin‚Äù room of the progressing gaming token industry. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With Phase‚ÄÇ4 at an end, excitement builds for a 20% price jump to $0.03 in the next stage. Meanwhile, its exchange listing target of $0.06 has now secured early‚ÄÇbackers an impressive 140% ROI, with forecasts indicating even bolder post-launch gains toward $1.50-$3.50 by late 2025. The combination of‚ÄÇaccessibility and explosive potential makes MUTM an anomalous asset below $0.05 with billion-dollar relevance. Mutuum Finance‚ÄÇPresale Momentum Gathers Pace Thanks to its structured presale model, investors are competing to grab its‚ÄÇtokens now at a price which will be raising at each phase until Phase 4 ends. The now-$0.025 entry point provides‚ÄÇa last opportunity ahead of the subsequent stage boosting prices by 20%, with this repeating across 11 brackets until $0.06 launch. Tokenomics suggests 140% profits for buyers at launch,‚ÄÇwith post-exchange forecasts offering life-changing returns. If‚ÄÇit even reaches $1.50 (a modest target among bullish analysts), a $1,000 investment today would swell to $60,000. That kind of arithmetic accounts for why a high percentage of phase 4 allocations have already been made. Certik is also finalizing technical audits to strengthen investor confidence further. Channels and social media will report the outcomes‚ÄÇonce finalized, which might spark another demand increase. The team‚Äôs clarity of vision and sound security protocol clearly stand opposed to just another high-flying flock of coins‚ÄÇweighted more heavily on hype than fact, drawing parallels to the operational integrity of industry-leading assets BNB. As MUTM rises, ADA struggles against bearish‚ÄÇpressure, its price hovering around $0.69 after a 6% dip. Sell pressure is feeding itself, analysts warn, with a possible drop‚ÄÇto $0.64 if the trend continues in tandem with the woes of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And while BNB attracts risk-averse holders, MUTM targets asymmetric opportunity‚ÄÇseekers‚Äîa dynamic that‚Äôs contributing to the speed of its presale. The Last Phase 4 Joining Call Mutuum Finance is only getting newer‚ÄÇby the minute, with some funding rounds in MUTM Phase 4 now rapidly drying out! The project‚Äôs buy-and-distribute mechanism channels revenue generated on the platform back into token buybacks, providing continued buying pressure well after launch. When combined‚ÄÇwith mtTokens‚Äîinterest-bearing deposit certificates‚Äîthe MUTM ecosystem encourages long-term holding, lessening sell pressure and magnifying scarcity. The early purchasers not only enjoy immediate paper profits but also establish the best yields to compound their‚ÄÇfuture earnings from staking and liquidity mining. With the completion of Certik‚Äôs audit,‚ÄÇthere is less time left to buy below $0.03. Market‚ÄÇmonitors compare MUTM‚Äôs trajectory with the initial days of Binance Coin, where early adopters realized exponential returns. Billions budgeted for ADA and‚ÄÇBNB set precedent, which makes Mutuum Finance‚Äôs fusion of DeFi utility and thoughtful tokenomics a manifestation of a similar fate‚Äîbut only for those acting before the Phase 4 curtain draws. Secure Your Position Ahead of Price‚ÄÇChanges MUTM offers an inclusive value proposition amid a historically expensive sector‚ÄÇand presale mechanism designed to provide natural protection against wider market shocks. MUTM, on the other hand, rides an upward trajectory tied to audited protocols and a use case beyond speculation,‚ÄÇas established tokens reflexively ebb and flow. Head to Mutuum Finance‚Äôs‚ÄÇofficial channels to get in on Phase 4 ahead of price and likely billion-dollar maker opportunity goes.

Downing Street also said it ‚Äúreserves the right‚Äù to respond to protect the UK‚Äôs national interest. The president had announced 25% levies on cars, steel and aluminum imports, and is expected to impose further tariffs on countries with which the U.S. has a trade imbalance or those he regards as imposing unfair taxes or regulation. The U.S. government has singled out VAT as an example of an unfair tax, but Downing Street has rejected the characterization. UK ministers have also been pressured to drop the 2% digital services tax which hits big U.S. tech firms such as Meta, Google, and Amazon. UK ministers prepare for Trump tariffs on Wednesday Downing Street revealed that it expects the UK to be hit by more tariffs when Donald Trump establishes his trade barriers on April 2. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that the UK ‚Äúreserves the right‚Äù to respond to the tariffs to protect national interest. UK ministers are expecting the nation to be hit by tariffs that will apply to all countries as part of the U.S. president‚Äôs ‚Äú liberation day .‚Äù UK‚Äôs hopes for a deal before Wednesday are also fading as the former top UK trade negotiator Crawford Falconer warned Keir Starmer‚Äôs plan for an ‚Äúeconomic prosperity deal‚Äù with the U.S. could take as long as a year to come to fruition. Falconer argued that the UK got a year at most for a deal, but ‚ÄúTrump and the government will say no, we can do this quicker,‚Äù and they can get the deal done in a matter of months as opposed to years. Starmer maintained that officials will continue talks with the U.S. ‚Äúas long as there‚Äôs a chance to reach a deal.‚Äù The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) noted that if the U.S. imposed a reciprocal 20% increase in tariffs on all trade partners, the UK‚Äôs economy would be 1% smaller than its central forecast in the peak year of impact in 2026 to 2027. The OBR argued that in that scenario, it would wipe out all of the government‚Äôs fiscal buffer as additional tariff revenue was more than offset by lower receipts from income, corporation, and consumption taxes. Starmer‚Äôs official spokesman Dave Pares said the UK has been actively preparing for all eventualities ahead of the expected announcements from President Trump this week. Pares also expects the UK to be impacted alongside other countries. ‚ÄúOur trade teams are continuing to have constructive discussions to agree a UK-U.S. economic prosperity deal, but we will only do a deal which reflects this government‚Äôs mandate to deliver economic stability for the British.‚Äù -Dave Pares, British Prime Minister‚Äôs spokesperson. Stock markets plummeted on Monday in their worst month in two years after Donald Trump acknowledged that the new tariffs he is expected to announce tomorrow would hit ‚Äúall countries.‚Äù The president told reporters on Air Force One that ‚Äúyou‚Äôd start with all countries. Essentially all of the countries that we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù UK ministers expect a hit on Trump‚Äôs tariffs United Kingdom ministers have been engaged in intense negotiations in recent weeks with the U.S., but are now resigned to being hit with whatever Trump announces on April 2. Government sources have maintained they did not recognize the timelines suggested by Falconer. The country‚Äôs ministers argued there was deep uncertainty around what the U.S. President planned, including within his own administration. They also acknowledged they are taking a ‚Äúcool-headed‚Äù approach and are prepared for multiple scenarios. Pares also mentioned that the UK has been clear that a trade war with the U.S. was not in the national interest, but the nation will reserve the right to respond in a way that does protect British industry once details are viewed. He added ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre preparing for all eventualities. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôve said that we rule nothing out.‚Äù Falconer, who was the government‚Äôs most senior trade official until the end of last year, noted that failure to avoid new tariffs on Wednesday would hurt the UK economy, but he backed Starmer‚Äôs plan to seek a wider deal. The former top UK trade negotiator believes it will be damaging to some people if tariffs are applied, particularly exports, autos and steel. He also argued that it‚Äôs not going to shift the United Kingdom economy overnight, ‚ÄúGod knows we survived Brexit, which is far bigger than this is going to be.‚Äù The official, who led the UK‚Äôs attempts to reach a comprehensive U.S. free trade deal during Trump‚Äôs first term, also added that Labor could face mounting pressure to retaliate. He said that ‚Äúthe government needs to be careful that mood doesn‚Äôt shift, and if Europe moves, they might get under some pressure.‚Äù The former British ambassador to the U.S. Kim Darrock noted that UK ministers need to be wary of giving Trump wins. He argued that tariffs are Trump‚Äôs all-purpose forcing mechanism and he‚Äôll use them again if he sees them working. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

42761752,https://coingape.com/?p=246911,1743528697,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Predicts 270% Dogecoin Price Rally, Here‚Äôs When",https://coingape.com/analyst-predicts-270-dogecoin-price-rally-heres-when/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts are closely monitoring the cryptocurrency‚Äôs movements after recent predictions suggest a potential rally. Analyst Javon Marks has made a bold forecast, claiming that Dogecoin price could see a significant price surge of over 270%. As pointed out by Marks, if the DOGE price remains above the ascending trend, the price might break though the current highs and touch the levels as high as $0.6533. This is because such optimism has been attributed through trends seen in the performance of Dogecoin price in the past. Dogecoin Price Trends Point to 270% Rally At the current phase, Dogecoin price is highly likely to move toward bullish sentiment once again. Javon Marks highlighted that DOGE has been making higher lows since the recent swing low area. A healthy trend that has prevailed from last week is manifested by the higher lows, meaning the price is preparing for a surge up. In his case, Marks predicts a $0.6533 target which is 270% above the current ones. Subsequently, Javon Marks also emphasized that every time DOGE price formed higher lows, it moved up to even higher levels. This consistent behavior, coupled with the current trend, leads Marks to predict that a rally could be imminent. According to his forecast, the next wave could push Dogecoin price above its resistance levels and set new price records. This prediction follows Trader Tardigrade‚Äôs forecast of a ‚ÄúJ-shaped rebound‚Äù for Dogecoin price, which may set a path to a new ATH. Resistance and Support Levels for Dogecoin Ali Charts, another crypto analyst, has outlined key resistance and support levels that traders should watch closely. He identifies $0.18 and $0.21 as key resistance levels. If the Dogecoin price breaks above these resistance levels, Dogecoin could trigger the next major rally. On the other hand, Javon Marks also highlighted important resistance zones for the Dogecoin price. These include the $0.25 to $0.26 range, which has previously acted as a point of support but has now turned into resistance. If Dogecoin‚Äôs price drops below this range, it could find buying interest and potentially bounce higher. If the price fails to breach these resistance levels, it could indicate further downside movement toward the $0.16 area. Furthermore, recent whale activity has caught the attention of analysts. According to Ali, whales have been accumulating large amounts of Dogecoin, with over 220 million DOGE purchased in March alone. This buying activity indicates that larger investors may be positioning themselves for a possible rally, further adding to the optimism surrounding Dogecoin‚Äôs price outlook. DOGE Bullish Outlook Amid New Upgrade Among other appealing scenarios of Dogecoin price prediction , there is a planned upgrade of the ecosystem that implies switching to a new consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Twerk (PoTW). In the whitepaper, this proposal elaborates on how the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism can be replaced with fun and games. Similarly to Marks, Cantonese Cat also featured analysts on their chart that project a bullish reversal of Dogecoin. Based on the weekly chart, the DOGE price has painted several bullish signals such as the long-term diagonal trendline and a convergence between the 100-week and 200-week SMA crossover. Cantonese Cat notes that Dogecoin‚Äôs recent price movements near this trendline are essential to watch. A successful retest and defense of this trendline could confirm the breakout, supporting the case for further price increases.

42761891,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/?p=41855,1743528890,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png,Beyond The Vault: Why Bitcoin‚Äôs True Power Lies In Motion,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/beyond-the-vault-why-bitcoins-true-power-lies-in-motion,"Bitcoin Magazine Beyond The Vault: Why Bitcoin‚Äôs True Power Lies In Motion Michael Saylor, you were forced to realise that all the store-of-value assets are defective and pushed you to focus on the only asset that is not. That does not make you immune to seeing the medium of exchange case. You will see how the housing market is huge when you watch it from one point of view and horrible from another. But if you experience pain driving you to keep your billions of dollars purchasing power, housing is a decent tool to keep it. Your SoV obsession misses the mark‚Äîbadly. The biggest aspect of Bitcoin is the medium of exchange. Even though the fiat system increasingly separates money‚Äôs functions, that doesn‚Äôt mean it should. I get that saying Bitcoin is a medium of exchange is kicking the hornet‚Äôs nest, and all the other currency lords will try to stop Bitcoin. It‚Äôd be great if they joined in instead of fighting it. That will give all the billionaires certainty that they can put money in it, but simply using Bitcoin just to store value is attacking it. That approach will turn it into digital gold 2.0, captured. There‚Äôs no store of value without a medium of exchange! The medium of exchange comes first. You receive a transaction, then you store the Bitcoin. If the store of value were the main point, imagine announcing you lost your keys for your Bitcoin stack‚Äîyou‚Äôd still store it perfectly, but without the medium of exchange function, the market will wipe out the fictional fiat value layered on top. That value is there exactly because it can move and still can be used as a medium of exchange. An oxygen tank is vital for reserves, but breathing matters more. The store of value is secondary and relies on the ability to transact. Without that, the store of value means nothing. Michael, you learned this firsthand when your million-dollar holdings in Argentina were diluted by 90%. You struggled to preserve the value not because you did not see it coming but because you couldn‚Äôt use it as a medium of exchange. True, a poor store of value weakens the medium of exchange, but why does the latter take priority? Because the ability to exchange is what lets you respond. By now, most people exposed to Bitcoin know the chart from Jesse Mayers that you popularized. You claim there‚Äôs no better idea than a $900 trillion clean store of value, then immediately call Bitcoin one of the world‚Äôs most liquid markets, running 24/7/365. Guess what? Liquidity means medium of exchange. Now, let‚Äôs break down the Jesse chart, starting with the housing market. It‚Äôs valued at $330 trillion, but it‚Äôs such a poor medium of exchange that it only trades for $1.3 trillion annually. Regulations and taxes make trading real estate even tougher. Still, since it‚Äôs more than 100 times better as a store of value, billionaires prize it, increasingly dominating the market and pricing out younger generations. A house might be valuable, but its worth grows not just from what it is but from its ties to nearby utilities. Build a road to it, and the value rises. Add a superstore or a gas station, or connect it to the electrical grid, and the value climbs again. The network creates opportunities for energy to flow into the area, boosting the chance to capture that energy as economic value, like money. So the exchanges that happen in the network are what increases the value of a house. But I see the flip side: if you‚Äôre a billionaire and everyone‚Äôs after your resources, you don‚Äôt want a big network around your house. You‚Äôd prioritize privacy instead. The house might lose value, but the goal shifts to raising the cost for others to reach you, reducing the chance to be attacked. What about the bond market? Bonds are valued at $300 trillion as a store of value, with $140 trillion traded yearly plus $25 trillion in new bond issuance. That means the medium of exchange value is about 50% of its total value annually. It‚Äôs better than houses in that sense, but the numbers still show people primarily use it as a store of value. Next up are equities. Valued at $115 trillion, they were traded for about $175 trillion. This shows their strength as a medium of exchange exceeds their store of value role. Take your MicroStrategy stock‚Äîyou know it better than anyone. How much value did it store last year, and how much was exchanged through it? The next two sections are interesting. The art industry‚Äôs yearly transactions are so minor that they don‚Äôt even register on the chart. Meanwhile, the cars and collectibles sector sees trading volumes of nearly $4 trillion annually. This highlights that they‚Äôre mostly seen as a store of value each year, but it also reveals how poorly the housing market performs as a medium of exchange‚Äîoutdone even by the car market. Ooooh gold! Gold bugs rave that it‚Äôs been around for over 5,000 years, calling it the ultimate store of value for whatever reason‚Äîyet it‚Äôs just 1.78% of the store of value market. This shows that once its medium of exchange role was stripped away, it became vulnerable to capture and manipulation. Sorry, gold bugs, that genie‚Äôs not going back in the lamp. Gold holds $16 trillion in value, and the gold bugs claim it could store the $120 trillion worth of money in it. They‚Äôre desperate to pump their bags, but the market disagrees, valuing the defective fiat money ten times higher than the shiny, lifeless rock. Is gold a better medium of exchange, then? It trades at $54 trillion yearly, boosted by derivatives, making its medium of exchange use 3.5 times its store of value role. Money might not dominate as a store of value among assets, but it‚Äôs the leading medium of exchange by far. Other stores of value assets don‚Äôt even come close. What if the dollar, the top currency, became just a store of value? It would collapse the USD network, boosting the value of non-US assets as their networks step in to meet the demand. Over time, their store of value assets would rise while USD assets would plummet. Global money totals around $120 trillion, but look at the top central banks‚Äô transaction volumes: Fedwire at ~$1,182 trillion, TARGET2 at ~$765 trillion, CHAPS at ~$145 trillion, and others (partial) at ~$500 trillion (a conservative estimate due to incomplete data). So, while the store of value is $120 trillion‚Äîper the Jesse chart‚Äîthe medium of exchange utility of these networks is over 20 times greater, which is around ~$2.5 quadrillion. What would the medium of exchange value be if 2 billion unbanked people were included? How many more transactions would that spark? And what if microtransactions were possible? Where does Bitcoin fit into all of this? The prevailing narrative urges holders never to sell, positioning Bitcoin solely as a store of value. Yet, the market tells a different story. In 2024, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap hit $2 trillion, while the value exchanged on its first layer‚Äîthe blockchain‚Äîreached $3.4 trillion. Factor in the Lightning Network (though its exact figures remain elusive), and the total likely approaches $4 trillion. This suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a medium of exchange is twice as significant as its store-of-value function. So, what happens if that long-standing ‚Äúhold forever‚Äù propaganda narrative begins to fade? Bonds and equities are financial ‚Äúinstruments‚Äù that pretend to be money because fiat currency is flawed. This creates a market that shuts out much of the population from safeguarding their wealth, further splitting money‚Äôs store of value role. But how inclusive are these instruments? Or are they just tools to siphon value from the fiat medium of exchange, channeling it to privileged individuals and billionaires and others alike with a need to hoard? Globally, only 10-20% of people have exposure to bonds, mostly indirectly through pension or investment funds, not directly. For equities, 15-25% of the population has some access. That leaves at best 80% of humanity without these tools to protect themselves, making them vulnerable to exploitation. Splitting the store of value from the medium of exchange sets up a dynamic of extractors and the extracted. This amplifies the ‚Äúcantillion effect‚Äù: those who can print the medium of exchange buy up store-of-value assets, sidelining 80% or more of people. It‚Äôs a feedback loop that weakens the system, widening the gap between haves and have-nots. The more you print, the more you disconnect money from its store-of-value role. Another very big part of the whole system is the fees. There are fees for sending dollars via the banking system, and that is a service, but how much are the fees when you want to switch from the medium of exchange into the store-of-value instruments? A lot more. That is creating so much friction in the whole system, and it contributes to excluding the have-nots from storing their value. At this point, the medium of exchange turns more and more into the medium of extraction rather than for exchange. This is also a reason why the store of value case is more appealing in the fiat system. Bitcoin is not pretending to be money like everything else; it is the first engineered money that doesn‚Äôt erode like a melting ice cube and doesn‚Äôt discriminate. It is the money of those who choose it. With no printer behind it, there‚Äôs no urge to swap it for a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù store of value‚Äîthere‚Äôs no second best. Even those without Bitcoin can use it to shape their lives into the lives they desire. Moving away from chasing money to store in something and instead building whatever enriches their lives on top of Bitcoin. The biggest idea isn‚Äôt storing value‚Äîit‚Äôs moving it. But to move value, you first need to have some stored. Then again, to have some stored, someone needs to move some your way first. That‚Äôs why the rich prefer assets that don‚Äôt erode like a melting ice cube. Meanwhile, those starting their careers focus more on receiving value than storing what they don‚Äôt yet have. Why does the store of value case draw so much attention? One reason could be the effort involved. With a store of value, you buy and hodl‚Äîno work needed to improve your life. With a medium of exchange, you must work to grow your savings, persuading others to pay for your goods or services in Bitcoin. Another factor: for most, their fiat portfolio still outweighs their Bitcoin one. Only when Bitcoin surpasses their fiat holdings will they consider enhancing their lives with it. That shift isn‚Äôt tough for much of the world‚Äôs population, who lack savings or assets anyway. This might explain why the current system resists letting them exit, pushing dependency by offering to custody their Bitcoin‚Äîtrading one reliance for another. Even ossification ties into the need for more mediums of exchange use. You, Michael, strongly support ossification, but if Bitcoin isn‚Äôt used to reach more people, you‚Äôre delaying it. Unlike you, America knew that to make the dollar the world‚Äôs reserve currency, they had to distribute it widely to lock in the network effect. They saw the network as the key to ossification, and it worked easily since printing and sharing bills cost little. With Bitcoin, its absolute scarcity requires balancing how much to spread versus store. Still, that doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt spend any at all. The metaphor of storing fat in the body is key to long-term survival. True, but it overlooks the need for a steady food income to stay alive before storing fat. Without income, there‚Äôs nothing to store‚Äîso exchange comes first. Yet, for someone not worried about hunger, the focus shifts to storing food to prevent spoilage. I keep hammering this point to highlight your bias toward the store of value, which skews your judgment and misleads others. At this stage of my Bitcoin journey, I‚Äôm certain of this: chasing money corrupts you. Bitcoin shifts that‚Äîit stops you from pursuing money endlessly and lets you use it for the life you want. What happens when you have enough of everything you desire? What then? With Bitcoin, that‚Äôs entirely possible, and every Bitcoiner should be ready with an answer for when it happens. Chasing money, though, is a bottomless pit you can‚Äôt fill. The Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil. I agree, but how does it play out? What is the mechanism? Chasing money‚Äîmaking it the top priority and making the other things lesser‚Äîis the mechanism. You‚Äôre not building a Bitcoin standard‚Äîyou‚Äôre stacking a deck. Like gold in the past, you‚Äôre the one this time hoarding Bitcoin from people and institutions, further entrenching the fiat standard. Saylor, you‚Äôre not attacking the dollar as some believe‚Äîyou‚Äôre bolstering it by boosting your stock and its ecosystem. Instead, you‚Äôre speculatively hitting those who fund your Bitcoin buys. You‚Äôre not just hurting them; by strengthening the dollar, you‚Äôre amplifying the pain for other currency holders. Hoarding sats while the world watches? That‚Äôs not a cybercity‚Äîit‚Äôs a gated estate funded by their own money. I wonder if people would want to invest their Bitcoin in your securities. How many would actually do it? I‚Äôm sure true Bitcoin maximalists wouldn‚Äôt trade their perfect store of value asset for a fiat ‚Äúinstrument.‚Äù Ask yourself: at this point, would you spend your Bitcoin to buy Apple stock? You did invest in them before, after all. It makes no sense‚ÄîI‚Äôd give you Bitcoin just for you to turn it into some fiat thing, pay fiat fees, bolster fiat custodians and third parties, only so you can buy Bitcoin again on the other end. In the end, I don‚Äôt have proof, but I‚Äôm fairly certain you already know everything I‚Äôm saying in this article/message. Though it‚Äôs written to you, Michael, it‚Äôs aimed at those who see you as the new Bitcoin Jesus, blindly following without questioning your actions. They make reckless bets in their own lives‚Äîbets that could wipe out their Bitcoin‚Äîlacking the financial safeguards and interest rates you have. Your messages, which they echo, don‚Äôt apply to most of humanity. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just another asset or financial tool‚Äîit‚Äôs borderless, permissionless money for the people. Treating it otherwise diminishes its true worth. Merely storing it won‚Äôt bring freedom. Letting sats flow builds the network. Letting sats flow fosters cooperation for a better future. Letting sats flow strengthens the ecosystem. Store some for tomorrow, but do not be the richest man in the grave‚Äîsave them for plans that keep them moving later.

Is it a Crypto exchange, or can you just use your PayPal account to pay for cryptocurrencies, or can you use cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services as you would with fiat currencies? We are going to try to take a deep dive and uncover what PayPal is actually offering in our cryptocurrency world and what these newfangled exchanges are. With the cryptocurrency market now worth more than one trillion, it is moving from the margins and taking up itsplace centre stage. In an unstable world, we seem to be seeing a craze for decentralized and digital currencies. Hundreds of virtual currencies are popping up. Relative turmoil The early days of Trump's latest presidency have been synonymous with crypto and speculation, and government policy have ensured the markets are in a constant state of flux. There has been much debate about whether a Trump meme coin launched before his inauguration was a scam for selling collectables or not. Regardless, it unlocked several phishing scams and attacks that led to accounts being hacked and passwords being stolen in under two minutes . Crypto exchanges are not places to buy goods or services with your Bitcoin, Ethereum or Tether, but they work like a stock exchange where investors can buy and sell their digital currencies. To the uninitiated, they can appear quite daunting with their talk of margin or lending trading and future and options trading. Before these exchanges came into being, investors could only obtain crypto via mining or organizing transactions via online and offline forums. Now, there are crypto exchanges operating worldwide with varying levels of security and fee structures. The ideal exchange makes trading easy, has reliable security features and does not charge excessive fees. Crypto Exchanges still relatively new Whether centralized or decentralized, they are a very new concept that try to match buyers and sellers. The pros are that they are an easy, hassle-free way to buy cryptocurrencies, allow legitimate trade, and many offer their users tax forms to make it easier for users to work out crypto taxes. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to hacks and cyber theft; users do not have the right to hold their private keys, and if the exchanges fail, users cannot access their funds or trade places. This is why many users prefer to trade their cryptocurrencies on an established platform like PayPal. It is quite ironic that PayPal is now regarded as a reliable and almost traditional payment platform when it was once very much the disruptor and challenger . Presumably, at some point in the future, the ""disruptor"" crypto exchanges will become reliable and totally trustworthy, but for now, the whole exchange market is still quite erratic. PayPal and Crypto increasingly linked Over the past year, there has been a good deal of PayPal crypto news coming out of the US, with the company launching a US Dollar Stablecoin (PYUSD) just about eighteen months ago. The coin is backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, and it has a redemption value of US dollar 1.1. The company announced that PYUSD was also available on the Solano Blockchain, claiming this offered consumers faster and cheaper transactions. MoonPay's integration with the platform back in May 2024 ensures a seamless fiat-to-crypto experience for US-based PayPal customers. In addition, US merchants can now buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal business account, and it has sped up and reduced the costs of cross-border money transfers with Xoom. These integrations mean that people in Asia-Pacific and Africa should have better access to digital financial solutions from a trusted source, and businesses will not be restricted by traditional banking hours. PayPal's Senior Vice President of Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Digital Currencies, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, said, ""Cross-border transactions are an important driver for economic growth and prosperity in developing countries with this step, Xoom and its partners, like Cebuana Lhuillier and Yellow Card, will be able to leverage PayPal's payment technologies and the blockchain to enable seamless money transfers across borders further."" PayPal is not an Exchange However, regardless of all its forays into crypto, PayPal is not a place to trade crypto for crypto; it is more a place to use, exchange and interchange crypto and fiat currencies. One of the areas where crypto is still most widely used is for people who enjoy a punt at an online casino. If you are Canadian, you will know that gambling is very much part of the DNA of the country. While crypto sceptics accuse investing in blockchain currencies as nothing other than a gamble, online casinos make no pretence that they are any more than a great entertainment option. Just as it can be hard to find a reliable crypto exchange, online casinos can also be a bit hit-and-miss - particularly offshore ones and those that accept cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, it can all be rather like the Wild West and it can be hard to work out which ones are reputable. Fortunately, while online casinos that accept crypto payments via PayPal might be a fairly recent phenomenon, services that rate and review online casinos are not. For example, Casino.org ranks the top PayPal casinos in Canada , so that players do not have to take a risk. They can just get on with the fun, whether they are using fiat or cryptocurrencies or possibly a mixture of the two. Ultimately, while you can use PayPal for all kinds of cryptocurrency transactions, it is not a crypto exchange. You can use the platform to buy cryptocurrencies and the platform is also making it easier to use it. It allows consumers to pay for purchases using Bitcoin , Ethereum and other supported currencies with a seamless checkout process. Customers select their preferred currency at checkout ‚Äì just as they would select a debit or credit card ‚Äì and PayPal does the rest. PayPal also offers consumers features such as price alerts and recurring purchases, allowing users to buy, hold, sell, and manage their crypto assets through the platform. It can also be used to transfer crypto to family and friends, whether they are PayPal users or not. As the world wakes up to the potential of cryptocurrencies, PayPal claims to be leading the charge by unlocking new opportunities for consumers and businesses alike.

42763454,https://blockworks.co/news/gunzilla-token-letter-speculation-off-grid,1743529682,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Off The Grid confidential letter sparks speculation around tokenomics,https://blockworks.co/news/gunzilla-token-letter-speculation-off-grid,"This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The shooter game Off The Grid has faced some disapproval ‚Äî and some praise ‚Äî over a purported confidential letter. The letter in question was reportedly emailed to Gunzilla Games‚Äô private investors in regard to its GUN token that became tradeable on Binance this week. GUN launched on Monday and hit a $68 million market cap within hours of launch, but that number has since fallen to $40 million. The letter references a SAFT, or a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens, that means investors gave the company money upfront for tokens at a later, future date. The copy-pasted text of the letter was posted on X yesterday by a crypto trader and got over 115,000 views in less than a day. The larger post also included the trader‚Äôs scathing criticism of the decision. We don‚Äôt know more about the specifics of the SAFT yet, though. The supposed text of that email also references a change to GUN‚Äôs vesting tokenomics ‚Äî and offers investors a chance for a refund if they don‚Äôt want to agree to the new terms. What exactly might these changes be? The trader who leaked the purported letter, Grail.eth, claims seed round investors were supposed to get 5% of their GUN tokens unlocked on launch day, while strategic round investors were supposed to see 2% of their tokens unlock on launch. According to the public GUN whitepaper, the strategic round is seeing 0% of tokens unlocked on launch. The Private A and B rounds have been granted the same. This means these groups‚Äô tokens won‚Äôt be unlocked for at least a year because their tokens have a 12-month cliff, with 18 months of vesting. Some traders on Twitter speculate that the changes may be in order to fund the token‚Äôs listing on Binance, though this has not been confirmed by Gunzilla or Binance. ‚ÄúWe do not charge listing fees to projects listing on Binance,‚Äù a Binance spokesperson tells Blockworks. ‚ÄúRegardless, deposits from project teams are refundable and designed to help protect users by ensuring that projects are serious about building their projects, keeping them alive and continuing to build after listing on Binance. The deposit also serves to help protect users in situations where projects harm them by failing to deliver on their commitments.‚Äù Others have criticized GUN‚Äôs tokenomics for allotting a significant amount to investors in the first place. But not everyone‚Äôs seeing these tokenomics in a negative light. I‚Äôm personally a fan of any project that makes investors wait longer to unlock their tokens. The ‚Äúdump on retail‚Äù price action isn‚Äôt fun for anyone, and it can kill excitement around a new project fast if it happens shortly after a token launches. ‚ÄúA rare instance where the project chooses its users over VCs,‚Äù wrote Ava Labs Marketing Lead Avery Bartlett in response to the post with the letter, while also admitting he understood the criticism around it (Gunzilla is using its own Avalanche L1).

Expert Predicts Exact Timeline for the Next Massive Surge,https://coingape.com/xrp-price-to-27-expert-predicts-exact-timeline-for-the-next-massive-surge/,"Crypto expert Egrag Crypto has again predicted that the XRP price could rally to as high as $27. The analyst has also revealed the exact timeline for when the altcoin could record this massive price surge. Expert Reveals Time For XRP Price To Hit $27 In an X post , Egrag Crypto asserted that the XRP price can hit $27 in 60 days. The expert remarked that historical patterns indicate that the altcoin can reach this target within this timeframe. Based on this price prediction, XRP could reach this $27 target by June, marking a 1,250% gain for Ripple‚Äôs native crypto. The expert‚Äôs accompanying chart showed that he was alluding to the 2017 bull run as to why the altcoin could record such a parabolic rally. In 2017, XRP recorded a historic gain of over 60,000% as it rallied to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.8 the following year. As such, based on history, a 1,250% increase is nothing for the altcoin. In the meantime, the XRP price still boasts a bearish outlook thanks to the sentiment in the broader crypto market. As CoinGape reported, Ripple‚Äôs coin could drop to the next major support levels at $1.79 and $1.56 if it fails to hold above $2.03. Decision Time For The Altcoin In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades stated that it is decision time for the XRP price. She noted that the altcoin is showing strength with a bounce right back to the first key test at $2.17. She added that this is the resistance level she wants to see flip into support, as it might be the ‚Äúmost important price of the week.‚Äù The analyst stated that XRP must reclaim this level to build momentum. She added that the $2 level remains a valid target if the $2.17 level rejects. Meanwhile, CasiTrades revealed that $2.70, $3.05, and $3.80 are the major resistance zones once the upward trend is confirmed. The analyst also mentioned that the XRP price is now fully inside the Fibonacci Time Zone 3, which spans most of April. She affirmed that this is the breakout window market participants have been preparing for and that all signs point to a macro wave. CasiTrades affirmed that the structure is clean. The RSI divergence has confirmed the bottom, while the subwaves are aligning well with the larger targets. If the next leg pushes XRP back above $2.17 with momentum, she claimed that market participants may finally see obvious signs of Wave 3. Interestingly, the analyst added that if the altcoin clears $2.70 this week, it may break the $1,000 price extension. For now, investors may remain cautious, especially seeing how XRP fell after the PMI and JOLTS data release earlier today. Donald Trump is also set to announce reciprocal tariffs tomorrow, which could spark a massive price crash. The post XRP Price to $27?

His warnings come as the crypto industry emerges from the recent Bybit hack , which reportedly involved a sophisticated compromise of SafeWallet infrastructure. This attack marked a departure from previous North Korean hacking incidents . Instead of directly targeting Bybit, the hackers managed to breach Safe{Wallet}. This shift in tactics highlights the growing sophistication of their strategies and raises significant concerns about the security of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. According to Samczsun , North Korean-backed cybercrime isn‚Äôt just the work of a single group, but rather a network of state-sponsored threat actors operating under different names. You might also like: Trump family reportedly seizes majority control of World Liberty Financial North Korea‚Äôs cyber warfare structure Samczsun has been analyzing North Korea‚Äôs cyber threat for years. He explains that referring to all North Korean cyber activity as the ‚ÄúLazarus Group‚Äù oversimplifies a far more complex network. North Korea‚Äôs hacking operations are primarily run through the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency that oversees multiple hacking units. These include not only Lazarus Group but also APT38, AppleJeus, and other specialized teams. Each of these groups has a different focus. Lazarus Group, for example, is known for high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist. APT38 specializes in financial crimes, including bank fraud and cryptocurrency theft. ‚ÄúAPT38,‚Äù Samczsun wrote, ‚Äúwhich spun out of Lazarus Group in around 2016 in order to focus on financial crimes, targeting banks (such as the Bank of Bangladesh) first, then cryptocurrency later.‚Äù AppleJeus has targeted cryptocurrency users with malware disguised as trading apps. These groups work under the same government umbrella, helping to fund North Korea‚Äôs weapons programs and evade international sanctions. You might also like: Bitcoin in retirement plans? Sen. Tuberville revives crypto bill Crypto is now a North Korea target North Korea has turned to cryptocurrency as a major source of revenue. Unlike traditional finance, crypto transactions are decentralized and often more difficult to track or freeze. North Korean hackers exploit this by breaching exchanges, deploying malware, and using fake job offers to gain access to internal systems. One example is the case of ‚ÄúWagemole‚Äù operatives ‚Äî North Korean IT workers who infiltrate legitimate tech companies. These individuals appear to be regular employees but sometimes use their access to steal funds or compromise systems. This tactic was seen in the Munchables exploit , where an employee with ties to North Korea drained assets from the protocol. Another method is supply chain attacks, where hackers compromise software providers that serve cryptocurrency firms. In one case, AppleJeus hackers inserted malware into a widely used communications tool, affecting millions of users. In another, North Korean attackers breached a contractor working with Radiant Capital, gaining access through social engineering on Telegram, according to Samczsun. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin may see consolidation in April and May as selling pressure drops What this means for crypto Samczsun warned that North Korea‚Äôs cyber operations are evolving. The Bybit attack shows that hackers are now targeting infrastructure providers, not just exchanges. This means the entire crypto ecosystem ‚Äî from wallets to smart contract platforms ‚Äî could be at risk. For crypto users and businesses, the key takeaway is that North Korean cyber threats go beyond Lazarus Group and simple exchange hacks. The industry needs stronger security protocols, improved intelligence sharing, and greater awareness of social engineering threats.",News|Bybit|Crime|Cyber Attack|Lazarus Group|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-01 17:51:23

With the global market hovering slightly above extreme fear, analysts continue to debate ETH‚Äôs growth potential against its risks. At the same time, new projects like Panshibi are drawing interest as alternatives. The SHIBI token has found success in a period where established assets struggle with liquidity. Here's why: Panshibi Gains Momentum as Investors Look Beyond the Top 100 Cryptos Now, more than ever, investors are seeking opportunities outside the belt of popular cryptocurrencies. While the top 100 dominates the crypto market, newer tokens sometimes provide better entry points and a stronger upside. Over the past month, Panshibi has made headlines as one of the better options, with an architecture that could change the game. Panshibi offers an ecosystem that benefits both traders and non-traders. With staking rewards of up to 1,200% APY, social-fi integration across the Bamboo Valley, and a commitment to panda conservation efforts, Panshibi has appealed to thousands of investors worldwide. The meme project proves to be more than just a speculative asset. Moreover, Panshibi plans to intensify its security measures after the crypto ecosystem lost over $1.64 billion to hackers in Q1. Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool and passed Coinsult‚Äôs smart contract audit. It also has additional features in place to prevent rug pulls or schemes that could hurt early investors. With increasing engagement on social media and ongoing presale momentum, Panshibidraws comparisons to early-stage success stories. Whether the SHIBI token offers better odds than established names remains to be seen, but its tangible use case and real-world impact keep investors interested. Ethereum Price Down 50%, But Could Q2 Spark a Bullish Reversal? Over the past year, Etheruem has fallen 50%, with its price shy of $1,800. However, history suggests a turnaround could happen in Q2 as ETH often surges after a poor Q1 performance. This statistic could explain why a certain whale has amassed over 142,000 ETH in the past 30 days , drawing the attention of market analysts. Moreover, data from CoinCodex projects a 45% price increase by May 1, 2025, aligning with Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade slated for late April. Given the success of the Hoodi testnet, analysts see Pectra as a potential catalyst for a mid-year bullish reversal. With the current market dynamics, longing ETH comes with both opportunities and risks. Should Ethereum fail to break through the $1,880 barrier, technical indicators point to another decline. Immediate support is over $1,780, while a crucial support zone lies around $1,650. At this time, 80% of the Ethereum community remains bullish according to Coinmarketcap. Conclusion The fourth stage of the Panshibi presale is nearing its end. A bull run from the current state of the crypto market could spell big profits for ETH holders and even bigger profits for early SHIBI investors.

42762823,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144986,1743530406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Caution: Crypto Fear & Greed Index Unchanged at 34, Lingering in ‚ÄòFear‚Äô Zone",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-fear-6/,"Are you feeling uneasy about the crypto market? You‚Äôre not alone. The latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading indicates that the market sentiment remains firmly in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone. As of April 1st, the index, a crucial tool for gauging overall market emotions, sits at 34, unchanged from the previous day. This consistent ‚ÄòFear‚Äô reading prompts a deeper look into what this means for investors and the potential future of the crypto landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Sentiment Compass The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, acts like a compass for the volatile cryptocurrency market. It‚Äôs designed to distill the complex emotions driving crypto trading into a single, easy-to-understand number. Ranging from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed), the index provides a snapshot of the prevailing market sentiment. Think of it as a gauge of investor emotions ‚Äì are people panicking and selling, or are they enthusiastically buying? Currently, the needle is pointing towards ‚ÄòFear‚Äô. But what exactly fuels this index, and why is it important for anyone involved in the crypto space? Let‚Äôs break down the components: Volatility (25%): Measuring the rapid and unpredictable price swings in the crypto market. High volatility often correlates with fear, as uncertainty increases. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzing trading volume and market momentum against recent averages. Strong buying momentum can suggest greed, while weak volume during price drops can signal fear. Social Media (15%): Tracking sentiment across social media platforms, particularly crypto-focused channels. This factor assesses the overall buzz and positivity or negativity surrounding cryptocurrencies. Surveys (15%): Conducting periodic polls to directly gauge crypto investors‚Äô feelings and expectations. While not always real-time, surveys provide valuable insights into broader sentiment trends. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitoring Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market capitalization. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‚Äòflight to safety‚Äô during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Spikes in searches like ‚ÄúBitcoin crash‚Äù can reflect increased fear in the general public. Why Does the ‚ÄòFear Zone‚Äô Persist? Understanding Current Crypto Market Sentiment The persistent reading of 34, firmly within the Fear zone , highlights a prevailing cautiousness in the crypto market. Several factors could be contributing to this sustained sentiment. Global economic uncertainties, regulatory pressures, and recent market corrections can all fuel investor anxiety. When the index hovers in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone, it suggests that investors are apprehensive, potentially leading to decreased buying pressure and increased selling pressure. This environment can create opportunities for savvy investors, but it also underscores the need for careful navigation. Is this prolonged ‚ÄòFear‚Äô a bad thing? Not necessarily. In fact, contrarian investors often see periods of extreme fear as potential buying opportunities. The logic is simple: when everyone else is fearful and selling, prices may be undervalued, presenting a chance to buy low before the market potentially recovers. Navigating Market Volatility and Bitcoin Sentiment in Times of Fear Market volatility is inherent to the cryptocurrency space, but understanding how to navigate it, especially during periods of fear, is crucial. The Bitcoin sentiment , often a bellwether for the broader crypto market, plays a significant role in the Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements and overall sentiment heavily influence the index due to its market dominance. When Bitcoin experiences volatility or negative sentiment, it often drags the entire market mood down with it. Here are a few actionable insights to consider when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates ‚ÄòFear‚Äô: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on market sentiment or fear. Conduct thorough research on projects before investing. Understand the fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider DCA as a strategy during fearful times. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. This can help mitigate risk and average out your entry price. Review Your Portfolio: Periods of fear are good times to reassess your portfolio. Are your holdings aligned with your risk tolerance and long-term investment goals? Consider rebalancing if necessary. Stay Informed, But Filter the Noise: Keep abreast of market news, but be wary of excessive hype or fear-mongering. Focus on credible sources and fundamental analysis rather than succumbing to emotional reactions. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. Periods of fear are often followed by periods of growth. Maintain a long-term perspective and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. The Silver Lining of Fear: Potential Opportunities in Crypto Market Sentiment While ‚ÄòFear‚Äô might sound negative, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that it can also present opportunities. As Warren Buffett famously said, ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù When the crypto market sentiment is dominated by fear, it can lead to price corrections and potentially undervalued assets. This is when diligent investors can find opportunities to accumulate quality cryptocurrencies at discounted prices. However, it‚Äôs crucial to differentiate between fear-driven dips and projects with genuinely weakened fundamentals. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a crystal ball, but it‚Äôs a valuable tool for understanding the prevailing emotional climate of the crypto market. The current reading of 34, consistently in the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô zone, serves as a reminder of the cautious sentiment. By understanding the factors that influence this index and adopting a rational, research-driven approach, investors can navigate these periods of fear and potentially position themselves for future market upturns.

Meanwhile, popular analyst VirtualBacon recently pointed out a big issue, stating how different sources define M2 Money Supply and global liquidity , leading to mixed market signals. Some traders see bullish signs in the chart, while others don‚Äôt, and the reason comes down to how M2 is measured. Is M2 growing, or are some trackers mixing it with global liquidity? Bitcoin and M2 Money Supply For Bitcoin, M2 Money Supply growth is a key factor in price movements. M2 measures the available cash reserves, including cash deposits, deposits in checks, savings, market accounts, funds, and deposits of less than $100,000. Just found this inconsistency causing arguments on M2 vs global liquidity. On many trackers like Bitcoin Magazine Pro, Global M2 is calculated to include central bank balance sheets (AKA Global Liquidity). Whereas the traditional M2 money supply in only the cash reserve‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/z7afTmymwa ‚Äî VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) April 1, 2025 When M2 expands, more money is available to invest, and Bitcoin benefits as a liquidity-sensitive asset. A rise in M2 often leads to a surge in Bitcoin prices, as more investors pour money into digital assets. Global M2 liquidity is surging, and history suggests that risk assets like Bitcoin may soon react. As of April 1, global M2 money supply reached an all-time high of $108.4 trillion , marking a 3.7% increase from its 2025 low of $106 trillion recorded on nov 4. . Altcoins React To Global Liquidity Altcoins, on the other hand, are more influenced by global liquidity, which includes central bank balance sheets and overall risk investment trends. When global liquidity increases, investors become more willing to take risks, benefiting altcoins. This is why altcoins often see more volatility compared to Bitcoin. The broader net cast by global liquidity impacts risk assets, and altcoins dance to this rhythm. Things To Keep in Mind The important lesson for crypto traders is to understand which data matters for their investments. Bitcoin‚Äôs price is closely tied to M2 Money Supply, while altcoins respond more to global liquidity trends.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-01 18:01:19

ADA has long been a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, but broader market conditions have stifled its growth. With renewed optimism in the air, speculation is heating up over whether Cardano can capitalize on a more favorable environment. While ADA investors weigh the ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù a different kind of bet is catching fire, Panshibi(SHIBI) . It‚Äôs not just another meme coin; it‚Äôs a wildcard play with a cult-like following. April could be a game-changer, and SHIBI holders are already ahead of the curve. Are they onto something? ADA's Potential Surge Amid Sanction Shifts: A Cardano PricePrediction Cardano price has been stuck in a tug-of-war‚Äîjust enough momentum to keep hopes alive, but not enough to break free. Sitting around $0.65 , it‚Äôs flirting with a dangerous support level at $0.64. Fall below, and ADA could be staring at the low $0.50s. But if sentiment flips? That‚Äôs when things get interesting. Cardano isn‚Äôt just waiting for a miracle, it‚Äôs gearing up for a speed boost. The Leios upgrade promises Solana-like performance with full decentralization, which is a game-changer if it delivers. More speed, more efficiency, more attention. Could this be ADA‚Äôs moment? Considering these developments, Cardano price prediction hinges on both external economic factors and internal advancements. All eyes are on the U.S. If sanctions ease, markets could get the green light to rally‚Äîand ADA might finally catch fire. The question is, can it hold out until then? The Panda That Could Outrun ADA‚ÄîWhy Panshibi (SHIBI) Might Be April‚Äôs Biggest Crypto Play Meme coins have a habit of making millionaires out of skeptics. Dogecoin started as a joke, yet it had a market cap bigger than some Fortune 500 companies at its peak. Now, Panshibi (SHIBI) is rolling in with a formula that‚Äôs too good to ignore‚ÄîAsia‚Äôs love for pandas, meme culture‚Äôs viral magic, and tokenomics that scream high potential. With Cardano price still searching for its next big catalyst, SHIBI might be the true wildcard of the season. Over $1.28 million raised in presale, an entry price of just $0.005, and a built-in 1,200% stake-to-earn incentive. Investors aren‚Äôt just throwing money at this for fun‚Äîthey see something bigger. Panshibi isn‚Äôt just another meme coin riding the hype train; it‚Äôs an ecosystem built to reward participation. Add in VIP perks like the Bamboo Private Club, where presale buyers get exclusive benefits, and it‚Äôs clear that early adopters aren‚Äôt just buying a token‚Äîthey‚Äôre buying into an entire movement that could define the next wave of meme coin success. What about security? 10-year liquidity lock. 2-year team token lock. Fully audited by Coinsult. No shady backdoors, no rug-pull concerns‚Äîjust a clear path to what could be 2025‚Äôs biggest meme coin breakout. Unlike past projects that promised the moon and disappeared overnight, Panshibi is laying the groundwork for long-term sustainability, ensuring that it‚Äôs not just a fleeting trend but a serious contender in the meme coin space. So while analysts debate Cardano price predictions and watch sanctions like a hawk, Panshibiinvestors are already locking in their spots. The real question isn‚Äôt if SHIBI will explode‚Äîit‚Äôs who will be holding it when it does. With a 145,000% post-launch price prediction, this isn‚Äôt just another speculative play. It‚Äôs a bet on a meme-fueled revolution that could leave hesitant investors wondering why they didn‚Äôt jump in sooner. Secure Your Shibi Position Now! This isn‚Äôt one of those ‚Äúshould‚Äôve, could‚Äôve, would‚Äôve‚Äù moments, you either get in or watch others cash out. SHIBI is still sitting at $0.005, but not for long.

In a new interview on the Less Noise More Signal YouTube Channel, Coutts shares a chart that shows the price of Bitcoin overlaid with large down moves ‚Äì of at least 2.5% or more ‚Äì in the DXY. The DXY measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other major foreign currencies weighted by volume and often moves inversely to risk assets like Bitcoin. According to Coutts, many of the large downward moves in DXY ‚Äì like the one that happened in late March ‚Äì have coincided with the beginning of BTC rallies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just showing the Bitcoin chart and when these have occurred, which are the yellow icons. And so, on the eight occasions set, we‚Äôve seen this play out 90 days later on all eight occasions ‚Äì the Bitcoin [price] has been higher on average by about 30%, but anywhere by about 30% to 50% or 60%. So if this was to play out and the lag between financial conditions and liquidity and asset prices plays out, then, really, we‚Äôre sort of looking at May as being a strong month for Bitcoin and potentially a retest of the all-time highs.‚Äù Source: Jamie Coutts/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $85,138, 21% below its all-time high.

Brazilian Court Uses Blockchain Technology for Legal Notices in Bitcoin Scam Case!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-first-brazilian-court-uses-blockchain-technology-for-legal-notices-in-bitcoin-scam-case/,"A Brazilian court has authorized the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to inform unknown Bitcoin owners of their involvement in a $900 million pyramid scheme allegedly linked to BWA Brazil. Brazilian Court Approves NFT-Based Subpoenas in Bitcoin Scam Case This legal move leverages blockchain technology to deliver direct legal notices to wallet addresses suspected of holding embezzled funds. The court-appointed receiver handling BWA Brazil‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings filed a petition requesting approval for digital service of process via NFTs. The judge ruled in his favor, stating: ‚ÄúCreditors who have suffered millions of dollars in losses should not suffer further harm from regulatory delays in keeping up with technological innovation.‚Äù The ruling allows the court to mint NFTs containing legal documents and send them to wallet addresses associated with the scheme, even if their owners cannot be identified. The Public Prosecutor's Office supported the motion, emphasizing the importance of stopping the statute of limitations on claims regarding Bitcoin assets acquired using creditor funds. BWA Brazil‚Äôs Alleged Crypto Pyramid Scheme Founded in 2017 by Paulo Roberto Ramos Bilibio, BWA Brazil marketed itself as a Bitcoin investment firm, promising fixed monthly returns of 5%, an unrealistic figure given Bitcoin‚Äôs volatile nature. The firm froze withdrawals in early 2020, leaving investors with losses exceeding $52.2 million. The firm was first placed into legal rescue in July 2020, but its case was later upgraded to bankruptcy proceedings after customers were not compensated. Bilibio and his partner Jessica da Silva Farias allegedly used customer deposits to purchase Bitcoin, amassing an estimated 11,200 BTC, currently worth over $900 million. Both suspects remain at large. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: A First!

The markets are bracing for potential turbulence as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent just dropped a bombshell: President Donald Trump is set to unveil detailed reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd at 19:00 UTC. This news, delivered in a Fox News interview and reported by Forexlive, has the potential to send ripples through the global economy, and the ever-sensitive crypto market is undoubtedly watching with bated breath. What does this mean for your digital assets? Let‚Äôs dive into the specifics and unpack the possible scenarios. Why Trump Tariffs are a Big Deal for the Crypto Market Trump tariffs , a hallmark of the former president‚Äôs trade policies, are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. While seemingly straightforward, these measures can trigger a complex chain of reactions that extend far beyond traditional markets, directly impacting the digital asset space. Here‚Äôs why crypto investors should pay close attention: Market Volatility Amplification: Tariffs often lead to trade disputes and uncertainty in the global economy. This uncertainty translates directly into market volatility , something the crypto market is already intimately familiar with. When traditional markets react negatively to tariff announcements, we often see a corresponding, and sometimes amplified, reaction in the crypto sphere. Risk-Off Sentiment: Tariffs can fuel a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô sentiment among investors. In times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to flock to safer assets. While some argue Bitcoin is becoming a ‚Äòsafe haven‚Äô asset, the broader crypto market is still largely considered a high-risk, high-reward investment. A risk-off environment could lead to capital outflows from crypto to more traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds. Inflationary Pressures: Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods. These increased costs can be passed on to consumers, leading to inflationary pressures. Inflation can erode the purchasing power of fiat currencies, which, in theory, could make inflation-resistant assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive. However, the immediate market reaction to tariff news is often negative, driven by fear of economic disruption. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global trade is a delicate web of interconnected economies. Tariffs can disrupt these relationships, leading to geopolitical tensions and further economic instability. This broader uncertainty can impact investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Decoding the Announcement: What to Expect on April 2nd Secretary Bessent‚Äôs announcement is brief but loaded with implications. The key phrase here is ‚Äúdetailed information on reciprocal tariffs.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down what each part means: * **Detailed Information:** This suggests that Trump‚Äôs announcement won‚Äôt be a vague statement but will likely include specifics about which countries and goods will be targeted, and the percentage of the tariffs. The level of detail will heavily influence market reactions. Vague announcements create uncertainty, while detailed ones allow for more precise market assessments and responses. * **Reciprocal Tariffs:** ‚ÄúReciprocal‚Äù implies that these tariffs are in response to trade practices of other countries. This could escalate into a trade war if other nations retaliate with their own tariffs. Trade wars are generally bad news for global trade and market stability. * **April 2nd, 19:00 UTC:** Mark your calendars! This is the crucial time to watch for the announcement. Expect increased volatility in the crypto market around this time. News outlets and crypto analysis platforms will be closely monitoring and reporting on the announcement and its immediate market impact. Potential Impacts on Your Crypto Portfolio So, how might these Trump tariffs affect your crypto holdings? While predicting market movements with certainty is impossible, here are a few potential scenarios to consider: Scenario Potential Crypto Market Reaction Actionable Insight Aggressive Tariffs Announced (High tariffs on major trading partners) Negative. Sharp drop in crypto prices, increased volatility, potential risk-off flight to fiat or stablecoins. Consider risk management strategies: reduce exposure, set stop-loss orders, diversify into stablecoins temporarily. Moderate Tariffs Announced (Targeted tariffs, less broad impact) Neutral to Slightly Negative. Moderate volatility, potential short-term dip followed by recovery if the market assesses the impact as manageable. Monitor market sentiment closely, consider buying the dip if you believe in long-term crypto prospects. Announcement Delayed or Less Hawkish than Expected Positive to Neutral. Relief rally in crypto prices, reduced volatility. Market may interpret delay or softer stance as less immediate economic threat. Potential buying opportunity, but remain cautious as tariff issue is likely not fully resolved. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors In the face of this urgent news, what should crypto investors do? Here are some actionable insights: * **Stay Informed:** Keep a close eye on news and market analysis leading up to and following the April 2nd announcement. Reputable crypto news sources and financial news outlets will be crucial. * **Manage Risk:** Volatility is expected. Implement risk management strategies appropriate for your risk tolerance. This might include adjusting your portfolio allocation, setting stop-loss orders, or hedging with stablecoins. * **Don‚Äôt Panic Sell:** Market dips can be unsettling, but panic selling often leads to losses. Make informed decisions based on your investment strategy and risk assessment, not emotional reactions. * **Long-Term Perspective:** Remember that the crypto market is known for its cyclical nature. Short-term volatility driven by tariff news may present buying opportunities for long-term investors who believe in the fundamental value of cryptocurrencies. * **Diversification:** A diversified portfolio across different asset classes, including and beyond crypto, can help mitigate risk during periods of economic uncertainty. The Crypto World Watches and Waits The upcoming announcement of Trump tariffs is a significant event that could inject further volatility into the already dynamic crypto market . While the exact impact remains to be seen, being prepared, staying informed, and managing risk are crucial for navigating these potentially turbulent waters. The crypto community will be keenly observing the events of April 2nd, ready to adapt to whatever unfolds in the ever-evolving landscape of global trade and finance.
