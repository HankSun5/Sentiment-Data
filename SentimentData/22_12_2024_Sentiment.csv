How low could prices go post-Trump Inauguration?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-overdue-correction-low-prices/,"Bitcoin’s rally is hitting a wall, and the numbers are lining up for a big correction in the next month. October saw the global money supply hit a peak of $108.5 trillion, pushing Bitcoin to its record $108,000 high. But here’s the twist: over the last two months, the money supply has dropped by $4.1 trillion, now sitting at $104.4 trillion—its lowest since August. Historically, Bitcoin lags behind money supply by about ten weeks. If that pattern holds, prices could sink by as much as $20,000 in the weeks after president Donald Trump’s inauguration. Analysts are pointing to Bitcoin’s current phase as a mid-top correction—a pattern seen before in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Those phases led to monster bull runs, but first came the pain. And it looks like this one could sting, especially with predictions that even before inauguration, Bitcoin might drop 30%. Panic selling hits markets and Bitcoin ETFs bleed out Panic is spreading beyond crypto. U.S. equity funds just posted outflows of $50.2 billion in the week ending December 18. That’s the biggest exodus since 2009. Large-cap funds lost $20.9 billion, wiping out six weeks of gains. Small-cap, multi-cap, and mid-cap funds weren’t spared either, losing $5.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the volatility index ($VIX) just posted its second-largest daily jump in history. The market is on edge, and Bitcoin’s caught in the middle of it. Leveraged long positions in Bitcoin got crushed, pushing prices down to $92,000 by mid-December. The weekend gave bulls a little breathing room, with a rebound to $99,500 on Bitstamp. Coinbase buyers tried to claw prices back to six figures, but institutional players staying on the sidelines made the recovery look shaky. The optimism didn’t last. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) felt the heat too. December 20 brought nearly $300 million in net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs . The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took the hardest hit, logging its largest-ever outflow at $72.7 million. Investors are bailing, and fast.

In a recent update, Saylor mentioned that he is ready to participate should President-elect Donald Trump establish a crypto advisory council. He is willing to guide the President-elect on crypto matters to shape and reform the country’s digital assets policy. Michael Saylor and The Big Bet on Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin goes beyond words. Since 2020, he has actively supported Bitcoin, even putting his money where his mouth is. Having personally invested nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin, Saylor’s dedication to the digital currency has been unmatched. That year, he proudly announced that he owned 17,732 BTC. This was even before his company, MicroStrategy, made its first large-scale purchase of the asset. Today, MicroStrategy owns a staggering 440,000 BTC, accounting for nearly 2% of the Bitcoin supply. This massive accumulation is no accident. Saylor has called Bitcoin the “apex property of the human race.” He drew comparisons to the territories of Manhattan and Alaska that were once purchased during early American colonization. For him, Bitcoin represents the future, an essential piece of cyberspace that the U.S. should own in bulk. Donald Trump’s Crypto Shift and Saylor’s Support Like many others, Michael Saylor sees Trump as the most Bitcoin and crypto-friendly Republican politician. Although Saylor is not a strong supporter of the Republican Party, he believes it has become more open to progressive changes in crypto regulation. He supports their push to treat crypto as a tool for economic growth and lower regulatory pressure. Also, it encourages individuals to pursue their financial goals using digital assets, especially Bitcoin. Before now, Trump was never a fan of crypto. Once a critic of Bitcoin, calling it “not money” and “based on thin air.” However, in recent years, his views on crypto have changed significantly. During his campaigns this year, he accepted crypto donations and attended a major crypto conference. He publicly promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. The Creation of a Crypto Advisory Council Trump’s crypto journey is taking shape with the announcement of a potential crypto advisory council. While details remain scarce, some industry leaders seek to engage with the incoming administration . These include Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). If established, the council is expected to be key in shaping future crypto policies. This comes after Trump’s proposed tax cuts for crypto companies, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump has recently appointed pro-crypto executives to hold significant positions in his incoming administration. These moves are expected to impact the direction of crypto regulation in the U.S positively .

Sui (SUI) Sui is a groundbreaking blockchain platform designed for global adoption. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable environment for developers. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model and the secure Move programming language. This innovative approach addresses inefficiencies found in other blockchain systems. By focusing on user experience, Sui removes common barriers in blockchain interactions. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make Web3 applications more accessible and friendly. Sui’s potential lies in its strong technical foundation and commitment to usability. By simplifying blockchain interactions, it stands out in a crowded market. Compared to other platforms, Sui’s focus on the end user could give it an edge. In the current market, there is a demand for user-friendly and scalable solutions. While many coins compete on technology alone, Sui combines this with a dedication to accessibility. This approach may position it well as the blockchain space continues to evolve. Considering market trends, platforms like Sui that prioritize both innovation and user experience may attract more attention. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum that pays tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It’s a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There’s no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave. Conclusion While SUI and PEPE are strong contenders, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by merging sports and memes, aiming for exceptional growth in this bullish altcoin season.

It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table. It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions, bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 (+1233%) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved. XYZVerse is Heating Up, and This is Your Chance to Get in Early Why $XYZ Is Gaining Traction What’s fueling this explosive growth? It’s simple: community, vision, and results. The XYZVersers, a rapidly growing base of supporters, are the lifeblood of the project. Unlike many meme coins that rely on fleeting hype, $XYZ is already delivering tangible progress, thanks to its presale strategy and ambitious roadmap. The project’s foundation is rock-solid. $XYZ is redefining the meme coin market with a concept that blends sports culture with cutting-edge crypto technology. This isn’t another coin trying to cash in on a trend; it’s creating an entirely new playbook. Ambitious Plans Backed by Action $XYZ’s roadmap doesn’t stop at a clever theme. The project is built to deliver long-term value: Major Exchange Listings: Aiming for global visibility and accessibility. Staking and Passive Rewards: Giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. Scalability on Polygon: Fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with sports media outlets and exclusive digital creators to amplify its reach. These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results. But in the midst of this chaos, XYZVerse is proving to be a rare exception — a champion in the making. With a sports-driven ecosystem, an impressive 1,233% presale surge, and a roadmap built for sustainability, XYZVerse is showing all the signs of a long-term player in the crypto space. For investors tired of empty promises and looking for a meme coin with real value, XYZVerse offers a fresh opportunity. The presale is still underway, and with its innovative approach and rapid growth, $XYZ might just be the hidden gem that fills your wallet with lasting returns.

XYZVerse is preparing for a potential surge of 16,900%, promising to shake up the market in a big way. This development hints at a major shift in the crypto landscape, capturing the attention of investors everywhere. Trump’s Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side – The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ – the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it’s time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.001 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 1000%!

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has seen notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, ETH has dropped by 10.38%, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, over the last month, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.05%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the six-month timeframe, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 2.34%, reflecting overall market volatility. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3,648.43 and $4,137.17. The nearest resistance level is at $4,317.86, while the closest support is at $3,340.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 20.60, suggesting that ETH is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,622.00, which is below the 100-day average of $3,869.08, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If Ethereum manages to break above the resistance at $4,317.86, it could aim for the next target at $4,806.60, representing a possible increase of around 16%. On the downside, falling below the support at $3,340.38 might lead to a drop towards $2,851.64, which would be a decrease of approximately 22%. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge Ethereum’s next move. Conclusion ETH and other coins are strong, but XYZVerse’s sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans in the 2024 bull run’s biggest market shakeup.

With fresh concepts and growing communities, five standout tokens are positioning themselves as potential game-changers. These emerging cryptocurrencies could redefine fortunes by 2025, capturing attention beyond the usual favorites. Curious which names might dominate the next chapter? The spotlight is shifting—don’t miss out. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Brett: Cultural Icon and Mascot of Base Chain Brett is the mascot of Base Chain and a cultural symbol in the crypto space. It represents the expanding ecosystem of Base Chain, which hosts various projects and applications. This ecosystem offers a supportive environment for Brett to grow and potentially increase its role. As Base Chain develops, Brett may benefit from the broader resources and innovations within the platform. Its appeal in the market depends on the ongoing growth and adoption of Base Chain technology. BOME: A Memecoin Merging Culture and Decentralized Tech BOME, or the Book of Meme, is an experimental project combining memes, blockchain storage, and cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized platforms like Arweave, IPFS, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for permanent storage. The project aims to preserve and celebrate meme culture through its $BOME token on the Solana blockchain. By creating an unstoppable collection of digital content, it explores new possibilities for decentralized social media and online culture. The unique blend of creativity, technology, and community engagement positions the coin as an intriguing concept in the crypto market. Its appeal largely depends on user interest in meme culture and the broader market’s performance. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. It is inspired by the popular Dogwifhat meme and aims to provide a fun, community-driven experience. Meme coins often gain attention due to their ties to internet trends, with dog-related tokens being especially popular. WIF focuses on creating engagement through its community rather than offering utility like traditional cryptocurrencies. Its current appeal lies in its viral and lighthearted nature, traits that historically attract short-term investor interest. The coin’s potential depends on its ability to maintain online visibility and grow its community during this phase of the market. The technology behind Solana ensures fast and low-cost transactions, which may help the coin sustain user activity. Mew: A Unique Cryptocurrency with a Feline Focus Mew is a cryptocurrency themed around a cat navigating a market dominated by dog-related coins. It aims to stand out with a distinct identity and engage users through its creative concept. The coin seeks to build its own ecosystem while addressing gaps in the current market of meme coins. Its potential lies in offering differentiation and novelty in an oversaturated meme coin space. Whether Mew is an attractive option depends on market conditions, competition, and development progress. Conclusion BRETT, BOME, WIF, and MEW may appeal to some, but their potential is more limited short-term. DOGEN, however, stands out with a bold vision of luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by presale’s end and strong market aspirations, it positions itself as a top contender for massive gains and a community of driven leaders.

This recent price movement highlights the market’s ongoing volatility as investors grapple with shifting sentiment and technical levels. Despite the rebound, Bitcoin now faces a significant challenge in sustaining its upward momentum. Related Reading: XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity Analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling data revealing that Bitcoin encounters a massive resistance zone between $97,500 and $99,800. This “brick wall” is fortified by the activity of 924,000 wallets, which collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC in this range. Such strong on-chain resistance could hinder BTC’s ability to reclaim the psychological $100,000 level in the near term. This critical area will likely determine Bitcoin’s next move. Successfully breaking through this zone could pave the way for another rally, while failure to do so might lead to heightened selling pressure and a retest of lower support levels. As the market watches this pivotal phase unfolds, all eyes remain on key technical and on-chain signals to gauge whether Bitcoin’s recovery is sustainable or if a larger correction looms ahead. Bitcoin Holding Strong Bitcoin has experienced intense price swings over the past few days, with a 15% correction followed by a swift 6% bounce in under three days. This rapid movement highlights the serious volatility gripping the market, with Bitcoin mirroring the broader uncertainty. Despite the turbulence, there is growing optimism among analysts regarding Bitcoin’s outlook, as its recovery from aggressive selling pressure yesterday took only a few hours. Martinez shared key insights on X, shedding light on a significant resistance zone that Bitcoin must overcome to regain momentum. According to Martinez, Bitcoin faces a “brick wall” between $97,500 and $99,800. This range is fortified by 924,000 wallets that collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC within these levels. This substantial cluster of on-chain resistance could act as a barrier to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

For now, Bitcoin remains resilient, holding its ground amid market volatility, with many analysts cautiously optimistic about its potential for another rally. Technical Analysis Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,200, showing a strong recovery from the $92,000 mark, which has proven to be a significant demand level. This reaction from $92K signals strength in Bitcoin’s price action, indicating the potential for bullish momentum in the weeks ahead. If BTC manages to push above the critical $100,000 level in the coming days, it could trigger a massive surge, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs. This psychological and technical milestone is expected to ignite a wave of buying pressure as investors and traders anticipate the next leg of the rally. However, the market remains uncertain, and the possibility of Bitcoin entering a sideways consolidation phase cannot be ruled out. In this scenario, BTC could remain range-bound between its all-time highs and local lows, reflecting a period of accumulation as the market recalibrates after recent volatility.

Pompliano says in a FOX 5 interview that “2025 will continue to be a great year for Bitcoin.” According to the investor, two factors are likely to drive the price of Bitcoin to greater heights. “One, you’re going to continue to get printing of money both in the United States and globally. And then two is you have a Federal Reserve that is cutting interest rates. And as that M2 money supply grows and interest rates go down, you get cheap capital coming into the market.” Pompliano also explains why Bitcoin’s rising prices and increasing market cap make BTC “less risky” for deep-pocketed investors. “If you go back and you look at it when Bitcoin was at $1,000, there was plenty of these large capital pools that said, ‘This thing’s new, this thing is too small. I need to put tens of billions of dollars into an investment, I can’t do it with this, it’s too risky.’ Now as Bitcoin has gotten bigger and it’s gotten to a $2 trillion market cap, now all of a sudden everyone’s like, ‘Wait a second, I can put money in it. It’s derisked. This is an opportunity for me.’ And so as the price continues to go higher, more of these large pools of capital will come in. As large pools of capital come in to buy a finite-supply asset, price should continue to go up.” Bitcoin is trading at $97,363 at time of writing.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 21:03:00

While some folks are still hesitant about diving into the digital asset world , savvy investors are already taking massive returns. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—newer projects with game-changing tech and solid fundamentals are stealing the limelight. If you’re itching to find the best cryptos to join this weekend, you’re in the right place. One name-making wave in the crypto sphere is Qubetics ($TICS). With its presale gaining momentum and a future that looks brighter than the Las Vegas Strip, Qubetics is a project you can’t afford to overlook. Let’s dig into what makes Qubetics, alongside established giants like Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX), the hottest cryptos to invest in this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain and Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t your average crypto project. It’s a powerhouse redefining blockchain development while making it accessible to everyone—from tech newbies to seasoned developers. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,100 holders, raising a whopping $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, the potential upside is staggering. Analysts need to catch up on the numbers. They’re predicting $TICS could hit $10 or even $15 after the mainnet launch, boasting an ROI of up to 43,711%. For context, investing $50,000 today could potentially turn into a jaw-dropping $21.8 million. Don’t let that sink in for too long—opportunities like this don’t come daily. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its focus on “ Real World Asset Tokenisation .” Imagine being able to tokenise your real estate property, art collection, or even intellectual property. For businesses, this could mean raising funds faster than you can say “traditional banking” by offering fractional ownership to investors globally. Individuals? They get to liquefy high-value assets without losing control. Think about tokenising a family heirloom to pay for college or medical bills while keeping the sentimental value intact. It’s like having your cake and eating it, too. Beyond tokenisation, Qubetics is a one-stop shop for blockchain innovation. Its QubeQode IDE simplifies smart contract development, while the multi-chain wallet and decentralised VPN address key interoperability and privacy issues. In short, it’s a tech-driven ecosystem poised to drive Web3 adoption on a global scale. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchains Like a Pro Polkadot isn’t just another name in the crypto game; it’s a trailblazer. Known for its ability to connect different blockchains, Polkadot has carved out a niche that few can rival. The project’s focus on interoperability means developers and enterprises can build decentralised applications (dApps) that work across multiple blockchain networks seamlessly. It’s like building a Lego set where every piece fits perfectly, no matter where it comes from. Since its inception, Polkadot has been a go-to for investors who want a mix of innovation and stability. It’s not the flashiest crypto, but it’s reliable, which keeps it in the spotlight. DOT tokens have steadily risen in value, serving as a solid alternative investment for diversifying beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Its staking mechanism is another feather in its cap, rewarding holders with a consistent income stream. Polkadot’s parachain auctions have been a game-changer, allowing projects to secure dedicated slots on its network. This unique approach has turned Polkadot into a launchpad for promising blockchain projects, adding layers of value to its ecosystem. Whether you’re a casual investor or a hardcore trader, Polkadot offers something for everyone. Looking ahead, Polkadot’s ability to adapt and grow makes it a prime candidate for long-term portfolios. DOT should be on your radar if you’re after one of the best cryptos to join this weekend. Avalanche (AVAX): The Speed Demon of Blockchains Regarding speed and scalability, Avalanche is in a league of its own. Launched to tackle Ethereum’s congestion, Avalanche has quickly become a favourite among developers and investors. Its high-performance blockchain can handle over 4,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. Avalanche’s recent ‘Avalanche9000’ upgrade is a testament to its commitment to innovation. By lowering transaction fees and introducing cost-effective subnets, Avalanche is establishing itself as a developer’s dream platform. Projects building on Avalanche benefit from its efficiency, and users enjoy lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. It’s a win-win. From DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces, Avalanche has its hands in every pie. The ecosystem’s growth has been phenomenal, attracting big-name investors and developers. If you’ve been sleeping on AVAX, now might be the time to wake up. It’s trading just 20% below its all-time high, teasing a breakout that could soar prices. Avalanche’s appeal lies in its ability to deliver what it promises. It’s not just a hype machine; it’s a project with real-world utility and a robust community. Whether you’re into staking, trading, or just holding for the long haul, Avalanche is a strong contender among the best cryptos to join this weekend. Conclusion The crypto market moves fast, and hesitation can cost you. Qubetics offers a golden opportunity to get in early on a project with massive upside. Meanwhile, Polkadot and Avalanche are proven players who continue delivering value. These projects represent a mix of innovation, reliability, and potential that’s hard to beat. Don’t sit on the sidelines. Head to Qubetics’ presale page now, or grab some DOT and AVAX from your favourite exchange. The best cryptos to join this weekend won’t wait around forever, so why should you?

Here’s why. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is often likened to “digital gold,” with its fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a potential hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. And nowadays, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. It can balance exposure to traditional assets like cash, stocks, and bonds. Bitcoin is also one of the most liquid assets globally, and its historical performance has shown significant long-term value appreciation — it reached an all-time high of over $108,000 on Dec. 17 . But there’s no shortage of risks. A board might avoid adopting a Bitcoin treasury due to the coin’s extreme price volatility, which can lead to substantial losses during downturns. Also, regulatory uncertainties pose potential threats as governments refine crypto policies. Additionally, liquidity challenges during market slumps can amplify price drops when offloading assets. So it’s no wonder that, on Dec. 10, Microsoft’s board channeled the long-standing crypto skepticism of its co-founder, Bill Gates, and recommended ditching the proposa for a Bitcoin trasury. Gates himself has famously dismissed crypto as “100% based on greater fool theory” — ouch. Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor was busy trying to woo Microsoft when he touted Bitcoin’s own meteoric returns and bragged about MicroStrategy’s stock soaring after their BTC splurge. His pitch? Bitcoin could boost Microsoft’s market cap while acting as a financial guardian angel. Microsoft’s response? No, thanks. Meanwhile, at least 10 other companies are embracing the MicroStrategy playbook. Table of Contents Genius Group Worksport Amazon MicroStrategy Marathon Digital Holdings Tesla Coinbase Hut 8 Mining Corp Block Inc. OneMedNet Genius Group Genius Group, an AI-powered education group, announced in November that it had completed the purchase of 110 Bitcoin for $10 million, at an average price of $90,932 per Bitcoin. The purchase made good on a promise to employ what it called a “Bitcoin-first” strategy where it planed to commit 90% or more of its current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million in Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company bolstered its Bitcoin treasury by acquiring 194 Bitcoin worth $18 million at an average price of $92,728 per Bitcoin. Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton credited Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury plan for the inspiration, adding that “more companies will see the benefits of establishing a Bitcoin treasury, and will be equipped with the clear steps to follow.” Worksport Worksport, a U.S.-based provider of pickup truck solutions, is adding cyptocurency to its corporate treasury strategy. The Nasdaq-listed company announced on Dec. 5 that it would be adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP ( XRP ) to its treasury assets. This follows a resolution by the company’s board of directors, which approved an initial purchase of $5 million worth of BTC and XRP. Worksport is committing 10% of its excess operational cash to this corporate pivot, it said in the announcement. “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement,” Steven Rossi, chief executive officer of Worksport, said. Amazon Amazon shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research , are urging the Seattle-based company’s board to assess the potential benefits of adding Bitcoin to the company’s financial strategy. The proposal, submitted on Dec. 6, aims to explore whether Bitcoin could protect and enhance shareholder value, especially amid persistent inflation and declining yields from traditional assets. The National Center emphasizes Bitcoin’s robust performance—131% growth in the past year and 1,246% over five years—as evidence of its potential as an inflation hedge and a growth asset. The initiative also highlights concerns about the diminishing purchasing power of Amazon’s $88 billion cash reserves due to average inflation of 4.95% over the past four years. This move represents a broader trend of shareholder proposals influencing corporate policies, leveraging shareholder rights to advocate for financial strategies that address economic risks and enhance long-term value. MicroStrategy Perhaps the most vocal of all Bitcoin fans is MicroStrategy’s Saylor who, as of this past week, increased the company’s total holdings to 439,000. As a result, Saylor has officially strengthening MicroStrategy’s position as the top corporate BTC holder, considering it a long-term store of value. Saylor, during an appearance on the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, even voiced his willingness to advise President-elect Donald Trump on crafting a digital assets policy for the U.S. But Saylor continues to draw scrutiny: Analyst Jacob King has labeled MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused business model a “giant scam,” claiming it is unsustainable and destined for collapse. MicroStrategy’s business model is a giant scam and relies on a reflexive loop: it issues debt or equity to buy BTC, which drives BTC’s price higher. This increases MSTR’s market cap, boosts its index weight, and attracts more sheep investors. With a higher valuation, it issues… pic.twitter.com/Owyi7mCHaO — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 17, 2024 Marathon Digital Holdings As one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies, Marathon owns 44,394 BTC. Its business model revolves entirely around mining and holding Bitcoin as part of its assets​. Back in July, the company confirmed it will adopt “a full HODL approach” towards its Bitcoin treasury policy, retaining all that it mines within its operations, in addition to its open market purchases. “Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin,” CEO Fred Thiel stated. “We believe bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Tesla Tesla initially bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in 2021 and currently holds 9,720 BTC. While the Elon Musk-led company remains a significant corporate holder​. BitcoinTreasuries data shows that Tesla is the fourth-largest holder of Bitcoin among U.S. public companies with crypto treasuries (MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms are believed to hold more). In October, the electric vehicle company reportedly moved $765 million worth of Bitcoin to unidentified wallets. Coinbase The cryptocurrency exchange holds 9,480 BTC as part of its reserves, leveraging its position as a major player in the digital asset ecosystem​. The Brian Armstrong-led firm holds large amounts of Bitcoin as an exchange and converter. It’s also a trusted institution for custody services, and counts the Bitcoin ETF coterie of BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares, Invesco, Valkyrie, Wisdom Tree and Franklin Templeton among its clients. Therefore, Coinbase has a Bitcoin treasury for itself and oversees others. Hut 8 Mining Corp On Thursday, crypto.news reported that Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, added 990 Bitcoin to its reserves. The company spent roughly $100 million to increase its total holdings to 10,096 BTC. The reserve, now valued at over $1 billion, places Hut 8 among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company, under the guidance of CEO Asher Genoot, purchased the coins at an average price of $101,710, significantly higher than its cumulative acquisition cost of $24,484 per Bitcoin. Block Inc. The startup (formerly Square) holds 8,027 BTC as part of its strategy to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream finance. The Jack Dorsey-founded company is so bullish on Bitcoin that, last month, it confirmed a company-wide pivot towards the cryptocurrency mining sector. Block decided to dial down resources towards music streaming service TIDAL, and sunset TBD, a venture focusing on decentralizing the internet, to focus on expanding its presence in the Bitcoin mining sector. Block acquired TIDAL in a 2021 acquisition for roughly $300 million. The platform has continued to struggle, with reports indicating workforce reductions and a $132.3 million impairment charge . OneMedNet OneMedNet Corp., as of Nov. 12, owns some 34 Bitcoins. Off The Chain Capital, an investor in OneMedNet, was also inspired by Saylor, betting that Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge but a springboard for its healthcare data innovation. Aaron Green, the company’s CEO, stated, “By continuing to invest a portion of our assets into Bitcoin, we aim to not only safeguard our financial stability but also fuel the ongoing development and innovation within our iRWD platform.” Read more: Bitcoin blitz: Odell Beckham Jr. and 6 other NFL stars betting big on blockchain",Feature|Bitcoin|michael saylor|Microsoft|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-21 21:43:58

BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Massive Potential When it comes to the top meme coins for massive income, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto space. With its presale raising over $4.2 million, the coin has demonstrated an incredibly strong demand right from the start.

One of the most exciting aspects of Mog Coin is its utility in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Speaking in a debate with a smug DOD official, the comedian pointed out the puzzling disparity between the Pentagon's massive budget and the daily struggles of low-ranked service members, some of whom still rely on government assistance to get food on the table. “We got out of 20 years of war, and the Pentagon got a raise,” Stewart put bluntly. “I can’t figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that’s f*cking corruption.” John Deaton gained recognition in the crypto community for his support of Ripple Labs and its cryptocurrency, XRP, where he filed an amicus brief on behalf of XRP holders, arguing that the SEC’s classification of the cryptocurrency as a security unfairly harmed retail investors. Deaton is also a founder of CryptoLaw, a legal platform meant to be a one-stop shop for public information, links to news articles, and probing analysis on the regulatory landscape of the US crypto industry. As a Republican candidate in Massachusetts, Deaton tried to unseat staunch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren in the 2024 US Senate elections, albeit unsuccessfully. While not necessarily warranted against all government agencies, Deaton's frustration at the federal government's inefficacies is at least understandable in the context of his protracted legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency recently sued a US-based crypto project, Dragonchain, alleging that its foundation conducted a $16.5 million unregistered offering of DRGN tokens. The court filing indicated the SEC’s readiness to pursue the case despite Chair Gensler’s imminent departure scheduled for the Inauguration Day on January 20. The incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins is expected to enforce the Trump administration's pro-crypto agenda. For context, the Department of Government Efficiency, named after the mercurial billionaire’s favorite cryptocurrency, will be co-led by Elon Musk himself, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and House GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. While the “department” in its name may suggest that D.O.G.E will be a full-fledged government agency, President-elect Donald Trump said that it will “provide advice and guidance from outside of government,” suggesting that D.O.G.E. will function more as an independent advisory body. Musk’s role being informal will also allow him to remain the head of his electric car maker Tesla, social media platform X, and rocket company SpaceX without raising inevitable questions about potential conflicts of interest. D.O.G.E’s primary focus will be to identify inefficiencies in federal spending, pawing the way for the new administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” as per Trump’s statement. The work of the department will conclude no later than July 4, 2026, which is the date of the 250th anniversary of The US Declaration of Independence. Ripple donates $5 million to Trump’s inauguration Meanwhile, the US crypto companies, including Ripple, are doubling down on their financial support for Donald Trump, pledging millions to his inauguration celebrations. The three-day-long event will feature galas, parades, and dinners celebrating Trump's win alongside Vice President-elect JD Vance According to Fox News , blockchain payment firm Ripple contributed $5 million in XRP tokens. Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken donated $1 million each, while digital asset payment provider MoonPay vowed to donate an undisclosed amount. Interestingly, Ripple’s chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen has been one of the top contributors to Kamala Harris’ campaign, donating more than $11 million to the Future Forward PAC supporting her presidency bid. Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was reportedly one of the first crypto execs to score a one-to-one meeting with Donald Trump days after his win. The millions flowing from the crypto firms are just a tiny part of the record-breaking $200 million already raised by the inaugural fund, surpassing Trump’s first term's $107 million and trouncing Biden’s $62 million. A source close to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee expressed confidence that they will be able to reach a $225 milestone by Inauguration Day. The big tech joined alongside crypto companies in contributing to the fund, with top business executives such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and OpenAI's Sam Altman each donating $1 million. “Amazon donates $1 million while Ripple donates $5M,” John Deaton posted on X in response to the news. “New era.”",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-21 21:48:02

The collaboration will introduce the world’s first lithium tokenization project, a disruptive initiative scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. Mechanics of Tokenization According to local reports , the project will use blockchain technology to convert the property rights of lithium into digital tokens. This will allow investors to trade fractional shares of the mineral without physically handling or owning it. The process is intended to democratize resource access, improve liquidity, and facilitate international trade through secure and immutable blockchain-based transactions. Argentina is home to some of the world’s largest lithium deposits, with most concentrated in Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy. The metal is not only a cornerstone of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage but also critical in the global transition to cleaner energy. Some analysts estimate that the EV industry alone could be worth a mind-blowing $1.3 trillion in the next three years, fueled by growing worldwide demand. While the country’s ore export is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2025, the sector is still facing challenges related to accountability in the supply chain. To address this, the tokenization project will facilitate greater traceability and authenticity of the material, helping reduce the risk of fraud and ensuring ethical and environmental standards are met. It will also help improve collaboration between the Argentine government and mining firms, ensuring they adhere to transparent and ecologically friendly practices. Opportunities for Argentina Tokenizing real-world assets like minerals could become a multi-billion dollar endeavor by the end of the decade. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggested such assets could represent at least 1% of the global mutual fund and ETF market by 2030, translating into a $600 billion business. Speaking exclusively to CryptoPotato, Atómico 3 founder Pablo Rutigliano highlighted the economic and environmental significance of the tokenization initiative, saying: “Blockchain’s distributed ledger allows stakeholders to trace the provenance of lithium, ensuring it is ethically and sustainably sourced. For instance, stakeholders can confirm adherence to local labor laws, environmental standards, and water usage metrics, which are crucial concerns in Argentina’s lithium-rich regions.” According to him, the project will benefit both local and international communities. The initiative is a chance for economic inclusion, job creation, and fair revenue distribution for the country’s mining sector. Rutigliano believes the venture will allow profits to reach local producers and communities by reducing reliance on intermediaries. Furthermore, he said that introducing blockchain-based platforms will create demand for tech-savvy roles and training opportunities. For investors, a tokenized version of the metal improves market accessibility by enabling fractional ownership and 24/7 trading, boosting liquidity and reducing transaction costs.

As announced by the protocol on its official X account, the chain has produced 1,000,000 blocks. With this impressive milestone, the community demands have increased with calls for a bridge to connect with other networks. Sonic Chain by The Numbers In an earlier update, the protocol shared the Transaction Per Second (TPS) recorded by early users thus far. Notably, core developer Andre Cronje spotlighted an 850 TPS despite the network not operating at full speed yet. However, sealaunch onchain explorers noted that the Sonic Chain scored a 1,620 TPS on December 18. As Andre Cronje revealed, the “safety mode” is currently active for the new layer-1 scaling solution. This mode was introduced to let enough validators get onboarded to the network. In all, most of the figures are independently recorded and might change as the Sonic Chain matures. The Sonic mainnet went live on December 18 after months of active development. This protocol is Fantom’s evolutionary response marked by the transition to Sonic Labs earlier in September. With the official launch, the broader industry has kept a keen eye on what the protocol may have to offer. Top industry personalities including Ran Neuner have endorsed the chain as one of the fastest in the ecosystem. To further turbocharge its growth, Sonic Labs has proposed that the Uniswap DAO allocate 250,000 UNI as liquidity mining rewards for its validators. As part of the proposal, this 250,000 UNI will complete its 500,000 S allocation for the same purpose. We’re proposing that @Uniswap DAO allocate 250k of UNI as liquidity mining rewards in addition to our 500k in S. The era of DeFi on Sonic is nearing. https://t.co/T8QUjYc8d5 pic.twitter.com/0v3dw2CEj3 — Sonic Labs (@SonicLabs) December 20, 2024 Triggering Layer 1 and 2 Networks The broader digital currency ecosystem is preparing for a new era in the crypto world that would be marked by more proactive policies. As such, every protocol hopes to capture as much of the market share as possible amid a pro-crypto led administration Donald Trump is courting. Sonic Chain will look to compete with top rivals including Ethereum, Solana, XRP Ledger and Layer-2 gamechangers like Base Network. While it has received a good start, it remains uncertain how well it can catch up with protocol like Base that currently dominates the Ethereum TVL scene.

Such developments could mark a transformative phase for Ripple and its XRP token, elevating its status among institutional and retail investors alike. However, while XRP price gathers attention, investors and traders are shifting their focus to PropiChain , a revolutionary altcoin positioned to deliver an unprecedented 30,000% growth by early 2025. As the spotlight shines brighter on Ripple and its competitors, PropiChain emerges as a powerful player, disrupting industries far beyond the financial sector. XRP Price Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation The XRP Price has experienced a notable bump in recent weeks, largely fueled by speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval. This comes after the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple saw significant breakthroughs, boosting confidence in XRP’s regulatory future. Why an XRP ETF Matters Increased Accessibility: An ETF would make XRP investments easier for institutional and retail investors, driving liquidity and demand. Institutional Adoption: Similar to Bitcoin ETFs, an XRP ETF could trigger significant institutional inflows, further stabilizing and boosting its price. Market Legitimacy: ETF approval signals regulatory acceptance, potentially paving the way for other crypto-focused financial products. While the XRP Price rallies on ETF optimism, analysts warn that significant gains may already be priced in. This leaves traders seeking untapped opportunities in emerging altcoins like PropiChain , where growth potential remains exponential. PropiChain: The Altcoin Set to Dominate PropiChain is a blockchain-based platform redefining real estate investments in a market valued at over $300 trillion. PropiChain’s innovative ecosystem combines blockchain, AI, and tokenization to solve major inefficiencies in the real estate sector. Features That Make PropiChain Stand Out PropiChain is a trailblazer in the crypto space, offering features that directly benefit investors: AI-Powered Market Insights: PropiChain’s advanced AI tools analyze global real estate markets in real-time, identifying undervalued properties and emerging opportunities. Tokenized Real Estate: By tokenizing properties, PropiChain allows investors to buy and sell fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and flexibility. Metaverse Integration: PropiChain is pioneering virtual property tours and global networking events in the metaverse, enhancing the buyer and seller experience. Security Audits: PropiChain’s infrastructure has been rigorously tested and certified, including a comprehensive BlockAudit review , ensuring top-tier security for its users. Global Listings: PropiChain’s CoinMarketCap listing adds to its credibility and market visibility, attracting a broader investor base. PropiChain Presale: A Huge Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. This marks a critical juncture for early adopters, as the price will jump to $0.023 in Stage 3. Why the Presale is a Game-Changer Low Entry Point: At just $0.011 per token, even small investments can yield massive returns. For instance, a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to over $300,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected price of $7.15. Exponential Growth: Analysts predict PropiChain could mirror early Bitcoin or XRP growth trajectories, making this presale a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Limited Supply: With a finite number of tokens available, demand is expected to outpace supply rapidly, driving prices even higher. XRP vs. PropiChain: A Comparative Analysis While the XRP Price remains a focal point for many crypto enthusiasts, PropiChain offers distinct advantages that make it a compelling alternative: Utility Beyond Finance: Unlike XRP, which focuses on cross-border payments, PropiChain addresses the vast and underserved real estate market. Higher Growth Potential: XRP price growth may be capped due to its existing market penetration, while PropiChain’s untapped potential offers significantly higher returns. Investor Accessibility: PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows anyone to participate, whereas XRP requires a more traditional investment approach. Why Now is the Right Time The clock is ticking for those looking to secure PropiChain tokens at the current presale price of $0.011. With its next stage price set at $0.023, early investors stand to benefit significantly from getting in now. Historical Comparisons: PropiChain’s growth potential mirrors XRP price’s early days when it surged from $0.002 to over $3 within months. Life-Changing Returns: Even a modest $500 investment in PropiChain today could grow to over $165,000 by 2025. Upcoming Milestones: As PropiChain completes its presale and launches its platform, demand is expected to skyrocket, making this the lowest price you’ll ever see for this token. Conclusion While the XRP Price continues to make headlines, the real opportunity lies with PropiChain, a groundbreaking altcoin disrupting the real estate industry. Its innovative features, robust ecosystem, and rare growth potential make it a must-have in any investor’s portfolio. With the presale in full swing and token prices set to increase, the time to act is now. Don’t miss this chance to be part of something this big!

The doctor-patient communications platform ConnectOnCall, owned by health tech firm Phreesia, says 914,138 users are affected, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. In a statement, the firm says the breach exposed records shared in communications between doctors and patients including full names, phone numbers, dates of birth, health conditions, treatments, medications as well as Social Security numbers. “ConnectOnCall’s investigation revealed that between February 16, 2024, and May 12, 2024, an unknown third party had access to ConnectOnCall and certain data within the application, including certain information in provider-patient communications… ConnectOnCall took the ConnectOnCall product offline and has been working through a phased restoration of the product in a new, more secure environment.” ConnectOnCall allows patients to contact their doctors via text, phone call or telehealth for concerns about prescriptions, lab results and other medical issues. The firm sent letters to affected users earlier this month to shed light on the security incident while offering identity and credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security numbers were stolen. ConnectOnCall says users should stay alert and immediately report any suspicious activity related to identity theft or healthcare fraud.

These machines, built to mimic human form and function, are no longer clunky prototypes stumbling over simple tasks. Now they’re equipped with advanced AI systems that enable them to perform real-world jobs, from factory lines to warehouses. And here’s the thing, some analysts think these robots could replace human workers on a massive scale by the end of the decade. “Breakthroughs in generative AI are giving robots the ability to see, think, and act,” said Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia’s VP of Omniverse and simulation technology. He’s not exaggerating. Sectors like manufacturing, retail, and logistics are already exploring how humanoid robots can fill critical gaps. A trillion-dollar race is on Wall Street is starting to catch on to the financial potential of humanoid robots. Citigroup predicts the humanoid robot market could hit $7 trillion by 2050, with over 1.19 billion of these machines in use globally. Morgan Stanley projects a slightly less 63 million robots by the same year. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates a $38 billion market by 2035. Analysts believe humanoid robots could eclipse autonomous vehicles in market potential. Tesla’s share price has already soared due to its work in AI and autonomy, but it’s clear that humanoid robots could be an even bigger opportunity. According to Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, the adoption curve for humanoid robots might move faster than robotaxis because these machines can immediately tackle repetitive and dangerous jobs. “The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable,” Jonas said. The Tesla wildcard Tesla, under the ever-controversial Elon Musk, has its eyes on the humanoid prize. The company’s Optimus robot was first revealed in 2021, but its capabilities were widely criticized for being underwhelming. Fast forward to today, and Tesla’s robotics ambitions are much more serious. Musk claims these robots could eventually make Tesla worth a mind-blowing $25 trillion. Tesla’s close ties to the incoming Trump administration will likely give it a massive edge. Analysts believe federal support for robotics could mirror previous subsidies for the semiconductor industry. Trump’s hardline immigration policies might also drive demand for automation, further boosting Tesla ’s robotics division. Nvidia powers the brains Behind many of these humanoid robots is Nvidia, the chipmaker that’s quietly dominating the AI space. Nvidia’s Project GR00T is a robotics platform that includes everything from AI models to simulation tools. XPeng, Boston Dynamics, and other robotics leaders are using this platform to accelerate their development. Nvidia also launched the Jetson Thor supercomputer earlier this year, designed specifically for robots. These technologies are important because humanoid robots need immense computational power to get through human-centric environments like homes and workplaces. According to Lebaredian, the company is working on GR00T models for motion control, whole-body coordination, and sensing, all of which are essential for humanoid robots to function effectively. While factories and warehouses are natural starting points, the real value of humanoid robots lies in consumer applications. Imagine robots that can babysit your kids, clean your house, or even cook your dinner. Some analysts believe this is where the big money is. This change won’t happen overnight though, but the groundwork is already being laid. Companies like Xiaomi are exploring how robots can fit seamlessly into our daily lives.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

The updated policy will permit advertisers offering crypto exchange products and services to run ads in the UK, provided they meet specific requirements. Google stated that ads for crypto exchanges and software wallets will only be allowed if the businesses are registered with the FCA. The policy will also extend to hardware wallets designed to store private keys for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other digital assets. However, ads for hardware wallets will only be permitted if they do not offer additional services such as buying, selling, or trading. While Google did not outline further requirements for hardware wallet advertisers, it emphasized the need to adhere to local regulations. “As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” Google stated. This means advertisers aiming to promote crypto-related products on Google must familiarize themselves with local regulations in their target jurisdictions and fulfill the necessary requirements set by financial regulators. The policy change comes amidst increased efforts by regulators to combat unauthorized crypto promotions.

Why $99,800 Is An Important Resistance To Break",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-above-100000-again-why-99800-is-an-important-resistance-to-break/,"The Bitcoin price is approaching the $100,000 level again after experiencing significant declines these past weeks. A crypto analyst has pointed out that the critical resistance level at $99,800 is crucial for Bitcoin’s next move. If the pioneer cryptocurrency can break through this level, it could trigger a significant breakout, potentially propelling Bitcoin past the $100,000 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance At $99,800 Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a chart showing an In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) analysis of the distribution of Bitcoin wallets based on their purchase price. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is facing extreme resistance between the $97,500 and $99,800 price levels as it tries to breach $100,000 again. Martinez noted that around this price range, approximately 923,890 wallet addresses had purchased over 1.19 million BTC. This price zone acts as an important resistance level because many Bitcoin holders may look to sell and break even, potentially exerting selling pressure. In the IOMAP chart shared by Martinez, the green dots that signal ‘In the Money’ represent price levels below the current Bitcoin price, where wallet holders are in profit because they bought BTC at a lower value. On the other hand, the red dots that represent ‘Out of the Money’ show price levels of Bitcoin’s present value, where wallet holders are at a loss because they bought BTC at a higher price. Lastly, the white dot indicates ‘At the Money’ and represents the current price of Bitcoin at an average of $98,676, where some crypto wallets see neither profit nor loss. Below Bitcoin’s current price, the chart shows strong buying zones, which could provide strong support if the pioneer cryptocurrency experiences a potential pullback. Martinez has forecasted that breaking through the critical resistance range between $97,500 and $99,800 would signal the start of a bullish rally for Bitcoin, potentially leading it to a new all-time high. Currently, the Bitcoin price is trading at $98,652, steadily rising to return to previous highs above $100,000. To a new all-time high, Bitcoin will have to surge by over 7%, surpassing its present ATH above $104,000.

According to the authorities, the duo have been indicted for defrauding investors of over $22 million in crypto. A String of Broken Promises The U.S. attorney’s office states that between May 2021 and May 2024, the Southern California men engaged in “rug pull” schemes. They collected investments for Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital asset projects. However, the two men were not interested in actualizing the promises made to the investors. According to the prosecutor, in connivance with a yet-to-be-named co-conspirator, the duo collected $22.4 million from multiple rug pull schemes. These individuals, however, had no plans to see the projects through. Vault of Gems, Hay, and Mayo claimed it would be pegged to hard assets in one of their NFT projects. The men told their investors that the project had been designed to work with jewelers worldwide. They deceived investors with claims that Vault of Gems was already making its exchange to serve jewelry retailers. How Investors Discovered the Crypto Fraud Some investors first got a hint of the rug pull in a post on the Vault of Gems’ X account. To engage the community, the account had posted, “What’s happening?” in November 2021. The responses from members of the community alerted others to the fact that Hay and Mayo deleted parts of a community Discord channel. The channel served as a convergence platform for investors. One of the users, Mal (@MalPachinko) response, alleged that Hay and Mayo failed to deliver on the roadmap. Mal noted that the duo left about 1,900 token owners holding the bag with no hopes of recovering their investments. Analysts say the incident highlights why users in the crypto space need to familiarize themselves with different fraudulent schemes and how to avoid them . California Authority Assures Justice The authorities are accusing Hay and Mayo of transferring cryptocurrency realized from their projects into their wallets. This is part of the scheme to defraud their unsuspecting investors. Aside from the Vault of Gems rug pull scheme, others they carried out included projects titled Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Faceless, Uncovered, Dirty Dogs, and many more. Rug pull schemes come in various forms, including loss of value, as in the SnowdogDAO incident . Principal Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Nicole Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, promised to protect investors. Argentieri also assured the department would do everything possible to eliminate crypto fraud and bring offenders to justice.

33767162,[object Object],1734822004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Price Crash To $2 Marks End Of Bearish 2nd Wave – Factors To Drive Bullish 3rd Wave,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-crash-to-2-marks-end-of-bearish-2nd-wave/,"Crypto analyst TradinSides has revealed that the recent XRP crash to $2 could have ended the bearish 2nd wave. With that out of the way, the crypto analyst mentioned the factors that could drive the wave 3 impulsive move to the upside. XRP Price Crash Ends Bearish 2nd Wave In a TradingView post , TradingSides stated that the XRP price retest of the $2 level could be the end of the second wave in the Elliot Wave of XRP’s bullish cycle. With Wave 2 likely done, Wave 3’s impulsive move to the upside will take place anytime from now. The crypto analyst outlined five factors on which this bullish potential is based. First, the analyst cited the recent launch of Ripple’s RLUSD as one of the factors that could drive the Wave 3 move for the XRP price. The stablecoin launch has undoubtedly provided a bullish outlook for XRP, especially considering how its price surged following the RLUSD launch on December 17. Another factor that the crypto analyst listed is Donald Trump’s embrace of altcoins. The US president-elect has already declared his pro-crypto stance and is expected to create a regulatory-friendly environment for these altcoins once he takes office on January 20. The XRP price could make significant gains on the back of this event, as Ripple was one of the major crypto donors to Donald Trump’s campaign and his incoming inauguration. TradinSides also listed the appointment of pro-crypto Paul Atkins as another factor that provides bullish potential for the XRP price. Atkin’s administration is expected to end the Commission’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto industry. This could lead to the SEC dropping its appeal against Ripple, another factor the crypto analyst mentioned could provide a major boost for the XRP price. Lastly, the analyst outlined the approval of the XRP ETFs as a factor that could drive XRP’s third wave to the upside. Analysis Of Higher Timeframes In an X post, crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provided an in-depth XRP price analysis based on the higher timeframes. For the yearly candle, the analyst noted that a close above $1.99 would be a game-changer. He added that the $1.99 target marks the 2017-yearly candle body closure, and a close above that would be a historical moment for XRP. While analyzing the six-month chart, Egrag Crypto stated that the XRP price is now steadier, with lower risk and more stable growth than in the 2017 cycle. He predicts that XRP will experience more sustainable price growth this time around. For his 3-month chart analysis, Egrag Crypto stated that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in this timeframe still has plenty of room to expand. He added that the XRP price has already crossed the 70 mark, which is “extremely bullish,” and that the crypto still has two more bullish targets at 87 and 96. Lastly, for the 2-month timeframe, the crypto analyst stated that the XRP price is above the Equilibrium. The last time this happened, XRP saw a massive 13x price increase. In line with this, the analyst remarked that a rally to $13 looks “super easy” to reach. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.36, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

But for many investors, it became a story of missed opportunities, as its value soared beyond reach. If you’re still regretting missing out on ICP, don’t worry— Qubetics is here, and it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in blockchain technology. With its innovative solutions like the non-custodial wallet, Qubetics is addressing key challenges in the crypto world while offering investors a chance to get in early. With analysts predicting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet launch, now might be the time to make your move. The Evolution of Blockchain: From ICP to Qubetics ICP captured the market’s attention with its promise of decentralised internet services, but it wasn’t without its limitations. As blockchain technology evolves, new projects are emerging to build on ICP’s foundation while solving its shortcomings. Enter Qubetics—a platform designed to offer unmatched usability, security, and scalability in the blockchain ecosystem. ICP’s groundbreaking idea of decentralised web services paved the way for Qubetics. However, ICP’s rapid growth highlighted significant challenges, including scalability and ease of use for everyday applications. Qubetics builds on these lessons, delivering a blockchain platform that is accessible, secure, and ready for mass adoption. Qubetics introduces tools like its non-custodial wallet to simplify blockchain interactions for users and developers. Unlike traditional wallets that require third-party oversight, the Qubetics wallet empowers users to maintain full control over their assets. This innovation aligns perfectly with the blockchain ethos of decentralisation and trustless systems, making Qubetics an attractive option for both investors and developers. Why Qubetics Stands Out The blockchain market is competitive, but Qubetics is setting itself apart with its forward-thinking technology and community-driven approach. Blockchain adoption has faced hurdles such as complex user experiences and scalability issues. Platforms like ICP brought these challenges to light, and Qubetics is here with solutions. Its non-custodial wallet ensures that users retain ownership of their digital assets, removing the need for intermediaries. This feature not only improves security but also enhances trust among users. The market response to Qubetics has been overwhelmingly positive. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $7.4 million and sold 365 million $TICS tokens, priced at just $0.0311. With over 11,100 token holders, the project has built a strong community, reflecting confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts Are Bullish: $10–$15 Predictions for $TICS It’s rare for a project to capture both market excitement and analyst confidence, but Qubetics has done just that. Experts predict that $TICS tokens could reach $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, thanks to Qubetics’ technological edge and growing adoption. The non-custodial wallet, for instance, is a game-changer for crypto users seeking security and simplicity. Combined with Qubetics’ scalability solutions, this innovation positions $TICS as a token with real-world utility—an essential factor for sustained growth in the crypto space. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Pass You By If you missed out on ICP, don’t let history repeat itself. Qubetics offers a second chance to be part of a blockchain revolution, combining cutting-edge technology with a user-centric approach. The current presale stage is your opportunity to secure $TICS tokens at just $0.034 before prices potentially skyrocket. With predictions of $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the time to act is now. Qubetics isn’t just following in ICP’s footsteps; it’s carving out its own path as a blockchain leader. Whether you’re an investor or a tech enthusiast, this is your chance to ride the next wave of innovation. Visit the Qubetics presale platform today and claim your stake in the future of blockchain.

His proposal reflects how digital currencies are gaining more acceptance, even from skeptics and critics. For years, Peter Schiff, vocal Bitcoin critic. He has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, generates no income, and is driven purely by speculation. Even called it as “Bubble.” Schiff’s shift on proposing USA coin Yet, there is a twist, Schiff has recently proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin,” instead of Bitcoin Reserve, which is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. Could this sudden shift in his perspective reveal contradictions in long-standing criticism and indicate a selective acceptance of cryptocurrency principles? Schiff has always been an opponent of Bitcoin, emphasizing its limitations as an asset. According to him, Bitcoin is inability to generate income makes it inferior to traditional assets like real estate, which produce rents that can cover debt payments. He has also dismissed Bitcoin as a store of value, arguing that its price surges are driven by hype and FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than fundamental stability, even after it reached $100,000. Schiff criticized the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposed by some U.S. policymakers and Senator Cynthia Lummis being a part. Especially, the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve to clear the national debt. Schiff argued that this move would destabilize the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar, warning that government involvement in Bitcoin could lead to hyperinflation. From Bitcoin critic to advocate of centralized digital currency Despite his opposition to Bitcoin, Schiff has now proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin.” According to him, the coin could have a capped supply of 21 million as same as Bitcoin, but with an upgraded blockchain to make it viable for everyday payments. So, that could make all rich. This proposal seems to reflect Schiff’s partial acceptance of cryptocurrency concepts while rejecting Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. Ultimately Schiff’e idea of USA Coin opposes Bitcoin’s core principle: decentralization. By proposing USA coin, the U.S. government create and control the currency, So, he favors centralized authority and security over Bitcoin’s trustless and decentralized system. Schiff’s proposal questions his real motives. For years, he called Bitcoin a risky bubble driven by influencers and early investors trying to get rich quickly. But, by suggesting a USA Coin, he’s indirectly admitting that digital currencies have value and potential. His problem with Bitcoin’s decentralization seems less about the technology and more about wanting government control. This change shows Schiff may not fully reject digital currencies but dislikes Bitcoin’s lack of rules and central authority. His idea for a government-backed cryptocurrency shows he thinks digital assets need support from a trusted source to be safe and reliable. If Bitcoin became centralized or controlled by the government, would critics like Schiff support it? This reminds of many current adopters and influencers were once a big skeptic and critic, right from the President -elect Trump. Schiff often criticizes Bitcoin because it operates outside traditional banks and government control. Yet, his idea for a USA Coin shows he might accept cryptocurrency if it fits his preference for centralized authority. By suggesting a government-backed digital currency, Schiff seems interested in being part of the growing world of digital assets. Schiff’s mixed views show a bigger debate in finance about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin supporters see its decentralized model as a way to give people more power and rely less on traditional systems. But critics like Schiff think government support is needed for trust and stability. His idea for a USA Coin also shows how digital currencies are becoming more accepted, even by sceptics. It shows how Bitcoin’s growth has made critics rethink their views, even if they don’t fully agree with it. Peter Schiff’s proposal for a USA Coin shows a shift in his views on cryptocurrency. While he still criticizes Bitcoin’s decentralization, he supports a government-backed alternative, hinting at his preference for control. His evolving stance reflects the growing influence of digital currencies, even among critics.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 23:52:00

The cryptocurrency has steadily gained ground, attracting attention. As the price approaches the critical $4.98 resistance, the potential for a breakout looms. A successful move above this level could trigger a new phase of bullish momentum, setting the stage for the token to achieve new highs. Specifically, the $4.98 has been a key barrier in recent trading, and breaking through it would be a significant achievement for SUI. With strong market sentiment building, a breakthrough may inspire more buying pressure, pushing the price even higher. As the asset moves close to this crucial level, the possibility of new record highs becomes increasingly likely, making SUI one of the critical cryptocurrencies to watch in the coming days. SUI Bulls Take Charge Toward $4.98 Threshold SUI is currently demonstrating impressive bullish momentum as its price steadily climbs toward the critical $4.98 resistance level. This price action signals a strong comeback for the token, with bulls steadily regaining control after previous bearish pressure. The $4.98 threshold has emerged as a key point of interest since it represents a potential breakout zone that could drive the price higher toward new highs. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough A successful breach above the $4.98 level would confirm the continuation of the positive trend and attract additional buying interest. This could lead to a shift in market sentiment, with buyers asserting dominance and possibly pushing the price toward the next resistance levels. A Break Above $4.98 Could Signal More Upside SUI’s price has successfully risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a significant technical milestone that signals a shift in market sentiment. Significantly, this rise above the 100-day SMA indicates that the token may be entering a new bullish phase, as the price action is now trading above a key moving average that has historically acted as support or resistance. It reflects a growing market optimism and signs of stability, raising the potential for a continued upward trend. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms strong upbeat strength for SUI, rising above the 50% threshold to 59%. This suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling, signaling a shift in the market and a reversal of the recent downtrend. With the RSI in a neutral-to-bullish zone, there is room for further upside if the momentum continues, supporting the case for continued price gains and a break above $4.98. Related Reading: SUI Hits New ATH, Can Bullish Momentum Lead Price To $5 This Weekend? In conclusion, if SUI’s price breaks above the $4.98 level, it could lead to the formation of new highs, implying a strong continuation of the uptrend. However, failure to breach this resistance may result in a consolidation phase or a pullback, suggesting that sellers could still have control over the market and limiting upside potential.

If you’re looking to capitalise on this fast-growing trend, this month is brimming with potential. Leading the way are BTFD Coin, FLOKI, and BONE. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, making them the best new meme coins to buy this month. While BTFD Coin is making waves with its blockbuster presale and historic Stage 7 rollback, FLOKI is growing as a decentralised powerhouse, and BONE is carving its niche within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Let’s explore why these three are dominating conversations this month. BTFD Coin: The Bull Market’s Next Big Winner BTFD Coin has taken the crypto world by storm, raising over $4.2 million in its presale. With 57 billion coins sold and more than 6,100 holders onboard, the project’s momentum is undeniable. Now in its 12th stage, BTFD Coin is catching the attention of savvy investors looking to capitalise on its growth potential. What’s driving the hype? Its festive Stage 7 price rollback. For a limited time, buyers can grab BTFD Coin at $0.000064—a steep 50.77% discount from its current Stage 12 price of $0.00013, using the bonus code “BIG50”. This isn’t just a discount; it’s an opportunity to channel the spirit of the legendary 1973 financial crash, where smart investors like Warren Buffett turned chaos into wealth by buying undervalued assets. Here’s why this rollback matters: BTFD Coin is set to list at $0.0006 after the presale ends, promising an ROI of 837.5%. Imagine investing $15,000 at the discounted Stage 7 price. You’d secure 234,375,000 tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment could soar to $140,625. That’s the power of buying the dip at the right time. Beyond its presale success, BTFD Coin offers tangible utility with its Play2Earn gaming platform and staking rewards boasting a 90% APY. Its community-driven ethos ensures that it’s more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy this month, BTFD Coin’s mix of presale momentum and strategic pricing makes it an unmissable opportunity. Getting in on BTFD Coin’s Stage 7 price dip is straightforward: Visit the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code BIG50 to activate the Stage 7 rollback price. Input the amount you want to purchase and confirm the transaction. This rollback ends on January 5, 2025—don’t miss your chance to buy the dip! FLOKI: The Viking-Inspired Meme Coin Named after Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI has carved its place in the crypto world by combining meme culture with real-world utility. As a community-powered project, FLOKI goes beyond being just a coin. Its ecosystem includes innovative projects like the Valhalla metaverse game and the FlokiFi Locker, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform. What makes FLOKI one of the best new meme coins to buy this month is its ability to balance fun and functionality. The coin has a loyal following of “Floki Vikings” who are passionate about spreading its vision. With its ecosystem continuing to expand, FLOKI offers an intriguing mix of entertainment and financial opportunity. BONE: The Heart of Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem BONE is the governance token for ShibaSwap, the decentralised exchange powering the Shiba Inu ecosystem. While SHIB may be the headline act, BONE plays a crucial supporting role, allowing holders to vote on proposals and shape the project’s future. As part of the Shibarium Layer 2 blockchain, BONE has seen steady traction among investors who believe in the long-term potential of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. For those looking for a meme coin with real-world use cases and strong community backing, BONE is a top contender. Its position within the Shiba Inu ecosystem makes it one of the best new meme coins to buy this month for those seeking a mix of stability and growth. Conclusion The crypto market is buzzing this month, and meme coins are leading the charge. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy this month, BTFD Coin’s Stage 7 rollback, FLOKI’s dynamic ecosystem, and BONE’s pivotal role in ShibaSwap offer three compelling options. BTFD Coin’s presale momentum and festive pricing make it a standout, while FLOKI and BONE continue to prove that meme coins can offer more than just laughs.

Some feared that wallets may have been breached, as hackers always target crypto wallets. Responding to the X post , some users highlighted that the problem was beyond balances, as buying and selling nodes had issues. However, some were relieved and grateful for the reassurance of their funds and their efforts to restore the wallet’s operations. Crypto hackers stole up to $2.2 billion in 2024 Although the Trust Wallet issue was merely a glitch, it caused widespread panic among community members, who feared their wallets had been drained. Their concerns were valid, given the high frequency of security breaches in the crypto space. Chainalysis reports that crypto thieves stole a staggering $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024. Most of the crypto losses in 2024 resulted from hacking associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). A Chainalysis report reveals that North Korean hackers, including the lethal Lazarus, account for 61% of all the crypto stolen this year. Although Decentralized Finance was the most affected by hackers in the earlier months of 2024, centralized finance had the most significant financial blows in the year’s second and third quarters. The DMM Bitcoin suffered a $305 million loss in May from hackers, and in July, WazirX lost $234.9 Million. The team resolved the glitch and resumed normal operations Through their X account, Trust Wallet stated that they successfully resolved the glitch and that the wallet is fully operational. Some users confirmed, saying that they can access their balances. Trust wallet is one of the many digital wallets that crypto users rely on. It has always boasted of its robust safety measures and easy-to-navigate features. The glitch, if otherwise, would have been the biggest test for the digital wallet. Crypto security risks may increase over time, requiring users to be alert. Artificial intelligence might further complicate the situation. Most hackers are beginning to use AI for sophisticated attacks, including phishing, deepfakes, and malware.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Santiment says that among altcoins with at least a $500 million market cap, tokenized artificial intelligence (AI) project Virtuals ( VIRTUAL ) – an asset that’s up a staggering 20,000% year-to-date – is one of the leaders in terms of whale activity. Santiment also says high-net-worth investors are making moves to accumulate 10 digital assets including VIRTUAL during the latest crypto market crash. “Despite sizable crypto corrections this week, several altcoins are making very large whale transfers that are indicative of potential dip buys.” Other notable altcoins on the list include stablecoin issuer Usual ( USUAL ) and its stablecoin Usual USD ( USD0 ), decentralized betting platform Gnosis ( GNO ), decentralized finance (DeFi) project Aave ( AAVE ), as well as meme asset Floki ( FLOKI ). VIRTUAL is trading for $2.74 at time of writing, a nearly 20% gain on the day. On December 16th, it peaked at $3.34 while a year ago, it was moving for around $0.013. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Santiment says that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest drop to under $100,000 has caused a “buy the dip” mentality among investors. “With Bitcoin falling as low as $95,500 today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over eight months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since that time, Bitcoin’s market cap is +81% higher.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading for $97,006 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.
