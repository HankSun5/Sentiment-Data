How low could prices go post-Trump Inauguration?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-overdue-correction-low-prices/,"Bitcoin’s rally is hitting a wall, and the numbers are lining up for a big correction in the next month. October saw the global money supply hit a peak of $108.5 trillion, pushing Bitcoin to its record $108,000 high. But here’s the twist: over the last two months, the money supply has dropped by $4.1 trillion, now sitting at $104.4 trillion—its lowest since August. Historically, Bitcoin lags behind money supply by about ten weeks. If that pattern holds, prices could sink by as much as $20,000 in the weeks after president Donald Trump’s inauguration. Analysts are pointing to Bitcoin’s current phase as a mid-top correction—a pattern seen before in 2012, 2016, and 2020. Those phases led to monster bull runs, but first came the pain. And it looks like this one could sting, especially with predictions that even before inauguration, Bitcoin might drop 30%. Panic selling hits markets and Bitcoin ETFs bleed out Panic is spreading beyond crypto. U.S. equity funds just posted outflows of $50.2 billion in the week ending December 18. That’s the biggest exodus since 2009. Large-cap funds lost $20.9 billion, wiping out six weeks of gains. Small-cap, multi-cap, and mid-cap funds weren’t spared either, losing $5.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $2.9 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, the volatility index ($VIX) just posted its second-largest daily jump in history. The market is on edge, and Bitcoin’s caught in the middle of it. Leveraged long positions in Bitcoin got crushed, pushing prices down to $92,000 by mid-December. The weekend gave bulls a little breathing room, with a rebound to $99,500 on Bitstamp. Coinbase buyers tried to claw prices back to six figures, but institutional players staying on the sidelines made the recovery look shaky. The optimism didn’t last. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) felt the heat too. December 20 brought nearly $300 million in net outflows from U.S. Bitcoin ETFs . The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) took the hardest hit, logging its largest-ever outflow at $72.7 million. Investors are bailing, and fast.

In a recent update, Saylor mentioned that he is ready to participate should President-elect Donald Trump establish a crypto advisory council. He is willing to guide the President-elect on crypto matters to shape and reform the country’s digital assets policy. Michael Saylor and The Big Bet on Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin goes beyond words. Since 2020, he has actively supported Bitcoin, even putting his money where his mouth is. Having personally invested nearly $1 billion in Bitcoin, Saylor’s dedication to the digital currency has been unmatched. That year, he proudly announced that he owned 17,732 BTC. This was even before his company, MicroStrategy, made its first large-scale purchase of the asset. Today, MicroStrategy owns a staggering 440,000 BTC, accounting for nearly 2% of the Bitcoin supply. This massive accumulation is no accident. Saylor has called Bitcoin the “apex property of the human race.” He drew comparisons to the territories of Manhattan and Alaska that were once purchased during early American colonization. For him, Bitcoin represents the future, an essential piece of cyberspace that the U.S. should own in bulk. Donald Trump’s Crypto Shift and Saylor’s Support Like many others, Michael Saylor sees Trump as the most Bitcoin and crypto-friendly Republican politician. Although Saylor is not a strong supporter of the Republican Party, he believes it has become more open to progressive changes in crypto regulation. He supports their push to treat crypto as a tool for economic growth and lower regulatory pressure. Also, it encourages individuals to pursue their financial goals using digital assets, especially Bitcoin. Before now, Trump was never a fan of crypto. Once a critic of Bitcoin, calling it “not money” and “based on thin air.” However, in recent years, his views on crypto have changed significantly. During his campaigns this year, he accepted crypto donations and attended a major crypto conference. He publicly promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. The Creation of a Crypto Advisory Council Trump’s crypto journey is taking shape with the announcement of a potential crypto advisory council. While details remain scarce, some industry leaders seek to engage with the incoming administration . These include Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). If established, the council is expected to be key in shaping future crypto policies. This comes after Trump’s proposed tax cuts for crypto companies, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump has recently appointed pro-crypto executives to hold significant positions in his incoming administration. These moves are expected to impact the direction of crypto regulation in the U.S positively .

Sui (SUI) Sui is a groundbreaking blockchain platform designed for global adoption. It offers a secure, powerful, and scalable environment for developers. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model and the secure Move programming language. This innovative approach addresses inefficiencies found in other blockchain systems. By focusing on user experience, Sui removes common barriers in blockchain interactions. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make Web3 applications more accessible and friendly. Sui’s potential lies in its strong technical foundation and commitment to usability. By simplifying blockchain interactions, it stands out in a crowded market. Compared to other platforms, Sui’s focus on the end user could give it an edge. In the current market, there is a demand for user-friendly and scalable solutions. While many coins compete on technology alone, Sui combines this with a dedication to accessibility. This approach may position it well as the blockchain space continues to evolve. Considering market trends, platforms like Sui that prioritize both innovation and user experience may attract more attention. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency launched on Ethereum that pays tribute to the famous Pepe the Frog meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. It’s a deflationary memecoin with a catchy theme and a straightforward approach. Unlike other complicated projects, PEPE embraces its meme roots and keeps things pure and simple. There’s no utility promised, and the team is upfront about it. They appeal to the crypto community by having no transaction taxes and focusing purely on being a fun and engaging token. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw an explosive surge that pushed its market cap to a staggering $1.6 billion. Early investors saw massive gains, turning some into millionaires overnight. This surge sparked what many call a “memecoin season,” with other meme-based tokens experiencing wild price swings. PEPE’s roadmap includes plans to get listed on major exchanges and aims for a “meme takeover.” While it’s uncertain if PEPE and other memecoins will reach new highs, many in the crypto community are hopeful, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving cycle. In a market where memes can drive value, PEPE stands out as an attractive coin for those looking to ride the next big wave. Conclusion While SUI and PEPE are strong contenders, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by merging sports and memes, aiming for exceptional growth in this bullish altcoin season.

It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table. It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions, bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 (+1233%) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved. XYZVerse is Heating Up, and This is Your Chance to Get in Early Why $XYZ Is Gaining Traction What’s fueling this explosive growth? It’s simple: community, vision, and results. The XYZVersers, a rapidly growing base of supporters, are the lifeblood of the project. Unlike many meme coins that rely on fleeting hype, $XYZ is already delivering tangible progress, thanks to its presale strategy and ambitious roadmap. The project’s foundation is rock-solid. $XYZ is redefining the meme coin market with a concept that blends sports culture with cutting-edge crypto technology. This isn’t another coin trying to cash in on a trend; it’s creating an entirely new playbook. Ambitious Plans Backed by Action $XYZ’s roadmap doesn’t stop at a clever theme. The project is built to deliver long-term value: Major Exchange Listings: Aiming for global visibility and accessibility. Staking and Passive Rewards: Giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. Scalability on Polygon: Fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with sports media outlets and exclusive digital creators to amplify its reach. These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results. But in the midst of this chaos, XYZVerse is proving to be a rare exception — a champion in the making. With a sports-driven ecosystem, an impressive 1,233% presale surge, and a roadmap built for sustainability, XYZVerse is showing all the signs of a long-term player in the crypto space. For investors tired of empty promises and looking for a meme coin with real value, XYZVerse offers a fresh opportunity. The presale is still underway, and with its innovative approach and rapid growth, $XYZ might just be the hidden gem that fills your wallet with lasting returns.

XYZVerse is preparing for a potential surge of 16,900%, promising to shake up the market in a big way. This development hints at a major shift in the crypto landscape, capturing the attention of investors everywhere. Trump’s Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side – The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ – the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it’s time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.001 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 1000%!

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has seen notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, ETH has dropped by 10.38%, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, over the last month, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.05%, showing signs of recovery. Looking at the six-month timeframe, ETH has experienced a slight decline of 2.34%, reflecting overall market volatility. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3,648.43 and $4,137.17. The nearest resistance level is at $4,317.86, while the closest support is at $3,340.38. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 20.60, suggesting that ETH is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,622.00, which is below the 100-day average of $3,869.08, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If Ethereum manages to break above the resistance at $4,317.86, it could aim for the next target at $4,806.60, representing a possible increase of around 16%. On the downside, falling below the support at $3,340.38 might lead to a drop towards $2,851.64, which would be a decrease of approximately 22%. Traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge Ethereum’s next move. Conclusion ETH and other coins are strong, but XYZVerse’s sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, uniting sports fans in the 2024 bull run’s biggest market shakeup.

With fresh concepts and growing communities, five standout tokens are positioning themselves as potential game-changers. These emerging cryptocurrencies could redefine fortunes by 2025, capturing attention beyond the usual favorites. Curious which names might dominate the next chapter? The spotlight is shifting—don’t miss out. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win. HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Brett: Cultural Icon and Mascot of Base Chain Brett is the mascot of Base Chain and a cultural symbol in the crypto space. It represents the expanding ecosystem of Base Chain, which hosts various projects and applications. This ecosystem offers a supportive environment for Brett to grow and potentially increase its role. As Base Chain develops, Brett may benefit from the broader resources and innovations within the platform. Its appeal in the market depends on the ongoing growth and adoption of Base Chain technology. BOME: A Memecoin Merging Culture and Decentralized Tech BOME, or the Book of Meme, is an experimental project combining memes, blockchain storage, and cryptocurrency trading. It uses decentralized platforms like Arweave, IPFS, and plans to expand to Bitcoin inscriptions for permanent storage. The project aims to preserve and celebrate meme culture through its $BOME token on the Solana blockchain. By creating an unstoppable collection of digital content, it explores new possibilities for decentralized social media and online culture. The unique blend of creativity, technology, and community engagement positions the coin as an intriguing concept in the crypto market. Its appeal largely depends on user interest in meme culture and the broader market’s performance. Dogwifhat (WIF): A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. It is inspired by the popular Dogwifhat meme and aims to provide a fun, community-driven experience. Meme coins often gain attention due to their ties to internet trends, with dog-related tokens being especially popular. WIF focuses on creating engagement through its community rather than offering utility like traditional cryptocurrencies. Its current appeal lies in its viral and lighthearted nature, traits that historically attract short-term investor interest. The coin’s potential depends on its ability to maintain online visibility and grow its community during this phase of the market. The technology behind Solana ensures fast and low-cost transactions, which may help the coin sustain user activity. Mew: A Unique Cryptocurrency with a Feline Focus Mew is a cryptocurrency themed around a cat navigating a market dominated by dog-related coins. It aims to stand out with a distinct identity and engage users through its creative concept. The coin seeks to build its own ecosystem while addressing gaps in the current market of meme coins. Its potential lies in offering differentiation and novelty in an oversaturated meme coin space. Whether Mew is an attractive option depends on market conditions, competition, and development progress. Conclusion BRETT, BOME, WIF, and MEW may appeal to some, but their potential is more limited short-term. DOGEN, however, stands out with a bold vision of luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by presale’s end and strong market aspirations, it positions itself as a top contender for massive gains and a community of driven leaders.

This recent price movement highlights the market’s ongoing volatility as investors grapple with shifting sentiment and technical levels. Despite the rebound, Bitcoin now faces a significant challenge in sustaining its upward momentum. Related Reading: XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity Analyst Ali Martinez shared compelling data revealing that Bitcoin encounters a massive resistance zone between $97,500 and $99,800. This “brick wall” is fortified by the activity of 924,000 wallets, which collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC in this range. Such strong on-chain resistance could hinder BTC’s ability to reclaim the psychological $100,000 level in the near term. This critical area will likely determine Bitcoin’s next move. Successfully breaking through this zone could pave the way for another rally, while failure to do so might lead to heightened selling pressure and a retest of lower support levels. As the market watches this pivotal phase unfolds, all eyes remain on key technical and on-chain signals to gauge whether Bitcoin’s recovery is sustainable or if a larger correction looms ahead. Bitcoin Holding Strong Bitcoin has experienced intense price swings over the past few days, with a 15% correction followed by a swift 6% bounce in under three days. This rapid movement highlights the serious volatility gripping the market, with Bitcoin mirroring the broader uncertainty. Despite the turbulence, there is growing optimism among analysts regarding Bitcoin’s outlook, as its recovery from aggressive selling pressure yesterday took only a few hours. Martinez shared key insights on X, shedding light on a significant resistance zone that Bitcoin must overcome to regain momentum. According to Martinez, Bitcoin faces a “brick wall” between $97,500 and $99,800. This range is fortified by 924,000 wallets that collectively purchased over 1.19 million BTC within these levels. This substantial cluster of on-chain resistance could act as a barrier to Bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

For now, Bitcoin remains resilient, holding its ground amid market volatility, with many analysts cautiously optimistic about its potential for another rally. Technical Analysis Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,200, showing a strong recovery from the $92,000 mark, which has proven to be a significant demand level. This reaction from $92K signals strength in Bitcoin’s price action, indicating the potential for bullish momentum in the weeks ahead. If BTC manages to push above the critical $100,000 level in the coming days, it could trigger a massive surge, potentially driving the price to new all-time highs. This psychological and technical milestone is expected to ignite a wave of buying pressure as investors and traders anticipate the next leg of the rally. However, the market remains uncertain, and the possibility of Bitcoin entering a sideways consolidation phase cannot be ruled out. In this scenario, BTC could remain range-bound between its all-time highs and local lows, reflecting a period of accumulation as the market recalibrates after recent volatility.

Pompliano says in a FOX 5 interview that “2025 will continue to be a great year for Bitcoin.” According to the investor, two factors are likely to drive the price of Bitcoin to greater heights. “One, you’re going to continue to get printing of money both in the United States and globally. And then two is you have a Federal Reserve that is cutting interest rates. And as that M2 money supply grows and interest rates go down, you get cheap capital coming into the market.” Pompliano also explains why Bitcoin’s rising prices and increasing market cap make BTC “less risky” for deep-pocketed investors. “If you go back and you look at it when Bitcoin was at $1,000, there was plenty of these large capital pools that said, ‘This thing’s new, this thing is too small. I need to put tens of billions of dollars into an investment, I can’t do it with this, it’s too risky.’ Now as Bitcoin has gotten bigger and it’s gotten to a $2 trillion market cap, now all of a sudden everyone’s like, ‘Wait a second, I can put money in it. It’s derisked. This is an opportunity for me.’ And so as the price continues to go higher, more of these large pools of capital will come in. As large pools of capital come in to buy a finite-supply asset, price should continue to go up.” Bitcoin is trading at $97,363 at time of writing.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 21:03:00

While some folks are still hesitant about diving into the digital asset world , savvy investors are already taking massive returns. It’s not just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore—newer projects with game-changing tech and solid fundamentals are stealing the limelight. If you’re itching to find the best cryptos to join this weekend, you’re in the right place. One name-making wave in the crypto sphere is Qubetics ($TICS). With its presale gaining momentum and a future that looks brighter than the Las Vegas Strip, Qubetics is a project you can’t afford to overlook. Let’s dig into what makes Qubetics, alongside established giants like Polkadot (DOT) and Avalanche (AVAX), the hottest cryptos to invest in this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain and Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t your average crypto project. It’s a powerhouse redefining blockchain development while making it accessible to everyone—from tech newbies to seasoned developers. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,100 holders, raising a whopping $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, the potential upside is staggering. Analysts need to catch up on the numbers. They’re predicting $TICS could hit $10 or even $15 after the mainnet launch, boasting an ROI of up to 43,711%. For context, investing $50,000 today could potentially turn into a jaw-dropping $21.8 million. Don’t let that sink in for too long—opportunities like this don’t come daily. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its focus on “ Real World Asset Tokenisation .” Imagine being able to tokenise your real estate property, art collection, or even intellectual property. For businesses, this could mean raising funds faster than you can say “traditional banking” by offering fractional ownership to investors globally. Individuals? They get to liquefy high-value assets without losing control. Think about tokenising a family heirloom to pay for college or medical bills while keeping the sentimental value intact. It’s like having your cake and eating it, too. Beyond tokenisation, Qubetics is a one-stop shop for blockchain innovation. Its QubeQode IDE simplifies smart contract development, while the multi-chain wallet and decentralised VPN address key interoperability and privacy issues. In short, it’s a tech-driven ecosystem poised to drive Web3 adoption on a global scale. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchains Like a Pro Polkadot isn’t just another name in the crypto game; it’s a trailblazer. Known for its ability to connect different blockchains, Polkadot has carved out a niche that few can rival. The project’s focus on interoperability means developers and enterprises can build decentralised applications (dApps) that work across multiple blockchain networks seamlessly. It’s like building a Lego set where every piece fits perfectly, no matter where it comes from. Since its inception, Polkadot has been a go-to for investors who want a mix of innovation and stability. It’s not the flashiest crypto, but it’s reliable, which keeps it in the spotlight. DOT tokens have steadily risen in value, serving as a solid alternative investment for diversifying beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Its staking mechanism is another feather in its cap, rewarding holders with a consistent income stream. Polkadot’s parachain auctions have been a game-changer, allowing projects to secure dedicated slots on its network. This unique approach has turned Polkadot into a launchpad for promising blockchain projects, adding layers of value to its ecosystem. Whether you’re a casual investor or a hardcore trader, Polkadot offers something for everyone. Looking ahead, Polkadot’s ability to adapt and grow makes it a prime candidate for long-term portfolios. DOT should be on your radar if you’re after one of the best cryptos to join this weekend. Avalanche (AVAX): The Speed Demon of Blockchains Regarding speed and scalability, Avalanche is in a league of its own. Launched to tackle Ethereum’s congestion, Avalanche has quickly become a favourite among developers and investors. Its high-performance blockchain can handle over 4,500 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest in the game. Avalanche’s recent ‘Avalanche9000’ upgrade is a testament to its commitment to innovation. By lowering transaction fees and introducing cost-effective subnets, Avalanche is establishing itself as a developer’s dream platform. Projects building on Avalanche benefit from its efficiency, and users enjoy lightning-fast, low-cost transactions. It’s a win-win. From DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces, Avalanche has its hands in every pie. The ecosystem’s growth has been phenomenal, attracting big-name investors and developers. If you’ve been sleeping on AVAX, now might be the time to wake up. It’s trading just 20% below its all-time high, teasing a breakout that could soar prices. Avalanche’s appeal lies in its ability to deliver what it promises. It’s not just a hype machine; it’s a project with real-world utility and a robust community. Whether you’re into staking, trading, or just holding for the long haul, Avalanche is a strong contender among the best cryptos to join this weekend. Conclusion The crypto market moves fast, and hesitation can cost you. Qubetics offers a golden opportunity to get in early on a project with massive upside. Meanwhile, Polkadot and Avalanche are proven players who continue delivering value. These projects represent a mix of innovation, reliability, and potential that’s hard to beat. Don’t sit on the sidelines. Head to Qubetics’ presale page now, or grab some DOT and AVAX from your favourite exchange. The best cryptos to join this weekend won’t wait around forever, so why should you?

Here’s why. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is often likened to “digital gold,” with its fixed supply of 21 million coins making it a potential hedge against currency devaluation and inflation. And nowadays, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics make it an attractive addition to corporate treasuries. It can balance exposure to traditional assets like cash, stocks, and bonds. Bitcoin is also one of the most liquid assets globally, and its historical performance has shown significant long-term value appreciation — it reached an all-time high of over $108,000 on Dec. 17 . But there’s no shortage of risks. A board might avoid adopting a Bitcoin treasury due to the coin’s extreme price volatility, which can lead to substantial losses during downturns. Also, regulatory uncertainties pose potential threats as governments refine crypto policies. Additionally, liquidity challenges during market slumps can amplify price drops when offloading assets. So it’s no wonder that, on Dec. 10, Microsoft’s board channeled the long-standing crypto skepticism of its co-founder, Bill Gates, and recommended ditching the proposa for a Bitcoin trasury. Gates himself has famously dismissed crypto as “100% based on greater fool theory” — ouch. Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor was busy trying to woo Microsoft when he touted Bitcoin’s own meteoric returns and bragged about MicroStrategy’s stock soaring after their BTC splurge. His pitch? Bitcoin could boost Microsoft’s market cap while acting as a financial guardian angel. Microsoft’s response? No, thanks. Meanwhile, at least 10 other companies are embracing the MicroStrategy playbook. Table of Contents Genius Group Worksport Amazon MicroStrategy Marathon Digital Holdings Tesla Coinbase Hut 8 Mining Corp Block Inc. OneMedNet Genius Group Genius Group, an AI-powered education group, announced in November that it had completed the purchase of 110 Bitcoin for $10 million, at an average price of $90,932 per Bitcoin. The purchase made good on a promise to employ what it called a “Bitcoin-first” strategy where it planed to commit 90% or more of its current and future reserves to be held in Bitcoin, with an initial target of $120 million in Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the company bolstered its Bitcoin treasury by acquiring 194 Bitcoin worth $18 million at an average price of $92,728 per Bitcoin. Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton credited Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury plan for the inspiration, adding that “more companies will see the benefits of establishing a Bitcoin treasury, and will be equipped with the clear steps to follow.” Worksport Worksport, a U.S.-based provider of pickup truck solutions, is adding cyptocurency to its corporate treasury strategy. The Nasdaq-listed company announced on Dec. 5 that it would be adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP ( XRP ) to its treasury assets. This follows a resolution by the company’s board of directors, which approved an initial purchase of $5 million worth of BTC and XRP. Worksport is committing 10% of its excess operational cash to this corporate pivot, it said in the announcement. “Our upcoming adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (Ripple) reflects our commitment to staying ahead of market trends while prioritizing operational efficiency and shareholder value. As we expand our product offerings and global reach, cryptocurrency has the potential to be a strong strategic complement,” Steven Rossi, chief executive officer of Worksport, said. Amazon Amazon shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research , are urging the Seattle-based company’s board to assess the potential benefits of adding Bitcoin to the company’s financial strategy. The proposal, submitted on Dec. 6, aims to explore whether Bitcoin could protect and enhance shareholder value, especially amid persistent inflation and declining yields from traditional assets. The National Center emphasizes Bitcoin’s robust performance—131% growth in the past year and 1,246% over five years—as evidence of its potential as an inflation hedge and a growth asset. The initiative also highlights concerns about the diminishing purchasing power of Amazon’s $88 billion cash reserves due to average inflation of 4.95% over the past four years. This move represents a broader trend of shareholder proposals influencing corporate policies, leveraging shareholder rights to advocate for financial strategies that address economic risks and enhance long-term value. MicroStrategy Perhaps the most vocal of all Bitcoin fans is MicroStrategy’s Saylor who, as of this past week, increased the company’s total holdings to 439,000. As a result, Saylor has officially strengthening MicroStrategy’s position as the top corporate BTC holder, considering it a long-term store of value. Saylor, during an appearance on the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, even voiced his willingness to advise President-elect Donald Trump on crafting a digital assets policy for the U.S. But Saylor continues to draw scrutiny: Analyst Jacob King has labeled MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused business model a “giant scam,” claiming it is unsustainable and destined for collapse. MicroStrategy’s business model is a giant scam and relies on a reflexive loop: it issues debt or equity to buy BTC, which drives BTC’s price higher. This increases MSTR’s market cap, boosts its index weight, and attracts more sheep investors. With a higher valuation, it issues… pic.twitter.com/Owyi7mCHaO — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 17, 2024 Marathon Digital Holdings As one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies, Marathon owns 44,394 BTC. Its business model revolves entirely around mining and holding Bitcoin as part of its assets​. Back in July, the company confirmed it will adopt “a full HODL approach” towards its Bitcoin treasury policy, retaining all that it mines within its operations, in addition to its open market purchases. “Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin,” CEO Fred Thiel stated. “We believe bitcoin is the world’s best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Tesla Tesla initially bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in 2021 and currently holds 9,720 BTC. While the Elon Musk-led company remains a significant corporate holder​. BitcoinTreasuries data shows that Tesla is the fourth-largest holder of Bitcoin among U.S. public companies with crypto treasuries (MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms are believed to hold more). In October, the electric vehicle company reportedly moved $765 million worth of Bitcoin to unidentified wallets. Coinbase The cryptocurrency exchange holds 9,480 BTC as part of its reserves, leveraging its position as a major player in the digital asset ecosystem​. The Brian Armstrong-led firm holds large amounts of Bitcoin as an exchange and converter. It’s also a trusted institution for custody services, and counts the Bitcoin ETF coterie of BlackRock, Grayscale, 21Shares, Invesco, Valkyrie, Wisdom Tree and Franklin Templeton among its clients. Therefore, Coinbase has a Bitcoin treasury for itself and oversees others. Hut 8 Mining Corp On Thursday, crypto.news reported that Hut 8, a Bitcoin mining company, added 990 Bitcoin to its reserves. The company spent roughly $100 million to increase its total holdings to 10,096 BTC. The reserve, now valued at over $1 billion, places Hut 8 among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The company, under the guidance of CEO Asher Genoot, purchased the coins at an average price of $101,710, significantly higher than its cumulative acquisition cost of $24,484 per Bitcoin. Block Inc. The startup (formerly Square) holds 8,027 BTC as part of its strategy to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream finance. The Jack Dorsey-founded company is so bullish on Bitcoin that, last month, it confirmed a company-wide pivot towards the cryptocurrency mining sector. Block decided to dial down resources towards music streaming service TIDAL, and sunset TBD, a venture focusing on decentralizing the internet, to focus on expanding its presence in the Bitcoin mining sector. Block acquired TIDAL in a 2021 acquisition for roughly $300 million. The platform has continued to struggle, with reports indicating workforce reductions and a $132.3 million impairment charge . OneMedNet OneMedNet Corp., as of Nov. 12, owns some 34 Bitcoins. Off The Chain Capital, an investor in OneMedNet, was also inspired by Saylor, betting that Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge but a springboard for its healthcare data innovation. Aaron Green, the company’s CEO, stated, “By continuing to invest a portion of our assets into Bitcoin, we aim to not only safeguard our financial stability but also fuel the ongoing development and innovation within our iRWD platform.” Read more: Bitcoin blitz: Odell Beckham Jr. and 6 other NFL stars betting big on blockchain",Feature|Bitcoin|michael saylor|Microsoft|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-21 21:43:58

BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a new player in the meme coin space, is currently riding a wave of excitement with its presale hitting a staggering $4.2 million in under a month. The price of BTFD has already surged from an initial price of $0.000004 to $0.00013 in Stage 12, with analysts predicting a 361.53% ROI by the time the presale finishes and the coin lists at $0.0006. With over 57 billion coins already sold to more than 6,100 holders, it’s clear that investors are jumping in fast to catch this rapidly-growing opportunity. Meme coins have been a hot topic for years now. Initially starting as playful tokens, they have evolved into powerful assets with strong communities driving their value. From Dogecoin’s surprising rise to Shiba Inu’s record-breaking success, meme coins are no longer just a joke—they’re becoming a significant part of the crypto landscape. Enter BTFD Coin, which is set to take meme coin popularity to the next level with its unique mix of Play-to-Earn (P2E) games, a referral program, staking rewards, and its engaged community of supporters.

Along with its lucrative P2E game that promises additional revenue streams for holders, the coin’s innovative referral program, and staking rewards, BTFD Coin is aiming to be more than just a meme—it’s positioning itself as a true contender in the world of crypto. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Massive Potential When it comes to the top meme coins for massive income, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about assets in the crypto space. With its presale raising over $4.2 million, the coin has demonstrated an incredibly strong demand right from the start. The presale has already moved through several stages, with the price currently sitting at $0.00013 in stage 12—representing an 361.5% potential return on investment by the time the presale ends and the token lists at $0.0006. BTFD Coin’s success is driven by the strength of its community. Over 6,100 holders are already on board, and the presale has sold a staggering 57 billion coins. What’s driving this excitement? Aside from the compelling financial returns, BTFD Coin has designed a robust ecosystem with features that set it apart from other meme coins. The Play-to-Earn game is one of the standout features that’s setting the coin apart, offering holders the chance to earn tokens through gameplay. This game is expected to bring long-term engagement and generate more interest in the project. But the real kicker for many investors is the referral program and staking rewards. These features provide a continuous incentive for investors to get involved, earn more tokens, and grow their holdings, creating a compounding effect that amplifies their profits.

Cat in a Dog’s World: The Quirky Meme Coin with Big Potential Another coin that’s quickly gaining attention in the meme coin sector is Cat in a Dog’s World. This quirky token blends the humour of meme culture with a strong sense of community, making it one of the top meme coins for massive income. Despite its playful name, Cat in a Dog’s World has garnered a loyal following, and it’s not hard to see why. With a unique brand identity and an emphasis on inclusivity, it’s quickly establishing itself as a contender for meme coin dominance. What makes Cat in a Dog’s World stand out is its community-driven approach. The coin has worked hard to build an ecosystem that rewards loyal holders with exclusive content, airdrops, and the chance to take part in fun community events.

Mog Coin: The Meme Coin That Is All About Innovation Mog Coin is another meme coin that’s catching the eyes of investors looking for massive income opportunities. Like other meme coins, Mog Coin started as a fun, light-hearted project, but it quickly grew into something more. What’s really interesting about Mog Coin is its focus on innovation. While many meme coins rely solely on community and hype to drive their price up, Mog Coin is incorporating real-world applications and collaborations that could help it become a legitimate asset in the crypto world. One of the most exciting aspects of Mog Coin is its utility in the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. The coin has partnered with several blockchain projects, enabling it to serve as a bridge between different networks. This cross-chain functionality gives Mog Coin an edge over many of its competitors and positions it as more than just a meme—it’s becoming an integral part of the growing DeFi space.

If the price can break above the $200 mark, it might indicate the beginning of a recovery. Solana (SOL) price maintained its poor performance by continuing its downward trend inside a tight price channel that it has been following for quite some time now. The whales have taken notice and are considering purchasing the dip as a result. For days now, the data from Coinshare has shown that whale activity has been on the rise. Solana inflows exceeded $1.7M last week, indicating a change in investor sentiment towards buying the dip. The high level of token trading activity continued this week, therefore the pattern holds. Investors trying to get in before the market likely enters a bull run in 2025 saw the whale’s participation increase dramatically this week. Bears in Control With an all-time high of $263.83 in November, the price of SOL maintained investor optimism for a potential additional climb. When the price of Solana shifted 29% away from that due to the crypto market slump, the whales took advantage of the situation. Total Value Locked ( TVL ) has dropped precipitously, which is another reason to be pessimistic about Solana’s short-term future. Data from DefiLlama shows that SOL TVL fell 7.7 percent in a single day, from $11.22 billion to $10.35 billion. There was a comparable drop in TVL on August 3 and October 29, after which the prices fell by almost 10% in a matter of days. A comparable price drop for SOL might occur if past events are any indication. Since its previous peak, Solana’s price has fallen sharply, and it is now trading at $181.36 as per data from CMC. If the price can break above the $200 mark, it might indicate the beginning of a recovery that could lead to a push toward the $215 level. But if the price breaks below and stays under $175 for an extended period of time, it might signal the beginning of more drops, with possible support near the $150 area.",Editors News|Investing News|Altcoin|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'The News Crypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thenewscrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thenewscrypto,2024-12-21 21:47:35

Speaking in a debate with a smug DOD official, the comedian pointed out the puzzling disparity between the Pentagon's massive budget and the daily struggles of low-ranked service members, some of whom still rely on government assistance to get food on the table. “We got out of 20 years of war, and the Pentagon got a raise,” Stewart put bluntly. “I can’t figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that’s f*cking corruption.” John Deaton gained recognition in the crypto community for his support of Ripple Labs and its cryptocurrency, XRP, where he filed an amicus brief on behalf of XRP holders, arguing that the SEC’s classification of the cryptocurrency as a security unfairly harmed retail investors. Deaton is also a founder of CryptoLaw, a legal platform meant to be a one-stop shop for public information, links to news articles, and probing analysis on the regulatory landscape of the US crypto industry. As a Republican candidate in Massachusetts, Deaton tried to unseat staunch crypto skeptic Elizabeth Warren in the 2024 US Senate elections, albeit unsuccessfully. While not necessarily warranted against all government agencies, Deaton's frustration at the federal government's inefficacies is at least understandable in the context of his protracted legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency recently sued a US-based crypto project, Dragonchain, alleging that its foundation conducted a $16.5 million unregistered offering of DRGN tokens. The court filing indicated the SEC’s readiness to pursue the case despite Chair Gensler’s imminent departure scheduled for the Inauguration Day on January 20. The incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins is expected to enforce the Trump administration's pro-crypto agenda. For context, the Department of Government Efficiency, named after the mercurial billionaire’s favorite cryptocurrency, will be co-led by Elon Musk himself, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and House GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. While the “department” in its name may suggest that D.O.G.E will be a full-fledged government agency, President-elect Donald Trump said that it will “provide advice and guidance from outside of government,” suggesting that D.O.G.E. will function more as an independent advisory body. Musk’s role being informal will also allow him to remain the head of his electric car maker Tesla, social media platform X, and rocket company SpaceX without raising inevitable questions about potential conflicts of interest. D.O.G.E’s primary focus will be to identify inefficiencies in federal spending, pawing the way for the new administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” as per Trump’s statement. The work of the department will conclude no later than July 4, 2026, which is the date of the 250th anniversary of The US Declaration of Independence. Ripple donates $5 million to Trump’s inauguration Meanwhile, the US crypto companies, including Ripple, are doubling down on their financial support for Donald Trump, pledging millions to his inauguration celebrations. The three-day-long event will feature galas, parades, and dinners celebrating Trump's win alongside Vice President-elect JD Vance According to Fox News , blockchain payment firm Ripple contributed $5 million in XRP tokens. Cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken donated $1 million each, while digital asset payment provider MoonPay vowed to donate an undisclosed amount. Interestingly, Ripple’s chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen has been one of the top contributors to Kamala Harris’ campaign, donating more than $11 million to the Future Forward PAC supporting her presidency bid. Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was reportedly one of the first crypto execs to score a one-to-one meeting with Donald Trump days after his win. The millions flowing from the crypto firms are just a tiny part of the record-breaking $200 million already raised by the inaugural fund, surpassing Trump’s first term's $107 million and trouncing Biden’s $62 million. A source close to the Trump-Vance inaugural committee expressed confidence that they will be able to reach a $225 milestone by Inauguration Day. The big tech joined alongside crypto companies in contributing to the fund, with top business executives such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, and OpenAI's Sam Altman each donating $1 million. “Amazon donates $1 million while Ripple donates $5M,” John Deaton posted on X in response to the news. “New era.”",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-21 21:48:02

The collaboration will introduce the world’s first lithium tokenization project, a disruptive initiative scheduled for launch in Q1 2025. Mechanics of Tokenization According to local reports , the project will use blockchain technology to convert the property rights of lithium into digital tokens. This will allow investors to trade fractional shares of the mineral without physically handling or owning it. The process is intended to democratize resource access, improve liquidity, and facilitate international trade through secure and immutable blockchain-based transactions. Argentina is home to some of the world’s largest lithium deposits, with most concentrated in Catamarca, Salta, and Jujuy. The metal is not only a cornerstone of electric vehicle (EV) batteries and renewable energy storage but also critical in the global transition to cleaner energy. Some analysts estimate that the EV industry alone could be worth a mind-blowing $1.3 trillion in the next three years, fueled by growing worldwide demand. While the country’s ore export is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2025, the sector is still facing challenges related to accountability in the supply chain. To address this, the tokenization project will facilitate greater traceability and authenticity of the material, helping reduce the risk of fraud and ensuring ethical and environmental standards are met. It will also help improve collaboration between the Argentine government and mining firms, ensuring they adhere to transparent and ecologically friendly practices. Opportunities for Argentina Tokenizing real-world assets like minerals could become a multi-billion dollar endeavor by the end of the decade. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) suggested such assets could represent at least 1% of the global mutual fund and ETF market by 2030, translating into a $600 billion business. Speaking exclusively to CryptoPotato, Atómico 3 founder Pablo Rutigliano highlighted the economic and environmental significance of the tokenization initiative, saying: “Blockchain’s distributed ledger allows stakeholders to trace the provenance of lithium, ensuring it is ethically and sustainably sourced. For instance, stakeholders can confirm adherence to local labor laws, environmental standards, and water usage metrics, which are crucial concerns in Argentina’s lithium-rich regions.” According to him, the project will benefit both local and international communities. The initiative is a chance for economic inclusion, job creation, and fair revenue distribution for the country’s mining sector. Rutigliano believes the venture will allow profits to reach local producers and communities by reducing reliance on intermediaries. Furthermore, he said that introducing blockchain-based platforms will create demand for tech-savvy roles and training opportunities. For investors, a tokenized version of the metal improves market accessibility by enabling fractional ownership and 24/7 trading, boosting liquidity and reducing transaction costs.

As announced by the protocol on its official X account, the chain has produced 1,000,000 blocks. With this impressive milestone, the community demands have increased with calls for a bridge to connect with other networks. Sonic Chain by The Numbers In an earlier update, the protocol shared the Transaction Per Second (TPS) recorded by early users thus far. Notably, core developer Andre Cronje spotlighted an 850 TPS despite the network not operating at full speed yet. However, sealaunch onchain explorers noted that the Sonic Chain scored a 1,620 TPS on December 18. As Andre Cronje revealed, the “safety mode” is currently active for the new layer-1 scaling solution. This mode was introduced to let enough validators get onboarded to the network. In all, most of the figures are independently recorded and might change as the Sonic Chain matures. The Sonic mainnet went live on December 18 after months of active development. This protocol is Fantom’s evolutionary response marked by the transition to Sonic Labs earlier in September. With the official launch, the broader industry has kept a keen eye on what the protocol may have to offer. Top industry personalities including Ran Neuner have endorsed the chain as one of the fastest in the ecosystem. To further turbocharge its growth, Sonic Labs has proposed that the Uniswap DAO allocate 250,000 UNI as liquidity mining rewards for its validators. As part of the proposal, this 250,000 UNI will complete its 500,000 S allocation for the same purpose. We’re proposing that @Uniswap DAO allocate 250k of UNI as liquidity mining rewards in addition to our 500k in S.

As such, every protocol hopes to capture as much of the market share as possible amid a pro-crypto led administration Donald Trump is courting. Sonic Chain will look to compete with top rivals including Ethereum, Solana, XRP Ledger and Layer-2 gamechangers like Base Network. While it has received a good start, it remains uncertain how well it can catch up with protocol like Base that currently dominates the Ethereum TVL scene.

Such developments could mark a transformative phase for Ripple and its XRP token, elevating its status among institutional and retail investors alike. However, while XRP price gathers attention, investors and traders are shifting their focus to PropiChain , a revolutionary altcoin positioned to deliver an unprecedented 30,000% growth by early 2025. As the spotlight shines brighter on Ripple and its competitors, PropiChain emerges as a powerful player, disrupting industries far beyond the financial sector. XRP Price Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation The XRP Price has experienced a notable bump in recent weeks, largely fueled by speculation surrounding a potential ETF approval. This comes after the SEC’s legal battle with Ripple saw significant breakthroughs, boosting confidence in XRP’s regulatory future. Why an XRP ETF Matters Increased Accessibility: An ETF would make XRP investments easier for institutional and retail investors, driving liquidity and demand. Institutional Adoption: Similar to Bitcoin ETFs, an XRP ETF could trigger significant institutional inflows, further stabilizing and boosting its price. Market Legitimacy: ETF approval signals regulatory acceptance, potentially paving the way for other crypto-focused financial products. While the XRP Price rallies on ETF optimism, analysts warn that significant gains may already be priced in. This leaves traders seeking untapped opportunities in emerging altcoins like PropiChain , where growth potential remains exponential. PropiChain: The Altcoin Set to Dominate PropiChain is a blockchain-based platform redefining real estate investments in a market valued at over $300 trillion. PropiChain’s innovative ecosystem combines blockchain, AI, and tokenization to solve major inefficiencies in the real estate sector. Features That Make PropiChain Stand Out PropiChain is a trailblazer in the crypto space, offering features that directly benefit investors: AI-Powered Market Insights: PropiChain’s advanced AI tools analyze global real estate markets in real-time, identifying undervalued properties and emerging opportunities. Tokenized Real Estate: By tokenizing properties, PropiChain allows investors to buy and sell fractional ownership, increasing liquidity and flexibility. Metaverse Integration: PropiChain is pioneering virtual property tours and global networking events in the metaverse, enhancing the buyer and seller experience. Security Audits: PropiChain’s infrastructure has been rigorously tested and certified, including a comprehensive BlockAudit review , ensuring top-tier security for its users. Global Listings: PropiChain’s CoinMarketCap listing adds to its credibility and market visibility, attracting a broader investor base. PropiChain Presale: A Huge Opportunity PropiChain is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011. This marks a critical juncture for early adopters, as the price will jump to $0.023 in Stage 3. Why the Presale is a Game-Changer Low Entry Point: At just $0.011 per token, even small investments can yield massive returns. For instance, a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to over $300,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected price of $7.15. Exponential Growth: Analysts predict PropiChain could mirror early Bitcoin or XRP growth trajectories, making this presale a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Limited Supply: With a finite number of tokens available, demand is expected to outpace supply rapidly, driving prices even higher. XRP vs. PropiChain: A Comparative Analysis While the XRP Price remains a focal point for many crypto enthusiasts, PropiChain offers distinct advantages that make it a compelling alternative: Utility Beyond Finance: Unlike XRP, which focuses on cross-border payments, PropiChain addresses the vast and underserved real estate market. Higher Growth Potential: XRP price growth may be capped due to its existing market penetration, while PropiChain’s untapped potential offers significantly higher returns. Investor Accessibility: PropiChain’s fractional ownership model allows anyone to participate, whereas XRP requires a more traditional investment approach. Why Now is the Right Time The clock is ticking for those looking to secure PropiChain tokens at the current presale price of $0.011. With its next stage price set at $0.023, early investors stand to benefit significantly from getting in now. Historical Comparisons: PropiChain’s growth potential mirrors XRP price’s early days when it surged from $0.002 to over $3 within months. Life-Changing Returns: Even a modest $500 investment in PropiChain today could grow to over $165,000 by 2025. Upcoming Milestones: As PropiChain completes its presale and launches its platform, demand is expected to skyrocket, making this the lowest price you’ll ever see for this token. Conclusion While the XRP Price continues to make headlines, the real opportunity lies with PropiChain, a groundbreaking altcoin disrupting the real estate industry. Its innovative features, robust ecosystem, and rare growth potential make it a must-have in any investor’s portfolio. With the presale in full swing and token prices set to increase, the time to act is now. Don’t miss this chance to be part of something this big!

The doctor-patient communications platform ConnectOnCall, owned by health tech firm Phreesia, says 914,138 users are affected, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights. In a statement, the firm says the breach exposed records shared in communications between doctors and patients including full names, phone numbers, dates of birth, health conditions, treatments, medications as well as Social Security numbers. “ConnectOnCall’s investigation revealed that between February 16, 2024, and May 12, 2024, an unknown third party had access to ConnectOnCall and certain data within the application, including certain information in provider-patient communications… ConnectOnCall took the ConnectOnCall product offline and has been working through a phased restoration of the product in a new, more secure environment.” ConnectOnCall allows patients to contact their doctors via text, phone call or telehealth for concerns about prescriptions, lab results and other medical issues. The firm sent letters to affected users earlier this month to shed light on the security incident while offering identity and credit monitoring services to individuals whose Social Security numbers were stolen.

These machines, built to mimic human form and function, are no longer clunky prototypes stumbling over simple tasks. Now they’re equipped with advanced AI systems that enable them to perform real-world jobs, from factory lines to warehouses. And here’s the thing, some analysts think these robots could replace human workers on a massive scale by the end of the decade. “Breakthroughs in generative AI are giving robots the ability to see, think, and act,” said Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia’s VP of Omniverse and simulation technology. He’s not exaggerating. Sectors like manufacturing, retail, and logistics are already exploring how humanoid robots can fill critical gaps. A trillion-dollar race is on Wall Street is starting to catch on to the financial potential of humanoid robots. Citigroup predicts the humanoid robot market could hit $7 trillion by 2050, with over 1.19 billion of these machines in use globally. Morgan Stanley projects a slightly less 63 million robots by the same year. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates a $38 billion market by 2035. Analysts believe humanoid robots could eclipse autonomous vehicles in market potential. Tesla’s share price has already soared due to its work in AI and autonomy, but it’s clear that humanoid robots could be an even bigger opportunity. According to Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, the adoption curve for humanoid robots might move faster than robotaxis because these machines can immediately tackle repetitive and dangerous jobs. “The urgency to scale humanoids is palpable,” Jonas said. The Tesla wildcard Tesla, under the ever-controversial Elon Musk, has its eyes on the humanoid prize. The company’s Optimus robot was first revealed in 2021, but its capabilities were widely criticized for being underwhelming. Fast forward to today, and Tesla’s robotics ambitions are much more serious. Musk claims these robots could eventually make Tesla worth a mind-blowing $25 trillion. Tesla’s close ties to the incoming Trump administration will likely give it a massive edge. Analysts believe federal support for robotics could mirror previous subsidies for the semiconductor industry. Trump’s hardline immigration policies might also drive demand for automation, further boosting Tesla ’s robotics division. Nvidia powers the brains Behind many of these humanoid robots is Nvidia, the chipmaker that’s quietly dominating the AI space. Nvidia’s Project GR00T is a robotics platform that includes everything from AI models to simulation tools. XPeng, Boston Dynamics, and other robotics leaders are using this platform to accelerate their development. Nvidia also launched the Jetson Thor supercomputer earlier this year, designed specifically for robots. These technologies are important because humanoid robots need immense computational power to get through human-centric environments like homes and workplaces. According to Lebaredian, the company is working on GR00T models for motion control, whole-body coordination, and sensing, all of which are essential for humanoid robots to function effectively. While factories and warehouses are natural starting points, the real value of humanoid robots lies in consumer applications. Imagine robots that can babysit your kids, clean your house, or even cook your dinner. Some analysts believe this is where the big money is. This change won’t happen overnight though, but the groundwork is already being laid. Companies like Xiaomi are exploring how robots can fit seamlessly into our daily lives.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE.

The updated policy will permit advertisers offering crypto exchange products and services to run ads in the UK, provided they meet specific requirements. Google stated that ads for crypto exchanges and software wallets will only be allowed if the businesses are registered with the FCA. The policy will also extend to hardware wallets designed to store private keys for cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or other digital assets. However, ads for hardware wallets will only be permitted if they do not offer additional services such as buying, selling, or trading. While Google did not outline further requirements for hardware wallet advertisers, it emphasized the need to adhere to local regulations. “As a reminder, we expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area that their ads target. This policy will apply globally to all accounts that advertise these financial products,” Google stated. This means advertisers aiming to promote crypto-related products on Google must familiarize themselves with local regulations in their target jurisdictions and fulfill the necessary requirements set by financial regulators. The policy change comes amidst increased efforts by regulators to combat unauthorized crypto promotions. On December 16, the FCA issued a warning against “Retardio,” a Solana-based memecoin and NFT project. The FCA expressed concerns about the project’s unauthorized promotions targeting UK customers, cautioning that unregistered firms leave consumers at risk of losing funds without recourse if the business fails.

According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price is facing extreme resistance between the $97,500 and $99,800 price levels as it tries to breach $100,000 again. Martinez noted that around this price range, approximately 923,890 wallet addresses had purchased over 1.19 million BTC. This price zone acts as an important resistance level because many Bitcoin holders may look to sell and break even, potentially exerting selling pressure. In the IOMAP chart shared by Martinez, the green dots that signal ‘In the Money’ represent price levels below the current Bitcoin price, where wallet holders are in profit because they bought BTC at a lower value. On the other hand, the red dots that represent ‘Out of the Money’ show price levels of Bitcoin’s present value, where wallet holders are at a loss because they bought BTC at a higher price. Lastly, the white dot indicates ‘At the Money’ and represents the current price of Bitcoin at an average of $98,676, where some crypto wallets see neither profit nor loss. Below Bitcoin’s current price, the chart shows strong buying zones, which could provide strong support if the pioneer cryptocurrency experiences a potential pullback. Martinez has forecasted that breaking through the critical resistance range between $97,500 and $99,800 would signal the start of a bullish rally for Bitcoin, potentially leading it to a new all-time high. Currently, the Bitcoin price is trading at $98,652, steadily rising to return to previous highs above $100,000. To a new all-time high, Bitcoin will have to surge by over 7%, surpassing its present ATH above $104,000.

According to the analyst, Bitcoin has historically experienced its most significant gains right after Christmas during the halving years. The analyst shared a price chart showing Bitcoin’s market performance during each halving cycle. In the 2012 halving year, Bitcoin started a significant price rally, which extended into the following year. The same bullish trend occurred in the next halving years in 2016 and 2020, with Bitcoin hitting exponential price highs. Based on this historical trend, Crypto Rover projects that Bitcoin could witness a similar bullish surge before the end of 2024, with the rally potentially continuing into 2025.

According to the authorities, the duo have been indicted for defrauding investors of over $22 million in crypto. A String of Broken Promises The U.S. attorney’s office states that between May 2021 and May 2024, the Southern California men engaged in “rug pull” schemes. They collected investments for Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) and digital asset projects. However, the two men were not interested in actualizing the promises made to the investors. According to the prosecutor, in connivance with a yet-to-be-named co-conspirator, the duo collected $22.4 million from multiple rug pull schemes. These individuals, however, had no plans to see the projects through. Vault of Gems, Hay, and Mayo claimed it would be pegged to hard assets in one of their NFT projects. The men told their investors that the project had been designed to work with jewelers worldwide. They deceived investors with claims that Vault of Gems was already making its exchange to serve jewelry retailers. How Investors Discovered the Crypto Fraud Some investors first got a hint of the rug pull in a post on the Vault of Gems’ X account. To engage the community, the account had posted, “What’s happening?” in November 2021. The responses from members of the community alerted others to the fact that Hay and Mayo deleted parts of a community Discord channel. The channel served as a convergence platform for investors. One of the users, Mal (@MalPachinko) response, alleged that Hay and Mayo failed to deliver on the roadmap. Mal noted that the duo left about 1,900 token owners holding the bag with no hopes of recovering their investments. Analysts say the incident highlights why users in the crypto space need to familiarize themselves with different fraudulent schemes and how to avoid them . California Authority Assures Justice The authorities are accusing Hay and Mayo of transferring cryptocurrency realized from their projects into their wallets. This is part of the scheme to defraud their unsuspecting investors. Aside from the Vault of Gems rug pull scheme, others they carried out included projects titled Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Faceless, Uncovered, Dirty Dogs, and many more. Rug pull schemes come in various forms, including loss of value, as in the SnowdogDAO incident . Principal Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Nicole Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, promised to protect investors. Argentieri also assured the department would do everything possible to eliminate crypto fraud and bring offenders to justice.

But for many investors, it became a story of missed opportunities, as its value soared beyond reach. If you’re still regretting missing out on ICP, don’t worry— Qubetics is here, and it’s shaping up to be the next big thing in blockchain technology. With its innovative solutions like the non-custodial wallet, Qubetics is addressing key challenges in the crypto world while offering investors a chance to get in early. With analysts predicting $10–$15 for $TICS post-mainnet launch, now might be the time to make your move. The Evolution of Blockchain: From ICP to Qubetics ICP captured the market’s attention with its promise of decentralised internet services, but it wasn’t without its limitations. As blockchain technology evolves, new projects are emerging to build on ICP’s foundation while solving its shortcomings. Enter Qubetics—a platform designed to offer unmatched usability, security, and scalability in the blockchain ecosystem. ICP’s groundbreaking idea of decentralised web services paved the way for Qubetics. However, ICP’s rapid growth highlighted significant challenges, including scalability and ease of use for everyday applications. Qubetics builds on these lessons, delivering a blockchain platform that is accessible, secure, and ready for mass adoption. Qubetics introduces tools like its non-custodial wallet to simplify blockchain interactions for users and developers. Unlike traditional wallets that require third-party oversight, the Qubetics wallet empowers users to maintain full control over their assets. This innovation aligns perfectly with the blockchain ethos of decentralisation and trustless systems, making Qubetics an attractive option for both investors and developers. Why Qubetics Stands Out The blockchain market is competitive, but Qubetics is setting itself apart with its forward-thinking technology and community-driven approach. Blockchain adoption has faced hurdles such as complex user experiences and scalability issues. Platforms like ICP brought these challenges to light, and Qubetics is here with solutions. Its non-custodial wallet ensures that users retain ownership of their digital assets, removing the need for intermediaries. This feature not only improves security but also enhances trust among users. The market response to Qubetics has been overwhelmingly positive. In its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $7.4 million and sold 365 million $TICS tokens, priced at just $0.0311. With over 11,100 token holders, the project has built a strong community, reflecting confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts Are Bullish: $10–$15 Predictions for $TICS It’s rare for a project to capture both market excitement and analyst confidence, but Qubetics has done just that. Experts predict that $TICS tokens could reach $10–$15 after the mainnet launch, thanks to Qubetics’ technological edge and growing adoption. The non-custodial wallet, for instance, is a game-changer for crypto users seeking security and simplicity. Combined with Qubetics’ scalability solutions, this innovation positions $TICS as a token with real-world utility—an essential factor for sustained growth in the crypto space. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Pass You By If you missed out on ICP, don’t let history repeat itself. Qubetics offers a second chance to be part of a blockchain revolution, combining cutting-edge technology with a user-centric approach. The current presale stage is your opportunity to secure $TICS tokens at just $0.034 before prices potentially skyrocket. With predictions of $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, the time to act is now. Qubetics isn’t just following in ICP’s footsteps; it’s carving out its own path as a blockchain leader. Whether you’re an investor or a tech enthusiast, this is your chance to ride the next wave of innovation. Visit the Qubetics presale platform today and claim your stake in the future of blockchain.

His proposal reflects how digital currencies are gaining more acceptance, even from skeptics and critics. For years, Peter Schiff, vocal Bitcoin critic. He has repeatedly argued that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value, generates no income, and is driven purely by speculation. Even called it as “Bubble.” Schiff’s shift on proposing USA coin Yet, there is a twist, Schiff has recently proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin,” instead of Bitcoin Reserve, which is similar to Bitcoin in many ways. Could this sudden shift in his perspective reveal contradictions in long-standing criticism and indicate a selective acceptance of cryptocurrency principles? Schiff has always been an opponent of Bitcoin, emphasizing its limitations as an asset. According to him, Bitcoin is inability to generate income makes it inferior to traditional assets like real estate, which produce rents that can cover debt payments. He has also dismissed Bitcoin as a store of value, arguing that its price surges are driven by hype and FOMO (fear of missing out) rather than fundamental stability, even after it reached $100,000. Schiff criticized the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposed by some U.S. policymakers and Senator Cynthia Lummis being a part. Especially, the idea of using Bitcoin as a reserve to clear the national debt. Schiff argued that this move would destabilize the U.S. economy and weaken the dollar, warning that government involvement in Bitcoin could lead to hyperinflation. From Bitcoin critic to advocate of centralized digital currency Despite his opposition to Bitcoin, Schiff has now proposed the creation of a government-backed digital currency called “USA Coin.” According to him, the coin could have a capped supply of 21 million as same as Bitcoin, but with an upgraded blockchain to make it viable for everyday payments. So, that could make all rich. This proposal seems to reflect Schiff’s partial acceptance of cryptocurrency concepts while rejecting Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. Ultimately Schiff’e idea of USA Coin opposes Bitcoin’s core principle: decentralization. By proposing USA coin, the U.S. government create and control the currency, So, he favors centralized authority and security over Bitcoin’s trustless and decentralized system. Schiff’s proposal questions his real motives. For years, he called Bitcoin a risky bubble driven by influencers and early investors trying to get rich quickly. But, by suggesting a USA Coin, he’s indirectly admitting that digital currencies have value and potential. His problem with Bitcoin’s decentralization seems less about the technology and more about wanting government control. This change shows Schiff may not fully reject digital currencies but dislikes Bitcoin’s lack of rules and central authority. His idea for a government-backed cryptocurrency shows he thinks digital assets need support from a trusted source to be safe and reliable. If Bitcoin became centralized or controlled by the government, would critics like Schiff support it? This reminds of many current adopters and influencers were once a big skeptic and critic, right from the President -elect Trump. Schiff often criticizes Bitcoin because it operates outside traditional banks and government control. Yet, his idea for a USA Coin shows he might accept cryptocurrency if it fits his preference for centralized authority. By suggesting a government-backed digital currency, Schiff seems interested in being part of the growing world of digital assets. Schiff’s mixed views show a bigger debate in finance about cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin supporters see its decentralized model as a way to give people more power and rely less on traditional systems. But critics like Schiff think government support is needed for trust and stability. His idea for a USA Coin also shows how digital currencies are becoming more accepted, even by sceptics. It shows how Bitcoin’s growth has made critics rethink their views, even if they don’t fully agree with it. Peter Schiff’s proposal for a USA Coin shows a shift in his views on cryptocurrency. While he still criticizes Bitcoin’s decentralization, he supports a government-backed alternative, hinting at his preference for control. His evolving stance reflects the growing influence of digital currencies, even among critics.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-21 23:52:00

The cryptocurrency has steadily gained ground, attracting attention. As the price approaches the critical $4.98 resistance, the potential for a breakout looms. A successful move above this level could trigger a new phase of bullish momentum, setting the stage for the token to achieve new highs. Specifically, the $4.98 has been a key barrier in recent trading, and breaking through it would be a significant achievement for SUI. With strong market sentiment building, a breakthrough may inspire more buying pressure, pushing the price even higher. As the asset moves close to this crucial level, the possibility of new record highs becomes increasingly likely, making SUI one of the critical cryptocurrencies to watch in the coming days. SUI Bulls Take Charge Toward $4.98 Threshold SUI is currently demonstrating impressive bullish momentum as its price steadily climbs toward the critical $4.98 resistance level. This price action signals a strong comeback for the token, with bulls steadily regaining control after previous bearish pressure. The $4.98 threshold has emerged as a key point of interest since it represents a potential breakout zone that could drive the price higher toward new highs. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough A successful breach above the $4.98 level would confirm the continuation of the positive trend and attract additional buying interest. This could lead to a shift in market sentiment, with buyers asserting dominance and possibly pushing the price toward the next resistance levels. A Break Above $4.98 Could Signal More Upside SUI’s price has successfully risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a significant technical milestone that signals a shift in market sentiment. Significantly, this rise above the 100-day SMA indicates that the token may be entering a new bullish phase, as the price action is now trading above a key moving average that has historically acted as support or resistance. It reflects a growing market optimism and signs of stability, raising the potential for a continued upward trend. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) confirms strong upbeat strength for SUI, rising above the 50% threshold to 59%. This suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling, signaling a shift in the market and a reversal of the recent downtrend. With the RSI in a neutral-to-bullish zone, there is room for further upside if the momentum continues, supporting the case for continued price gains and a break above $4.98. Related Reading: SUI Hits New ATH, Can Bullish Momentum Lead Price To $5 This Weekend? In conclusion, if SUI’s price breaks above the $4.98 level, it could lead to the formation of new highs, implying a strong continuation of the uptrend. However, failure to breach this resistance may result in a consolidation phase or a pullback, suggesting that sellers could still have control over the market and limiting upside potential.

If you’re looking to capitalise on this fast-growing trend, this month is brimming with potential. Leading the way are BTFD Coin, FLOKI, and BONE. Each of these coins brings something unique to the table, making them the best new meme coins to buy this month. While BTFD Coin is making waves with its blockbuster presale and historic Stage 7 rollback, FLOKI is growing as a decentralised powerhouse, and BONE is carving its niche within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Let’s explore why these three are dominating conversations this month. BTFD Coin: The Bull Market’s Next Big Winner BTFD Coin has taken the crypto world by storm, raising over $4.2 million in its presale. With 57 billion coins sold and more than 6,100 holders onboard, the project’s momentum is undeniable. Now in its 12th stage, BTFD Coin is catching the attention of savvy investors looking to capitalise on its growth potential. What’s driving the hype? Its festive Stage 7 price rollback. For a limited time, buyers can grab BTFD Coin at $0.000064—a steep 50.77% discount from its current Stage 12 price of $0.00013, using the bonus code “BIG50”. This isn’t just a discount; it’s an opportunity to channel the spirit of the legendary 1973 financial crash, where smart investors like Warren Buffett turned chaos into wealth by buying undervalued assets. Here’s why this rollback matters: BTFD Coin is set to list at $0.0006 after the presale ends, promising an ROI of 837.5%. Imagine investing $15,000 at the discounted Stage 7 price. You’d secure 234,375,000 tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment could soar to $140,625. That’s the power of buying the dip at the right time. Beyond its presale success, BTFD Coin offers tangible utility with its Play2Earn gaming platform and staking rewards boasting a 90% APY. Its community-driven ethos ensures that it’s more than just another meme coin—it’s a movement.

Some feared that wallets may have been breached, as hackers always target crypto wallets. Responding to the X post , some users highlighted that the problem was beyond balances, as buying and selling nodes had issues. However, some were relieved and grateful for the reassurance of their funds and their efforts to restore the wallet’s operations. Crypto hackers stole up to $2.2 billion in 2024 Although the Trust Wallet issue was merely a glitch, it caused widespread panic among community members, who feared their wallets had been drained. Their concerns were valid, given the high frequency of security breaches in the crypto space. Chainalysis reports that crypto thieves stole a staggering $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024. Most of the crypto losses in 2024 resulted from hacking associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). A Chainalysis report reveals that North Korean hackers, including the lethal Lazarus, account for 61% of all the crypto stolen this year. Although Decentralized Finance was the most affected by hackers in the earlier months of 2024, centralized finance had the most significant financial blows in the year’s second and third quarters. The DMM Bitcoin suffered a $305 million loss in May from hackers, and in July, WazirX lost $234.9 Million. The team resolved the glitch and resumed normal operations Through their X account, Trust Wallet stated that they successfully resolved the glitch and that the wallet is fully operational. Some users confirmed, saying that they can access their balances. Trust wallet is one of the many digital wallets that crypto users rely on. It has always boasted of its robust safety measures and easy-to-navigate features. The glitch, if otherwise, would have been the biggest test for the digital wallet. Crypto security risks may increase over time, requiring users to be alert. Artificial intelligence might further complicate the situation.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Santiment says that among altcoins with at least a $500 million market cap, tokenized artificial intelligence (AI) project Virtuals ( VIRTUAL ) – an asset that’s up a staggering 20,000% year-to-date – is one of the leaders in terms of whale activity. Santiment also says high-net-worth investors are making moves to accumulate 10 digital assets including VIRTUAL during the latest crypto market crash. “Despite sizable crypto corrections this week, several altcoins are making very large whale transfers that are indicative of potential dip buys.” Other notable altcoins on the list include stablecoin issuer Usual ( USUAL ) and its stablecoin Usual USD ( USD0 ), decentralized betting platform Gnosis ( GNO ), decentralized finance (DeFi) project Aave ( AAVE ), as well as meme asset Floki ( FLOKI ). VIRTUAL is trading for $2.74 at time of writing, a nearly 20% gain on the day. On December 16th, it peaked at $3.34 while a year ago, it was moving for around $0.013. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Santiment says that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest drop to under $100,000 has caused a “buy the dip” mentality among investors. “With Bitcoin falling as low as $95,500 today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over eight months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since that time, Bitcoin’s market cap is +81% higher.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading for $97,006 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 01:07:58

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD surging by $7,000 in under 24 hours. After dipping near December lows of $92,000 and liquidating leveraged long positions, Bitcoin rallied as the weekend began. It reached $99,500 on Bitstamp, with bulls pushing for six-figure territory despite the absence of institutional trading activity. Coinbase saw a resurgence of buying pressure, reversing earlier sell-side activity. “Coinbase buying a lot since lows,” noted trader Exitpump on X, contrasting the buying volumes on Coinbase with those on Binance. Another trader, Superbro, highlighted that Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) acted as a robust support level. On shorter timeframes, Superbro observed a potential breakout pattern forming in the shape of an inverse head and shoulders, a bullish indicator for both short- and long-term trends. Meanwhile, trading account Doctor Magic drew attention to Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI), describing recent movements as a potential “scam” breakdown. “There is a reason I am obsessed about this RSI scam breakdown that I have been posting for a while now; it happened in every major leg up until the first local top,” he explained, referencing past price correlations. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s daily RSI stood at 52, maintaining its position above the critical midpoint of 50. During bull markets, Bitcoin’s RSI often remains above the overbought threshold of 70 for extended periods. While Bitcoin’s resurgence neared $100,000, it came too late for U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors.

If you’re leaning towards the latter, you’re not alone. Meme coins have evolved from light-hearted digital currencies to some of the most lucrative investment opportunities in crypto. This is especially true as we head into 2025, where the best new meme coins to buy for 2025 are already shaping the landscape. At the forefront of this movement is BTFD Coin, with its new festive bonus “BIG50” allowing people to buy $BTFD at a 50% discount and an eye-popping 837% ROI potential. Then there’s Bonk, a Solana-based coin shaking things up with its decentralised, community-first approach, and Sudeng, a rising meme coin that’s making waves with its playful branding and steady growth. Ready to dive in? Let’s break it all down. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin That’s Bullish from the Start If you haven’t heard of BTFD Coin yet, where have you been? This meme coin has been dominating conversations, and for good reason. Since its presale launch, it’s raised over $4.2 million, sold 57 billion tokens, and attracted more than 6,100 investors. That’s not just impressive—it’s revolutionary for a meme coin just getting started. But here’s what’s really grabbing attention: BTFD Coin’s Stage 7 price reversal, where you can buy at $0.000064 instead of its current Stage 12 price of $0.00013, by using the “BIG50” bonus code. This pricing isn’t just a discount; it’s a chance to mimic the strategy of legendary investors like Warren Buffett during the 1973 financial crash. When others panic, the savvy buy—and they prosper. Think about this: If you invest $20,000 at the rollback price, you’d snag 312,500,000 coins. When BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could explode to $187,500. That’s an ROI of 837.5% just for recognising an opportunity when it knocks. Beyond its numbers, BTFD Coin is building an ecosystem designed for long-term engagement. Its Play2Earn gaming platform promises to attract gamers and investors alike, while staking rewards offering 90% APY ensure there’s something for everyone. BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s helping steer the ship. Bonk: Solana’s Meme Coin Marvel If BTFD Coin is the new kid making noise, Bonk is the scrappy underdog carving out its niche. Launched as the first meme coin on Solana, Bonk has built a reputation as a coin for the people. Its decentralised approach and refusal to bow to traditional financial structures have earned it a loyal fanbase, not to mention a hefty trading volume. What makes Bonk one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025 is its commitment to inclusivity. With 50% of its initial supply airdropped to the Solana community, it’s clear that Bonk prioritises its users over profit. That kind of goodwill doesn’t just build a community—it builds staying power. As Solana continues to grow as a blockchain, Bonk stands to benefit from its robust ecosystem. For investors looking to diversify, Bonk offers a chance to get in on the ground floor of something with the potential for explosive growth. Sudeng: The Playful Rising Star Sudeng may not have the same name recognition as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but don’t let that fool you—it’s a contender worth watching. Sudeng is carving out a space in the meme coin market with its focus on community engagement and light-hearted branding that appeals to a wide audience. What sets Sudeng apart is its steady approach to growth. It’s not rushing to make headlines; instead, it’s building a strong, engaged community that believes in its long-term vision. For those tired of high-risk, high-reward plays, Sudeng offers a breath of fresh air—a coin that grows with its investors rather than at their expense. Its playful branding and strategic roadmap make Sudeng one of the best new meme coins to buy for 2025, particularly for those seeking stability in a market known for its volatility. How to Buy $BTFD Coins? Getting in on BTFD Coin’s price rollback is a straightforward process. Start by visiting the BTFD Presale Page , where you can connect your wallet, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, to get started. Once connected, enter the bonus code “BIG50” to unlock the exclusive discounted Stage 7 price. After that, simply input the amount of $BTFD you wish to purchase, review the details, and confirm the transaction. Remember, this festive rollback offer is only available until January 5, 2025, so make sure to act fast before the opportunity passes you by.

BTFD Coin, with its impressive presale success and limited-time Stage 7 rollback, stands out as a game-changer for investors looking to capitalise on its 837% ROI potential. Meanwhile, Bonk continues to prove the power of community-driven projects on Solana, and Sudeng’s steady rise offers a more measured approach to meme coin success. For investors who understand that timing is everything, these coins represent a chance to get ahead in the fast-evolving crypto space.

The crypto analyst alluded to historical data to show how high DOGE could go in this bull cycle. How High Dogecoin Price Could Go In This Market Cycle In an X post, Dima James shared a chart that showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $80 in this market cycle. The analyst also predicted that the cycle top for Dogecoin could happen sometime between February 11th and May 7th, 2025. The analyst alluded to historical data to explain why he is confident that Dogecoin could reach this target. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash: Analyst Says Don’t Get Distracted As RSI Is Still Above A Bullish 50% Analyzing the daily chart, the crypto analyst explained that year 4 is typically the final year of each cycle, which is when the Dogecoin price has peaked every single time. He highlighted an indicator on the chart that has accurately predicted every single Bitcoin top. The analyst noted that Dogecoin tends to peak three to four weeks after Bitcoin reaches its top. In line with this, the analyst predicts that the cycle top for Dogecoin will happen sometime between February 11th and May 7th. Meanwhile, discussing the four-year cycle more, Dima James noted that the Dogecoin price had an impressive performance in this cycle’s year 3 (2024) compared to the year 3s of the previous cycles (2016 and 2020). He further reaffirmed his prediction that the Dogecoin price will finish this year at $0.31, marking the meme coin’s best year 3 performance to date. Year 4 has historically been the most significant year for Dogecoin, and Dima James expects a similar or even greater result in 2025, with Dogecoin outperforming its previous year 4 cycle performances. The analyst believes this will happen due to increased adoption and technological advancements. DOGE Has Found A Local Bottom In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade mentioned that the Dogecoin price may have found a local bottom. The analyst explained that there is a Doji Dragonfly hitting the Fibonacci level of 0.618 on the daily chart. He further noted that DOGE showing price rejection at this level indicates a potential bottom found. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Continues To Hold Steady Between $96,000 And $98,000 The crypto analyst recently mentioned that the Dogecoin price was stuck in a range. He predicted that a break above this range could send Dogecoin to the $1 psychological level. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin had entered the Gaussian channel on the daily chart. The crypto analyst added that the Dogecoin price has halted its downtrend at the channel’s mid-band, highlighting the Gaussian Channel’s supportive nature. In line with this, Trader Tardigrade suggested that Dogecoin is ready for a bullish reversal. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.33, up over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This surge is by a massive airdrop of 310 million HYPE tokens, increasing liquidity and interest. Despite the success, risks such as price instability and liquidity challenges remain. The platform’s unique Dutch auction system adds both excitement and uncertainty. Hyperliquid, has achieved a milestone by reaching a $11.5 billion trading volume and liquidation volume reaching $1.32 billion, as well as setting new all-time highs. This surge is not only a reflection of Hyperliquid’s growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. So, what is behind this explosive growth, and what are the challenges that come with it? Reason behind the Hyperliquid surge The huge increase in trading volume for Hyperliquid is mainly due to its massive airdrop. The platform gave away 310 million HYPE tokens to over 94,000 users. HYPE, played a major role in this surge, quickly rebounding after a market dip and surpassing $33 to set a new historical peak with the assistance fund currently holding around 11.234 million HYPE tokens, which is worth approximately $356 million. The platform’s assets are worth over $1 billion, and tokens like HYPE have even reached over $33, attracting a lot of attention. As more people have started holding and trading the tokens, the platform has seen a huge rise in liquidity and trading volume. Within days, 270 million HYPE tokens were claimed, worth around 11.5 billion, which surrpassed Uniswap’s 2020 airdrop in size. Some people think the price might drop later as the excitement fades, and Hyperliquid still relies on its own DEX trading to keep prices stable. Tokens like PURR and HFUN have seen huge gains, with some rising by 200%, which makes the platform even more attractive. Hyperliquid stands out from other decentralized exchanges with its unique trading system and low fees. It has $2.62 billion in locked value and a fee model that supports buybacks and ecosystem growth. The platform’s token supply is limited to 270.9 million out of a possible 1 billion, creating scarcity and demand. While Bitcoin and other altcoins saw price drops, HYPE’s price increased. Hyperliquid uses a Dutch auction system, where token prices drop until a buyer is found, thus driving up the token’s value quickly by limiting the number of tokens and using this auction model. Hyperliquid avoids flooding the market with too many low-value tokens, keeping them more exclusive. Auctions for tokens like GOD and HFUN have shown how quickly they can generate high demand. Hyperliquid’s high liquidity, especially for HYPE and other tokens, has been key to its record trading volume. As more tokens are added to the platform, liquidity keeps improving, which is attracting more traders. The liquidity to the market cap ratio of HYPE is 4.8%, which increases trading activity as more assets could join the platform. The other side Even though Hyperliquid has been successful, its approach comes with risks. The limited number of tokens and auctions help prevent oversaturation but can also make prices unstable. New tokens often lack liquidity or market makers, which can cause their prices to freeze. However, as more liquidity comes in, some tokens might suddenly spike in price. The airdrop-driven surge in users could lead to price instability. Once the initial excitement dies down, many users may sell their tokens, causing price drops and volatility. The Dutch auction system also creates unpredictable price discovery. It can lead to overvaluation of tokens, which may experience sharp declines once market sentiment shifts. As more tokens enter the ecosystem, many may lack the liquidity or stability to maintain long-term value, especially as the regulatory landscape for DeFi platforms becomes more uncertain. The increasing cost to secure a ticker, which can reach nearly $1 million, makes it hard for smaller projects to join. This also helps keep out low-value tokens. While this system helps feature valuable tokens, it can also leave some tokens without enough trading activity for a long time, making it risky to trade on the platform. The long-term effects of this approach remain uncertain for now.

DTX Exchange surges 500% in presale, attracting investors amid bearish trends for DOGE and SOL; a 900% rise predicted. Table of Contents DTX Exchange price rises 500%, more gains anticipated CEO: The Dogecoin price aligns with its typical movement The price of Solana may hit $1,000, analyst predicts What may lie ahead for DTX Exchange, Dogecoin & Solana? The crypto market is now experiencing a bearish trend, with many tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) showing red price charts. Although market analysts like CEO and CryptoELITES remain bullish about them, many investors are now turning to a new exchange token. This is DTX Exchange (DTX) , a phase six presale star that has seen its value increase by 500% so far. As it may redefine online trading, experts hint that this altcoin could rise by another 900% in 2025. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange price rises 500%, more gains anticipated As Dogecoin and Solana appear to be in the red, DTX Exchange is making headlines with its presale performance. This phase six presale sensation has made early buyers 500% richer while raising over $10M. With over 300K wallets already having DTX, it is clear interest in this altcoin is high. By holding this altcoin, people will get: Governance voting rights: The ability to vote on future developments for the DTX Exchange platform. Passive income: A percentage of the trading fee revenue generated on DTX Exchange. Staking rewards: Earn up to 15% APY in staking rewards. DTX will also power the DTX Exchange , an upcoming hybrid trading platform that lets users trade over 120K asset classes at up to 1000x leverage. These assets will include gold, stocks, crypto currencies, etc. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX token, which will allow millions of traders to set their eyes on it. As demand rises, so will its price. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, a Tier-1 CEX listing is projected to push this value to $0.20 – a 66% rise from its current price. This could make DTX one of the top altcoins for fast returns. CEO: The Dogecoin price aligns with its typical movement Although Dogecoin is one of the meme coin titans, its value has dropped recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Dogecoin price fell over 20% in the past 30 days. During that time, its value moved between around $0.40 and nearly $0.30. Crypto analyst CEO thinks this movement aligns with this meme coin’s typical 3-4 year cycle. According to his X post, Dogecoin may soar past $1 after a reversal comes soon. However, the Dogecoin market cap still sits at around $45B, which could hinder its growth. This meme coin will need a lot of new money for its price to see noteworthy gains. Crypto currencies like DTX Exchange will not have this problem, meaning fast returns for investors. The price of Solana may hit $1,000, analyst predicts Solana is among the top 10 altcoins at the moment. However, it has seen some red price charts recently as a bearish trend is gripping the entire crypto market. On the one-month chart, the Solana price has dropped over 20%—from around $240 to nearly $180. But, market expert CryptoELITES remains optimistic about Solana. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this altcoin will soar to $1,000 in the upcoming massive bull market. This Solana price prediction has given many traders faith in its growth. Although the Solana crypto may rebound soon, investors are also considering the DTX Exchange’s advantages. For instance, the Solana blockchain has around 65K TPS, while the DTX blockchain boasts over 100K TPS. This could make DTX a favorite over SOL. What may lie ahead for DTX Exchange, Dogecoin & Solana? While Dogecoin and Solana could rebound again as they have strong community backing, experts are also bullish about DTX Exchange. They claim its fair-launch model, ties to the $18T gold market, and small market cap could give it faster gains and more stability. Therefore, experts think this altcoin may soar by 900% in 2025.

It’s like walking into a candy store, but you choose investments that could turn small bets into big wins instead of sweets. With the market constantly evolving, finding the best altcoins to buy this week can feel like hitting the jackpot. Fortunately, three contenders stand out: Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and VeChain (VET). Each has its own unique flavour—from innovation to reliability and beyond. Let’s dive in to see why these projects have captured the imagination of investors everywhere. Qubetics, a cutting-edge crypto platform making waves in the blockchain world, is at the centre of today’s buzz. But it’s not alone. Litecoin and VeChain have long been favourites in the crypto community for their dependability and innovative features . If you want to diversify your portfolio with promising altcoins, these three are worth a closer look. Qubetics: The New King of Innovation Qubetics is turning heads in the crypto space, and for good reason. Currently in its 13th presale stage, this rising star has sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to more than 11,100 holders. That’s over $7.4 million raised, with the token priced at an attractive $0.0342. What’s got analysts so excited? It’s the potential for exponential growth . Predictions suggest $TICS could skyrocket to $10 or even $15 after its mainnet launch, offering jaw-dropping ROI figures of 29,107% and 43,711%, respectively. Imagine dropping $40,000 on $TICS today—that could translate to a mind-boggling $11.6 million if it hits $10. Unreal, right? But Qubetics isn’t just about hyped numbers. It’s the tech that truly sets it apart. Enter QubeQode IDE, a revolutionary blockchain development tool that simplifies smart contract creation and blockchain development. Whether you’re a business, a developer, or just someone curious about blockchain, QubeQode IDE has something for everyone. Picture this: a small business wanting to create a loyalty programme could use QubeQode to roll out tokenised rewards without needing a tech team. Or think about freelancers securing payment contracts that execute automatically when work is delivered. From decentralised VPNs to cross-border payment solutions, Qubetics has all the ingredients to become a blockchain powerhouse. What makes this even sweeter? Analysts believe the project’s accessibility and innovation could attract widespread adoption, making it one of the best altcoins to buy this week. With its presale success and a clear roadmap for real-world utility, Qubetics isn’t just a gamble; it’s a calculated bet on the future of blockchain . Litecoin: The Digital Silver That Keeps Delivering If Bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is its reliable silver sibling. Created by Charlie Lee in 2011, Litecoin has carved out its niche as one of the most dependable cryptocurrencies on the market. LTC has been a favourite among investors looking for stability and growth potential for over a decade. With its faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin, it’s no surprise that Litecoin has maintained a strong market presence. One of Litecoin’s standout features is its adoption in the payments space. Many merchants accept LTC as a form of payment, making it a practical choice for everyday transactions. Imagine buying a coffee or booking a flight with your Litecoin wallet. It’s that seamless. And let’s not forget its track record as a go-to investment for crypto enthusiasts who want an alternative to traditional stocks and bonds. Over the years, Litecoin’s price movements have mirrored the broader crypto market, making it an essential asset for those who want to ride the market’s highs while mitigating its lows. So, why is Litecoin still one of the best altcoins to buy this week? It’s all about staying power and innovation. Litecoin recently underwent a halving event, reducing its block reward and potentially driving scarcity. Analysts believe this could pave the way for long-term price appreciation. With its robust ecosystem and strong community backing, LTC remains a solid choice for both new and seasoned investors. VeChain: The Supply Chain Game-Changer VeChain isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a full-fledged platform designed to revolutionise supply chain management. Launched in 2015, VeChain uses blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency in retail, agriculture, and healthcare industries. Imagine being able to track your wine from vineyard to table or verify the authenticity of your luxury handbag with a simple scan. That’s the kind of innovation VeChain brings to the table. The VeChainThor blockchain powers its ecosystem, enabling businesses to create decentralised apps and smart contracts tailored to their needs. What makes VeChain particularly attractive is its dual-token system. While VET is used for value transfer, VTHO fuels transactions on the network. This setup ensures scalability and cost-efficiency, two critical factors for mainstream adoption. VeChain’s partnerships are another reason it’s one of the best altcoins to buy this week. Heavyweights like Walmart China, BMW, and Deloitte have all tapped into VeChain’s technology to enhance their operations. These collaborations validate VeChain’s utility and position it as a leader in blockchain solutions for the real world. For investors, VeChain offers a unique blend of stability and growth potential. Its strong focus on enterprise applications sets it apart from other altcoins, making it a favourite among those looking for a mix of innovation and reliability. With VET trading at attractive levels, now might be the perfect time to add it to your portfolio. Conclusion: Seize the Opportunity In the ever-changing world of crypto, finding the best altcoins to buy this week can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But Qubetics, Litecoin, and VeChain stand out as clear winners. Qubetics offers mind-blowing growth potential and real-world utility with its QubeQode IDE , while Litecoin delivers reliability and everyday usability. VeChain, on the other hand, is redefining how industries manage their supply chains, making it a long-term investment gem. So, what’s your next move? Whether you’re looking for explosive growth or steady returns, these altcoins have something for everyone. Don’t sit on the sidelines—get in the game and make your portfolio work for you. Remember, the early bird gets the worm, and in the crypto world, timing is everything. Ready to take the plunge?

Table of Contents Plutus v3 and decentralized governance: Will the Cardano price make another rally? PropiChain: Bringing creativity to the $300 trillion real estate sector Why PropiChain Presale is a lucrative opportunity for investors As the Cardano price market performance continues to fluctuate, enthusiasts are keenly watching the developments around the asset, which, despite its recent struggles, has garnered optimism for 2025. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, believes that the upcoming year could be transformative for ADA, especially as new competitors like PropiChain (PCHAIN) aim for astonishing growth in the coming year. You might also like: PropiChain’s crypto presale is changing real estate investment unlocking this $300T sector Plutus v3 and decentralized governance: Will the Cardano price make another rally? Cardano (ADA) continues demonstrating its commitment to creativity and decentralization with the recent launch of the Plutus v3 upgrade. This update significantly improves the blockchain’s smart contract capabilities, introducing more robust and efficient features that set ADA apart in the competitive blockchain space. The upgrade aligns seamlessly with the broader vision of complete decentralization, as governance now rests in the hands of ADA token holders. Introducing the Constitutional Committee as a temporary oversight body adds another layer of security, with plans to dissolve the committee once the governance framework is fully ratified. Despite these advancements, the Cardano price remains volatile. Trading at $1.093, the token has seen a modest 2.7% gain in recent days but remains within a tight price range. Yet, investor sentiment remains optimistic, with the Cardano price action scoring a strong 74 on the Fear & Greed Index. Over the past month, the Cardano price has gained 30%, highlighting its resilience amid market turbulence. PropiChain: Bringing creativity to the $300 trillion real estate sector While the Cardano price strategizes for a promising 2025, new entrants like PropiChain are making bold claims in the crypto space. PropiChain aims to change the real estate market by using blockchain technology to facilitate tokenized property investments. Built on a unique blockchain technology, the platform integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the Metaverse to create a seamless ecosystem for buying, selling, and managing properties. PropiChain eliminates the need for complex paperwork, intermediaries, and geographical constraints by tokenizing real estate assets into NFTs, enabling investors to transact securely and efficiently. One of PropiChain’s standout features is its fractional ownership model, allowing users to buy and sell portions of high-value properties. This democratizes access to the lucrative real estate market, empowering individuals with limited capital to invest alongside institutional players. Moreover, AI plays a key role in the PropiChain ecosystem, providing AI-driven analytics to simplify property valuation, predict market trends, and automate transactions, ensuring that users make informed decisions with minimal effort. The platform’s integration with the Metaverse adds a layer to real estate exploration. Through virtual reality (VR), investors can tour properties from anywhere in the world, gaining a deeper understanding of their features without needing physical visits. The Propiverse feature expands opportunities for buyers and improves property marketing strategies for sellers. This reduces the time spent analyzing the market and travel costs. PropiChain also addresses the security challenge with its decentralized Title Contract system, which records all transactions on an immutable ledger. This approach eliminates risks such as fraud, corruption, and counterparty defaults, making real estate investments safer than ever. Additionally, smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, automate leasing processes, rental payments, and lease renewals, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing transparency. Why PropiChain Presale is a lucrative opportunity for investors Listed on CoinMarketCap , PropiChain’s token presale is structured across multiple rounds, offering early participants the chance to acquire PCHAIN tokens at progressively increasing prices. In the current second round, the token is priced at $0.011 targeting a subsequent stage price surge to $0.023. Upon conclusion of the presale, the listing price is anticipated to be $0.032, providing early investors with substantial potential returns. For instance, an investment at the initial price point could yield an 800% return by the time of listing. Moreover, analysts have projected that PCHAIN could experience an over 120x increase, translating to significant gains for early adopters. Beyond the attractive pricing, PropiChain offers investors additional benefits, including property discounts, governance rights, and high annual percentage yields (APY) on holdings, with some estimates suggesting up to 225% APY.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 02:27:03

Dogwifhat WIF has experienced significant fluctuations recently, with its price ranging between $2.38 and $3.52. In the past week, the coin’s value dropped by 31.03%, and over the last month, it declined by 39.02%. Despite these short-term decreases, WIF has shown resilience over the past six months, gaining 19.71%, which suggests potential for long-term growth. The technical indicators hint at possible future movements. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28.61, indicating that the coin is currently oversold and might be poised for a rebound. The price is approaching a key support level at $1.91. If this support holds, WIF could bounce back toward the nearest resistance at $4.19, representing a substantial increase from current levels. Moving averages also provide insights into WIF’s trend. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.24, while the 100-day SMA is $2.62. A crossover could signal a shift in momentum. Additionally, the MACD level is at -0.0740, suggesting that bearish momentum may be waning. Traders are watching to see if WIF will rally or if it will test the second support level at $0.7749. Avalanche Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price fell by 18.86%, marking a significant short-term decline. However, over the past month, AVAX gained 10.91%, indicating a positive trend. Looking at the last six months, the price increased by 43.24%, demonstrating substantial growth in the medium term. The current price ranges from $42.59 to $57.15. The nearest resistance level is $63.55, while the nearest support is at $34.42. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 27.18, suggesting that the token is oversold and may be due for a rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $41.95, which is below the 100-day SMA of $47.35, hinting at potential upward movement. If AVAX breaks through the resistance at $63.55, it could target the next level at $78.12, representing a significant increase. Based on these indicators, AVAX may be set for a price rise. The oversold RSI and stochastic levels point to a possible upward correction. If the price holds above the support at $34.42 and gains momentum, it might reach higher resistance levels. The MACD level of -1.1796 also suggests potential for a trend reversal. Overall, the data points to growth potential for AVAX in the near future. Conclusion While WIF and AVAX show promise, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend and ambitious 20,000% growth target position it as a standout in the current bull run.

Its platform offers a compelling combination of speed, security, and accessibility, setting it apart from traditional exchanges. A key differentiator is Lunex’s extensive interoperability, which supports transactions across more than 40 different blockchains. This expansive reach provides users with unparalleled access to a diverse range of digital assets. To further empower users, Lunex offers a comprehensive portfolio tracker, providing real-time market insights to inform trading decisions. Furthermore, its non-custodial design ensures users retain complete control over their assets and private keys. At the same time, a robust staking program offers attractive APYs of up to 18%, creating additional passive income streams. The platform’s commitment to security is further reinforced by a comprehensive audit conducted by SolidProof, a reputable blockchain security firm. Analysts predict Filecoin price expansion amid ecosystem development Filecoin and its decentralized storage’s transformative potential have made the headlines, too. What started subtly as that democratized file storage and management network has expanded beyond reach. Recently, Filecoin unveiled integration with Akave and Storacha to redefine blockchain-based data management. Analysts predict these advancements could drive Filecoin price crypto gains as demand surges in gaming, AI, and enterprise storage sectors. Beyond this, Filecoin price is getting a bullish outlook at the heel of the network’s AI explorations. Recent collaborations with projects like Ramo and Kite AI underscore its commitment to decentralized, transparent, and scalable AI solutions. Filecoin is solidifying its dominance in the blockchain storage arena, and so is the Filecoin price on the charts. Monero post-crypto gains despite privacy-focused tech adversities Another altcoin showing much resilience and potential is Monero. The leading privacy-focused network is defying challenges with strong crypto gains. Despite the bearish storm and CEX delistings, Monero has painted a picture perfectly. Monero’s price has surged 13% MoM trading, and key technical indicators support optimism. Analysts predict upward movement, eyeing resistance levels at $268 and $333. Amid this market performance, Monero is advancing its privacy technology to confront future risks. Monero developers recently pioneered a quantum-resistant protocol with lattice-based cryptography to secure its blockchain from future computational breakthroughs. This innovation stands as a beacon against technological and regulatory threats that Monero is facing. Conclusion Filecoin, Monero, and Lunex Network represent a compelling trifecta for discerning crypto investors. While Filecoin and Monero may have maxed out their potential, Lunex Network brings a fresh take on DeFi and financial freedom. Its unique cross-chain DEX and rapidly growing presale present a unique opportunity for substantial crypto gains. Stats don’t stutter! Lunex presale has accrued over $5.3M in mere months.

While Pepe and Tron have established their names in the market, Lighchain AI, priced at a modest $0.003 during its presale , is capturing attention for its innovative approach and exponential growth potential. Let’s analyze these projects and uncover which one might become the next top gainer. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Riding the Memecoin Wave Pepe Coin jumped into the crypto world, riding the wave of wins made by well-liked memecoins like Dogecoin and a Shiba Inu. Its fun branding, bright online group and popular ads, it has fast caught the eye of both crypto fans and simple buyers. The climb of Pepe shows the big sway of web culture and jokes in forming crypto trends. But, Pepe’s future mostly rests on group excitement and market feeling instead ͏of clear use or a set plan for growth. The memecoin now misses traits that give real-world worth or lasting reasons to use it, which might affect its ability to last in the long run. For the time being, it grows on guesswork interest, pulling in backers keen for fast gains in an unstable market. Tron (TRX) Steady Contender in Blockchain Utility Tron has been a consistent and prominent player in the blockchain space, carving out a niche by focusing on decentralized content and applications. Launched in 2017, Tron aims to create a global digital entertainment system that allows for secure and cost-effective distribution of content without intermediaries. Its blockchain infrastructure is known for fast transaction speeds, high scalability, and minimal fees, which have made it an attractive choice for developers and enterprises seeking efficient solutions. In addition to powering decentralized applications (dApps), Tron has recently expanded its ecosystem to include decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), further diversifying its use cases. These expansions position Tron as a versatile and multi-dimensional platform. For instance, its DeFi initiatives are aimed at creating open and accessible financial systems, while its foray into NFTs supports the growing demand for digital collectibles and unique tokenized assets. Lighchain AI (LCAI) Newcomer With Revolutionary Potential Lighchain AI stands out as the most promising contender in this trio, thanks to its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Positioned as a disruptor in the DeFi and AI markets, LCAI brings unmatched innovation and utility. Why Lighchain AI Could Be the Next Big Thing Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM enables developers to build AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) across industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) A unique consensus mechanism that rewards nodes for performing AI computations, creating value beyond just blockchain validation. Deflationary Tokenomics LCAI employs a deflationary model, burning a portion of transaction fees to reduce supply and increase scarcity, making it an ideal long-term investment. High ROI Potential Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , analysts project a potential rise to $2 by 2025, offering a staggering 6,666% ROI for early adopters. Which Crypto Will Reign Supreme? Lighchain AI a relatively new project, is already generating significant buzz and establishing itself as a formidable competitor to established cryptos like Pepe Coin and Tron. Its innovative features and potential for exponential growth make it an exciting prospect for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. Also the presale success of LCAI a great opportunity to invest before the public sale, which is expected to drive up demand and increase its value. However, Pepe Coin and Tron’s established market presence gives them an edge in terms of current popularity and widespread adoption. Ultimately, the future performance of these cryptocurrencies will depend on various factors such as community support, technological advancements, and wider mainstream acceptance. As always, it is important for investors to perform their own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions. Bright Future for Lighchain AI The crypto market continues to evolve, and projects like Lighchain AI (LCAI) are pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve. As Pepe rides the memecoin wave and Tron solidifies its place in DeFi, Lighchain AI offers investors a unique opportunity to be part of a transformative project with real-world impact and exponential growth potential. Whether it will become the next big gainer is yet to be seen, but one thing is for sure LCAI is certainly a promising contender in the crypto world and one to watch closely in the coming years. So, it is safe to say that exciting times lie ahead for all three cryptocurrencies, with each offering unique opportunities and potential for growth. The future of the cryptocurrency market remains unpredictable, making it an exciting space for investors to explore new opportunities and find their next successful investment.

Despite this sharp downturn, XRP has shown resilience, bouncing back with a notable 20% recovery since yesterday. This quick rebound has reignited discussions about XRP’s long-term prospects, even as short-term sentiment remains shaky. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Losses Spike 3 Times The Weekly Average – Healthy Correction Or Downturn? According to data shared by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez, whales have accumulated 80 million XRP since the correction began on December 17. This surge in whale activity suggests a growing confidence among large investors, who appear to be seizing the opportunity to buy XRP at lower prices. Such accumulation often signals a long-term bullish outlook, even as the broader market navigates periods of uncertainty. While XRP’s recovery is encouraging, it comes amid a backdrop of negative sentiment and price instability. The coming days will likely prove crucial in determining whether XRP can maintain its upward momentum or if further consolidation is on the horizon. For now, whale activity offers a glimmer of optimism, hinting at sustained interest in the asset despite recent setbacks. XRP Whales Loading Up XRP is currently trading 22% below its multi-year high of $2.90, following a period of heightened market volatility. Despite the recent turbulence, XRP has maintained its footing above the $1.90 low—a critical support level that serves as the bulls’ last line of defense. Holding this level is essential for preserving the broader bullish structure and preventing a deeper correction. Recent data from Santiment, shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, highlights a significant development: whales have purchased 80 million XRP since the correction began on December 17. This accumulation by large investors suggests growing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential despite the short-term price decline. Historically, whale activity has often preceded significant price movements, as these investors typically have access to better market insights. If XRP can sustain its position above $2 and begin to push through crucial supply zones, a rapid recovery could follow. Overcoming these resistance levels would likely pave the way for renewed bullish momentum, with the potential to retest multi-year highs. Related Reading: Solana Holds Monthly Support As Network Activity Grows – Time For A Breakout? While challenges remain, such as prevailing market uncertainty and cautious sentiment, the combination of strong support and significant whale accumulation offers an optimistic outlook for XRP in the weeks ahead. Holding current levels could signal the start of a new upward trajectory. Testing Liquidity Above $2 XRP is trading at $2.35, marking a strong recovery from its recent dip to $1.95. This rebound underscores the resilience of XRP’s price action, as it continues to hold above key support levels. The $1.95 low has proven to be a pivotal point for bulls, and maintaining this momentum could signal further gains in the coming days. However, for the rally to gain credibility, XRP must reclaim the $2.60 mark. This level serves as a critical resistance point and a confirmation zone for bullish sentiment. Breaking above $2.60 would likely attract more buying interest, propelling XRP toward retesting multi-year highs. On the flip side, a loss of the $2 support level would shift the narrative. Such a move would expose XRP to further downside risks, potentially leading to a deeper correction. Market sentiment remains cautious, and a break below $2 could result in accelerated selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Data Reveals No Significant Panic Selling In The Market – Shakeout Or Trend Shift? For now, XRP’s outlook hinges on its ability to navigate between these crucial levels. Bulls will need to push the price above $2.60 to validate the rally, while bears will aim to drag it below $2 to seize control. The next few sessions will be critical in defining XRP’s short-term trend.

ETH believers were almost exposed to its future price, which would shoot up to approximately $0.66. For instance, when it was first launched in 2015, it was only worth approximately $0.66. Just as predicted, investors saw their initial investment multiply when ETH reached thousands. Luckily for those who missed out on the bullish moves, ETH now has a new investment lookalike, Rexas Finance (RXS) , says Ethereum Bull Touts. Its token, RXS, has a low entry cost, and it’s expected to experience great growth in the upcoming months. They are predicting a potential of $20 for RXS. Whales have accumulated RXS You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted What is Rexas Finance Tokenizing real estate, commodities, and collectibles is a foreign term, but it will redefine economies. Rexas enables investors fractional ownership of RWA. RWA stands for Real World Assets, which reinforces the globalization of financial markets. Rexas Finance is the leader for realigning traditional financial assets into a decentralized ecosystem. However, with such great potential comes a massive barrier to entry and high transaction costs. Still, Rexas makes the purchase easy. Total global RWA is valued at over $379 trillion, which allows Rexas to address major issues within economies of illiquidity and massive costs. With RWA now addressing these major problems, flipping this chart from red to green, the number of pathways to invest in the market is now cheap. Rexas facilitates these pathways with the QuickMint Bot and GenAI systems, making token creation simple and accessible. These technologies allow businesses and individuals to convert assets into tokens easily and reduce the difficulty of trading on blockchain platforms. Why RXS mirrors Ethereum’s early potential The synergy between RXS and Ethereum is fascinating. RXS perfectly depicts the ‘new world’ of digital asset creation, specifically the digital asset trading landscape. Rexas Finance is perfectly positioned to be part of the next big blockchain revolution by reaching out to global markets. Ethereum gained considerable acceptance and growth as a result of its use. In the same vein, RXS’s potential impact on pricing will be seen in its real-world applications and expansion of its environment. Over the next few months, a spike in acceptance has prompted analysts to project RXS could achieve $20 — an amazing 13,233% upsurge relative to its present presale price of $0.15. Robust tokenomics backing RXS’s growth RXS will thrive on the market because the token has been designed with a robust structure of tokenomics, which supports the strategy of balancing acceptance and value increase in the long run. As for RXS, its circulating supply stands at 1 billion tokens, and the distribution is outlined as follows: 42.5% for presale, promoting early engagement in the project. 10% for treasury, building a large global community. 15% for liquidity, fostering multi-exchange trading. 30.5% for staking rewards, marketing, and team engagement, stimulating activity and creativity. This degree of distribution ensures diversity in the ecosystem while enhancing early and consistent holders. Also, the demand for RXS will be driven by the ecosystem’s growth due to its currency utility as a token on the platform. Long-term predictions regarding RXS position it at even higher levels as its growth curve is similar to that of Ethereum, as institutional or mainstream users capitalize on the currency. The new face of the blockchain Although Ethereum’s smart contract and DeFi development changed the game, RXS is poised to be the new face of the following stage of blockchain evolution—the fusion between digital assets and real-world assets. Rexas Finance is a project that tackles multiple real-world problems, such as illiquidity and deficiency, providing immediate use cases and long-term disrupting capabilities. It almost seems like Ethereum investors at $0.66 believed they’d purchased something at the early stages of what would eventually become a new project. Likewise, those purchasing RXS at 0.15 might just be in for the ride of their lives. Conclusion Rexas Finance is no ordinary currency; it is going to change the future by eliminating the barriers of asset ownership and investment while making finance accessible worldwide. It has the potential to tokenize and democratize access to real-world assets, which makes it one of the most unique blockchain projects of this decade. With forecasts predicting RXS to be at $20 in the near term, RXS is positioned towards investors seeking to replicate what early Ethereum investors did, where they made thousands of dollars. The time when cryptocurrencies relied on duplicitous tokens is yet to come; thus, grab RXS altcoin, as this is the monumental moment to do so.

The latest chatter in the crypto streets has all eyes on meme coins. While Goatseus Maximus and ANDY face a downturn, BTFD Coin is stealing the spotlight with its presale discount, creating waves across the community. If you’ve been snoozing, you might’ve missed the memo—BTFD Coin is surging past milestones faster than a caffeine-fueled day trader. Meanwhile, Goatseus Maximus and ANDY are struggling to hold the line as their value takes a nosedive. Meme coins have been driving crypto mania for years, evolving from jokes to serious investment contenders. Who can forget the Dogecoin frenzy or the meteoric rise of Shiba Inu? But the market’s evolving, and investors are no longer just chasing laughs—they’re seeking solid returns. That’s where BTFD Coin steps in, marrying meme magic with utility and a roadmap that actually gets people talking. What makes BTFD Coin shine isn’t just the hype—it’s the real-world opportunities packed into its ecosystem. From a thrilling play-to-earn (P2E) game to staking rewards and an innovative referral program, BTFD Coin promises to redefine the meme coin game. Add to that its vibrant community backing, and you’ve got a project that’s ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips into Gold “Buy the dip.” It’s the mantra of seasoned investors, and BTFD Coin has built an entire brand around it. The world economy has seen its fair share of chaos—take 1973, for instance, when a major financial crash rocked global markets. History has shown that turbulent times can be gold mines for those bold enough to act. That’s the spirit BTFD Coin embodies—turning market chaos into wealth opportunities. Since launching its presale, BTFD Coin has been on fire. The presale is dominating the scene, letting investors buy at Stage 7 prices while the rest are in Stage 12. At $0.000064, this offers a massive 837.5% ROI at launch. Just use the code BIG50 – because catching dips has never been this profitable. Imagine this: You invest $50,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. That nets you 781,250,000 coins. When BTFD Coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to $468,750. Yep, you read that right—nearly half a million dollars from a $50K stake. And the best part? You can still grab coins at the discounted Stage 7 price during Stage 12 by using the bonus code BIG50 on their presale page. BTFD isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a whole vibe. The P2E game is designed to hook gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, while staking rewards offer passive income opportunities. Add in the referral program, where users can earn extra coins for spreading the word, and it’s clear BTFD has thought of everything to keep its community engaged and invested. Goatseus Maximus: From Hype to Hope Goatseus Maximus burst onto the scene with a roar, capturing imaginations with its tongue-in-cheek name and audacious marketing. But lately? The roar’s turned into a whimper. Its price has been on a steady decline, leaving investors scratching their heads and wondering what’s next. The project’s decline isn’t for lack of trying. Goatseus Maximus attempted to pivot with community-driven initiatives and vague promises of future utility. But in the cutthroat meme coin arena, vague doesn’t cut it. Investors crave tangible progress, and without it, confidence erodes. While the coin’s creators are scrambling to revive its fortunes, the clock is ticking, and the market isn’t known for its patience. That’s not to say Goatseus Maximus is dead in the water. If the team can deliver on its promises—or better yet, surprise the market with a game-changing move—it might claw its way back. But for now, it’s hard to see Goatseus Maximus as anything more than a cautionary tale. If you’re holding, you’re likely sweating bullets. If you’re considering buying in, proceed with caution and keep your eyes peeled for signs of a comeback. ANDY: Riding the Meme Coin Rollercoaster ANDY had its moment in the sun, riding a wave of celebrity endorsements and viral memes. But as the saying goes, “What goes up must come down.” And down it’s gone. Once a darling of meme coin enthusiasts, ANDY is now struggling to maintain relevance. The coin’s challenges stem partly from its overreliance on hype. While its initial surge was exhilarating, the lack of a solid roadmap or meaningful utility left ANDY vulnerable to market whims. It’s a classic case of a project flying too close to the sun—all flash, no substance. As the market matures, meme coins without a strong foundation are finding it harder to survive. That’s not to say ANDY is a lost cause. The team has hinted at upcoming developments that could reinvigorate the project. But in a landscape crowded with meme coins promising the moon, ANDY will need to deliver something truly extraordinary to win back investors. Until then, it remains a risky bet, more suited for thrill-seekers than cautious planners.

The crypto space heats up with Rollblock, Dogecoin, and Cardano vying for dominance in 2025, with Rollblock raising $7.4M. Table of Contents Rollblock: Redefining eGaming and poised to dominate the gambling industry Dogecoin’s bears may soon dominate the market as challenges looms Cardano balances challenges with strong growth drivers Rollblock’s recent milestones boost its potential The crypto space is heating up as investors eye the potential of Rollblock , Dogecoin, and Cardano for 2025. While Dogecoin rides on its meme appeal and Cardano pushes creativity with its blockchain technology, Rollblock is turning heads with its real-world gambling solutions and fresh approach. Each offers unique opportunities, but which one holds the edge for growth? Notably, Rollblock has already raised $7.4 million in its ICO so far. You might also like: DeFi ecosystem for BTC, says Hoskinson; Rollblock early backers to take advantage Rollblock: Redefining eGaming and poised to dominate the gambling industry Rollblock is an eGaming casino that is set to alter the gambling market. This project provides secure, fair gaming and complete regulatory compliance with a Curacao eGaming License. Rollblock utilizes Ethereum to encrypt all bets and is tamper-proof, providing complete transparency and trust for its users. The platform just recently got approval from the Anjouan Gaming Authority, known for establishing the gold standard for internet gambling regulation. This seal of approval signifies that Rollblock’s extensive platform, featuring over 7,000 casino games and sports betting options, meets the highest industry benchmarks for security and reliability. Boasting a thriving community of 25,000 gamers, Rollblock generates significant daily revenue. A portion of this income is redistributed weekly through a unique revenue-sharing model that buys RBLK tokens from the open market. Users can stake 40% of these tokens for some of the highest APYs in crypto while the remaining 60% is burned, driving scarcity and boosting value. The platform’s presale has already raised over $7.4 million, with tokens priced at $0.043. Experts predict an explosive trajectory once Rollblock officially launches in 2025. Positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing $540 billion online gaming market—projected to reach $800 billion in five years — Rollblock is set to carve out a significant share. Dogecoin’s bears may soon dominate the market as challenges looms Dogecoin dipped over 29% this last week to $0.28 after briefly reaching $0.48. Additionally, Dogecoin slipped below the key $0.39 support level, indicating some recent volatility. Dogecoin has traded in a consolidation phase between $0.49 and $0.35 in the last 4 weeks. Regardless of the fluctuations, several holders in the Dogecoin community remain optimistic, expecting a rally. On-chain data shows considerable whale accumulation, indicating big investors are positioning themselves for future gains in the Dogecoin ecosystem. However, Dogecoin faces challenges. DOGE was developed in 2013 as an enjoyable alternative to Bitcoin and has a zero supply cap. This means that 10,000 tokens are produced every minute, and right now, the memecoin has 147 billion coins in circulation and is inflationary — triggering worry among potential investors. Additionally, Dogecoin ranks poorly in developer activity, and analysts fear that this could hinder innovation and adoption. Cardano balances challenges with strong growth drivers Cardano (ADA) is navigating a tough price environment, trading below the $1.00 mark and drawing attention from traders. After failing to sustain momentum above $1.12, Cardano saw a pullback, stabilizing near $0.9151. It remains below key levels, including the 100-hourly simple moving average, giving bears a short-term edge. However, Cardano has strong fundamentals driving optimism. Its Hydra layer-2 solution promises faster, cheaper transactions, boosting its appeal for developers and dApps. With over 70% of ADA staked, the network showcases strong community trust. Cardano’s partnerships, like its blockchain integration in Ethiopia’s education system, highlight its real-world applications. Additionally, ADA’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake system aligns with the growing demand for sustainable blockchain solutions. Technical indicators, including RSI and support/resistance levels, suggest potential for upward momentum, keeping analysts bullish on Cardano’s long-term prospects. Rollblock’s recent milestones boost its potential Rollblock’s recent Solid Proof and Anjouan Gaming Authority positions it as the crypto with a greater 2025 potential, potentially better than Cardano and Dogecoin. Backed by unique technology and strong community support, Rollblock stands as a compelling altcoin with immense potential for reshaping the gambling industry.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock, an AI-powered GambleFi protocol, is gaining attention as it challenges Solana and Ripple, with analysts predicting a 50x-100x rally in 2025. Table of Contents Millions of RBLK purchased by investors Is Solana running out of steam? Ripple Price Remains Steady Rollblock a clear favorite among whales A promising new altcoin is expected to take off in 2025 at the expense of major cryptos such as Ripple and Solana. Solana has been unable to follow the price pattern of Bitcoin and has reached a resistance mark around the $220 level. While down 5% in 24 hours, Ripple is performing a little better than the wider market on a monthly basis, trading at just $0.50 in early November. The new altcoin presale that whales are investigating is Rollblock (RBLK) , an AI-powered GambleFi protocol that looks to disrupt traditional casinos. Analysts have suggested that this coin could rally 50x to 100x if market conditions are correct, which is one reason why whales have been migrating to this particular presale. You might also like: Amid market correction, ETH, TON traders see benefits of Rollblock’s deflationary crypto Millions of RBLK purchased by investors Rollblock is a fully licensed, regulated, and secure crypto casino designed to change online gaming. Easily accessible, the platform hosts over 7000 game modes and recently added a sports betting mode that covers most major sports. In addition to its games Rollblock also introduces a revenue share model. As part of this model up to 30% of casino revenue is used to buy RBLK tokens from the market. These are split 60:40 to a dedicated token burn (60%) and staking APY (40%). This makes RBLK deflationary while investors can enjoy a passive income stream. The presale further aims to democratize the centralized gambling industry with instant crypto deposits and easy email sign-up, breaking apart a gigantic $450 million sector. Transparent blockchain analytics on betting history empower users to understand where the funds are going and what they are entitled to. With a wildly turbulent crypto market, it is little surprise that whales are investing in Rollblock. The token price is steeply discounted at $0.043, set to increase to $0.047 in the next round. Moreover, a 20% limited presale bonus is another incentive to purchase the coin before it skyrockets, not after. This is the lowest possible price for RBLK. The presale has raised $7.4 million so far and it has nearly breached its soft cap of $10 million. The crypto casino is already live for play throughout the presale, with a minimum viable product before the fundraising rounds have even been finalized. Is Solana running out of steam? Solana was the best-performing top 20 coin in 2023. After plummeting swiftly due to association with the FTX scandal, Solana went from $9 in December 2022, to $112 in December 2023. The bull run continued all the way to its recent November high of $257, while it currently trades at $181. However, whether Solana can sustain these price movements remains questionable. Even with positive news such as Solana ETP staking in Europe and the likely approval of a Solana Spot ETF in the USA, Solana could easily be described as an overbought token. $181 is not a discounted price for a token that sold for $9 less than 2 years ago. More concerning is the underreported fact that altcoins like Solana no longer seem to have such a strong positive correlation with Bitcoin. Ripple Price Remains Steady Ripple has been one of the best-performing mainstream tokens, with a 5x price rise from early November to its current price of $2.09. This is great news to those who bought at the low in early November. However, Ripple is in a similar position to Solana in terms of investment potential – it’s too late to enter the market. Late-stage investors are paying a premium for an overbought token. Like Solana, it has plenty of updates, partnerships, and upgrades. Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, recently launched on major exchanges. In November, an XRP ETF application was filed in Delaware, and whales also bought over 50 million Ripple tokens. Rollblock a clear favorite among whales RBLK remains a clear winner compared to overpriced coins such as Ripple and Solana, as evidenced by Whale investment. It has a strong use case and offers high growth as a presale with early investors already up over 330%! For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 03:55:00

These alternative cryptocurrencies have carved out niches for themselves, offering innovative tech, specialised use cases, and often, insane growth potential. And let’s be real, who doesn’t want to catch the next big thing before it rockets to the moon? As we wrap up 2024, three standout projects are generating major buzz among crypto enthusiasts: Qubetics (TICS) , Arbitrum (ARB), and EOS (EOS). While each brings something unique to the table, they’re united by their reputation as some of the best coins to buy now. Here’s the lowdown on why these three deserve a closer look, starting with the new kid on the block, Qubetics. Qubetics: Revolutionising Crypto with Multi-Chain Innovation Let’s talk about Qubetics. This isn’t just another crypto presale hyped up on social media; it’s a game-changer in the making. Qubetics is in its 13th presale stage , and the numbers don’t lie. With over 365 million $TICS tokens sold to more than 11,100 holders, this project has already raised a whopping $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, $TICS is shaping up to be one of the best coins to buy now. But you might want to act fast—the price is set to jump by 10% this weekend. The Qubetics Multi-Chain Wallet is a standout feature. Imagine managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even obscure tokens from different blockchains—all in one sleek app. For freelancers working globally, it means getting paid in crypto without stressing over which wallet supports what. For businesses? Seamless transactions across chains. And for the average Joe? No more juggling half a dozen apps. Say you’re in New York paying for coffee with Bitcoin or travelling in Europe and switching to local cryptos; Qubetics’ wallet makes it effortless. What really has analysts talking are the price predictions. By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, delivering a jaw-dropping 630% ROI. Post-presale, it’s forecasted to soar to $5, a mind-boggling 14,500% ROI. And after its mainnet launch? A potential $15 per token, translating to a whopping 43,711% ROI. Do the math: a $100,000 investment now could balloon into $14.6 million if $TICS reaches $5. Its numbers like these that have everyone scrambling to get in. Arbitrum: The Layer-2 Powerhouse Arbitrum isn’t some fly-by-night altcoin. This Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum has been around the block, proving its worth as one of the best coins to buy now for anyone serious about decentralised finance (DeFi). Built to tackle Ethereum’s infamous gas fees and slow transaction times, Arbitrum has become a favourite for developers and users alike. In 2024, Arbitrum has cemented its position as a DeFi leader, hosting projects from lending protocols to decentralised exchanges. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second while slashing costs has made it indispensable. For instance, a user might pay $50 in gas fees on Ethereum—but with Arbitrum, it’s just pennies. It’s no wonder the ecosystem has seen billions locked in its protocols. Arbitrum’s ARB token plays a central role here, and it’s been steadily climbing the ranks. Known for its consistent performance, ARB has become a go-to investment for those seeking stability in the volatile crypto space. And let’s not forget the potential for staking and governance rewards. Whether you’re a retail investor or a whale, ARB’s utility and growth trajectory make it a no-brainer. What’s cool about Arbitrum is its adaptability. Picture this: you’re running a DeFi project and need a solution that scales with demand without breaking the bank. Arbitrum’s got your back. Or maybe you’re just a casual user sick of Ethereum’s fees. Either way, it delivers. With Ethereum 2.0 still ironing out kinks, Arbitrum fills a critical gap. It’s not just a stopgap solution; it’s setting the standard for what Layer-2 should look like. And that’s why it’s consistently among the best coins to buy now, with analysts expecting more growth as DeFi adoption expands. EOS: The OG of Scalable Blockchain EOS might not be the shiny new toy in the crypto world, but don’t sleep on it. Launched in 2018, EOS was one of the first blockchains to seriously tackle scalability. It promised high throughput and low fees, making it a pioneer in the race to dethrone Ethereum. While newer competitors have emerged, EOS remains a solid pick for those looking for the best coins to buy now. The EOS network is known for its Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which enables fast, cheap transactions. This makes it ideal for developers building dApps that need speed and efficiency. From gaming to supply chain solutions, EOS has been a backbone for countless projects. EOS’s journey hasn’t been without hiccups. Early controversies around centralisation and governance led to a dip in its popularity. But 2024 has been a comeback year, with renewed developer interest and a push to re-establish itself as a leader in the blockchain space. The EOS token has regained traction, and its affordability makes it an attractive entry point for new investors. Think about it: if you’re a business launching a global app, you want a blockchain that won’t crash under pressure. That’s where EOS shines. Its scalability and efficiency have kept it relevant, even as the market evolves. And for long-term holders, the token’s history of resilience offers a sense of security rarely found in crypto. EOS isn’t just a relic of crypto’s past; it’s a workhorse built to last. And with upcoming upgrades and partnerships, it’s positioned to keep serving those who value performance and reliability. That’s why it’s still on the radar for anyone scouting the best coins to buy now. Conclusion Qubetics, Arbitrum, and EOS each bring something unique to the table, making them standout picks among the best coins to buy now . Whether it’s Qubetics’ groundbreaking Multi-Chain Wallet, Arbitrum’s role as a DeFi cornerstone, or EOS’s enduring scalability, these projects cater to different needs and investment goals. For those looking to get in early, Qubetics offers unmatched growth potential with its presale momentum and jaw-dropping price predictions. Arbitrum provides stability and utility in a rapidly growing DeFi space, while EOS delivers reliability and performance for dApp developers. So, what’s your next move? Don’t let these opportunities pass you by. Dive into the research, pick your favourite, and get in on the action before the next big surge.

Amid this mild bearish market sentiment, traders and investors appear hesitant to participate in the altcoin, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Analyzing recent on-chain metrics alongside technical analysis suggests a fine outlook for Cardano (ADA) . While long-term holders show optimism, as evidenced by significant outflows from exchanges, technical patterns indicate potential short-term bearish trends. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, ADA appears bearish as it has successfully broken down from a head-and-shoulders price action pattern and recently retested that level. This retest of the breakdown level has partially confirmed that ADA is poised for a price decline. Source: Trading View Based on the technical analysis, there is a strong possibility that the altcoin could drop by 15% to reach the next support level at the $0.80 mark. If this sentiment remains unchanged, it will be easy for ADA to achieve the predicted target. Optimistic On-Chain Metrics Despite the bearish technical analysis, long-term holders seem optimistic about ADA, as reported by Coinglass . According to data from ADA spot inflow/outflow, exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $200 million worth of ADA in the past week. However, there has not been a single inflow during this period, despite a notable price decline. This trend represents the movement of assets from long-term holders’ wallets away from exchanges. It suggests that investors are bullish and accumulating tokens amid the price crash, indicating potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.89, having experienced a price decline of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has dropped by 45%, indicating reduced participation from traders and investors amid the ongoing price decline.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-22 04:21:42

This flash dump, occurring over just three days, has left many investors and analysts questioning whether this marks the end of the current bull market or signals a healthy correction within an ongoing bullish trend. Temporary Setback Or Trend Reversal? The price action has been particularly notable this week, with Bitcoin breaking through the $100,000 support level, which had held strong for eight consecutive days. Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this decline. One significant influence is the market makers’ strategy, which involved driving the price upward to encourage traders to open long positions at around $98,000, thereby increasing liquidity. Related Reading: Is This The Bottom? Experts Weigh In On Bitcoin 13% Dip And Potential Recovery After exhausting this liquidity, market makers strategically used Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech as a catalyst to drive a downward price movement, effectively filling the price inefficiencies at $93,744 (50%) and $90,513 (100%). Analysts explained, “The Bitcoin drop was necessary as there were inefficiencies below the price that needed to be filled, which are $93,744 for 50% and $90,513 for 100%. The inefficiency rule states that traders must fill either 50% or 100% of the inefficiency.” They added that market makers “purposely took the price upward to induce traders to open long positions, thereby increasing the liquidity at $98,000. Exhausted market makers decided to wipe out the liquidity at $98,800 and used Powell’s speech as a catalyst to fuel the downward movement.” Experts now predict a bounce to $101,000 before either a pullback or a continuation of the trend, as the $93,788-$92,200 range currently acts as robust support. This zone has seen significant buy orders, aligning with the 50% inefficiency recently filled. A bounce from this level appears inevitable. BlackRock And Institutional Moves Signal Confidence In Bitcoin Amid the volatility, BlackRock, one of the world’s leading asset management firms, has made headlines for its substantial investments in Bitcoin. According to insights from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock has not only net bought Bitcoin while other ETFs were selling but has also amassed a considerable amount, now holding 122.6K BTC. This makes BlackRock the 11th largest holder of Bitcoin, controlling roughly 0.6% of the circulating supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Here’s Where The Nearest On-Chain Support Is Their aggressive accumulation, including a recent $1.5 billion purchase, contrasts sharply with the broader market’s net selling of $785 million in BTC this week. BlackRock’s actions have sparked discussions on platforms like X, with many applauding or humorously noting their transition from traditional assets to digital currencies. Additionally, BlackRock’s involvement in the crypto market was underscored by their BUIDL Fund receiving $100 million USDC, signaling a strategic pivot towards digital assets. Such a heavyweight in finance could interpret this move as a vote of confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies, potentially influencing market sentiment and dynamics. Market Sentiment: Fear Or Opportunity? The market’s current sentiment, as measured by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in the ‘greed’ zone at 62, indicating minimal fear among investors. Instead, the dip below $100,000 is viewed by many as a buying opportunity, with expectations of an imminent recovery. Analysts predict a bounce back to around $101,000 before any significant pullback or continuation of the current trend, supported by robust buying at the $93,788-$92,200 range, which aligns with the recently filled 50% inefficiency level.

In my professional opinion, supported by the consensus among researchers and industry experts, Solana (SOL) demonstrates significant potential for exceptional growth in the coming years. Here are the key reasons behind this assessment. Memecoin mania – Catalyst for Solana’s market cap dominance In my professional opinion, Solana’s trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Its growth has not only matched Bitcoin ‘s impressive 140% surge this year but has consistently outperformed many of its peers. What’s truly exciting is that this could be just the beginning of Solana’s rise . The crypto community is buzzing about Solana’s potential, and for good reason. Its technological superiority is undeniable, with transaction speeds that dwarf those of Ethereum . This blazing performance is attracting developers and users alike, positioning Solana as the premier platform for DApps (decentralized applications) and DeFi (decentralized finance) projects. Many industry analysts, researchers and developers are particularly bullish on Solana’s prospects. As of November 2024, Solana has already reached around $250, with a market cap of over $100 billion. Some of them predict that Solana will break through resistance levels and potentially reach $400 to $750 in the near future. From my perspective, a memecoin mania has been a significant driver of Solana’s growth, catapulting it to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surpassing BNB . The Solana ecosystem now hosts over 1,000 memecoins with a combined market cap of over $20 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $6.8 billion. However, this is likely just the beginning of Solana’s trajectory. As we look toward 2025, the network is poised for even greater adoption as ‘serious’ projects begin to recognize and leverage Solana’s technological advantages. Furthermore, Solana’s growing dominance in the DeFi sector is evident in its rapidly increasing TVL (total value locked). In fact, some DEXs (decentralized exchanges) on Solana are now seeing higher trading activity than their Ethereum counterparts. This shift in the DeFi landscape could be the catalyst that propels Solana to new heights. Solving trillion-dollar inefficiencies in financial markets Chainlink (LINK) is another altcoin that I believe has immense potential. As an oracle network, Chainlink plays a critical role in connecting blockchain smart contracts to real-world data. But what really excites me about Chainlink is its strategic pivot toward asset tokenization . This move aligns perfectly with the growing trend of bringing traditional financial assets to the blockchain. The potential market for tokenized assets is staggering, with some estimates suggesting it could be worth trillions by 2030. By partnering with major financial institutions to facilitate this transition, Chainlink could position itself at the forefront of a financial revolution. LINK is no longer just a crypto project – it is positioning itself as the backbone of a decentralized financial market infrastructure, solving trillion-dollar inefficiencies. Limited supply meets unlimited AI potential Finally, I hold the view that Bittensor (TAO) represents an intriguing intersection of two of the hottest trends in tech – cryptocurrency and AI (artificial intelligence). With a limited supply of 21 million coins, mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity model, Bittensor has built-in deflationary pressure. As the demand for AI solutions continues to grow, Bittensor’s role in enabling decentralized AI networks could drive significant value appreciation. However, it’s important to note that the AI crypto space is still in its infancy and highly volatile. While Bittensor shows promise, investors should be prepared for rapid shifts in market sentiment. In conclusion, looking at the broader market, recent market forecasts predict that by 2025 we could see spot ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) with more than $10 billion in assets and the tokenization of more than $1 trillion in RWAs (real-world assets). These trends bode well for the altcoins I’ve highlighted – particularly Solana and Chainlink. In my assessment, while Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the crypto market , these altcoins offer unique value propositions that could drive outperformance in 2025. Solana’s speed and growing DeFi ecosystem, Chainlink’s pivotal role in asset tokenization and Bittensor’s position at the intersection of crypto and AI make them compelling options for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolios.

While traditional markets struggle with uncertainty, meme coins showcase their resilience and vibrant appeal. There’s no shortage of options, from established leaders like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to promising newcomers like Pepe Coin and Bonk. But BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the spotlight, which is turning heads by rolling back to its Stage 7 presale price—an extraordinary opportunity for savvy investors seeking substantial returns. For those looking to explore the best new meme coins to join in December 2024 , here’s a closer look at five exceptional options that combine creativity, utility, and hype for long-term potential. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Game-Changing Opportunity BTFD Coin is redefining the meme coin landscape with its innovative presale strategy. Currently, in Stage 12, it has reintroduced its Stage 7 price of $0.000064, giving investors a rare chance to buy in at a significant discount using the code BIG50 . With over 6,100 holders snapping up more than 57 billion coins and raising over $4.2 million, BTFD Coin is proving to be a hot ticket. BTFD’s appeal lies in its engaging ecosystem, which includes a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game whose beta version launched during Stage 10. While rewards are not yet live, this feature hints at an exciting future. Its staking mechanism is equally impressive, offering investors up to 90% APY, making it an attractive option for passive income seekers. The project further encourages engagement through its exclusive Bulls Squad community and a robust referral program, which spreads awareness while rewarding users. The coin seamlessly integrates into everyday financial activities, combining gamification with financial utility. With its presale performance, innovative ecosystem, and discounted pricing, BTFD Coin is an unmissable opportunity for those seeking top meme coins to buy and hold for the long term. 2.

Bonk (BONK): The Solana-Based Meme Star Bonk has emerged as a standout meme coin on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the network’s high-speed transactions and low fees to carve out a unique position. Its launch was met with immediate attention, thanks to massive airdrops, and its seamless integration into the Solana ecosystem has given it a technological edge. Being built on Solana enables Bonk to deliver practical utility alongside its meme appeal, making it a strong contender for long-term investment.

This bullish outlook could see Litecoin’s price surge past its $127 resistance zone and retrace a price above $150. The bullish setup building up around Litecoin’s price coincides with increased accumulation from LTC miners that has recently pushed Litecoin’s price to gain 35%. HBAR ETFs are also in the pipeline, according to predictions from market watchers, and Hadera’s ecosystem is only growing. Adding to the list of crypto projects on track for massive gains in 2025 is Lunex’s LNEX token, which has seen its price surge over 283%, rising from a presale entry price of $0.0012 to $0.0046. Its ongoing presale has already raised over $5.3 million. Find out more. Lunex Network Facilitates Deep Liquidity Revolutionising DEFI Lunex is reinventing the entire DeFi sector with a protocol that removes the complexities and security risks that fund losses for DEX traders. Lunex Network is a hybrid DEX and aggregator created with both on-chain and off-chain elements in a move to deliver the world’s first deep liquidity DEX. The latest projections forecast a DeFi market growth of $231 billion by 2030, and LNEX is on track to lead the charge thanks to its multi-chain compatibility, which offers users access to more than 50,000 currency pairs. You don’t need to connect your wallet address to get started; a simple receiving address from your non-custodial wallet is sufficient. With each trade on Lunex, its aggregator works in the background to deliver the most liquid pair at affordable network fees. This enables speedy transaction finality. With only 50% of LNEX tokens up for grabs, now is the ideal time to jump into the presale, given that analysts anticipate an uptick on launch. Litecoin’s Price Rebounds At The $100 Mark Amid A Market-wide Dip After surging to $137, Litecoin’s price consolidated around the $120 region and is now seeking support at the $100 price mark following the market-wide sell-off after the unexpectedly slow interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Even so, Litecoin’s price maintains its bullish appeal, with on-chain data revealing an increased rate of accumulation from LTC miners. Also, Litecoin’s ETF prospects are gaining momentum, with speculators anticipating a bullish resurgence in Litecoin’s price past its previous ATH. Speculation Concerning HBAR ETFs Rises as HBAR’s Price Rebounds at $0.26 After surging over 100% to prices as high as $0.39, HBAR is now rebounding with established support in the $0.26 region. Some fundamentals supporting HBAR’s price ascent include Hadera’s Consensus Service in creating an immutable ledger of AI computing, as seen by NVIDIA and Intel’s unveiling of “Verifiable Compute.” Further adding to this bullish sentiment, analysts on Wall Street are predicting an HBAR ETF approval alongside Litecoin’s ETFs thanks to the alignment of both projects with regulatory perspectives. Conclusion When all’s said and done, the likely approval of Litecoin and HBAR ETFs is a bullish signal that could see the two altcoins surge to new heights. Fortunately, LNEX token holders no longer have to wait for massive gains, as seen by LNEX’s recent uptick. Can LNEX’s gains surpass LTC and HBAR?

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 05:19:00

By 2027, NEAR is expected to rise to $16.90, driven by mainstream adoption. Looking ahead to 2030, NEAR Protocol could witness a significant surge, with its price potentially reaching $27 or beyond. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is one of cautious optimism, with stakeholders closely monitoring its progress and evolution. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price fell by over 1.2% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol sought support and resistance at $5.00 and $5.50, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for today, December 22, shows that the price has fallen below the $5.00 mark as bears dominate the markets. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR falls below $5.00 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicated an upward trend in the market as prices moved toward the $6.50 level. The bulls were unable to climb past $8.00 or establish a secure foothold above $5.00 and the price has come crashing down in the last ten days. NEAR price falls to $5.00 The Indicators reflect the increasing bearish price sentiment as all three major technical indicators signal rising bearish price sentiments. The MACD is bearish at -0.288 units and suggests strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the EMAs are below the mean position, and the indicator shows a steady bearish momentum. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 32.41 from above the 70.00 index level. The diverging Bollinger Bands suggest increasing volatility, indicating that the $5.00 support may not hold for the week. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows a sudden spike in NEAR price as the asset broke past $6.0. The price movement was followed by a short return to $5.70 before crossing back above the $6.00 mark as the bulls sought to go past the $7.50 resistance. However, the bulls failed to secure a foothold above $5.00 and the price has come crashing down in the last ten days. NEAR price breaks down below the $5.00 support The RSI is at 36.28, suggesting that the asset is at the bottom of the neutral zone, which indicates that the bears have less room for more upward movement in the short term. However, the downward slope suggests increasing selling pressure on the asset, suggesting further gains. The MACD is bullish , with the MACD line at 0.015 showing slight bullish dominance across the 4-hour charts, which has been decreasing in recent candles. These indicators collectively issue a steady bullish trend that suggests a consolidation below $5.50.

The strong trade volume suggests increasing activity, indicating a robust force behind the recent fall. As such, the price rose rapidly to the $5.50 mark before stumbling below the $50 mark again. Traders should expect NEAR to continue its bearsih rally as the bears chase the $4.00 mark. Currently, the closest support level is $5.00 and below at $4.50, while NEAR Protocol faces difficulty establishing a foothold above the $5.00 level. Is Near Protocol a good investment? NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR down? NEAR price rose rapidly to the $8.00 mark, however, the bulls failed to secure a foothold above $5.00 and the price has come crashing down in the last ten days. Will NEAR reach $10? NEAR is experiencing a volatile market movement that may see it reach the $10 mark before the year closes. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2027 as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next decade. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability, and strong ecosystem development. However, the project needs to keep up with sector developments to maintain its edge in the digital ecosystem.

In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year.

Amid this, veteran trader Peter Brandt has reiterated his bullish outlook on the flagship crypto, indicating that the crypto could continue its rally ahead. In addition, other on-chain metrics also indicate a positive momentum for BTC ahead. Peter Brandt Predicts Bitcoin Price Rally Ahead The Bitcoin price, alongside the top altcoins, has witnessed a strong rally over the past few days, sparking market confidence. However, the flagship crypto has recently witnessed a sharp decline amid a broader crypto market crash this week. Despite that, BTC has recovered from its weekly lows on Saturday, indicating investors are reentering the market. Amid this, veteran trader and top market expert Peter Brandt maintained a bullish outlook for BTC. In a recent analysis, Brandt said that the crypto is likely to hit $108,358 in the coming days, sparking optimism. However, he also warned over a potential decline to $76,614 citing the technical charts. Source: Peter Brandt, X Besides, he also said that “this is not a prediction”, indicating the risks associated with the market. He said that these analyses only reflect the “possibilities, not probabilities, not certainties.” Besides, he has recently set a BTC price target of $125K , which has also gained notable market attention. However, the market optimism is soaring towards the crypto market after Donald Trump’s election win in November. Now, as Trump’s inauguration on January 20 is approaching, the market sentiment is further bolstered by anticipation over the pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US. What’s Next For BTC? The discussions over the US BTC Strategic Reserve have fueled market sentiment recently. On the other hand, the recent robust inflow into US Spot Bitcoin ETF has also signaled a growing institutional interest in the crypto. However, the recent outflux this week into BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF and others has fueled concerns. Despite that, the on-chain metrics indicate positive momentum ahead. For context, top analytics platform CryptoQuant said that “Bitcoin demand is surging.” CryptoQuant said that “OTC desks” are witnessing their largest monthly inventory decline this year, down 26K BTC. Considering that, the tightening market supply also indicates a bullish momentum ahead. Source: CryptoQuant, X In addition, other market experts have also remained optimistic about the future trajectory of BTC. For context, Matrixport has cited key reasons recently that have sparked a rally in Bitcoin price and top altcoins like Solana, XRP, and DOGE. Besides, it also set a BTC price target of $160K for the crypto, boosting investors’ confidence.

Many whales are talking about Cardano’s potential rally to $6, but they are most excited about crypto casino Rollblock’s 1000% potential. This top altcoin has created a next-generation online gambling experience and is looking at explosive growth when its crypto presale ends. Rollblock Tops Whale Interest With Enormous Revenue Potential Rollblock is a revolutionary next-generation GambleFi protocol set to disrupt the $500 billion casino industry. The global gambling industry is ripe for a blockchain technology revolution, with a rapidly increasing share of this revenue moving online each day. Legacy online gambling sites are still slow, dull and riddled with red tape and hidden fees. Rollblock’s casino of more than 7,000 games and sports betting is changing this. Rollblock’s platform operates on the blockchain, which means fast, seamless and transparent access from anywhere in the world through over 20 different crypto tokens. Rollblock has also enhanced the player experience through the latest in UX design and a community-focused approach. This community focus includes a generous suite of rewards programs and fresh events each month. However, its most important element is its game-changing profit-sharing system. Rollblock’s system works through buybacks that employ a portion of the casino’s weekly revenue. These buybacks share profit back with the community through either burn events that increase RBLK’s value or through staking rewards that are competitive with current industry standards. $RBLK tokens are currently selling out fast during stage nine of its presale, with tokens valued at $0.043. With early investors already seeing returns of over 300% experts are making extremely bullish predictions of over 800% returns going into 2025. Cardano Midnight Upgrade Sets Course for $6 by 2026 Cardano is also seeing massive whale interest thanks to its imminent Midnight upgrade. The Midnight upgrade will see Cardano build a sidechain dedicated to processing transactions that limit public information. This will make Cardano the ideal platform for DeFi applications that need to confirm transactions while hiding the details involved. The Cardano price is expected to increase to over $6 by 2026 on this rapid DeFi expansion. This would be an over 500% increase from the current price and more than double its all-time high from 2021. Dogecoin to Be Meme Coin of 2025 Thanks to Trump Presidency The Dogecoin price is expected to continue its association with Elon Musk and the Donald Trump presidency in 2025. This association could send the Dogecoin price as much as 1000% higher as Trump and Musk dominate the headlines for the year. Dogecoin has been the top meme coin destination for crypto enthusiasts looking to celebrate Trump’s win and Musk’s creation of the Department of Government Efficiency. This association already took Dogecoin 500% higher in November with Dogecoin currently trading at $0.2892. Rollblock Top Altcoin for Crypto Whale Portfolios in 2025 While Dogecoin and Cardano look promising for 2025, Rollblock is the undisputed top altcoin for crypto whales. With experts predicting a huge 100x rally out of its crypto presale, Rollblock is being added to whale portfolios now before it is too late.

Their price movements are driven more by sentiment and social media hype than utility or fundamentals, causing memes like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin to plummet harder than most assets when enthusiasm wanes. Gaming coins have the added benefit of harnessing utility alongside massive hype potential. Within this sector, Rollblock is poised to be the next trailblazer during its tentative presale. Here’s why investors are bullish. Rollblock Is Poised To Become The Next Gaming Trailblazer Rollblock is transforming the GameFi landscape with its advanced ERC-20 platform, offering robust security, engaging rewards, and significant growth potential. Analysts anticipate that Rollblock could experience notable expansion during the peak of the bull run, with possible gains during the projected market recovery and altcoin season in Q1-Q2 2025. A key factor in these optimistic projections is Rollblock’s extensive game library, featuring over 7,000 titles ranging from casino classics like poker and blackjack to exclusive blockchain-only games. The platform plans to launch at least a dozen additional games in Q1, along with its recently added sports betting feature, continually enhancing its versatility. Central to Rollblock’s ecosystem is the RBLK token, powering its play-to-earn model and revenue-sharing program. This program uses Rollblock’s revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market. These tokens are then burned to make RBLK deflationary, with 40% of repurchased tokens being used for staking rewards. A Meme Is A Meme: Dogecoin Not Immune To Market Crash Dogecoin has faced significant pressure amid the shock crypto market crash, with its price plummeting by 27% as Bitcoin dropped to $93,000. The broader market downturn, fueled by the hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve’s recent FOMC meeting, has fostered an unequivocally bearish environment for coins like Dogecoin. In the long term, Dogecoin is expected to bounce back as its cultural significance and backing by high-profile figures like Elon Musk solidify Dogecoin’s status as the top meme coin. Musk’s ongoing interest and hints about integrating Dogecoin into the X platform continue to generate optimism about its utility and adoption, and as market conditions stabilize and liquidity increases from anticipated fiscal and monetary stimulus globally, Dogecoin could regain significant ground as cryptocurrencies biggest meme coin by some distance. Shiba Inu’s Positive Q4 Bounceback Thwarted By Sudden Market Capitulation After reaching $0.000033 and rekindling investor interest early in Q4, Shiba Inu has declined by over 20% this past week. Bitcoin’s correction below $95,000 has created headwinds for speculative assets like Shiba Inu, decimating the promising momentum Shiba Inu built earlier in the quarter in anticipation of the bull run. Many Shiba Inu investors nevertheless remain optimistic. More than 60% of Shiba Inu holders are still in profit, and Shiba Inu is likely to continue dominating the meme coin landscape as the second largest meme, supported by a loyal community and massive hype. Get Into Rollblock Before The Gaming Rally Of 2025 Given that the recent market crash mirrors 2020’s down to its timing and scope preceding a major altcoin season in the following months in 2021, it’s clear that this shakeout is likely temporary. When investors are fearful, that is the time to accumulate. Currently priced at $0.043 in its ninth presale phase and recently licensed by GamingArjouan, RBLK offers an opportunity to purchase a potential 100x gem early in its lifespan.

This rise is part of a broader trend marked by substantial price fluctuations in the past seven days, which saw Bitcoin breaking below close support levels. Particularly, Bitcoin’s price movement in the past few days has been filled with declines below the $100,000 price level and liquidations across the entire crypto industry. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Surge Above $225,000 By June 2025 Among the many voices weighing in on Bitcoin’s future trajectory is Adrian Zduńczyk, a renowned cryptocurrency analyst better known as CRYPTO₿IRB. While sharing his insights on X, the analyst noted that Bitcoin’s current bull run is already 80% complete, with the remaining 20% expected to be the most exhilarating phase. According to Zduńczyk, this phase will push the Bitcoin price to unprecedented heights in the first half of 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price And Its Weekly Golden Cross: Why The Crash To $0.31 Remains Natural Speaking of the bull run being 80% complete, the current market cycle arguably began in October 2023, when applications of Spot Bitcoin ETFs triggered euphoria among crypto investors. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $26,000, but the ensuing rally saw it breaking above multiple price resistance levels in quick succession. This, in turn, led to a break above its then all-time high to cross above $70,000 in March 2024, and then the latest break above the $100,000 psychological threshold in December 2024. As CRYPTO₿IRB predicted, the current bull run has played out to about 80% of its trajectory, with only 20% left to play out. Calculations show that Bitcoin has already increased by about 315% since the bull run started about a year ago. However, the analyst’s projection suggests that the leading cryptocurrency is about to make another 110% increase from its current all-time high in the next six months. Particularly, Zduńczyk has projected that Bitcoin will peak at an astonishing price of over $225,000 by June 2025. Altseason To Follow Bitcoin’s Peak, Bear Market Lurks Beyond 2025 Zduńczyk anticipates that a major altseason, which is characterized by explosive gains across the altcoin market, will occur after Bitcoin reaches its projected peak. However, he cautioned investors to remain vigilant, warning that 2026 will likely usher in a bear market and potentially bring in losses between 80% and 90% from the highs of various cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: XRP Price Crash: Analyst Says Don’t Get Distracted As RSI Is Still Above A Bullish 50% His advice to the crypto community is clear: “Realize gains and run before 2025 ends.” The analyst also hinted at a significant development scheduled for December 27, which he cryptically referred to as a “big release,” though details remain undisclosed at this moment. Although CRYPTO₿IRB’s prediction is bullish, it pales in comparison to projections from other crypto analysts, with some putting Bitcoin’s peak above $1 million in the current market cycle.

XMR could reach a maximum price of $897.60 by the end of 2027. By 2030, Monero’s price may surge to $1,466.22 Monero (XMR) stands out in the cryptocurrency space for its strong focus on privacy and decentralization of transactions. This makes it a popular choice for privacy advocates and those prioritizing security. The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero continues to progress, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth? Can it sustain its competitive edge in the ever-evolving crypto market? Will XMR recapture its ATH at $517.62? Overview Cryptocurrency Monero Token XMR Price $207.51 Market Cap $3.82B Trading Volume 24-h $112.64M Circulating Supply 18.45M XMR All-time High $517.62 May 07, 2021 All-time Low $0.213, Jan 15, 2015 24-h High $220.39 24-h Low $201.02 Monero price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $169.36 200-Day SMA $162.73 Price Prediction $400.84 (110.97%) F & G Index 40.22 (fear) Green Days 16/30 (54%) 14-Day RSI 49.77 Monero price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Monero price fell to $190 as bearish pressure rose The XMR coin had risen by over 2.4% at the time of writing. Monero prices have sought support and resistance at $180 and $210, respectively. The Monero price analysis for December 22 shows high volatility as XMR rises to the $190.00 mark as bearish pressure dominates the market. The price fell to the $180 mark but the bulls have found some recovery. Monero price analysis 1-day chart: XMR rises to $190 as bulls push through The 24-hour XMR/USD price chart indicated a bullish trend in the market as prices moved toward $160.00. In recent days, the price fell to $180 but the bullish pressure increased to $192. Monero (XMR) price falls to $190 The Indicators reflect the bullish price sentiment, as all three major technical indicators show positive signs. The MACD is bearish at -3.18 units, showing strong bearish sentiment, while the EMAs are also above the mean position, and their gradient turns negative as the price rises. The RSI also shares this sentiment, falling to around the 50.46 index level from the 70.00 mark, showing room for further upward movement in the short term. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest lower volatility, indicating that the $210.00 resistance may hold for the week. Monero price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart shows Monero making a sudden breakdown as the price broke below $180 to $165 within a four hour period. However, the bulls were still able to form a recovery to the $190 level. Monero (XMR) price struggles below $ 200 The RSI is at 53.97, suggesting that the asset is near the center of the neutral region. The MACD, at 0.54, shows bullish momentum across the 4-hour charts, which has increased with recent candles. The sentiment is further supported by the EMAs, which show a rising slope. These indicators collectively indicate a bullish trend forming at the current price level.

Despite the flash crash a few days ago, the bulls quickly bought the dip to recover the asset’s price to the $180.00 mark. The bulls have crushed the short-term resistances held by the bears, and as the price enters the $210 level, the $200 provides a secure foothold for short-term movements. As such, traders can expect the price to halt its bullish rally as the buying pressure decreases. As such, the price can be expected to rise from around the $190 price level to test the $210 resistance across the next few days. However, the bulls need to guard the $180 and the $185 key support level to prevent a fall to the $150 level. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio. Why is XMR down? After failing to secure support past the $200 mark XMR price fell to $180 but the bullish support allowed it to recover to $192. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. Will XMR reach $250? Monero is experiencing a strong bullish rally that may reach the $250 mark before the year closes.’s Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors. Adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals make it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes. Recent news/opinion on Monero Justin Ehrenhofer, granting an interview to Coindesk, says: “One thing that keeps coming up is that privacy is always a battle – you always have people that are getting better and better about tracing… So privacy needs to keep getting better and better. The tools need to keep getting better and better. You can’t just stand still because if you stand still you become obsolete.” Start9Labs announced the integration of BTCPayServer to allow Monero transactions for e-commerce stores.

Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero. Monero price history; Source: Coinmarketcap Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00 making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset as the price declined below the $160 mark by the month’s end. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December Monero has made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $200 mark albeit briefly. However, it remains to be seen whether the month will continue in this direction for the crypto.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-22 06:27:00

Tron’s token burn is creating scarcity and raising interest. But can the Rollblock crypto presale beat them? With its unique casino-linked rewards and earning options, Rollblock could be the surprise winner as the crypto market gains momentum. Rollblock crypto presale: Bridging gaming and crypto to outshine Tron and Avalanche In the online gambling market, the number of users is expected to hit 281.3 million by 2029, according to Statista. This booming market opens huge opportunities, and Rollblock is stepping in to shake things up. Rollblock is a GambleFi protocol that bridges decentralized and traditional gaming, giving users the best of both worlds. It stands out as one of the first community-backed crypto casinos, where holding the $RBLK token lets users earn a share of casino revenues. The Rollblock crypto presale, now trading at $0.043, has already raised over $7.4 million, proving the strong demand for its unique model. Unlike other cryptos, Rollblock ensures economic stability by using part of the casino’s profits to buy back RBLK tokens. This reduces supply and helps boost the token’s value, protecting investors even during market dips. With a growing online gambling market and Rollblock’s community-focused approach, it could easily outshine established cryptos like Tron and Avalanche . The Rollblock crypto presale is your chance to join a project this altcoin season that’s set to disrupt the casino and gaming world. Avalanche9000 upgrade: The altcoin game-changer simplifying blockchain development The Avalanche 9000 upgrade brings big changes, making it cheaper and easier to create and run blockchains on the Avalanche network. With the new Etna upgrade, costs to launch Layer 1 blockchains have dropped by 99.9%, and transaction fees on the C-Chain are now 96% lower. This opens the door for developers to build custom blockchains with features like flexible staking and token setups. A key highlight is the new Interchain Messaging feature. It allows blockchains on Avalanche to easily share tokens, NFTs, and other data with each other. These updates make Avalanche a strong choice for developers and position it as a top choice this altcoin season with practical uses and long-term potential. Justin Sun’s bold burn: will scarcity ignite Tron’s future? Justin Sun, the founder of Tron , announced a bold plan to burn 100% of the revenue from SUN tokens. This burn strategy aims to reduce the overall token supply, making the tokens scarcer and potentially more valuable. By committing to transparency and addressing technical concerns, Sun seeks to boost investor confidence and solidify the Tron ecosystem as a competitive player in the crypto space. This burn initially sparked excitement, leading to a price spike of Tron’s TRX token, reaching $0.45. However, the market cooled this altcoin season , and the price gradually dropped to $0.25 by the end of the month, highlighting ongoing volatility despite the burn’s long-term potential. Rollblock is flipping the script on GambleFi – are you ready to play? The crypto space is always busy with innovation— Avalanche is slashing fees, Tron is burning tokens, but Rollblock? It’s rewriting the rules of GambleFi! If you’re eyeing something beyond the ordinary, Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing model could be your golden ticket. So, why just watch?

Despite a 24% decline over the past week, Dogecoin remains up by 246% year-to-date, trading at $0.3078. Given its strong performance in 2024, analysts are optimistic about its future potential. Discussions have emerged around the token achieving key price milestones, including $10, $20, $50, and even $100. To provide insights, both Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT were consulted for their predictions on when the asset might achieve these price points. Their responses highlight both the opportunities and challenges facing the meme-inspired cryptocurrency. Timelines According to Grok According to Grok, Dogecoin could reach $10 as early as 2029 or as late as January 2040. This estimate aligns with projections from sources like Changelly and CoinCodex. Achieving this milestone would require a market capitalization of approximately $1.41 trillion. Grok also suggests that Dogecoin might hit $20 between 2040 and 2045. However, this projection is more speculative due to the significant increase in market capitalization required, approximately $2.82 trillion. While Grok does not provide a clear timeline for $50, it acknowledges that reaching $100 would require a market cap exceeding $14.73 trillion. Grok views this goal as unlikely under current market conditions. Optimistic scenarios place the possibility for $100 beyond 2040, though such a valuation is widely considered unrealistic without transformative changes in the global financial landscape. Timelines According to ChatGPT ChatGPT offered a more detailed breakdown of the conditions under which Dogecoin could achieve these price points, focusing on factors such as market growth and adoption. ChatGPT estimates that the asset could reach $10 between 2028 and 2032, provided it captures 10% of an anticipated $15 trillion cryptocurrency market. This level of adoption would require strategic partnerships, increased use cases, and broader acceptance of blockchain technology. For the asset to reach $20, ChatGPT forecasts a timeline of 2030 to 2035. Achieving this price would necessitate a market cap of $2.82 trillion, assuming the total crypto market expands to $30 trillion and Dogecoin maintains a 10% share. The AI further predicts that Dogecoin could hit $50 between 2035 and 2040, contingent upon the global cryptocurrency market reaching $70 trillion. This valuation would require the token to sustain substantial dominance in the market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to ChatGPT, the $100 target is the most speculative. For this to occur, the token’s market cap would need to exceed $14.08 trillion, which is only feasible if the total crypto market surpasses $100 trillion. ChatGPT views this scenario as highly improbable without significant shifts in global financial systems. Challenges to Reaching These Price Points While the projections from Grok and ChatGPT suggest potential paths for the asset to achieve these milestones, the challenges are significant. Each target requires substantial growth in market capitalization, broader adoption of blockchain technology, and increased use cases specific to the asset. The $100 milestone, in particular, would demand unprecedented market conditions, including the cryptocurrency market becoming a dominant force in global finance. These projections underscore the speculative nature of such price targets, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting long-term forecasts. The digital asset’s potential to reach higher price levels depends on various factors, including market dynamics, technological advancements, and strategic adoption. While the possibility of the token hitting $10 or $20 appears within reach over the next two decades, targets like $50 and $100 remain highly uncertain.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 06:42:00

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price declined by 13.66%, moving within a range of $3,648.43 to $4,137.17. Over the last month, however, it saw a gain of 7.75%, indicating some positive momentum amid the volatility. Looking at the six-month timeframe, Ethereum’s price decreased by 4.14%, reflecting a mixture of short-term gains and longer-term challenges. Technical indicators provide insight into Ethereum’s current state. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 31.82, which is near the oversold threshold. This suggests that the asset may be undervalued at present levels. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $3,403.46, below the 100-day average of $3,807.62, showing a dip in short-term pricing compared to the longer-term trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is at -85.71, indicating bearish momentum, while the stochastic value of 13.16 is low, often associated with oversold conditions. Considering support and resistance levels, if Ethereum’s price moves upward, it may encounter resistance at $4,317.86, which is about 18% above the current lower price range. Surpassing this, the next resistance level is $4,806.60, approximately 32% higher. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $3,340.38, about 9% below the current price. If the price falls further, the second support level is $2,851.64, representing a potential decline of roughly 22%. These levels are key areas that may influence Ethereum’s price action in the near future. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced significant volatility lately. In the past week, its price dipped by 23.46%. Over the last month, it decreased by 13.15%. However, looking at the past six months, SHIB saw a rise of 19.81%. This mix of short-term declines and longer-term gains highlights the coin’s unpredictable nature. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00002396 and $0.000032. The nearest resistance level is $0.00003614, and the closest support level is $0.00002006. If the price breaks above the resistance, it could target the second resistance at $0.00004418, representing a substantial percentage increase. On the downside, falling below the support might see the price testing the second support level at $0.00001202. Technical indicators offer more insights. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.00002187, below the 100-day average of $0.00002547. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.79, while the Stochastic is at 28.66, both suggesting that SHIB is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000006701, indicating bearish momentum. These factors might imply potential for a price reversal or further decline, making SHIB a coin to watch closely. Conclusion Despite ETH and SHIB’s strong gains, XYZVerse steals the spotlight with its unique sports-meme blend, aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

XRP’s price is at a crossroads and has lost the majority of the gains made in the last seven days. All of the top 10 coins are trading in red, with Solana and Dogecoin recording double-digit losses. Analysts are speculating that XRP might be in the midst of a larger correction, following a strong rally earlier this month. The price could be undergoing a consolidation phase, which may either be part of a larger corrective pattern or a more extended sideways movement. Potential Scenarios, Key Resistance and Support Levels Resistance Zone The immediate resistance for XRP is between $2.30 and $2.53. If the price reaches this range, it may face selling pressure and could potentially reverse to the downside. Traders should be cautious if the price approaches this area. Critical Support Level The key support level to watch is $1.96, where a previous low was formed earlier in December. If XRP drops below this level, it could trigger further selling, potentially pushing the price lower into a range between $1.39 and $1.80. Consolidation Phase XRP could be in the midst of a consolidation phase, where the price moves sideways within a defined range. This could be a correction after the recent rally. If XRP remains above the $1.96 level, it could eventually break higher, potentially testing the resistance zone between $2.30 and $2.53. Downside Risk If XRP breaks below the $1.96 support, it could enter a deeper correction. In this case, the price might move towards the lower support zone between $1.39 and $1.80.

On-chain analysis by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed that the bitcoin market is currently experiencing a demand shock because demand growth is accelerating and supply is shrinking. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , bitcoin apparent demand has been expanding since late September at a monthly rate of 228,000 BTC, while the total amount of BTC readily available for sale across crypto exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, miners, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has declined to levels not seen since October 2020. BTC Demand Is Eating Supply Inventory The balance of BTC accumulator addresses, which refer to investors who buy BTC and have never sold any, is expanding monthly at a record-high rate of 495,000 BTC. Bitcoin demand growth has led to inventory levels at OTC desks declining by the largest monthly volume in 2024 for the first time since April 25. Bitcoin OTC desks’ monthly inventory has fallen by -26,000 BTC this year, with an additional 40,000 BTC decline in tier balance since November 20. “OTC desks source Bitcoin mostly for institutions and large buyers. If Bitcoin demand is outpacing supply, then OTC desks’ Bitcoin balances will decline, and vice versa. Right now, their balances are declining as demand outpaces supply,” CryptoQuant stated. Sell-side Liquidity Falls to 2020 Levels As demand continues to rise, so does liquidity in the industry. The total market cap of USD-based stablecoins recently crossed $200 billion for the first time, representing a 20% or $35 billion increase since late October. This reflects an influx of liquidity and fresh money in the crypto market. The growth also coincided with BTC rallying above $100,000 to $108,000. The crypto asset was worth $96,700 at the time of writing, per data from CoinMarketCap. Furthermore, bitcoin sell-side liquidity now hovers around 3.397 million BTC, the lowest level in over four years. This liquidity has shrunk even further by 678,000 BTC so far this year, greatly reducing the potential for selling pressure. Moreover, the liquidity inventory ratio, a metric that measures how many months of demand the current sell-side inventory covers, has fallen to 6.6 months from 41 months recorded at the beginning of October. CryptoQuant explained that a declining sell-side inventory ratio coincided with the BTC rallies witnessed in the first and fourth quarters of 2024.

However, these claims require further scrutiny to separate fact from fiction. Origin of the Speculation The rumors originated from a December 19 post by the official X account of HOSKY , a meme coin project associated with Cardano. The post humorously declared that ADA had been chosen as Switzerland’s official cryptocurrency. Many community members responded with curiosity, asking whether the claim was legitimate. Further fueling the debate, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, shared the post with a tongue-in-cheek comment , adding to the lighthearted nature of the announcement. Despite this, some members of the community were left unsure of whether the claim was satire or a genuine development. Well, at least we get chocolates and nice watches https://t.co/NnSj836nhv pic.twitter.com/dxoOKzRY4L — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 20, 2024 Tensions Within the Cardano Ecosystem This playful post coincides with ongoing concerns among Cardano supporters regarding the governance and operations of the Cardano Foundation, the organization responsible for promoting the token’s adoption. The Foundation, established under Swiss law, has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and accountability to the community. One of the primary issues highlighted by critics, including Hoskinson, is the method by which the Foundation’s board members are selected. Under Swiss regulations governing foundations, board members are appointed without direct input from the community, as foundations in Switzerland are not designed to function as membership-based organizations. In a December 18 post, Hoskinson voiced dissatisfaction with the current governance structure. He criticized the Cardano Foundation for its limited community involvement in decision-making and suggested relocating the organization to jurisdictions with more flexible regulatory environments, such as Abu Dhabi or Wyoming. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of the Swiss Government The claim that ADA has been adopted as Switzerland’s national cryptocurrency appears to be tied to broader discussions about the Swiss government’s influence over the Cardano Foundation. While the Foundation operates under Swiss laws, there is no evidence to suggest that the Swiss government has officially endorsed or adopted ADA as a national cryptocurrency. The HOSKY post seems to be a satirical take on the community’s frustration with the Foundation’s governance model and its perceived alignment with Swiss regulatory frameworks. While the playful speculation brought attention to these issues, it also underscored the need for clear communication and transparency. As discussions about governance continue, it remains to be seen whether the Foundation will take steps to address these concerns or consider relocating to a more community-focused regulatory environment.

The Top 10 List Cryptocurrency analytics platform Santiment recently estimated that Internet Computer (ICP) ranked first in terms of “notable development activity” in the past month, collecting a score of 409.63. The asset started December on the right foot, with its price jumping to a multi-month high of over $15. However, the latest market correction negatively affected ICP, which plummeted below $10 (per CoinGecko’s data). ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Chainlink (LINK) claimed the second spot with a ratio of 287.07, while Hedera (HBAR) ranked third. It is interesting to note that the top 3 club looked exactly the same after the previous research. Starknet (STRK) climbed the ladder and was positioned in fourth place, while Cardano (ADA) lost some steam and is now fifth. Similar to ICP and many other cryptocurrencies, ADA was at the forefront of gains in the first week of the month. On December 7, its price touched $1.30 (a level last observed at the start of 2022). The peak was short-lived, though, with ADA currently trading at around $0.84. The other digital assets down the line include Optimism (OP), Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), DeFiChain (DFI), and sUSD (SUSD). Santiment’s Methodology To conduct the aforementioned research , the platform’s team employs the so-called Ecosystem Dev Activity Dashboard, which shows the number of development events created on various blockchains and their associated dApps. “These events are carefully filtered and predefined to be representative of real programming progress, meaning no low-value actions are taken into consideration . This way, any crypto-curious person can easily see which are the most active crypto ecosystems out there,” the working group explained. The team emphasized the importance of the size of a project’s community, particularly focusing on how many members are developers and actively contributing to the ecosystem. Finally, Santiment clarified that development activity differs from GitHub activity. The former focuses on specific types of events, excluding things like commits, forks, comments, and project management tasks. In contrast, GitHub is comprised of all kinds of factors apart from commits. “One key distinction between Dev Activity and GitHub Activity is that Dev Activity allows for a fairer comparison between different organizations. This is because some events excluded in Dev Activity are related to Issues and Issue Comments,” Santiment’s team concluded.

In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $2.68, resulting in a correction to $2.31. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO price down today? JTO’s price lost its momentum around $3.5, resulting in a minor correction. Sellers are currently defending a surge above the $4 mark. Will JTO’s price recover? If JTO’s price faces buying demand around the current price level, we might see a strong rebound and JTO might surge toward $4. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2024 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/opinion on JTO news Solana-based Jito is set for its biggest token to unlock on December 7, with 135.71 million JTO tokens valued at approximately $521 million. This release, equivalent to about 103% of the current circulating supply, will be allocated to core contributors and investors. Jito price prediction December 2024 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have been upward, aiming to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a move above $100K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $4.2 and a minimum of $2.8, with an average value of $3.1 throughout December. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction December 2024 $2.8 $3.1 $4.2 Jito price prediction 2024 The effects of Bitcoin Halving typically appear 12-18 months afterward, but 2024 might see a different trend due to heightened institutional interest and improved macroeconomic factors. During the JTO airdrop, the token was available on major exchanges except Kraken, leaving one significant listing announcement to excite traders. However, this impact is likely minor. Progress on the Jito protocol is a critical factor influencing the 2024 Jito price forecast. While there isn’t a clear roadmap, announcing future developments could boost interest in the token. Based on technical analysis and forecast data, the projected minimum price of Jito in 2024 is $4.86. The price could climb to a maximum of $5.53, with an expected average of around $5.05.

This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $7.14. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

Since more individuals are selling than buying right now, it is on a downward trajectory. Buyers are finding it difficult to maintain a consistent price; should this continue, DOGE can drop below $0.3. However, if interest picks up, it might bounce back to $0.45. For now, things aren’t looking great. Over the past month, Dogecoin’s price started around $0.50 and dropped to $0.294. It went up and down a few times but kept falling overall, with a big drop near the end of the month. Shiba Inu’s breakout: Can it gain momentum? Traders are getting mixed signals from Shiba Inu (SHIB). Slow trading limits its growth, and the transfer of many SHIB tokens to exchanges indicates a drop. Support between $0.000024 and $0.000025 looks promising, but breaking over $0.000030 requires higher buying pressure and market momentum. Over the month, Shiba Inu’s price went up and down a lot. It started higher, hit a peak of $0.00003225 in the middle of the month, then dropped sharply. By the end of the month, it was down to $0.00002016. This likely means many people sold their coins after the price went up, causing it to fall steadily. Rollblock keeps the bull market buzzing while others struggle to catch up As we ride the bull market wave, Rollblock stands out by offering secure transactions and rewarding opportunities. While DOGE price prediction projects gloom and SHIB’s breakout potential depends on market momentum, Rollblock’s seamless blockchain integration and passive income rewards keep things exciting.

37957015,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=666217,1734852645,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution Reveals Strong Demand At $97K – Can BTC Hold?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-cost-basis-distribution-reveals-strong-demand-at-97k-can-btc-hold/,"Bitcoin has had a whirlwind few days, hitting an all-time high (ATH) last Tuesday before tumbling into a sharp 15% correction. This period of heightened volatility has left investors divided, with some expecting a continued uptrend while others brace for more downside. The market is closely watching Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim its bullish momentum. Related Reading: XRP Whales Loading Up – Data Reveals Buying Activity Top analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted critical data from the Bitcoin cost basis distribution, pointing to $97K as a crucial support level. Martinez stresses that holding this level is essential for BTC to maintain its uptrend and fend off deeper corrections. However, Bitcoin’s price action remains uncertain as it struggles to break through the psychological barrier at $100K. While many investors see the recent correction as a healthy reset after BTC’s meteoric rise, the failure to push higher could signal a more prolonged consolidation phase. With Bitcoin trading near pivotal levels, the coming days will be critical in determining whether it will resume its climb to new highs or face additional headwinds. Bitcoin Holding Above Key Demand Bitcoin is holding steady above a critical demand level around $97,000, offering a beacon of hope for bulls after recent volatility. This stability follows a brief test of lower demand at $92,000, which reinforced the market’s ability to absorb selling pressure. While the short-term recovery is encouraging, the price remains at a pivotal point that could determine its trajectory heading into the new year. Martinez recently shared insights from the Bitcoin cost basis distribution, emphasizing the importance of the $99,000–$97,000 range. His data highlights this zone as the most significant support threshold for Bitcoin, acting as a critical line in the sand for the current uptrend. However, Martinez warns of the potential downside risk if Bitcoin fails to hold this range: “We really don’t want this level to become resistance.” As Bitcoin consolidates near these key levels, sentiment across the market remains indecisive. Bulls are eager to see BTC reclaim momentum and push toward all-time highs, but the psychological resistance around $100,000 continues to loom large. Meanwhile, bears argue that the recent pullback could be a sign of an impending larger correction.

With market participants looking for clarity, Bitcoin must hold this critical support zone or risk losing its bullish structure. Whether the next major move is up or down will depend heavily on how BTC reacts within this price range. BTC Testing Liquidity Bitcoin is trading at $97,000, showing resilience after rebounding from local lows of $92,000. This bounce highlights the market’s strong demand at lower levels, reinforcing the bullish narrative for now. The price structure remains intact above $97,000, indicating that BTC is well-positioned to stage another rally toward its ATH. However, the $100,000 psychological barrier looms large as the next major hurdle for bulls. This level has proven difficult to overcome, with previous attempts falling short. A successful breakout above $100,000 in the coming days would likely reignite bullish momentum and set the stage for Bitcoin to reach new ATHs, restoring confidence among investors and traders.

On the flip side, failure to breach this critical resistance could trigger a less favorable scenario. If Bitcoin struggles to gain traction above $100,000, market sentiment may waver, leading to increased selling pressure. In such a case, BTC could face another downturn, testing key support levels once again.

37958118,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52835,1734853882,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Explains Why Investors Should Hold At Least 1000 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/experts-explains-why-investors-should-hold-at-least-1000-xrp/,"Edo Farina, the CEO of Alpha Lions Academy, has made a strong case for why investors should consider holding at least 1,000 XRP. In a recent video , he detailed the potential long-term benefits of investing in digital assets, emphasizing its growing relevance in the evolving financial landscape. He argues that the token’s utility and adoption prospects position it as a pivotal player in the shift toward a modern financial system. He believes securing a meaningful amount of the token now, before its value potentially increases, could be a strategic move for investors looking to benefit from what he describes as the greatest transfer of wealth in history. Establishing the 1,000 Benchmark Farina suggests that owning a minimum of 1,000 XRP is a critical goal for investors aiming to maximize future returns. Based on current market prices , this would require an investment of approximately $2,400. However, he believes this amount could yield significant returns as the asset gains traction and its utility expands. He believes the digital asset’s potential value could grow substantially, with future price projections ranging from $10 to $100 or more per token. This growth could be driven by increased adoption, particularly as Ripple collaborates with central banks and integrates the XRP Ledger into next-generation financial systems. Avoiding Common Mistakes One of the key points Farina raised was the importance of avoiding emotional trading decisions. He cited examples of investors who prematurely sold their XRP holdings at prices like $0.80 or $1, only to miss out on further gains as the market continued to rise. Farina cautioned against this reactive behavior, emphasizing the need for a disciplined, long-term perspective. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another critical issue Farina addressed is the risk of storing XRP on cryptocurrency exchanges. He highlighted incidents where exchanges have struggled with supply shocks or liquidation events, leaving investors vulnerable. To mitigate these risks, he strongly advised storing XRP in cold wallets, which provide enhanced security by keeping private keys offline. Farina also noted that removing holdings from exchanges can help investors avoid making impulsive decisions driven by short-term price fluctuations. By focusing on XRP’s long-term potential rather than monitoring its value daily, investors may experience less anxiety and make more rational decisions. The Importance of Long-Term Holding Farina believes that patience will be the key to success for investors. He urged holders to resist the temptation to sell early during market volatility, stressing that those who remain committed to their investment may reap significant rewards. According to Farina, only a small percentage of investors would benefit the most. For him, the 1,000 XRP target represents not just a financial milestone but also a commitment to understanding and participating in the future of digital finance. He expressed confidence that for those who hold onto their assets over the coming years, the financial rewards could be transformative by 2030 or even sooner.

The asset has recovered some ground but now sits at a pivotal level that will determine whether it resumes its bull run or slips once again. The start of the business week was quite bullish for XRP as the company behind it announced on Monday that its long-anticipated stablecoin will be officially released for trading on the next day. XRP went on a massive run, surging from under $2.4 to above $2.7 by the time the launch date arrived. However, it reversed its trajectory shortly after, and the broader market’s collapse took it south hard. In fact, Ripple’s token came crashing by 28% from the aforementioned local peak to $1.96. Many XRP whales used this opportunity to stack up on more tokens, which perhaps helped the asset recover some ground as it pumped to almost $2.4 yesterday. Nevertheless, it has lost its momentum once again and now struggles to remain above $2.2. According to popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this level is particularly significant for XRP’s future price movements. If it manages to maintain it, the token could resume its recent bullish activities and head toward $2.7 once again. In contrast, it risks falling beneath $2 for the third time in December if it breaks below it. If $XRP can hold above $2.20, it might consolidate for a while before taking another shot at the $2.70 resistance. But if the $2.20 support breaks, a downswing to $1.96 becomes imminent. pic.twitter.com/cdtdtSwzKy — Ali (@ali_charts) December 21, 2024 XRP indeed slipped below that line to $2.17 earlier today but managed to bounce off, at least for now. The next few days will be crucial to determine XRP’s closing price at the end of the year and if there will indeed be a Santa Claus rally, as many expected. With its most recent correction, XRP’s market cap has dropped once again to under $130 billion. This means that it has lost its third-place position to USDT, whose market capitalization is close to $140 billion.

Another potential breakout is on Ripple as it approaches the $4 mark. As Cardano retests $0.8 support, DTX Exchange (DTX) is making a storm as a revolutionary hybrid trading platform that can outperform the market’s stalwarts. Ripple (XRP): On the Verge of a $4 Breakout Ripple (XRP) continues to solidify itself further as an institutional and retail favorite of investors. XRP’s recent win against the SEC injects some much-needed freshness into the crypto market. With Ripple tokens currently priced at $2.10, XRP is facing a slight correction in view of the recent interest rate cuts by the US FED. Currently showing some strenuous bullish signals, analysts attribute this potential for a breakout to several factors: Increasing Institutional Adoption: Demand for Ripple is being spurred up by the number of partnerships Ripple has made with major financial institutions and central banks across the globe. Positive Sentiment Post-Grayscale Trust Launch : This launch of Grayscale’s XRP Trust has increased institutional exposure, further improving liquidity and market confidence. Ripple Stablecoin: Launched on the 17th of December, the XRP stablecoin, RLUSD, is pegged to the US dollar. This also adds more liquidity to the ecosystem, addressing one of Ripple’s biggest criticisms. A surge to $4 may be the next target if XRP manages to break through its immediate selling pressures. Records indicate that when Ripple starts going, it tends to launch into parabolic price action and is a favorite to see massive gains this cycle. Cardano (ADA): Poised for Recovery at $0.80 One of the most versatile Layer-1 blockchains in the market, Cardano (ADA) has remained relevant, thanks to its consistent upgrades as well as its growing ecosystem. Cardano is a strong competitor when it comes to smart contracts, but its focus on scalability and sustainability is what it is known for. ADA has shown a slight decrease, retesting its $0.80 support. However, many analysts think this correction is nothing more than FUD, with key catalysts in favor of Cardano reclaiming its previous highs: DeFi Expansion: DeFi on Cardano is growing, with Total Value Locked (TVL) rising steadily above $700 million. Enhanced Governance: With the upcoming CIP-1694 proposal which would introduce decentralized chain governance, the platform has gained new attention. Institutional Adoption: Given Cardano’s green blockchain narrative, ESG focused institutional investors can feel comfortable with ADA as a foundation for growth over the long term. Once market conditions improve, ADA could catapult back to $1, becoming one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. DTX Exchange (DTX): Redefining the Future of Trading Despite the tug-of-war between XRP and ADA to take over their niche, the DTX Exchange (DTX) is making its way to establish itself as the ultimate hybrid trading platform. DTX combines the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges to solve key pain points in the global trading space. Its concept has proven to be a viable one, seeing as the DTX presale raised a staggering $10,000,000 in early funding already. Is DTX Exchange a Game Changer? Unified Hybrid Blockchain: DTX’s proprietary VulcanX blockchain ties together traditional financial markets into DeFi, allowing seamless trading of ‘real world’ assets such as stocks, bonds, commodities and cryptocurrencies. Non-Custodial Storage Solutions: Traders maintain complete control over their funds and enjoy the best on-chain verification possible. Massive Upside Potential: With DTX priced at just $0.12 in its sixth ICO stage, the coin is expected to make a 7,000% gain once it lists on Tier-1 exchanges. DTX is a standout of ICOs this quarter, having strong investor interest and a growing community. Due to its ability to democratize financial markets, it is a compelling choice for investors looking for high growth. Conclusion Ripple and Cardano are definitely solid contenders within the crypto space, with DTX Exchange (DTX) setting itself apart from the rest. With its innovative hybrid trading platform, extensive market accessibility, and outstanding growth potential, it’s the best altcoin for investors aiming for life changing gains.

IOTA (IOTA) IOTA is a new kind of distributed ledger technology that’s changing the game in the world of Web3. Instead of using a traditional blockchain, it uses something called the Tangle—a network structure that looks like a multi-dimensional blockchain. This unique design allows for direct and secure transfers of data and value, recorded immutably on the network. People, businesses, and institutions can all use IOTA’s open-source tools to build and interact in the decentralized web. With its upcoming IOTA 2.0 upgrade in 2024, the project aims to achieve full decentralization. IOTA also works closely with its staging network, Shimmer, to offer solutions for a secure and open infrastructure that could drive the future economy. By enabling the development of decentralized applications with smart contracts compatible with Ethereum, it opens doors for more developers to participate. In a market where scalability and transaction speed are key, IOTA’s technology stands out. Compared to traditional blockchain coins, IOTA’s Tangle offers a fresh approach that could address some of the limitations faced by others. As the decentralized space evolves, technologies like IOTA may play a significant role in shaping what’s next. dYdX (DYDX) dYdX is changing how people trade futures in the crypto world. Founded in 2017 by Antonio Juliano, it’s a platform that lets users trade perpetual futures without needing permission from a central authority. It offers two main products: dYdX Chain (V4) and dYdX V3. The dYdX Chain is a Layer-1 network built with the Cosmos SDK, using Delegated Proof-of-Stake for security. This means users can trade by depositing USDC, and no central party takes trading fees. On the other hand, dYdX V3 uses Layer-2 technology from StarkWare, which makes transactions faster and cheaper on the Ethereum network. This blend of technologies provides users with flexibility and efficiency in their trading. The potential of dYdX lies in its innovation and responsiveness to market needs. By migrating from the ERC-20 ethDYDX token to a native DYDX token on its own chain, and initiating trading rewards in 2023, dYdX has shown a commitment to enhancing user experience. Its use of zero-knowledge rollups and focus on decentralization set it apart from other platforms. In the current market cycle, where traders seek speed, low costs, and trustless environments, platforms like dYdX are gaining attention. While the crypto market is volatile, dYdX’s advancements in technology and services position it as a noteworthy player in the decentralized finance space. Conclusion IOTA and DYDX are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out with its sports memecoin aiming for huge gains and community-driven growth in the 2024 bull run.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 490,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is flashing technical signals that preceded steep rallies in the past. The trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin has breached the upper range of its Bollinger Bands in the two-month time frame after spending about two years recovering from a bear market bottom. Traders use Bollinger Bands to identify potential periods of volatility expansion and determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold. TechDev’s chart also suggests that the two signals were present during the 2016 and 2020 market cycles – just before BTC ignited parabolic surges. “This is where things have gotten exciting.” Source: TechDev/X Looking at BTC from a different perspective, TechDev says Bitcoin is in the early stages of a parabolic ascent based on the crypto king’s logarithmic moving average convergence divergence (LMACD) indicator. The LMACD indicator is designed to reveal changes in an asset’s trend, strength and momentum. “Paying attention to the high time frames (HTFs) offers the best chance to trade the cycles. $30,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $50,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $70,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. $90,000 was not the top, because HTF expansion had not ended. And HTF expansion still has not ended.” Source: TechDev/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will not witness a cycle top until the LMACD on the two-month chart hits its resistance at 0.12. BTC’s LMACD appears to be currently hovering at 0.04. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,274.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 08:28:51

With promising innovations and real-world applications, Qubetics ($TICS) , Stellar (XLM), and Algorand (ALGO) have emerged as the frontrunners for significant growth. Qubetics is leading the charge with its game-changing QubeQode platform, which makes blockchain development more accessible, while Stellar and Algorand have solidified themselves as leaders in payment solutions and scalable networks. Here’s why these three projects are the best coins for exponential returns and why they belong in your portfolio. Qubetics ($TICS): Bridging Accessibility With QubeQode Qubetics is fast becoming one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space, offering tools designed to simplify decentralised technology adoption. Now in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 365 million $TICS tokens to 11,100+ investors, raising more than $7.4 million. At just $0.0342 per token, Qubetics presents a rare opportunity for exponential returns for early investors. One of Qubetics’ most revolutionary features is QubeQode , a no-code development platform that allows businesses and individuals to build decentralised applications (dApps) without needing programming expertise. This feature removes barriers to blockchain adoption, empowering professionals, small businesses, and enterprises to enter the decentralised economy with ease. For example, a logistics company could use QubeQode to develop a transparent supply chain management app, improving tracking efficiency without incurring the cost of hiring blockchain developers. Likewise, a healthcare professional could create a secure, decentralised platform for patient data storage, ensuring data privacy and interoperability across healthcare providers. QubeQode democratizes access to blockchain technology, helping businesses of all sizes harness the benefits of decentralisation. By making development simple and affordable, Qubetics positions itself as a project with immense global potential. Qubetics has analysts predicting massive returns for $TICS holders. The token price is expected to hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, translating into over 630.19% ROI. Long-term projections of $5 to $10 post-mainnet launch suggest life-changing returns, with gains reaching as high as 29,107.82% ROI. For example, a $25,000 investment at today’s price of $0.0342 could grow to $7.3 million if $TICS reaches $10. With its accessible tools like QubeQode and strong market momentum, Qubetics is undeniably one of the best coins for exponential returns. Stellar (XLM): Transforming Global Payments Stellar is a leading blockchain platform designed to facilitate low-cost cross-border payments and financial inclusivity. Built to connect banks, payment systems, and individuals, Stellar’s network enables fast, secure transactions, making it a favourite among enterprises and NGOs. For example, Stellar allows a small business owner in South America to receive payments from international clients instantly and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional banking systems. Similarly, humanitarian organisations use Stellar to distribute aid to remote areas efficiently, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring funds reach the right people. With its growing adoption and partnerships with major financial entities, Stellar remains a strong choice for investors looking for projects with real-world utility and scalability. Its established reputation as a leader in cross-border transactions positions Stellar as one of the best coins for exponential returns in the years to come. Algorand (ALGO): Delivering Scalability and Sustainability Algorand is a high-performance blockchain platform known for solving the blockchain trilemma—balancing decentralisation, security, and scalability. Its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism enables Algorand to process thousands of transactions per second while maintaining energy efficiency and low fees. Algorand’s focus on sustainable scalability makes it an ideal platform for financial institutions, enterprises, and developers building decentralised finance (DeFi) solutions. For instance, a fintech startup can utilise Algorand to offer cross-border payment tools that are both affordable and reliable, tapping into underserved markets globally. Algorand’s robust partnerships, including collaborations with governments and enterprises, further solidify its position as a blockchain for real-world use cases. With increasing adoption and a growing DeFi ecosystem, Algorand continues to attract investor interest, making it one of the best coins for exponential returns in 2024. Conclusion: Why These Coins Offer Exponential Returns Qubetics ($TICS), Stellar (XLM), and Algorand (ALGO) are three of the best coins for exponential returns, offering unique innovations that meet the needs of a rapidly evolving digital economy. While Stellar focuses on transforming global payments and Algorand delivers scalable blockchain solutions, Qubetics takes the spotlight with its QubeQode feature, driving blockchain accessibility like never before. At just $0.0342 per $TICS token, Qubetics represents a rare opportunity for investors to get in early and maximise their returns. With projections pointing toward massive ROI, Qubetics is the Best Coins for Exponential Returns in 2024 .

One prominent trader has projected a 235% price increase for the token, suggesting it could reach $0.00005816, setting a new yearly high. The cryptocurrency market recently faced heightened volatility, with Bitcoin’s value dropping by over 10% in just two days to approximately $93,000. This decline had a ripple effect on altcoins, including Shiba Inu, which retested its $0.0002 support level. Despite the initial losses, Shiba Inu demonstrated remarkable recovery. The token surged by 28% from its recent low of $0.0000185 and continued to gain traction, rising by an additional 6% to trade above $0.000238 earlier yesterday. Analyst’s Bullish Predictions For Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dollars Maker, a well-known market analyst, has expressed strong confidence in Shiba Inu’s upward trajectory. In a recent TradingView commentary , he suggested that the token is poised for significant gains. He identified the December 20 price lows as an ideal entry point for long positions, citing the potential for a substantial upward movement. The analyst highlighted several key price targets for the token with the ultimate projection of $0.00005816 representing a 235% increase from its current levels. He believes the token will first aim for a notable rise to $0.00003339, followed by further gains to $0.00004566. This final surge would surpass its March 2024 high of $0.000045 and establish a new yearly peak. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Sentiment Other analysts have also shared optimistic outlooks for Shiba Inu. Klejdi Cuni noted that the token’s prolonged accumulation near the $0.00002424 support level indicates a solid foundation for future growth. He anticipates that this accumulation phase could propel the token to $0.000070 in the near term. Similarly, Pouyan TradeFX has forecasted an upward trend for Shiba Inu, projecting that it could break through a multi-year trendline that has constrained its growth. Once this resistance is overcome, the token could experience a significant rally, potentially exceeding a 100% increase in value. The recent recovery in the token’s price and the bullish predictions from multiple analysts highlight the token’s potential for substantial growth. While the projections range from moderate increases to a 235% surge, they reflect growing confidence in the token’s resilience and market position. However, investors are warned to approach these forecasts with caution and ensure careful consideration before making investment decisions.

The altcoins are also deep in the red, with massive daily price declines from the likes of SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, and many others. BTC’s Short-Term Recovery Although the business week started quite spectacularly for BTC, whose price skyrocketed from $101,000 to a new all-time high of over $108,000 by Tuesday, it actually turned sour on Wednesday after the latest US FOMC meeting. The primary cryptocurrency began a massive correction that culminated on Friday with a price slump to around $92,000. Thus, the asset had lost more than $16,000 in just 72 hours. At this point, the bulls finally managed to halt the freefall and helped BTC climb to $95,000. It kept going north on Saturday morning and jumped to $99,600. As the community was preparing for a potential challenge for the six-digit mark, bitcoin’s trajectory reversed once gain. BTC started to lose value once again and dropped to just under $96,000 hours ago. Despite being above that line now, bitcoin is still 2% down on the day. Its market capitalization struggles to remain above $1.9 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has risen to 55% as most altcoins have suffered a lot more. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 22.12.2024.

XRP was stopped ahead of $2.4 and has slipped to $2.24 now. Even more painful daily declines are evident from SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, XLM, DOT, HBAR, APT, ICP, AAVE, and CRO, with losses of up to 11% in the case of APT.

Despite the market-wide decline, these coins have a history of bouncing back stronger, making them the best candidates for this category. Let’s find out if INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA can 10x an investment portfolio! The IntelMarkets AI-Powered Trading Platform Gains Traction IntelMarkets is one new crypto project gaining attention from traders across the market due to its innovative features. It is a platform where users can trade perpetual contracts with high leverages and AI tools. Given its 1,000x leverage offering, traders can boost their potential gains from every trade.

Investors across the market are gravitating towards this platform to take advantage of its long-term value proposition. Its tools can help them scale up their performances in the market. Whale Sends 150 Billion PEPE to Binance A PEPE whale has stunned the crypto community after depositing 150 billion PEPE coins worth $2.72 million into Binance. On-chain trend tracker Lookonchain reported this development in an X post on December 19, 2024. This deposit comes amid an ongoing decline in asset prices. Speculations have erupted that the whale intends to sell these coins to curtail losses, having already lost $229,000 during the dip. However, this decline will give potential investors a chance to bid PEPE at a lower price and sell when its value rises during the next market leg-up. For now, PEPE trades at $0.00001609, down 31.49% over the week. Aave Blockchain Draws Up Proposal to Launch Aave V3 On Sonic Aave DAO has come up with a governance proposal to launch Aave V3 on Sonic. This proposal comes after Sonic Labs announced the launch of its mainnet Sonic on December 18, 2024. The proposal demands the support of Aave community members towards the deployment of the Aave v3, with a $22 minion TVL, on the layer-1 EVM-compatible blockchain. Sonic Foundation is committing $15 million, 20 million USDC, and up to 50 million Sonic native tokens as incentives for this integration. The Aave team remarked that this initiative will open a new source of revenue for the network and boost its value in the market. As of now, AAVE trades for $295, down 19.56% over the week. Whale Interest Grows in ADA Despite Drop in the Cardano Coin’s Price Cardano’s ADA has experienced a chaotic drop in price due to the current state of the crypto market. The ADA price has dipped 25% over the past week. Despite this decline, a group of whale investors continue to accumulate the Cardano coin substantially. Reports show that these whales bought over 100 million ADA tokens in December 2024 alone. Whale purchases often precede a remarkable price surge, sparking speculation that ADA may be on the verge of a rebound. In the meantime, the Cardano coin has lost 25% of its value in the past week, dipping to a token price of $0.82. Buy INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA For 10x Gains With the crypto market shedding gains, INTL, PEPE, AAVE, and ADA offer investors an opportunity to boost their portfolios tenfold during the next market leg-up. These assets have performed well in the past and are expected to repeat their previous performances again. However, INTL, a new crypto coin, stands out among these coins because of its ability to rival these top altcoins. INTL is still in Stage 8 of its public presale, valued at $0.073. With up to 50% gains up for grabs, before it reaches $0.110 at launch, smart investors are shifting their gaze to this coin. According to experts’ predictions, INTL can also soar 10x after its exchange debut. To secure all the gains on INTL, all you need to do is join the IntelMarkets presale now!

Social media sentiment shows a surge in FUD, with negative comments outweighing positive ones. Historical patterns indicate that extreme pessimism could signal a potential bullish reversal for Bitcoin. In the last 24 hours, after coming close to reclaiming the $100K level once again, the price of Bitcoin plummeted to $95K.

The Solana price succumbed to the bearish pressure and fell beneath $200 for the first time in over a month. While the price of SOL has continued its downward spiral in the past day, a prominent crypto analyst on X believes that the altcoin might be gearing for a rebound already. Below is how the Solana price could course-correct and resume its bullish trend. Can SOL Price Reclaim $200 Again? In a post on the X platform, crypto pundit Ali Martinez shared an interesting insight into the current Solana price action. According to the analyst, several indicators and formations are pointing to a rebound for the altcoin’s price. Related Reading: SUI Shows Strong Bullish Comeback: Breakout Above $4.98 In Sight This prediction revolves around quite a number of indicators and chart formations. Firstly, Martinez noted that the price of Solana appears to be testing a key support zone between the $188 and $179 region. As shown in the chart above, this price zone has served as a significant resistance level in the past — from March to November. Typically, when the price flips a resistance zone, the level tends to act as a significant support should the price return to it. Besides the cost basis of investors, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also pointing to a potential rebound for the Solana price. The RSI, which tracks an asset’s overbought and oversold levels, is currently at 31.72. According to Martinez, this RSI level has acted as support in the past, with the Solana price traveling to new swing highs on each occasion. Monitoring this indicator could provide the right time to enter a long position for the altcoin. Furthermore, the stochastic RSI is currently at oversold levels, suggesting that the price might be ready for a reversal. The Stoch RSI differs from the regular indicator in terms of the sensitivity and timeliness of its signals. Martinez did not specify a target for the Solana price should the indicator signals prove true. However, a glance at price action data shows that the altcoin’s price tends to at least return to its previous swing high whenever it finds support at the aforementioned levels. Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Solana is hovering around $180, reflecting a disappointing 6% decline in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency’s performance is even much worse on the weekly timeframe, having dropped by nearly 17% in the last seven days.

While Sacks was initially expected to lead the administration’s technology policy, the bulk of operational leadership will now fall to Michael Kratsios, a Scale AI executive and former US Chief Technology Officer during Trump’s first term. Kratsios will oversee technology policy alongside Gale Slater, who will focus on telecoms and antitrust. Sources say Sacks’ decision to scale back his role stems from his refusal to leave his investment firm Craft Ventures and his unwillingness to take on a full-time government position that would require Senate confirmation. Instead, Sacks is expected to serve as a Special Government Employee (SGE), a title that would allow him to intermittently advise the government while continuing his private sector duties. Sacks’s dual role has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. While SGEs face fewer restrictions than regular government employees, critics argue such arrangements can make policy implementation and accountability more difficult. Related News: BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Praised This Altcoin Today: Hours Later, He Sold Big “Not leaving office and not taking on a formal government role complicates things a lot,” said one source familiar with the transition process. “Even if conflicts of interest are often overlooked in this administration, there’s a realization that the tech policy role needs someone who is fully operational and hands-on.” Kratsios, who was heavily involved in the transition team, is now expected to take the lead in personnel management and executing day-to-day policy initiatives. Despite the redefinition of his role, Sacks insists he remains at the center of the administration’s technology strategy. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Sacks dismissed reports that his role was being scaled back as “nonsense.” “I plan to spend 50% of my time in Washington making policy and 50% in Silicon Valley keeping up with the latest technology. That seems like an ideal fit for a tech policy role and is exactly what I asked for.” Despite the changes, Sacks is expected to remain influential within the Trump administration, where his close ties to Silicon Valley and his advocacy of right-wing policies have given him a key role in shaping the administration’s approach to technology, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. *This is not investment advice.

A Deal That Fueled TerraUSD Collapse The SEC revealed that in 2021, Tai Mo Shan struck a deal with Terraform Labs to purchase Terra LUNA tokens at a significant discount. The firm later acquired $20 million worth of UST to artificially maintain the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, when UST lost its peg in May 2022, the fallout was devastating, causing widespread financial losses for investors. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler noted the broader implications of the collapse, stating, “The impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public.” The incident has since become an important case for the cryptocurrency industry, fueling regulatory efforts like the Lummis-Gillibrand Stablecoin Act of 2024 , which bans algorithmic stablecoins entirely. The Chain Reaction of Failure At its peak, TerraUSD ranked as the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Its downfall began on May 8, 2022, when a whale dumped $285 million worth of UST, causing it to depeg and fall to $0.98. The situation worsened rapidly as fear and uncertainty gripped the market, leading to a sharp decline in UST’s value to $0.67 within two days. The panic-selling and cascading liquidations revealed a critical flaw in the system: UST’s market capitalization had outgrown its collateral reserves of LUNA, making the stablecoin fundamentally unsustainable. The algorithmic mechanism meant to stabilize UST crumbled under pressure, resulting in the complete collapse of its value. The repercussions were far-reaching. The SEC launched a formal investigation into Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, ultimately leading to legal actions and fines totaling $4.4 billion. The settlement with Tai Mo Shan serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in algorithmic stablecoins and the importance of regulatory oversight to safeguard investors.

According to authorities, the suspects, 23-year-old Gabriel Hay of Beverly Hills and Gavin Mayo of Thousands Pam’s were accused of scamming unsuspecting investors in a crypto scheme. In a statement by prosecutors, the two men were charged with taking funds for investment in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and disappearing. The prosecutors also mentioned that the duo floated several crypto schemes that met the same end as their NFT scheme. According to a statement from the United States Attorney’s office, the two men, with help from another person, carried out this scam from May 2021 to May 2024. The statement revealed that they carried out an act known as rug pull, where developers or people in charge of a project take out investor funds and abandon the project. Two California men charged for multiple crypto scam schemes In the indictment, the prosecutors noted that the suspects, Hay and Mayo, lied to investors about the state of one of their projects, Vault of Games. The duo claimed that the NFT project will be the first to be pegged to a hard asset. They also lied to investors that the Vault of Games project would work with jewelers worldwide, a claim that was found to be false. In addition, the men also claimed they had started making their exchange, where jewelers would come and register to provide service. Things started to go south when the Vault of Games’ handle on X posted in November 2021, asking what was happening. After a while, the followers gathered around the project’s comment section, accusing them of deleting the investor’s page on their Discord channel. Most users were frustrated, lashing out at the project, with one thing evident; they had been scammed by its founders. The comments later accused the developers of stealing the community funds, with most of them disappointed that they failed to deliver on their promise. Prosecutors list out the allegations against the men According to the prosecutors, the California men acted brazenly and without remorse, transferring the stolen funds into their wallets. They also mentioned that the Vault of Games was not the duo’s first rodeo, tying them to the rug pulls of projects like Faceless, Sinful Souls, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, Roost Coin, Clout Coin, MoonPortal, among others. In her statement, the Department of Justice (DOJ) Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole Argentieri condemned the act, citing the dangers of emerging technologies. “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money,” Argentieri said. Argentieri also assured the public that the department will continue a clampdown on individuals and entities carrying out these acts. “The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice,” she added. In addition to their charges, prosecutors claimed that Hay and Mayo stalked one of their project managers, harassing him for outing one of their projects as a scam. The prosecutors said when the project manager, who was first blamed for the rug pull, pointed to the Californian men as the creators of the project, they sent several threatening messages to him in hopes of getting him to recant his story. They also posed as fake lawyers to make him back down from talking to the cops. In one of the emails, Hay and Mayo threatened to falsely accuse the project manager’s parents of carrying out improper sexual acts. The indictment mentioned that the last threat came in September 2023, with the duo reminding the project manager that they were still watching him while planning ‘to destroy’ him. The California men are charged with a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of stalking, and two counts of wire fraud. If the prosecutors get a favorable ruling, they could spend up to 25 years in jail.

Solana’s SOL: A High-Speed Blockchain for Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that prioritizes scalability, offering a foundation for decentralized applications with faster transactions and support for multiple programming languages. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, is central to the ecosystem, enabling transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Unlike some platforms that rely on sharding or second-layer solutions, Solana focuses on a high-capacity network to attract developers and investors. The potential of SOL lies in its ability to support a wide range of high-activity projects and services. In the current market cycle, Solana’s emphasis on speed and scalability positions it as an attractive option for those interested in decentralized applications and blockchain technology. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi. Inspired by Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within Ethereum’s ecosystem. The coin started with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and “burned” 40% of the total supply, reducing circulation. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB aims for broader utility by developing platforms like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and governance system. Its integration with Ethereum allows for potential growth in decentralized applications. Conclusion While SOL and SHIB show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those pursuing excellence. Designed for alpha males seeking luxury and success, it offers real benefits and community. With expected 700% growth in presale and potential thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, DOGEN could achieve record-breaking success.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 09:32:00

Vance in January. This donation marks the largest cryptocurrency contribution ever made for a political event. Other major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Ondo Finance, have also committed $1 million each to the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. These contributions will fund a series of celebrations, including parades, dinners, and exclusive receptions surrounding the January 20th swearing-in ceremony. The donations come with significant benefits for top contributors. Companies or individuals donating $1 million or raising $2 million will receive six tickets to high-profile events. These include exclusive dinners with Trump and Vance, receptions with incoming Cabinet members, and access to other private gatherings. Such opportunities offer crypto leaders a chance to establish direct relationships with the new administration and influence future regulatory policies. The involvement of crypto firms in political funding reflects the sector's growing influence. Earlier this year, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse personally donated $25 million to Fairshake, a pro-crypto super PAC. Collectively, crypto-affiliated PACs have raised over $133 million for political campaigns this cycle. This financial support highlights the industry’s commitment to shaping a favorable regulatory environment in the United States. Meetings between top crypto executives and Trump have already yielded results. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has resigned, and pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins has taken his place. Furthermore, Trump has appointed David Sacks as the first-ever AI and Crypto Czar , signaling a strategic focus on these technologies in his administration. These changes suggest a policy shift that could benefit the cryptocurrency industry over the next four years. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have also held private discussions with Trump in recent months. Topics included regulatory reforms and key personnel appointments aimed at promoting innovation while ensuring market stability. With the cryptocurrency industry’s increasing political presence, these dialogues are expected to play a vital role in shaping the sector's future. The recent surge in crypto political funding follows a broader trend of integration between digital assets and traditional power structures. Ondo Finance’s donation comes after a significant market boost, with its token reaching an all-time high of $2.14 following a major investment from World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed project. This financial momentum has reinforced the sector’s credibility in political and economic discussions. Crypto leaders recognize the importance of being part of policymaking processes, especially as regulatory clarity remains a key concern. By supporting Trump’s inauguration and engaging directly with political leaders, companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken are positioning themselves as influential stakeholders in the U.S. financial landscape. As the cryptocurrency industry gains ground in Washington, Trump’s administration appears ready to embrace digital assets and blockchain technologies. The appointment of key pro-crypto figures, along with significant financial contributions from the industry, signals a potential turning point. The coming years could see the U.S. adopting a more crypto-friendly stance, driven by collaboration between political leaders and industry pioneers.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|ONDO,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-22 09:41:15

This will offset about $42 trillion of the country’s liabilities, it claimed. The VanEck analysis assumes that the national debt will compound by 5% between 2025 and 2049, starting at $37 trillion. This is an optimistic estimate given that the rate over the last ten years has been 10%. It further assumes Bitcoin will compound at 25% annually over the same period from the base of $200,000 in 2025. Source: VanEck Based on this assumption, Bitcoin would be worth $42.3 million by 2049. Thus, if the BITCOIN Act, which proposes that the US have a reserve of one million Bitcoins by 2029, is enacted, the value of the reserve in 2049 would be $42 trillion. However, many have considered the assumption that Bitcoin will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next 25 years to be highly unlikely. In his response, VanEck’s Head of Research, Matthew Sigel , argued that Bitcoin has actually been growing at a 50% CAGR over the last 10 years. Thus, 25% is a conservative assumption. VanEck’s Head of Research says the Bitcoin acquisition will benefit the US dollar Sigel has now further affirmed his opinion on the benefits of a Bitcoin Reserve for the US. In a recent post countering an article by crypto investor Nic Carter against a Bitcoin Reserve, Sigel noted that now is the best time for the US to have a Bitcoin reserve. He explained that the US debt burden has been the major factor preventing it from having a reserve, but it can now start with Bitcoin to position itself for the future. The analyst noted that Bitcoin can be a complementary asset that will strengthen the US dollar, and the belief of many that the adoption of Bitcoin by the US will undermine the dollar could not be more wrong. He said: “Bitcoin doesn’t have to undermine the dollar. As in an investor portfolio, a small position is simply a hedge against fiscal unsustainability and geopolitical uncertainty, which can strengthen our asset base and impose some discipline on the Central Bank.” Sigel also believes that Carter overestimates how the market will react to the US government acquiring Bitcoin . In his view, there is gradual mainstream adoption and some political will at present; together, these will be enough to lay the foundation for the reserve and build on it with time. Bitcoin reserve will not cost US $1 trillion; can be a gradual process Meanwhile, Sigel also clarified in his post that the Bitcoin reserve will not impose an additional cost burden on the US. Based on VanEck estimates, it will cost the US around $320 billion to own one million BTC. However, he believes that accumulation could be a gradual process, giving the US a first-mover advantage and expanding with time. In the expert’s opinion, such an advantage has strategic benefits for the US government. BTC’s neutrality makes it ideal as a reserve asset and allows the country to retain its leading position in innovative technology, he said. He added that Bitcoin could also benefit the US energy strategy as it incentivizes energy infrastructure development. Sigel said: “Bitcoin mining incentivizes the development of domestic energy infrastructure, including renewables, nuclear, and grid resiliency projects. This aligns with US strategic goals for energy independence and sustainability.” With the two experts arguing for and against Bitcoin, the crypto community remains divided on whether it would be a good idea. Most of those opposing it are concerned it will not benefit the US dollar and might lead to the government taking control of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, the possibility of the US having an SBR is currently limited as the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the government cannot buy Bitcoin. It remains to be seen whether the next administration can change this position.

Qubetics Could Be December’s Most Rewarding Choice,https://thecoinrise.com/fantoms-growth-left-you-wondering-whats-next-qubetics-could-be-decembers-most-rewarding-choice/,"Fantom made headlines with its cutting-edge technology and solutions for smart contracts, creating a platform that caught the attention of early investors. Back when its ICO launched, few could have predicted how far it would go. Those who got in early saw their portfolios flourish as Fantom grew into one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space. But for many, hesitation turned into regret as they watched Fantom’s value rise without them. What if you could avoid that feeling this time around? Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project that’s stirring up excitement in the crypto world with its ongoing presale. Built to address the gaps that previous blockchains couldn’t fully close, Qubetics is creating a decentralised ecosystem that’s practical, accessible, and full of potential. If you’ve been searching for the next big thing, Qubetics might just be the opportunity to turn things around. Qubetics Presale Is Your Chance to Avoid Missing Out Again If you’ve heard about Qubetics but haven’t taken action yet, here’s what you’ve missed so far. The whitelist opened at a jaw-dropping $0.01, giving early participants an exclusive entry point. As the presale progressed through its initial stages, prices remained incredibly competitive, rewarding those who acted quickly. But all is not lost—Qubetics is now in its 13th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0342. Every week, the price increases by 10%, with each stage closing on Sunday at midnight. So far, over $7.4million has been raised, 365 million $TICS tokens sold, and more than 11,100 holders have joined the journey. This isn’t just another presale—it’s a chance to be part of a project that’s gaining momentum for all the right reasons. What makes Qubetics truly stand out is its QubeQode IDE , a tool designed to revolutionise blockchain development. Imagine a medium-sized enterprise wanting to streamline its operations using blockchain. With QubeQode, they can use drag-and-drop components to integrate features like token management or user authentication without needing a full-blown development team. For independent creators, the form-based configuration simplifies smart contract design, making blockchain more accessible than ever. And for developers, the code snippet library saves time by offering pre-built solutions for common tasks. Whether you’re a business, a freelancer, or a tech enthusiast, Qubetics is removing barriers and unlocking new possibilities. Fantom’s Journey and What It Means for Your Crypto Strategy Fantom started with the bold goal of creating a high-performance, scalable blockchain. When its ICO launched, tokens were sold at a fraction of what they’re worth today. Early adopters who recognised Fantom’s potential saw their investments multiply as the project gained traction. Fantom’s ability to address real-world problems, like improving the speed and cost-efficiency of transactions, helped it secure partnerships and grow its ecosystem. At its all-time high, Fantom delivered extraordinary returns for early investors. Those who hesitated, however, found themselves either paying more to get in or missing out entirely. Fantom’s story is a reminder of the importance of acting early in the crypto space. While the opportunities aren’t endless, new projects like Qubetics are stepping up, offering a chance to start fresh. Act Now and Be Part of Something Big Missed chances can feel frustrating, but they don’t have to be the end of the road. Qubetics is giving you a real shot at starting fresh with its presale still open for action. With over $7.4 million raised and the 13th stage underway, now’s your opportunity to grab $TICS tokens before prices climb higher with the weekly 10% increase. Fantom showed how early decisions can shape big wins. Qubetics is your chance to move past hesitation and take hold of something promising. This presale could be the turning point your crypto journey needs—don’t let it slip by.

Analysts believe this token has what it takes to leave Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano price in the dust, making it the breakout star of the market. With such explosive potential while selling out massively in the presale market at a low cost, investors should rush to secure WLTQ before it sells out. Wall Street Analysts Predict 30,000% Rally For WallitIQ (WLTQ), Surpassing Rivals WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale draws Wall Street analysts, who predict a massive 30,000% rally in 14 days to outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) and the Cardano price. As a next-generation DeFi wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) focuses on security and efficiency, making it a strong competitor to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA). Investors are rushing to secure WLTQ tokens at a discounted $0.0243 , the lowest price available during its presale. With over $2.6 million raised in the current presale stage and $2 million from the previous phase, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has become a top crypto presale option for savvy investors. Wall Street analysts highlight the urgency of getting in now, as the price will rise to $0.0420 once this stage ends. WallitIQ (WLTQ) promises a secure wallet and delivers just that. Advanced biometric and facial recognition features keep unauthorized users out, while dual-layer encryption (AES and ECC) guarantees private keys and transactions remain safe. Beyond security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) improves everyday crypto transactions and guarantees easy trades of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Its “Scan and Pay QR” feature reduces ETH gas fees for large transfers, while 24/7 live agent and AI chatbot support keep users connected. Wall Street analysts believe the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will offer even higher profit in the long run as its price moves toward new highs. Wall Street analysts say buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale tokens today before they increase to $0.0420. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Setbacks As Wall Street Analysts Predict It Will Fall Behind Rivals Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular dog-themed meme coin, is facing mounting challenges as Wall Street Analysts predict WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass it significantly with a projected 30,000% price increase. Shiba Inu (SHIB) price recently suffered a market setback, plunging over 10% last week and dropping to $0.00002585. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) managed a modest 3% gain last month, hopes of a significant rebound have been dampened by its inconsistent performance. Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recorded an impressive 166% year-to-date increase, the recent losses have erased much of the progress made by investors. Cardano Price Consolidates Amid Rising Competition From Emerging Tokens The Cardano price has been stuck in a consolidation phase, with Wall Street analysts pointing to increasing competition from emerging presale tokens. After testing an all-time high of $2, the Cardano price has since crashed to around $1.04. Despite its recent struggles, the Cardano price continues to move steadily, striving to maintain its position among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Over the past 7 days, the Cardano price has risen by 2%; last month, it climbed 38% to $1.25. While the Cardano price aims for new highs, many ADA investors are considering more profitable opportunities like WallitIQ (WLTQ). Conclusion Wall Street analysts have identified WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a top contender, projecting a 30,000% rally in 14 days. This performance is expected to outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA). Investors are rushing to the WLTQ presale, eager to secure significant returns before prices climb. Investors can lock in the lowest possible price now, with a 30,000% rally projected in just two weeks. Already listed on CoinMarketCap, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers transparency and real-time tracking capabilities. WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet simplifies crypto transactions with an intuitive wallet experience.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Hougan says that institutional money is in the early stages of broadening out to other crypto assets besides just Bitcoin ( BTC ). Hougan forecasts that 2025 will be the year that institutional investors will begin to incorporate more diversification in their crypto-investing strategies the same way they do in other asset classes like equities or bonds. “You’re already seeing it broaden out actually. A lot of people were worried about the Ethereum ETFs for instance, which launched this summer and had tepid inflows. But over the last month or so, you’ve seen billions of dollars flow into those products. Again, the things that have happened in crypto in the past keep happening. Historically, most people enter crypto through Bitcoin, and then they discover Ethereum, and then they think about Solana. There’s no reason to assume that the institutions that came into Bitcoin won’t move on to other assets in the future. In fact, I think in 2025, you’re going to see an explosion of interest in index space strategies that give diversified exposure to crypto. Of course, [that is] something we’ve been doing at Bitwise since 2017 when we pioneered that concept. I think 2025 is when that becomes a mainstream way to allocate to this space, the same way it is to stocks and bonds and real estate and everything else.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

At the center of it all was Elon Musk. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is now as much a political disruptor as he is a tech icon. His deep-pocketed support for President Donald Trump and his economic policies has turned him into an unelected power broker, and people are wondering: is this billionaire’s game about helping America or protecting his own empire at the expense of the economy? Elon has thrown a fat $277 million behind Trump and his Republican allies. $239 million of that was funneled through Elon’s America PAC, making him the largest donor of the 2024 election cycle. For a man who once claimed he wouldn’t support either candidate, Elon didn’t just flip, he went all in. By August, he was rallying voters at Trump campaign events, calling the election “the most important of your lifetime” and urging his hundreds of millions of followers to act. According to him, his breaking point was the Democrat-originating WOKE culture. Elon’s role in Trump’s economic revolution Trump’s economic policies are as divisive as his tweets, and Elon’s fingerprints are all over them. Let’s talk about tariffs. Trump wants to slap 10% to 20% import taxes to boost American manufacturing. He also wants to hit BRICS countries with 100% tariffs if they dare abandon the US dollar. Sounds patriotic, right? Well economists are not impressed. They predict that these tariffs will drive up consumer prices without creating the jobs Trump promises. Then there’s the immigration plan: mass deportation. Trump wants millions of undocumented immigrants out. Critics say this will cause labor shortages in critical industries like agriculture and construction, where immigrants are the backbone. And here’s where Elon officially steps into the policy arena. Trump has proposed the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), a $500 billion federal spending-cut machine. Elon is set to lead it. This initiative aims to slash federal spending by identifying and axing what Elon sees as wasteful programs. That’s $2 trillion over four years. But here’s the catch: those cuts will amputate services millions of Americans depend on. Even Elon admits this won’t be easy. He has acknowledged “temporary hardship” for Americans during this economic reset. But what’s hardship for the guy with hundreds of billions of dollars? Because for families living paycheck to paycheck, it’s rising prices, fewer jobs, and shredded safety nets. Retailers have already warned of price hikes thanks to those tariffs. Deportations could cripple supply chains. And cutting federal spending by billions is gonna be public services, housing programs, and food aid on the chopping block. Elon’s motives: Public service or self-service? Let’s not pretend Elon is just a well-meaning billionaire trying to save America. Though he is a decent person, this is also about power and revenge for him. He’s been violated many times by the Oval before, and that must’ve been hurtful. It is fair to assume he has gotten just a tad vindictive, and perhaps petty too. You see, Elon’s alignment with Trump gives him access — real, tangible access — to federal contracts, regulations, and influence that could supercharge his companies. SpaceX, Tesla , and his other ventures thrive on government contracts. With Elon leading the efficiency commission, he’s essentially got a direct line to control federal spending priorities. Who needs a lobbyist when you’re the one holding the purse strings? Some Democratic Senators say Vice President-elect J.D. Vance is going to be pretty much useless. They think it’ll be Elon in the Oval making all the decisions while Trump “yes and”s him. And this guy doesn’t just play behind closed doors. He uses his platform—literally his platform, X (formerly Twitter)—to drive his agenda. It’s no secret that he has ramped up his numbers of tweets in a day since his buddy won the election. At one point, Elon posted over 150 times in a single day, derailing the bipartisan government funding bill. Elon’s posts included more than once inaccuracies, like claiming the bill gave lawmakers a 40% pay raise and funded a $3 billion stadium in D.C. You can go through the bill yourself and see that none of that was true. But by the time fact-checkers caught up, it was already dead. “This bill should not pass,” Elon wrote. Twelve hours later, it didn’t. He celebrated, tweeting, “The voice of the people has triumphed!” But was it really the people, Elon? The bill wasn’t even public then. Why was Elon so invested in killing that bill? Well, as it turns out, buried in the legislation was a provision targeting tech transactions involving China. And guess what? Elon has deep business ties in China . The original bill would’ve cost him money. We can’t say how much though. Anti-crypto and Wall Street critic Senator Elizabeth Warren summed it up in an open letter to Trump: “The American public has no way of knowing whether the advice Elon is whispering in secret is good for the country—or just good for his own bottom line.” Washington’s newest power couple Trump and Elon are reshaping power in America. Trump gives Elon legitimacy. Elon gives Trump money, reach, and a level of influence no other billionaire can match. Together, they’re a force. And they’ll probably change the world, starting with that national Bitcoin strategic reserve . And then fixing all of the economic bridges Joe Biden burned, like Russia and China. Elon’s billions and his platform make him untouchable in a way no one else in Trump’s circle is. Cabinet secretaries can be replaced. Advisors can be sidelined. But Elon? He’s too big to fail, too connected to ignore, and too rich to challenge. Republicans joke about Elon as the next Speaker of the House, but the truth is, he doesn’t need the title. That’d be like a demotion to him now.

The new additions include former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks , Jane Dietze of Galaxy Digital, and Gregg Winiarski from Fanatics Holdings. The appointments, revealed in a December 20 SEC filing , come as the company gears up for its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index on December 23. Brian Brooks Role Sparks Excitement The crypto community believes that Brian Brooks’ addition to MicroStrategy’s board is a major move for the firm. Brooks, who briefly served as CEO of Binance.US in 2021 and was previously the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, brings deep regulatory and strategic expertise to the table. Bitcoin-focused platform Swan Bitcoin called Brooks’ appointment a “BIG deal,” noting his extensive connections within the U.S. banking system. Meanwhile, crypto analyst MacroScope stated the strength of all three appointments, particularly Brooks, whose name has recently circulated as a potential candidate to replace Gary Gensler as SEC Chair under a pro-crypto administration. Dietze and Winiarski also bring notable credentials. Dietze, currently on Galaxy Digital’s board, adds investment acumen, while Winiarski, Chief Legal Officer at Fanatics Holdings, brings extensive legal expertise to MicroStrategy’s operations. MicroStrategy’s Growing Influence These appointments coincide with MicroStrategy’s impending addition to the Nasdaq 100 Index , a landmark achievement that underscores the company’s growing stature. Nasdaq confirmed that MicroStrategy (MSTR) will join Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise as new entrants to the index, replacing firms like Illumina and Moderna. Being listed on the Nasdaq 100 solidifies MicroStrategy’s position among the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. The move also reflects the company’s transition from a software enterprise to a Bitcoin-heavy investment vehicle, driven by founder Michael Saylor’s bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. This development caps off a year of strategic milestones for MicroStrategy. With its Bitcoin holdings exceeding $5 billion , the company’s influence extends beyond the corporate world, reshaping narratives around Bitcoin adoption.

As XRP continues to perform well, fraudsters leverage its popularity to deceive unsuspecting users. A recent incident highlights this troubling trend, with scammers impersonating prominent figures in the crypto world to lure victims. Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), a cryptocurrency influencer on X, recently shared a warning regarding fake giveaways falsely attributed to Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple. These fraudulent posts, cleverly designed to appear legitimate, promote a fake initiative involving the recent launch of RLUSD , Ripple’s stablecoin. SCAM ALERT THIS SCAM IS SPREAD MULTIPLE TIMES AMONG ALL INFLUENCER POSTS AND IT IS A CLEAR SCAM! PLEASE ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT NO ONE EVER IS GIVING YOU #XRP FOR FREE! REPOST TO SHARE THE MESSAGE! THIS SH*T NEEDS TO GET STOPPED! pic.twitter.com/nR2XVzjgTl — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 20, 2024 The Tactics of These Scammers The fraudsters behind these scams rely on subtle tactics to deceive their audience. For instance, they create accounts that mimic names and profile images of prominent individuals. In this case, the scammers misspelled Garlinghouse’s name, omitting the letter “I,” making the discrepancy difficult to detect. These posts are often accompanied by convincing visuals and elaborate captions for legitimacy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Garlinghouse has previously criticized platforms like YouTube and X for failing to address the proliferation of cryptocurrency scams. His frustration resonates with the broader crypto community, which continues to struggle with a surge in fraudulent activities across various social media platforms. The scam’s message claims that Ripple intends to distribute 100 million XRP to investors because of RLUSD’s launch, and promises rewards to loyal participants. Such posts are designed to exploit the excitement surrounding legitimate developments in Ripple’s ecosystem, preying on users who may not exercise sufficient caution when engaging with these posts. Amelie emphasized the importance of vigilance in her post. Her comments serve as a critical reminder to the community to remain skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true. She noted that no one was giving out free XRP, as the desire to earn profit without investing often drives people to fall for these scams. How to Stay Safe in the Crypto Market To protect yourself from falling victim to such schemes, it is crucial to verify the authenticity of any promotional offers. Always double-check the legitimacy of social media accounts, particularly when they claim to represent prominent figures or organizations. Additionally, avoid clicking on links or providing personal information to unverified sources. Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently exposed another sophisticated scam , and prominent voices in the market are constantly on the lookout, exposing scammers to the public and protecting investors.

The analysts predict a $6 target for ADA in the current bull cycle. ADA gained 1,800% under similar conditions in 2020. Despite a recent pullback, Cardano (ADA) supporters are adamant that the cryptocurrency’s trend is consistent with the 2020 patterns. Most crypto community members observing ADA’s recent price development are discussing the potential of the crypto, projecting the possibility of a $6 for the digital asset before the bull run ends. ADA’s price reached a $1.327 yearly high on December 3 before correcting. A 42% pullback saw ADA decline to $0.762 in less than three weeks. However, the cryptocurrency’s supporters believe the bullish momentum is intact, and the altcoin will repeat the achievements of the last bull cycle.

This price action has left traders and investors questioning the next direction for ETH as it consolidates under critical resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Will Test ATH Once It Breaks This Strong Supply Zone – Details Despite the turbulence, on-chain data suggests a potentially bullish outlook. Analyst Ali Martinez shared insightful metrics showing that Ethereum whales have been accumulating heavily during this period of uncertainty. According to the data, whales purchased 340,000 ETH—worth over $1 billion—in the last 96 hours. This significant accumulation indicates that major players see long-term value in Ethereum, even as short-term market sentiment remains mixed. The ongoing whale activity could signal an upcoming recovery for ETH, with large holders positioning themselves for future gains. Historically, such accumulation phases have often preceded strong rallies, as increased demand and reduced supply contribute to upward momentum. Ethereum Whale Demand Keeps Rising Ethereum demand has shown significant instability throughout the year, with persistent selling pressure pushing prices down from local highs. Each rally attempt has faced resistance, highlighting the challenges ETH has encountered in sustaining upward momentum. Despite this, Ethereum continues to demonstrate resilience, particularly during corrective phases, as large holders actively accumulate ETH. Martinez recently shared compelling data on X, indicating a remarkable whale accumulation trend. In the past 96 hours alone, whales have purchased 340,000 Ethereum, valued at over $1 billion. This substantial buying activity underscores the confidence that major players have in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Such accumulation often signals the possibility of a market shift, with whales strategically positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Martinez and other analysts believe this whale-driven demand hints at a significant price surge in the weeks to come. Furthermore, the broader crypto community anticipates Ethereum playing a pivotal role in the expected altseason next year, solidifying its position as a market leader among altcoins. Related Reading: XRP Holds Key Demand Level – Whale Activity Suggests Strength As Ethereum enters this critical phase, market participants will closely monitor its ability to capitalize on the current accumulation. If whale activity continues, it could pave the way for Ethereum to reclaim local highs and potentially set new milestones, reinforcing its dominance in the crypto space. ETH Holding Key Support Ethereum is currently trading at $3,320, showing resilience after holding above the critical 200-day moving average (MA) at $3,000. This level is widely regarded as a key indicator of long-term market strength. Holding above it suggests that Ethereum remains in a bullish structure despite recent volatility and selling pressure. For Ethereum to regain momentum, bulls will need to push the price above the $3,550 resistance level and maintain it. Breaking this zone would signal a renewed upward trend and increase the likelihood of Ethereum testing higher levels. However, this may not happen immediately, as the market could enter a period of sideways consolidation.

Such consolidation is common after periods of heightened volatility and allows the market to establish a more stable base for the next significant move. A strong consolidation phase above $3,000 would further confirm the 200-day MA as a solid support level, boosting confidence among investors.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 10:36:00

The Interpol issued a ‘Red Notice’ for Richard Heart whose real name is Richard Hurler. According to the details, Heart is declared wanted for allegedly committing tax fraud and assault. A red notice implies that a person is provisionally declared wanted globally, meaning law enforcement can locate and arrest the person. In Heart’s case, he is a person of interest in Finland, with authorities actively looking for him. However, the Red Notice does not automatically translate into an international arrest warrant. Heart was also listed on the most wanted fugitive list, where he is being sought after to answer for the same allegations. Hex founder wanted on allegations of tax evasion and assault Europe’s most wanted website shared the details of the allegations against Richard Heart. According to the website , the Hex founder’s assault case involves a 16-year-old girl. Heart was said to have dragged the girl by her hair into a stairwell before knocking her to the ground. The website mentioned that the Hex founder inflicted several bodily harm on the girl, causing her to suffer physical pain. “Schueler physically assaulted a 16-year-old victim by grabbing their hair, dragging them into the stairwell, and knocking them to the ground. While the victim was lying on their back on the floor, Schueler punched them 4 – 5 times in the face, nose, eyes and head area,” the website read. The report also revealed that the victim was left on the spot with various degrees of bodily harm, including broken facial skin, bleeding, and swelling in several areas. In addition, the victim’s clothes were covered in blood, detailing the extent of the harm caused by Heart. Also, the Hex founder allegedly committed tax fraud, failing to observe a mandatory duty that was important in assessing his taxes. The report claimed that Heart received income from his business but failed to file taxes for multiple years. “Schueler failed to file business tax returns for the tax multiple years and also failed to complete information on his income on his pre-filled personal tax returns. Schueler received income from his business or income-generating activities that he should have declared to the Tax Administration for tax assessment,” the report said. The report further revealed that the Hex founder avoided hundreds of millions in taxes between June 2020 and April 2024. The Red Notice comes three months after Finnish authorities released an order to remand him. According to a detective in Helsinki, Heart’s income reporting did not match the estimates of the tax service. Heart has remained active on social media.

The regulator took him to court over the alleged offering of three unregistered products, Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and Pulse (PLSX). Although the Hex founder had previously asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, the SEC claimed it had the authority to act. According to the SEC, Heart raised more than $1 billion through the sale of unregistered crypto products. The complaint mentioned that Heart told investors that the tokens would provide a way for them to achieve wealth.

In one of the more bizarre twists of Afghanistan’s post-2021 collapse, these guys are reportedly trading memecoins, specifically Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), proving that hypocrisy and hustle know no bounds. Afghanistan’s economy has been a disaster since the Taliban took over in August 2021. With $7 billion in central bank reserves frozen by the U.S. and international sanctions isolating the country, the financial system is a shadow of its former self. Banks barely function, and liquidity is almost non-existent. Afghans turned to crypto as an alternative, but by 2024, the Taliban banned it outright. Taliban trades Shiba Inu and Dogecoin while enforcing crypto bans In the documentary, one Taliban member admitted to profiting from SHIB but complained he lost it all by “buying high and selling low.” Another bragged about his Dogecoin flips. The Taliban’s social media nickname, “Talibros,” captures this contradiction. While the group cracks down on crypto for ordinary citizens, its members allegedly trade it under the radar. This duality has raised eyebrows globally, exposing the gap between what they preach and what they do. Afghanistan ranked 20th on Chainalysis’s Crypto Adoption Index in 2021, largely because crypto provided a way for citizens to survive amid the economic collapse. By press time though, the country’s rank has tanked. The Taliban’s ban destroyed local crypto activity, shutting down exchanges and arresting traders. Crypto c rackdown wrecks Afghanistan’s financial lifeline In the beginning, cryptos were tolerated because they allowed Afghans to bypass banking restrictions and sanctions. Families used crypto wallets to receive remittances, while local apps like HesabPay flourished. This stopped once the Taliban decided crypto was apparently out of step with Islamic finance principles, though there is nothing anywhere that proves that and the claim itself makes no sense. In mid-2024, the Taliban shut down at least 16 exchanges in the Herat province, arresting operators and confiscating funds. Traders were labeled criminals, and the government insisted crypto trading was forbidden. Officials claimed cryptocurrencies facilitated gambling and scams, which they said hurt everyday Afghans. The central bank called crypto “haram,” but critics argue the Taliban’s true motivation was control. Decentralized currencies threaten the Taliban’s grip on Afghanistan’s fragile economy. As for the citizens, the impact has been brutal. All signs point to an even worse economic situation next year. Weirdly enough, the Taliban has also been getting pretty chummy with Russia’s President, Vlad Putin. As we reported before, they asked him for an invitation to the October BRICS annual summit he hosted in Kazan. He didn’t, but reports now say he has partnered with them to “fight against terrorism.” Ironically, Putin has also removed them from his country’s list of terrorists. Some economists believe the Taliban might even try to get Afghanistan to join the BRICS, even if it is as a partner country. It remains to be seen how India, and specifically China and will would react to that. Russia seems down though.

Two contenders have recently caught the spotlight Cardano (ADA), a well-established blockchain focused on research-driven development, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a newcomer blending artificial intelligence with blockchain at a rock-bottom presale price of $0.003. Which of these two stands a better chance of turning $100 into $10,000 within just three months? Let’s compare their technology, growth potential, and market positioning to see which one could deliver astronomical returns in a short time frame. Cardano (ADA) Steady Climber with Strong Fundamentals Cardano, often praised as a first-rate blockchain spot, is famous for its peer-checked way, Proof of Stake (PoS) agreement and promise to growth and long lasting. These traits have made it a key part of the crypto world, pulling in backers who care about long-term safety and careful growth. Though Cardano is a trustworthy and good project, its slow rise and bi͏gger market cap make quick short-term wins less likely. In good market times, getting 2x or 3x back in a few months can happen, but making a 100x jump (changing $100 to $10,000) in just three months is very unlikely. Cardano’s slow speed works well for those who keep it long-term, but it’s not made for fast gains in little time. Lightchain AI (LCAI) AI-Powered Underdog with Massive Upside Lightchain AI is an exciting new project that’s taking things to the next level by integrating AI directly into its blockchain infrastructure. With its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), developers can create AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) that solve real-world issues in industries like healthcare, logistics, and finance. But what really sets it apart is its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, which rewards users for meaningful AI computations instead of just staking or mining. Now, let’s talk about the entry price and growth potential. During its presale, LCAI is priced at just $0.003—a ridiculously low starting point. Even a modest jump to $0.30 would mean a 100x return, taking a $100 investment and turning it into $10,000. With its cutting-edge technology and deflationary tokenomics (burning a portion of transaction fees), analysts and insiders are excited about where this token could go, especially with milestones like the testnet and mainnet launches on the horizon. Of course, no gains are ever guaranteed, but with its low market cap, innovative features, and tiny starting price, LCAI has a much better chance at short-term growth compared to larger tokens like Cardano. It’s worth keeping an eye on! Risk vs. Reward Which One Offers a Better Short-Term Bet? Cardano (ADA) offers several advantages, including stable and proven technology, a large community, and a well-regarded team. However, its large market cap and slower organic growth make it less likely to deliver extraordinary short-term gains, such as 100x returns within three months. On the other hand, Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents an entirely different opportunity. With an extremely low entry price, groundbreaking AI integration, deflationary tokenomics, and massive upside potential, LCAI appeals to those seeking high-risk, high-reward investments. That said, it comes with challenges as an early-stage project, including higher risk and a less established community and ecosystem. For short-term speculators aiming to turn $100 into $10,000 in just three months, Lightchain AI’s risk-reward profile is more compelling. While such dramatic growth is far from guaranteed, LCAI’s low price, innovative technology, and potentially explosive narrative make it well-suited to attract market enthusiasm and rapid price appreciation. Smart Short-Term Play Cardano remains a stellar option for long-term investors who value security and steady progress. However, if your goal is to chase exponential gains in a short timeframe, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is the altcoin to watch. Its combination of innovative AI-blockchain fusion, ultra-low presale price , and deflationary model offers a rare opportunity for extraordinary returns—potentially turning $100 into $10,000 faster than almost any established cryptocurrency on the market today. As always, high potential reward comes with higher risk. Do your due diligence, and only invest what you can afford to lose. But for those ready to embrace the next big trend and potentially reap life-changing returns, LCAI may be the ideal pick for the upcoming bull run.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. Conclusion Dogecoin, PEPE, and MOG have shown great potential, but XYZVerse stands out as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth.

The notice stems from allegations of tax fraud and physical assault, marking the latest chapter in a series of legal battles surrounding the controversial crypto figure. Allegations of Assault and Tax Evasion Finnish authorities are pursuing Richard Schueler for allegedly assaulting a 16-year-old and evading taxes over a four-year period, from June 2020 to April 2024. The European most-wanted fugitives list claims that Schueler physically attacked the minor by dragging them by their hair, knocking them to the ground in a stairwell. The Red Notice, issued globally, does not constitute an international arrest warrant but enables law enforcement to locate and provisionally detain Schueler. This development comes three months after Finnish authorities initially issued a remand order on September 13. Detective Harri Saaristola of Helsinki Police disclosed to Finnish broadcaster Yle that discrepancies in Schueler’s reported income raised red flags. Despite the allegations, Richard Schueler has remained publicly silent on the matter, continuing his social media activity with cryptic remarks. On December 21, he posted on X: “If the haters really wanted to get me down, they could raise more than the $27M I did for medical research.” SEC Lawsuit Adds to Mounting Legal Pressure Beyond the Interpol notice, Schueler is embroiled in a $1 billion lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator accuses him of conducting unregistered offerings of three cryptocurrencies: Hex, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX). According to the SEC, Richard Schueler raised over $1 billion through these offerings, promoting them as a path to extraordinary wealth for investors. In August, Schueler sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but the SEC pushed back, asserting its authority to pursue the case. The mounting legal challenges are casting a shadow over Schueler’s crypto ventures, which once garnered attention for their audacious promises of financial independence. However, critics have long questioned the legitimacy of Hex and its associated projects, further intensifying scrutiny.

From the victory of Donald Trump to the mass adoption of this technology by the world’s makers, the cryptocurrency market is making a significant impact each day. Moreover, with the market shifting from Bitcoin season to the altcoin season, the volatility in the crypto space has skyrocketed during December 2024. With top altcoins crossing the beyond-affordability level, the crypto market has many undervalued gems. CoinPedia’s expert panel has dedicated itself to finding such gems. Reportedly, these tokens are much easier to invest in and have a high possibility of experiencing a meteoric rise in a short period. Gala (GALA) The gem of the Web3 ecosystem, the Gala project is a standard Layer-1 application. With a motive to empower the gaming industry, this ecosystem has dedicated itself to becoming the first billion-user application in the world of blockchain. TradingView: GALA/USDT Despite recording a negative price action over the past few days, the Gala token has maintained a strong bullish price action in the longer time frame. This makes it a fundamentally strong project. With a highly anticipated altseason in 2025, the Gala price is projected to retest its major resistance level of $0.30, making it a potential 8X project for the upcoming time. Bonk (BONK) One of the best-performing memecoins of the Solana ecosystem, the Bonk price continues to play a vital role. By trading at a discount of ~50% from its ATH of $0.00005916, the BONK memecoin is currently undergoing a bearish price action. TradingView: BONK/USDT However, considering the historic price rise, this memecoin has always achieved a new all-time high during the altcoin market after recording a major price correction during the Bitcoin season. The BONK coin price is expected to achieve a new high during the upcoming crypto bull run. This makes this project a top pick for this list. Jasmy Coin (JASMY) Built on the Ethereum ecosystem, the Jasmy Coin is a project based on the Internet of Things, a Tokyo-based provider. To restore and protect individual data by combining IoT technology with blockchain technology and giving its users full control over their personal information, the JASMY price has significant attention. TradingView: JASMY/USDT By constantly recording a higher high, Jasmy Coin’s price has formed a strong bullish price action in the weekly time frame. This highlights a high possibility of this crypto project heading toward its target price of $0.10. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) This crypto project is the leading community memecoin on the BNB chain. Notably, the Baby Doge was created as a joke to help spread awareness of animal adoption. By giving more than £81,000 worth of dog food, BabyDoge is the only meme with an official world record for saving dogs. TradingView: BABYDOGE/USDT Notably, this meme coin has been highly volatile since its inception, highlighting a strong price action for it in the crypto space. With a successful listing on the top cryptocurrency exchanges around the globe, the BABYDOGE price is highly undervalued at this point. With a potential surge, this project may cut 1 – 2 zeros this bull run. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The second largest memecoin by market capitalization, the SHIB price has regained momentum by adding over 130% in 2024. With the SHIB burn program, this memecoin eyes to achieve a new high this AltSeason. TradingView: SHIB/USDT The MACD indicator continues recording a bullish price action despite the ongoing memecoin market correction. However, the Shiba Inu price is currently trading at a discount of 72.39% from its ATH of $0.00008845, making it a potential token for the top 10 list. Reserve Rights (RSR) Built as an “ERC-20” token, the Reserve protocol serves two main purposes, staking and governance. Notably, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token was launched in May 2019 after the successful Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) on the Huobi Prime cryptocurrency platform. TradingView: RSR/USDT The technical indicators are recording an increase in volatility, indicating a rise in the buying and selling pressure for this altcoin. Notably, in the longer time frame, a bullish rise can be recorded, highlighting a positive outlook. An increase in the adoption process of the Ethereum ecosystem could push the value of this ERC-20 token toward a new ATH during 2025. Under an optimistic outlook, the Reserve Rights price may reach as high as $0.05 if the market favors the bulls. Flare (FLR) Built as an EVM-based layer 1 project, it aims to make blockchain more efficient by giving developers decentralized access to high-integrity data across various chains. Moreover, with a monetization model, its native token FLR acts as a mode of payment. TradingView: FLR/USDT Taking into consideration a strong bullish reversal, the Flare price may hit a new high. Notably, the altcoin is anticipated to surpass its present ATH of $0.0797 and head toward its prolonged price target of $0.10. BitTorrent (BTT) BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing platform with a decentralized application. Launched in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by blockchain platform TRON in July 2018. Following this, BTT was launched on the TRON blockchain, using its TRC-10 application. TradingView: BTT/USDT With the growing cryptocurrency space, the altcoin market is projected to gain significant traction in the coming months. This could result in the BTT coin price heading toward a new all-time high in 2025. Mode (MODE) Mode cryptocurrency project is a modular Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Layer-2 project. The primary task of this project is to use the OP stack and part of the Optimism superchain. It is used to foster growth and to adopt blockchain applications. Currently trading at a discount of ~67% from its ATH of $0.1177, the MODE price has been the attention of the cryptocurrency market with its impressive comeback. With a bullish reversal, this ecosystem may smash its present high and achieve a new one. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) Built on the Ethereum chain, this meme coin Layer-2 (L2) blockchain. With an aim to provide speed, security, efficiency, and lower transaction fees, its native token “PEPU” is used across the ecosystem as the mode of payment. Notably, this meme coin takes its inspiration from the “PEPE” token. By trading at a discount of ~72% from its ATH of $0.06858, the memecoin project has the potential to 10X in the upcoming time.

This relationship hints that Bitcoin could experience a steep drop to $20,000, an almost 80% plunge from its current valuation, according to an analysis by financial commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter in an X post on December 21. Historically, Bitcoin prices have exhibited a lagged correlation with the global money supply, typically trailing by approximately 10 weeks. The entity stated that this trend aligns with the recent peak in the supply, which hit a record $108.5 trillion in October before falling by $4.1 trillion to $104.4 trillion as of December, the lowest level since August. Bitcoin and Global money supply correlation chart. Source: Joe Consorti Notably, the decline coincides with Bitcoin’s recent retreat, which saw the cryptocurrency face the threat of plunging below $90,000 . “If the relationship still holds, this suggests that Bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin’s red-hot run may take a pause,” the platform noted. The analysis noted that Bitcoin’s valuation may decline if this historical relationship persists. Fate of Bitcoin price correlation with M2 At the same time, in an X post on December 18, Bitcoin custody firm Theya’s head of growth, Joe Consorti, noted that investors should anticipate two possible outcomes with the two continuing to show correlation. Consorti suggested Bitcoin could decouple from this pattern, driven by strong demand within its ecosystem. He also warned that tightening liquidity could lead to a deep mid-cycle correction if the correlation persists. Elsewhere, Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision , highlighted Bitcoin’s correlation with global money supply as a key indicator of its future trajectory. In a late November post on X, Coutts projected the M2 money supply to exceed $127 trillion by 2025, an 18% increase driven by economic and monetary factors. He noted that Bitcoin has historically absorbed about 10% of new liquidity, suggesting the cryptocurrency could see substantial inflows during this period. Global money supply chart. Source: Jamie Coutts However, not all market players believe the M2 correlation with Bitcoin will dictate the digital currency’s price movement. An X user with the pseudonym CryptoAnarchyst argued that the money supply is no longer a key indicator for Bitcoin, as the market has shifted from retail-driven to institutional and derivative-led. The user stated that with the rise of exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), retirement funds, and corporations, the focus has moved away from traditional liquidity measures, and relying on M2 could lead to poor decision-making in the current market. Sooner you guys realize that M2 no longer matters, better is going to be for you guys. M2 mattered when the market was mostly direct retail driven. People had to have cash on hand to invest in Bitcoin… since ETFs came in, now retirement funds, corporations, derivatives, and… — 🇭🇷CryptoAnarchyst📈🚀🌚 (@CryptoAnarchyst) December 21, 2024 Correlation between global money supply and risk assets The global M2 supply measures total liquidity in the economy, including checking and savings accounts and other assets easily converted into cash. When global liquidity increases, central banks inject more money into the system by lowering interest rates or using quantitative easing, such as buying government bonds , often boosting investment in risk assets like Bitcoin. On the other hand, when liquidity contracts, risk assets like Bitcoin typically face downward pressure. Bitcoin’s fixed supply also makes it appealing as an alternative to central bank systems, further tying its price to changes in global liquidity. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $97,013 at press time, with daily losses of over 1%. On the weekly chart, BTC is down over 5%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

This is backed by Bitcoin trading above the 50-day simple moving average ($91,748) and the 200-day SMA ($70,040). Looking ahead, Bitcoin is facing major resistance at $100,000 for a chance to clinch another record high, with $95,000 serving as a strong support level worth watching in the short term.

Some community members on Twitter, such as @Xrp_goat, speculated that the transfer could be related to legal proceedings. “Ripple just paid the SEC,” they stated , referencing the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether XRP should be classified as a security. Another user, @Theannointedone, speculated that the funds might be directed toward former U.S. President Donald Trump, stating , “Right to Mr. Donald Trump.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s History with Large Transactions Ripple is no stranger to high-value transactions. The firm occasionally moves large amounts of XRP to fund operations and provide liquidity to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, or distribute tokens to strategic stakeholders. However, the lack of transparency regarding the recipient in this particular transaction has left room for debate and speculation. Market Impact At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.29, with a 1.09% price decrease over the last 24 hours. While large transactions like this often raise concerns about potential sell-offs, there is no direct evidence linking this transfer to market movements. However, investors and traders remain cautious, as significant transfers from Ripple’s wallets are sometimes perceived as signals of impending market activity. A s Ripple continues its activities amid regulatory challenges and market volatility, such high-profile transactions will likely remain a focal point for investors and analysts.

A large section is criticizing the move, saying that it undermines the ethos of cryptocurrency. With the debit card, users can spend directly from their Metamask wallets, simplifying crypto transactions. They can convert their crypto into fiat currency in real-time as they transact through Linea, a speedy layer-2 network from Ethereum. Disgruntled crypto stakeholders raise concerns The launch of the Metamask debit cards has raised serious concerns among crypto users . They argue that the card’s structure negates decentralization and financial freedom, key pillars of cryptocurrency. According to disgruntled crypto users, the card will box its users to traditional banking systems. Muna O., a crypto purist, asked, “Wasn’t the whole ethos of crypto to provide an alternative system to fiat?” while highlighting the contradiction. The partnership with Mastercard is seen as an attempt to undermine the autonomy on which cryptocurrency is premised. There are also concerns about security, more so with centralized systems. Johana Castellanos, a blockchain analyst, called for sophisticated security measures rather than relying on what is currently there. Johana pointed out that Metamask’s wallet has endured frequent attacks. The cost associated with the debit card has also been mentioned. There are fears that the percentage swap fee might be high, around 6 to 9%. Because the card will be unregulated, it will attract juicy fees for Metamask and Mastercard to reap while hurting the users, contrary to the promise of crypto. Metamask and Mastercard have high hopes for pilot program The rollout of the card in the US follows earlier rollouts in the EU, UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia with eligible currencies including USDC, USDT, and WETH. The Metamask card was promoted as a way to avoid the hustle of transferring cryptocurrency to a bank or centralized exchange before spending. The partnering entities argue that the card will boost the public adoption of cryptocurrency. On one hand, Metamask has robust security features to ensure the card is tamper-proof and difficult to hack. On the other, Mastercard has a wide merchant network, giving the card fast, cheaper and secure spending. Lorenzo Santos, Senior Product Manager at Consensys said, “ Metamask card pilot gives people more freedom to spend crypto. Metamask card represents a major step to removing the friction that has traditionally existed between the blockchain and real-world commerce.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Mastercard|MetaMask|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|USDT|WALLET|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-22 11:47:52

Currently trading at $3,38, Ethereum has shown resilience amidst market volatility, supported by trading volumes of $28.68 billion. Despite short-term bearish sentiment, two key models—the Block Subsidy Model and the Mayer Multiple—indicate that Ethereum could still achieve significant growth in this cycle, with price targets ranging from $7,200 to $11,433. Block Subsidy Model Highlights $11,433 Target The Block Subsidy Model evaluates Ethereum’s value relative to its thermocap, or the cost of production. Previous cycles revealed Ethereum’s highs reached multiples of its thermocap—64x in its first cycle and 32x in the second. If this diminishing returns trend continues, the current cycle’s peak is projected at 16x the thermocap. Ethereum Block Subsidy | Credit: Valdrin Tahiri/ Glassnode Currently trading between the 8x and 16x thermocap multiples, Ethereum has historically initiated its steepest growth phase upon breaking above the 8x level. Analysts calculate this level at $5,716, while the 16x multiple sits at $11,433. This model suggests Ethereum has ample room to grow, with the likelihood of setting new all-time highs during this cycle. Mayer Multiple Indicates Expansion Phase The Mayer Multiple tracks Ethereum’s price against its 200-day moving average (MA), using multipliers to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Previous cycles saw Ethereum’s peaks above the 2.4x multiplier and lows below the 0.8x multiplier. Ethereum Mayer Multiple | Credit: Glassnode ETH has already tested the 0.8x level twice during this cycle—in June 2022 and September 2024—mirroring patterns from previous cycles. The current 2.4x multiplier, set at $7,200, acts as a significant milestone. Should Ethereum follow historical trends, this level will serve as a benchmark for a new all-time high. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Short-Term Technical Outlook While long-term growth indicators remain positive, Ethereum ’s short-term outlook faces hurdles. A persistent downward trendline is capping bullish momentum near $3,400. This trendline intersects with a supply zone at $3,500 to $3,555, previously a support level but now acting as resistance. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Immediate support lies at $3,252, with additional levels at $3,097 and $2,940. Breaking above $3,555 could trigger bullish momentum, while a failure to breach this level might lead to further consolidation or declines. The RSI stands at 41, signaling a neutral-to-bearish sentiment. Key Insights: Resistance Levels: $3,555 supply zone and downward trendline limit immediate upside potential. Support Levels: Key support at $3,252, with further safety nets at $3,097 and $2,940. Long-Term Outlook: Models project Ethereum’s peak between $7,200 and $11,433. $BEST Wallet Raises Nearly $5.30M: Time-Sensitive Investment Opportunity Best Wallet is transforming the Web3 space by supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 11:53:00

However, the past week will be a quick one to forget for the crypto market, especially the altcoin, which declined in value by over 12%. While this price slump experienced by Ethereum has been linked to the US Federal Reserve rate cut, the recent drab performances of the spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could also be associated. After a lengthy spell of positive inflows, investor interest in the US-based ETH ETFs seems to be losing momentum. Spot ETH ETFs Snap 18-Day Positive Inflows Streak According to data from SoSoValue, the US-based spot Ethereum ETFs logged a total net outflow of $75.11 million on Friday, December 20. This marked the first time the Ethereum funds would be registering back-to-back negative performances. On Thursday, December 19, the Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded a total net outflow of $60 million. This single-day performance put an end to the ETH ETF’s 18-day streak of positive inflows and the first negative day in December for the products. Related Reading: XRP Could Be The Altcoin To Recover Quickly, CryptoQuant Analyst Explains Why Surprisingly, BlackRock’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker ETHA) was the only spot ETF that recorded outflows on Friday. According to market data from SoSoValue, the ETHA exchange-traded fund posted nearly $103.7 million to close the week. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (with the ticker FETH) recorded $12.95 million in net inflow on Friday. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Mini Trust (ETH) were the only other ETFs that registered positive inflows on the day, with $7.51 million and $8.10 million, respectively. These back-to-back days of negative performances saw a net $135 million flow out of the ETH exchange-traded funds in just two days in the past week. However, the crypto products finished with a weekly total net inflow — for the fourth consecutive week — of $62.73 million. Similarly, the spot Bitcoin ETFs appear to be losing interest from investors, as most funds recorded outflows to close the past week. The crypto products registered a daily net outflow of approximately $276 million on Friday. Ethereum Price As of this writing, the Ethereum price stands at around $3,342, reflecting a 2.4% decline in the past 24 hours. Given their impact on the value of ETH, it might be important for the spot ETFs to return to positive inflows if the Ethereum price is to see any relief.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changer in the digital world. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, it introduced smart contracts and a bustling ecosystem of decentralized apps. It’s moved to a Proof-of-Stake system, making it more energy-efficient. With Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, transactions are faster and cheaper. Ethereum also brought us ERC-20 tokens, which are used across many applications for things like governance and utility. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that keeps it all running, used for transactions, rewarding those who stake their coins, and acting as a valuable asset. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s future seems bright. The network plans to introduce sharding, which will make it even more scalable and reduce costs. Price predictions based on past trends suggest ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year and might not go lower than $2,700.31 in 2025. Compared to other coins, Ethereum stands out for its strong technology and active development. In the current market, with growing interest in decentralized finance and efficient blockchain solutions, ETH looks like a promising option. Its ongoing innovations and central role in the crypto ecosystem make it an attractive choice for many. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful twist on the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the lovable Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no cap on the total number. What started as a joke quickly gained a following, showcasing the power of community and social media in driving interest. In 2021, Dogecoin captured global attention as its value skyrocketed. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, it surged into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. Technologically, Dogecoin offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some of its peers, making it appealing for everyday use. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin remains notable for its strong community support and widespread recognition. While its abundant supply contrasts with the scarcity of coins like Bitcoin, its accessibility and enthusiastic following keep it in the conversation amid current market trends. XRP (XRP) Meet XRP, a cryptocurrency designed to revolutionize how we transfer money across the globe. Built on the XRP Ledger, XRP is a digitally native, programmable currency that’s fast, low-cost, and open to everyone. It operates without a central authority, making transactions irreversible and secure. This means you can send money anywhere in the world without needing a bank account, and without worrying about censorship or counterfeiting. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion tokens, with 80 billion gifted to Ripple for further development. XRP aims to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies, reflecting its name derived from “ripple credits.” Ripple, initially known as OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled release. In the current market cycle, XRP stands out for its potential to transform international payments with its speed and efficiency. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP offers faster transaction times and lower fees, making it attractive for both individuals and financial institutions. As the crypto market evolves, XRP’s focus on real-world utility could position it favorably among its peers. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is making waves in the world of cryptocurrency. It’s a platform designed for creating smart contracts, which are like digital agreements that work without middlemen. Cardano’s own cryptocurrency is called ADA. People use ADA to store value, make payments, and even earn more by supporting the network. What’s exciting is that ADA is seen as a rival to Ethereum’s ETH because it offers similar benefits but aims to be more efficient. One thing that sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. Instead of using lots of energy like some other cryptocurrencies, Cardano uses a method called proof-of-stake, which is much kinder to the planet. The platform is also divided into two layers, which helps it process many transactions quickly—some say up to a million per second! In today’s market, with a growing focus on sustainability and speed, ADA looks very attractive. As more people look for greener options in crypto, Cardano’s ADA might be the coin to watch. Conclusion Though ETH, DOGE, XRP, and ADA hold promising prospects, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth through a community-driven ecosystem.

The exchange predicted via its official X handle that XRP will make history in 2025, generating substantial interest within the cryptocurrency community. While Bitstamp did not provide specifics for the prediction, it is renowned as the cryptocurrency industry’s longest-operating exchange, and several positive developments in the short and long-term support this overwhelmingly bullish outlook. $XRP gonna make history next year — Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) December 20, 2024 Reasons to Be Bullish On XRP One of the biggest reasons to be bullish about XRP is Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. The excitement following his historic win sent the crypto market to new heights. Bitcoin has crossed $100k for the first time, and XRP hit its highest point since 2018. Notably, XRP reached its all-time high in January 2018 during Trump’s last administration , and the market is excited about how high it can go next year. There are also many other positive developments in the crypto market to be excited about. These include the anticipated conclusion of Ripple’s ongoing legal proceedings and the possible introduction of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is well known for his anti-crypto stance, but he is leaving his position on January 20. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Donald Trump has already nominated Paul Atkins to replace him, and experts believe the SEC, under Atkins’ pro-crypto administration, will end the lawsuits against Ripple and other cryptocurrency companies. Multiple companies have also filed for XRP ETFs. However, the SEC revealed that it will not approve any ETFs under the current administration. XRP’s Journey to A New All-time High The digital asset’s price trajectory has demonstrated notable volatility over the past few years. After establishing its current all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018, XRP experienced a significant decline, reaching $0.1151 by March 2020. At press time, XRP traded at $2.23, 41.51% below its all-time high, and many experts are confident it will close this gap and surpass it significantly. Recent market activity has shown promising signs of recovery, and JD (@jaydee_757), a prominent crypto analyst, responded to Bitstamp’s post, noting that 95% of investors will lose out on massive gains in the current cycle. Analysts are already setting lofty targets with some going into double and triple digits , but investors have to take profits wisely so they don’t lose out on life-changing gains.

It also highlighted opportunities that institutions could explore to adapt to the evolving practices in the crypto industry. The survey included participation from more than 15 institutional players, with intermediaries, investment funds, and venture capital funds making up 46%, 31%, and 23% of the respondents, respectively. It is worth mentioning that intermediaries in this context refer to companies that manage assets on behalf of others, while institutions as a whole are those with large total value locked. Trends Affecting Institutional Crypto Strategies According to the results sent to CryptoPotato , 33.4% of respondents said the biggest challenge faced by their company is integrating new crypto yield products aligned with their risk tolerance. Another 13.3% revealed that regulatory compliance affects their ability to incorporate new products in their offerings. Additionally, 6.67% of the participants said it is difficult to find the right strategy for allocating crypto assets, while another 6.67% disclosed that integrating multiple yield solutions at a go has been a big challenge. Interestingly, 6.67% of the respondents attributed their biggest challenge to custodians limiting product functionality, while the remaining 33.29% mentioned other challenges not outlined in the report. P2P.org identified risk as a recurring theme during the interviews, and it was mentioned across multiple levels, including technology, operations, and regulation. For technology, the respondents insisted that smart contracts pose a risk to their organization’s security and reliability. Challenges In Operations and Regulation In operations, the surveyees explained how certain blockchain mechanics could affect the movement of funds across industries. For instance, withdrawing funds from staked tokens could make the assets unavailable for some time, limiting how quickly capital can be redeployed to other business areas. When it came to regulation, the participants disclosed that one of their biggest challenges was integrating a new product that was in line with the regulatory guidelines for their business region. “The involvement of legal and compliance team here is critical to assess the exact risk factor. As reported in one of the interview, failing to correctly assess the regulatory layer can affect the resources allocated to a new product initiative, which might later be deemed unacceptable by regulatory authorities,” P2P.org stated. With regulatory requirements posing a significant challenge, these institutions are facing limitations in product integration and innovation.

The license was granted under the Banking Act (KWG) and DekaBank will be joining Commerzbank as one of the only traditional German banks to operate in this space. But let’s not get too excited—this is Germany, after all, where regulation is the order of the day, and every action is measured. While BaFin has granted crypto custody licenses to 11 other firms, most of those have gone to crypto-native companies, like the digital asset custody arm of Hauck Aufhäuser Lampe Privatbank. DekaBank’s license game is strong What makes DekaBank and Commerzbank stand out is that their licenses fall under traditional banking regulations, giving them a level of legitimacy that smaller crypto firms can only dream of. This isn’t DekaBank’s first big regulatory decision this year. Back in July, it snagged a license to operate as a crypto securities registrar. Translation? It can issue blockchain-based digital securities in Germany without needing a central securities depository (CSD). This cuts out unnecessary middlemen, a very crypto thing to do. DekaBank is also a founding member of SWIAT, a blockchain platform designed for digital securities issuance. It’s got giants like Standard Chartered and LBBW involved. Back in September, Siemens used SWIAT to issue a €300 million digital bond. Germany’s regulatory speed bump The Supervision of Crypto Markets Act (KMAG) is supposed to replace Germany’s old crypto rules with MiCA’s shiny new framework. But because the German government has been a political circus lately, the law was delayed for months. It only passed on December 18, giving institutions like DekaBank the green light to expand their crypto operations across the EU. Before KMAG’s passage, the regulatory limbo made things awkward for banks. Germany’s slow but steady approach to crypto regulation has its perks, though. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial instruments. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. While other countries are still fumbling with vague guidelines, Germany’s clarity on crypto rules makes it a heavyweight in the European crypto scene. Admittedly, it is boring, but it works. Germany’s crypto regulation is pretty much MiCA. But in the country, crypto held for over a year is exempt from capital gains tax, offering a major incentive for long-term investors. However, if you sell within a year, the profits face regular income tax rates, which can hit up to 45%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge. There’s some relief for smaller players, though—profits below €600 escape taxation entirely. As for the market, it’s very active. Out of 2,400 private crypto investors surveyed, 54% said they allocate more than 20% of their total assets to digital assets. On average, these investors are putting over a quarter of their portfolios into crypto. Security concerns are still top of mind, though. About 82% of investors flagged platform security as their number-one consideration when choosing where to invest. It’s no surprise that Bitcoin leads the pack, held by 91% of respondents, followed by Ethereum at 78%. Solana, a rising star, is also gaining traction. The German market has had its share of drama this year too though. The most significant episode was probably when the government unloaded a massive 49,858 BTC for $2.89 billion—leftovers from a piracy case.

Qubetics Might Be December’s Best Way to Turn Things Around,https://thecoinrise.com/regretting-not-jumping-on-binance-early-qubetics-might-be-decembers-best-way-to-turn-things-around/,"Remember Binance’s early days? It wasn’t always the crypto powerhouse it is now. Back in 2017, its ICO offered BNB tokens for what now feels like pocket change. Fast forward, and Binance has grown into a global phenomenon, leaving those who hesitated wondering what could’ve been. Stories like these sting, don’t they? They’re a harsh reminder of the power of early action in crypto and how waiting too long can mean losing out. But here’s the good news: missed chances don’t have to define your future. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project with its sights set on revolutionising the crypto space. Its presale is creating a stir among investors, offering a rare opportunity to get in early on something that blends innovation with usability. If Binance’s success is any indicator, projects like Qubetics could be the next chapter in your crypto journey. Qubetics Presale Could Be the Big Opportunity You’re Looking For If you didn’t make the whitelist for Qubetics, you missed out on a $0.01 entry point reserved for a lucky few. And as the presale moved through its early stages, prices stayed incredibly low, rewarding those who acted fast. But it’s not all bad news—you still have time to get in on the action. The Qubetics presale is now in its 13th stage, with tokens priced at $0.0342. Here’s how it works: each presale stage lasts seven days, ending every Sunday at midnight, with a 10% price increase kicking in as soon as the new stage starts. So far, over $7.4 million has been raised, more than 365 million tokens have been sold, and 11,100+ holders are already on board. That’s a lot of people betting on Qubetics becoming the next big thing. Why the buzz? It’s all about the QubeQode IDE , a development environment that’s making blockchain tech accessible to everyone. Imagine you’re a small business looking to integrate blockchain for better transaction security. Instead of hiring an expensive team of developers, you could use QubeQode’s drag-and-drop tools to add features like token management or data storage to your application. Even startups and enterprises are finding value here. The form-based configuration lets users customise smart contract logic with zero coding experience. And for developers, the code snippet library offers a collection of pre-written blockchain solutions, saving time and cutting costs. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a freelancer, or a large-scale operation, Qubetics provides tools that are practical and forward-thinking. How Binance’s ICO Paved the Way for Its Success Binance wasn’t always a household name in crypto. Back in 2017, its ICO sold BNB tokens at $0.11 each. Fast forward a few years, and Binance has become one of the most influential players in the space, building an ecosystem that includes an exchange, a launchpad, and even its own blockchain. At its all-time high, BNB rewarded early investors with mind-blowing returns, proving that taking calculated risks in crypto can pay off in a big way. But the road wasn’t always smooth. Binance faced challenges like regulatory scrutiny and stiff competition, yet it continued to innovate and expand. Those who got in early and held on reaped the benefits, while those who hesitated were left wishing they hadn’t. The lesson here is simple: success in crypto often favours those who act early. Binance’s journey shows how a strong vision combined with the right timing can turn a modest investment into something life-changing. And now, Qubetics offers a chance to apply those lessons to a new, promising project. Act Now Before This Opportunity Slips Away Regret over missed chances like Binance doesn’t have to linger forever. Qubetics is here, offering a fresh start for those ready to act. The presale is in full swing, and the clock is ticking on the 13th stage . With each week bringing a price increase, waiting could mean paying more or missing out entirely. If you’re ready to take control of your crypto journey, now’s the time to make a move. Qubetics is proving that early action can set the stage for future success, just like Binance did years ago. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by.

From Solana’s incredible recovery to Polkadot’s cutting-edge advancements, blockchain technology is evolving at lightning speed. Amid these developments, Qubetics is emerging as a revolutionary project with a record-breaking presale and a focus on solving blockchain’s most pressing challenges. While Solana and Polkadot continue to dominate conversations about scalability and multi-chain ecosystems, Qubetics is carving its niche with innovative solutions and real-world applications. With $7 million raised in its ongoing presale, it’s quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now for investors and developers alike. Let’s dive into what makes these three projects game-changers in the blockchain world. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Scalability Qubetics is much more than a cryptocurrency; it’s a comprehensive blockchain platform designed to tackle some of the most persistent challenges in the digital economy, including scalability, security, and interoperability . These attributes position Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy now, whether you’re looking for short-term gains or long-term innovation. A Presale for the Record Books In its 13th stage, the Qubetics presale has raised over $7.4 million, sold more than 365 million $TICS tokens, and attracted more than 11,100 holders. At a price of $0.0342 per token, the clock is ticking before a 10% price hike kicks in at the weekend. Analysts are making bold predictions: $0.25 by the presale’s end (630% ROI), $1 post-presale (2,820% ROI), and $15 following the mainnet launch (a staggering 43,711% ROI). Imagine investing $60,000 today at $0.0342 per token. That investment could grow to $438,450 at $0.25, balloon to $1,753,800 at $1, and reach an eye-popping $26,307,000 at $15. These numbers highlight why Qubetics($TICS) is capturing the attention of savvy investors. Why Scalability Matters Scalability is the backbone of blockchain technology, and Qubetics is leading the charge. For businesses, scalability means being able to handle thousands of transactions per second without network congestion or skyrocketing fees. Picture a global retailer using Qubetics to process real-time payments across multiple continents without breaking a sweat. For professionals and developers, scalability opens doors for building dApps that can cater to millions of users simultaneously. Imagine a healthcare platform managing patient data across various jurisdictions in seconds or an e-commerce giant enabling seamless cross-border payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. Qubetics’ focus on scalability isn’t just technical jargon—it’s the key to unlocking blockchain’s full potential for individuals, businesses, and industries. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain Solana has made a name for itself as one of the fastest blockchains in the world. With its lightning-quick transaction speeds and low fees, it’s no wonder Solana has become a favourite among developers and investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now. After weathering a storm following the FTX collapse, Solana has roared back to life with a staggering 2,100% rebound. This isn’t just a price story—it’s a testament to the strength of its ecosystem. From decentralised finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Solana continues to attract projects that demand speed and efficiency. Bitwise’s introduction of a staking ETP for Solana, offering a 6.48% yield, signals growing institutional interest in the blockchain. These developments are boosting Solana’s credibility and attracting more investors looking for stable, high-yield opportunities in the crypto space. Solana’s ability to handle thousands of transactions per second has made it a go-to platform for developers building dApps that require scale and speed. Whether it’s gaming, DeFi, or payments, Solana’s ecosystem is thriving, and its future looks brighter than ever. Polkadot: The King of Interoperability Polkadot is often referred to as the “blockchain of blockchains,” and for good reason. Its innovative parachain system allows different blockchains to communicate and share data seamlessly, making it a pioneer in interoperability. Polkadot’s upcoming 2.0 upgrade promises to make its parachain system even more application-centric. Developers will have more tools to create dApps that combine Polkadot’s interoperability with Ethereum’s smart contract functionality. This positions Polkadot as one of the best cryptos to buy now for developers and businesses looking to build scalable, multi-chain applications. Polkadot’s ecosystem is more than just a concept—it’s actively solving real-world problems. From supply chain tracking to cross-border payments, Polkadot’s technology is being used to create more efficient systems across industries. Its focus on interoperability ensures that businesses don’t have to choose one blockchain over another—they can have it all. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Solana and Polkadot are giants in the blockchain world, each excelling in their niches. Solana’s focus on speed and low costs has made it a favourite for developers and investors alike, while Polkadot’s leadership in interoperability ensures it remains a key player in the multi-chain future. But Qubetics is the new contender that’s turning heads. With its record-breaking presale, innovative solutions like scalability-focused architecture, and incredible ROI potential, Qubetics is more than just a token—it’s a vision for the future of blockchain. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project. Visit Qubetics’ presale page today and secure your $TICS tokens before the price hike. With $7.4 million already raised, the best cryptos to buy now don’t wait—and neither should you!

At $0.00036, a simple $500 investment in Dogecoin in 2014 would be worth an impressive $1,017,870. Although the history of Dogecoin shows the promise of cryptocurrencies, investors are now looking at other options, such as Rexas Finance (RXS), a $0.15 token sold during its continuous presale. With forecasts of a 250,000% increase, RXS might match the legendary returns of Dogecoin, thereby presenting the next major prospect for crypto enthusiasts. Crypto Whales Purchased RXS Token Dogecoin’s Journey: From Meme Coin to Multi-Million Dollar Asset Originally shown as a fun crypto in 2013, Dogecoin gained major popularity only in 2017. After its launch, DOGE's price hovered at $0.00036 for a number of years, yielding not very significant increases. Early on in the 2017 bitcoin bull market, there was a first notable price surge. March saw a 1,494% surge in Dogecoin, which peaked at $0.004 and dropped to $0.001 in the following months. Driven by a flood of hopeful investors, DOGE rebuilt momentum in late 2017 and by January 2018 it had reached $0.018. However, with celebrities like Tesla CEO Elon Musk sponsoring Dogecoin, its most important turning point came in 2021. In just five months, DOGE rose astonishingly 9,484% from $0.0046 in January to an all-time high of $0.74 in May. This climb reaffirmed Dogecoin's place as the top cryptocurrency and made more than $1 million out of a $500 investment in 2014. Rexas Finance (RXS): The DOGE Alternative Although Dogecoin offers historical returns, many investors are now looking at substitutes that can provide similar or even better chances for development. As the crypto market develops and competition rises, spotting tokens with good foundations and development potential is difficult. Rexas Finance (RXS) and other newly developed tokens are positioned as the future generation of investment-worthy cryptocurrencies. RXS draws in savvy investors with its inventive use case and presale price of $0.15. Because of their low entrance prices and a great capacity for expansion, analysts believe early-stage projects like Rexas Finance are most likely to yield Dogecoin-level profits. The new cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), provides unmatched access to tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), transforming asset management. With the platform, users may tokenize and trade assets, including intellectual property, art, and real estate, offering countless investment prospects. Using its innovative methodology, RXS meets the growing need for democratized ownership and asset liquidity in the worldwide financial system. Reflecting great investor trust, Rexas Finance has already raised $29.32 million in its tenth presale stage. Priced at $0.15, RXS offers early investors a great prospect, particularly considering its expected listing price of $0.20. Early attendees have already observed a 5x increase in value from the first presale stage, suggesting the coin's explosive potential. Can Rexas Finance (RXS) Do The Same? Because of its unique value proposition, market observers think Rexas Finance could surpass several current cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which mostly depends on community support and market sentiment, RXS presents an actual use case that attracts institutional and retail investors. Experts estimate that RXS might yield more than 250,000% returns, matching or surpassing the 203,474% increase in Dogecoin since 2014. Furthermore, fueling investor interest is Rexas Finance's $1 million gift. The platform is fast growing its community by enrolling over 558,000 people for the competition. Investors must accomplish particular requirements, hold at least $100 worth of RXS tokens, and promote people to the initiative to be eligible for the giveaway, guaranteeing broad involvement. Rexas Finance is exciting as it gets ready for its official introduction. The token's creative use case and appealing presale pricing help make it a top candidate for good returns. However, it is yet unknown if RXS can match Dogecoin's explosive rise; its strong foundations and investor interest point to a promising future. Rexas Finance is an appealing option for individuals who want to profit from the next major crypto prospect. Given its emphasis on actual asset tokenization and past presale success, RXS could be the DOGE alternative investors have been looking for.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 848,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical trends, Ethereum should soon bottom out against the top crypto asset by market cap. According to Cowen, ETH/BTC will rise sometime in early 2025 no matter how the crypto king fares against the US dollar. “Think about this: historically, ETH/BTC bottoms out either in December or January. It’s already December [22nd]. My guess? ETH stays weak against Bitcoin, probably for the rest of the year. It doesn’t mean you can’t have a green week – but it’s probably going to stay weak for the rest of the year, maybe early January, and then I would expect ETH/BTC to start moving up in 2025, regardless of the direction of BTC/USD.” Cowen goes on to note that also based on previous market cycles, 2025 should be a good year for ETH/BTC in terms of quarterly returns. “2022 Q1 and Q2 were red, then you had Q3 and Q4 [that] were green. The only other quarter that ETH/BTC has been green besides the second half of 2022 for the last three years was Q2 2024… But what do you notice about 2021? ETH/BTC was green. What do you notice about 2017? At least ETH/BTC was green in the first half, it was red in the second half but then it was green in 2018 as well. So I would argue as quarterly returns go, you’re probably going to see more green for ETH/BTC in 2025 and maybe even early 2026.” ETH/BTC is valued at 0.03444 ($3,343.71) at time of writing.

According to the analyst's estimate, the BTC price could be at $ 120,000 in two months. Peterson bases this estimate on ETF fund flows in the US. However, he also stated that the model he used was a partially conservative estimate and 80% of the time the price was higher than the estimate. According to Peterson, for the Bitcoin price to reach $120,000, fund flows would need to increase by 27% to $46 billion, an increase of $10 billion. He argues that with current growth rates, this amount could be reached within 60 days.

At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at $97,000 and has lost approximately 5% of its value in the last week. *This is not investment advice.

It’s a rollercoaster that leaves many investors frustrated. You throw $100 into a so-called “moonshot” coin, dreaming of millionaire status, but instead, you wake up as just another bag-holder. So, how do you avoid burning your cash? Smart decisions, folks. Here’s a rundown of meme coin flops that failed to deliver and one underdog that’s stealing the spotlight. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Sliding on Thin Ice Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT ecosystem, made a splash on launch but quickly sank. A jaw-dropping 51% drop in just 24 hours slashed its market cap from $4 million to $2 million. Popcat (POPCAT): Clawing Its Way Down Inspired by the viral “Popcat” meme, Popcat (POPCAT) was all hype, no substance. Within a month, it fell 47%, losing 19% in a week and 8% in a single day, with trading volume shrinking by 11%. DOGS Token (DOGS): Barking Up the Wrong Tree Launched on the TON blockchain to leverage Telegram’s massive user base, DOGS Token (DOGS) is struggling to stay afloat. Its price plummeted 33% in 30 days, with a 7% daily drop and declining market cap. Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT): Declawed and Declining Despite its nostalgic charm and animal welfare focus, Simon’s Cat Token ($CAT) couldn’t escape the meme coin curse. Over the past month, it dropped 25%, shedding 2.9% in a week and a brutal 27% in 24 hours, with trading volume down 40%. These animals are not cutting it anymore. The meme coin market is turning into a zoo. It’s a tired concept that’s lost its spark. Every new coin looks like a clone of the last, offering nothing fresh or exciting. In this overcrowded jungle of meme coins, one project is standing out by ditching the furry trend altogether. A fresh concept is drawing the spotlight, shining with something beyond the same old gimmicks. XYZVerse +1,233%—And This Champion is Just Warming Up Among a bunch of creepy animals, $XYZ brings something new to the table . It is the first ever all-sports meme coin rewriting the playbook with its relentless drive and competitive spirit, much like the athletes who inspire it. XYZVerse forms an ecosystem designed for champions , bringing together sports fans, gamers, and crypto enthusiasts under one vibrant banner. Currently in presale, $XYZ is already scoring big: Launch Price: $0.0001 Current Price: $0.001333 ( +1233% ) Final Stage Target: $0.1—an unbelievable 99,900% surge if achieved. XYZVerse is Heating Up, and This is Your Chance to Get in Early Why $XYZ Is Gaining Traction What’s fueling this explosive growth ? It’s simple: community, vision, and results. The XYZVersers, a rapidly growing base of supporters, are the lifeblood of the project. Unlike many meme coins that rely on fleeting hype, $XYZ is already delivering tangible progress, thanks to its presale strategy and ambitious roadmap. The project’s foundation is rock-solid. $XYZ is redefining the meme coin market with a concept that blends sports culture with cutting-edge crypto technology . This isn’t another coin trying to cash in on a trend; it’s creating an entirely new playbook. Ambitious Plans Backed by Action $XYZ’s roadmap doesn’t stop at a clever theme. The project is built to deliver long-term value: Major Exchange Listings: Aiming for global visibility and accessibility. Staking and Passive Rewards: Giving holders more reasons to stay engaged. Scalability on Polygon: Fast, efficient, and low-cost transactions. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with sports media outlets and exclusive digital creators to amplify its reach. These are calculated steps to ensure $XYZ has the staying power most meme coins lack. What’s Next for $XYZ? With the presale nearing its final stages, the real action is about to begin. The Token Generation Event (TGE) and public listings are on the horizon, and that’s when $XYZ will step into the global spotlight. More exposure, more liquidity, and a stronger community mean the potential for even greater growth. XYZVerse is building an ecosystem where sports fandom meets crypto culture, creating a space where engagement and rewards go hand in hand. If the presale results are anything to go by, this is only the beginning of what $XYZ can achieve. Choose Your Meme Coin Wisely The meme coin market is often treacherous terrain, filled with flashy promises and underwhelming results. But in the midst of this chaos, XYZVerse is proving to be a rare exception — a champion in the making. With a sports-driven ecosystem, an impressive 1,233% presale surge, and a roadmap built for sustainability, XYZVerse is showing all the signs of a long-term player in the crypto space. For investors tired of empty promises and looking for a meme coin with real value, XYZVerse offers a fresh opportunity. The presale is still underway, and with its innovative approach and rapid growth, $XYZ might just be the hidden gem that fills your wallet with lasting returns.

The speed at which AI is outgrowing regulation poses a risk to data, identity, and reputation verification and, if left unchecked, may increase the prevalence of misinformation and slow the progress of scientific innovation. The march towards super-intelligent AI is represented by its most fervent leaders as a push towards a scientific golden age. However, this push increases the chances of an existential risk of our society hitting a degradative tech plateau where widescale adoption of immature AI technology caps, and over time, degrades human creativity and innovation. You might also like: ZKP voting promises to unlock mathematically secure democracies | Opinion This is a contradictory take to most accelerationists. AI is supposed to increase our ability to do work faster and synthesize greater amounts of information. However, AI cannot replace inductive reasoning or the experimental process. Today, anyone can use AI to manufacture a scientific hypothesis and use that as input to generate a scientific paper. The results of products like Aithor often appear authoritative on the surface and may even pass peer review. This is a big problem because AI-generated texts are already being curated as legitimate scientific findings and often include bogus fabricated data to support their claims. There is a major incentive for young researchers to utilize whatever means they have available to compete for a limited number of academic jobs and funding opportunities. The current incentive system in academia rewards those who can publish the most papers, whether or not those papers describe legitimate findings—they just need to pass peer review and obtain enough citations. Academic content with unverified authorship will also pose a significant issue for industries dependent on basic science to power their research and development, the very R&D that keeps our society functioning and maintains the quality of life for a growing global population. As a result, well-funded R&D can only trust the research it is able to perform and replicate on its own, increasing the value of trade secrets and dealing a devastating blow to open science and access to meaningful information. Expensive replication efforts can deal with misinformation on its own, however, the problem is much bigger than that. Today, we’re facing an erosion of trust in the very foundations of knowledge, where unverifiable claims and ambiguous attributions undermine scientific advancements, posing a threat to the scientific community. There is a pressing need to establish a truth-based economy to authenticate content and data reliably. AI systems are as powerful as the data they are trained on Large language models are excellent tools for generating convincing content; however, they are only as informative as the data on which they are trained. Their ability to extrapolate outside of the training set still remains limited. The role of science isn’t just to synthesize existing knowledge but to create new informative artefacts that increase the entropy of the collective corpus of knowledge amassed by humanity. Over time, as more people use AI to generate content and fewer people generate original content, we’ll face a “low-entropy bloat” that does not introduce new information to the world but rather just recombines past knowledge. Primary sources will become lost as new “knowledge” is based on self-referential AI-generated content unless we build a resilient provenance and verified attribution layer into AI tools used for serious research. This “lobotomization” of the intellectual depth of the collective human corpus will lead to lasting impacts on medical, economic, and academic research as well as the arts and creative pursuits. Unverified data can influence studies, skewing outcomes and leading to important policy or technology failures that erode the authority of scientific research. The risks of AI-generated “science” are multifarious. The mundane operation of normal science will stall on authorship debates, allegations of plagiarism, and impaired peer review. We will need to devote more time and energy to deal with the many consequences of declining quality and accuracy of scientific research. AI is a useful tool for provoking ideas, structuring thoughts, and automating repetitive tasks; it must remain a complement to human-created content and not a replacement. It should not be used to author scientific papers that propose original findings without doing the work but rather as an aid to increase the efficiency and accuracy of human-led efforts. For example, AI can be helpful in running simulations on existing data with already-known methods and automating this work to help discover new research directions. However, the experimental protocol and human creativity required for scientific inquiry cannot be easily replaced. Building a truth-based economy A truth-based economy establishes a framework with systems and standards to ensure information and data authenticity, integrity, transparency, and traceability. It addresses the need to establish trust and verifiability across technological society, allowing individuals and organizations to rely on the accuracy of shared knowledge. Value is rooted in the veracity of claims and authenticity of observations and primary sources. A truth-based economy will make digital knowledge “hard” in the way that Bitcoin made fiat hard. This is the promise of the decentralized science movement. How do we get there? We need to start with the most important element in the scientific world, the individual researcher and their work. The current web standards for scientific identity today fall short of verifying claims on identity and proof of work. Current practice makes it very easy to manufacture a profile with a passable reputation; peer reviews are also at risk due to bias and collusion. Without verification of the metadata that accompanies a scientific claim, a truth-based economy for science cannot be established. Improvement to academic identity standards can begin with a simple cross-platform login powered by privacy-preserving identity verification technology. Users should be able to sign into any site with their credentials, prove authenticity, and selectively disclose facts about their reputation, data, or other agents or users. An identity layer that is rooted in a verifiable researcher’s reputation is the base foundation of DeSci. A complete on-chain scientific economy will allow public and anonymous participation in massively online coordination for research activities. Research labs and decentralized autonomous organizations can create permissionless systems and bounty programs that can’t be gamed by fraudulent reputation or identity claims. A universal scientific registry secured on blockchain with identity claims would provide a frame of reference for autonomous organizations built to amass verifiable scientific knowledge and test falsifiable hypotheses. Safeguarding the future of human progress We need to establish the foundations of truth through information transparency and rigorous verification to avoid a breakdown of trust within expert research fields. The chances of our collective progress continuing for hundreds of more years, unlocking successive scientific revolutions in materials science, biotechnology, neuroscience, and complexity science, will hinge on the curation of quality research and sound data. This will be the difference between a future society that is as advanced as we are compared to pre-enlightenment societies. Otherwise, we will have to expect that this is as smart as we get as a species, and we will only get dumber. It’s not clear if DeSci will save us or not, but there is a limited time to get things right.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 13:10:00

The first chart depicts XRP’s price movement in 2017. A key observation from this chart is the trajectory of the 20-day simple moving average (SMA). During XRP’s rise in 2017, the 20-day SMA briefly crossed above its price. This later triggered a massive run culminating in XRP’s all-time high. #XRP 2017 vs. 2024 In case it wasn't obvious enough ….. Have fun buying my bags off me at $8 -$13 $XRP pic.twitter.com/xy1M8a9QSB — Crypto V (@cryptovilian) December 20, 2024 XRP Repeating the Historical Pattern Crypto V’s second chart compares this historical price action to XRP’s current performance in 2024. Once again, XRP appears to be consolidating near the 20-day SMA after experiencing a significant upward move over the past few weeks. The 20-day EMA has now crossed over the price, signaling a coming massive rally. Crypto V also shared another intriguing development, noting that XRP’s market cap at the time of his analysis was almost 100x the market cap in 2017 when this massive rally began. According to Crypto V, “In case it wasn’t obvious enough… have fun buying my bags off me at $8–$13.” This suggests the analyst anticipates a major breakout, with XRP potentially reaching a price range between $8 and $13. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Expectations for XRP Many experts believe XRP is about to repeat its 2017 performance . The 20-day SMA is a widely used technical indicator in financial markets. It helps traders identify short- to medium-term trends by smoothing out price fluctuations. Historically, when an asset’s price remains above this moving average, it is viewed as a bullish signal, indicating the potential for further upward momentum. In both 2017 and 2024, XRP’s price behavior aligns with this pattern. Market sentiment is also helping to fuel bullish expectations. XRP has seen renewed interest following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election and the recent announcement that Gary Gensler, current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will resign in January 2025 . XRP’s current position relative to its historical patterns suggests a potential for significant price movement. As Crypto V and others have pointed out, the asset shows many signs that it will repeat its 2017 performance.

However, history shows that similar corrections have been followed by massive gains for the asset, with predictions of up to $6. ADAUSD. Source: TradingView ADA’s recent price performance could be analyzed from two main perspectives – short-term and long-term. When looking at the past ten days or so, the landscape is quite gloomy. Within this timeframe, the asset went from $1.2 to under $0.8. Although it has recovered some ground to $0.9 now, it is still 25% down since December 12. The broader landscape, though, shows a different picture. ADA’s price stood in a tight range between $0.3 and $0.4 for weeks ahead of the US presidential elections and the subsequent promising words by IOG’s founder, Charles Hoskinson. It exploded to a new multi-year peak of over $1.3 later on, and even now, with its correction to $0.9, it is still 160% up in less than two months. The first scenario is more painful for now, but when analyzing larger cycles, such as the current bull one, the second plays a more important role. Consequently, crypto analyst Ali Martinez focused on the long-term perspective to determine that ADA’s most recent correction could actually be a blessing in disguise. He noted that the token has followed an ‘eerily similar pattern’ to the previous cycle in 2020. Back then, the asset’s first major retracement after a substantial rally “happened at the very same time as the correction we are experiencing today.” As such, he believes ADA could shoot past its 2021 ATH of $3.09 (according to CoinGecko) and hit a new peak of $6. #Cardano $ADA is following an eerily similar pattern to its previous cycle.

Since then, the prominent altcoin has only shown slight resilience rising by over 5% in the past two days. However, recent data on wallet activity provides much cause to be bullish on Ethereum’s long-term future. Related Reading: Ethereum Rejected At $4,000 Resistance Again: What Lies Ahead For ETH? Ethereum HODL Addresses Increase Supply Dominance To 16% In a recent QuickTake post, CryptoQuant analyst MAC_D shared some positive insights on the Ethereum market. The crypto market expert reports that the balance of Ethereum Accumulation Addresses has surged by a remarkable 60% from August to December. During this time, these HODL wallets have boosted their portion of ETH supply from 10% to 16% i.e. 19.4 million ETH of 120 million ETH. To explain, the Accumulation Addresses are wallets that hold Ethereum but rarely move or sell their holdings. They are considered a measure of long-term investment and confidence. According to MAC_D, the rapid increase in these Ethereum HODL wallets’ holdings is a new development absent from previous bull cycles. The analyst attributed this massive accumulation rate to investors’ bullish expectations of the incoming Donald Trump administration in the US. These expectations include more favorable regulations on the DeFi industry which represents a major sector of the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, regardless of Ethereum’s current price movement, these long-holding wallets are likely to keep increasing their holdings in anticipation of future price growth. In addition, MAC_D emphasizes the importance of these Accumulation Addresses in that the price of Ethereum has never slipped below their realized price. Therefore, a continuous purchase by these wallets provides a high potential for a long-term price gain. Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million What’s Next For ETH? In regards to Ethereum’s immediate movement, MAC_D warns that macroeconomic factors are likely to exert a stronger influence on ETH’s price in the short-term as illustrated by the recent price crash induced by potential reduced interest rate cuts in 2025. At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $3,352 following a 3.07% decline in the past 24 hours. In tandem, ETH’s daily trading volume is down by 53.25% and valued at $31.15 billion. Following recent price falls, Ethereum also presents a negative performance on larger charts with losses of 14.74% and 1.05% in the past seven and thirty days, respectively. On a positive note, the asset’s price remains far above its initial price point ($2,397) at the start of the post-US elections price rally, indicating that long-term sentiment remains positive. With a market cap of $401 billion, Ethereum continues to rank as the second-largest cryptocurrency and largest altcoin in the digital asset market.

He took to his handle on X (formerly Twitter) to ask if Ethereum would enjoy the same success as Bitcoin should a Saylor-like personality promote the token. The scenario Anthony Sassano teased is based on Saylor’s role in the push for Bitcoin adoption. Michael Saylor and his firm, Microstrategy have become the face of Bitcoin adoption, buying millions upon millions worth of the digital asset strategically. The company’s initiative has installed Bitcoin as a source of value and as a better hedge against inflation, reducing its appearance as a speculative asset. While Microstrategy and Saylor have been more steadfast than most, other entities have also been integral in promoting the asset. Ethereum advocate makes his case The ETH advocate’s question caused quite a stir on X. Several users dropped their takes, discussing at length the reason why the ETH space needs its own high-profile champion. A user noted that it would be incredible, noting that the influence of the person will really provide great help to Ethereum. I still think there is an absolutely massive opportunity for someone to become Ethereum's Saylor-like figure Just relentlessly buying ETH no matter the price and then shilling ETH (and Ethereum!) endlessly to mainstream audiences I wish I had the money to do this myself 😅 — sassal.eth/acc 🦇🔊 (@sassal0x) December 22, 2024 Another user claimed there could be a concentrated decentralized effort, noting that the action could see input from influencers, whales, and other users in the space. One mentioned that a centralized figure could help boost ETH’s price, using structured mechanics. The user suggested a model that will include bonding, token boosts, and borrowing mechanisms, noting that it could help accelerate the price of the token. One user talked about yield integration, noting that it could make the strategy very effective. Meanwhile, some users brought up examples of personalities that they felt could fill the gap. A user suggested Bit Digital CEO Samir Tabar, highlighting that his company mines Bitcoin to accumulate Ethereum, a move that has helped to promote ETH as a proxy. Others also proposed other candidates, with a user highlighting the influence that United States President-elect Donald Trump could have on the price of Ethereum. He mentioned that his pro-crypto stance could be pivotal in shaping the future of the asset. Challenges and the wider implications for Ethereum The initiative, however, didn’t go down well with others, with most of them highlighting the dangers of centralized influence. A user noted that Saylor’s present and growing influence might be detrimental to the asset, noting that he holds about 2% of the total Bitcoin supply. The user noted that the development could deter others from adopting the asset, noting that a central person for Ethereum could face the same criticism. Others also talked about how hard it is to create a company that will sustain the same hunger for Ethereum as the one Microstrategy has for Bitcoin. A user said Ethereum’s 75 million token during its pre-sale creates a unique dynamic that would discourage an entity from taking up a central role. One user also said there could be conflict of interest issues, noting that large holders or validators may not want to become a centralized figure to protect their positions within the network. In addition, other users talked about Ethereum ’s ecosystem and its unique characteristics. A user talked about the state of the network without a ‘champion’ like Saylor, suggesting that someone like Bankless could fill the role. Meanwhile, another user said the decentralized nature of the network makes it hard for it to rely on a central figure like Saylor for advocacy. The conversation also trickled into the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a user highlighting Bitcoin’s 21 million cap makes it suitable for high-scale holding.

Chainlink ( LINK ), the biggest oracle provider, bottomed at $20.12 on Friday and rebounded to $22.50 on Sunday, Dec. 22. Still, the coin remains about 27% from its highest point this month, meaning that it is in a bear market. A potential catalyst for the LINK token is that whales are accumulating it. According to LookOnChain, nine new wallets withdrew 362,380 coins from Binance in the last two days. These coins are now valued at over $8.19 million. Crypto.news reported last week that another whale accumulated 65,000 LINK coins valued at $1.8 million. Whales are accumulating $LINK !

It’s worth noting that President-elect Trump and his family mostly own WLFI tokens. Chainlink, known in the crypto industry for its fundamentals, is the biggest oracle in the sector with over $35 billion in total value secured. That figure is higher than its biggest competitors like Chronicle, Pyth, Edge, and Redstone. Chainlink’s ecosystem will likely grow as more chains and networks embrace its technology. Justin Sun’s Tron, the most recent chain to use its oracles, has switched from WINKLink to Chainlink . Chainlink has also formed major partnerships in the Real World Asset tokenization industry, including by companies like Coinbase, Emirates NBD, SWIFT, and UBS. Chainlink price formed a double-bottom pattern LINK, like other cryptocurrencies, has dropped sharply in the past few days as concerns about the Federal Reserve remained. The token has remained above the 50-day moving average on the daily chart. Most importantly, it has formed a double-bottom chart pattern at $20.12. This pattern happens when an asset fails to move below a specific price two times. It is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in the market. LINK has also formed an inverse hammer pattern, a popular reversal sign. Therefore, the coin is likely to bounce back in the next few days as investors target the key psychological at $30, which is about 35% above the current level. On the flip side, the bullish view will become invalid if the coin drops below the double-bottom point at $20.12.

Starboard, one of the most aggressive activist investors in the US stock market, has taken a massive position in the company, and according to them, Riot could transform itself by moving focus to hyperscaler demand. Riot owns and operates huge Bitcoin mining facilities across central Texas and Kentucky and runs a robust electrical engineering division out of Denver. While the company holds 16,728 Bitcoins and boasts a mining infrastructure of over 1 gigawatt (GW) capacity, it has been underperforming in the stock market, apparently creating a compelling case for Starboard’s intervention. Riot’s performance in numbers—and why Starboard cares At $11.55 per share and a market valuation of $3.97 billion, Riot Platforms is no small fish. But this year has been rough. Bitcoin has surged by 130%, yet Riot’s stock dropped 24%, far behind competitors who’ve posted triple-digit gains. This underperformance points to serious issues in operations and leadership. Starboard isn’t known for sitting quietly when there’s potential to make a company profitable. With 155 activist campaigns under its belt and an average return of 23.27% on those campaigns, Starboard’s presence alone tells us that Riot might be forced into big changes. The numbers don’t lie. Riot spent $225 million on selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs this year—more than triple the $67 million it spent in 2022. Much of this expense comes from executives rewarding themselves with stock-based compensation, gobbling up 11.5%, 9.5%, and a ridiculous 32.12% of total revenue over the last three years. Despite this, Riot’s management has produced nothing but losses, with this year’s operating loss surging to $304 million, its worst ever. The company’s corporate governance is equally shaky. A staggered five-member board, instances of nepotism, and questionable leadership decisions have left Riot with the highest power cost and SG&A expense per Bitcoin mined. The result was a dirt-cheap valuation compared to industry peers based on metrics like enterprise value to petahash per second (EV/PH/s). Why Starboard thinks hyperscalers are a trillion-dollar opportunity Starboard is an investor, so it’s solely here to make money. Its plan for Riot is to get into the hyperscaler market. Hyperscalers are the giants of cloud computing—think Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud—who run massive data centers to support AI and high-performance computing (HPC). These companies are desperate for infrastructure, and Bitcoin mining facilities like Riot’s are a perfect match. Starboard pointed out that Riot already has the goods. Its Rockdale, Texas site is the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, with 700 MW of capacity. The Corsicana, Texas facility, set to hit 1 GW when completed, has 400 MW of capacity ready now. These facilities share key attributes with hyperscaler needs: high-performance computing infrastructure, renewable energy access, and scalability. Competitors have already seized this opportunity. Core Scientific, another Bitcoin miner, inked a deal with CoreWeave, an AI data center startup backed by Nvidia, to lease 500 MW of capacity. That deal is worth $8.7 billion over 12 years and delivers 75-80% profit margins—far better than the margins in Bitcoin mining. Core Scientific’s stock soared 40% the day after announcing the deal and is up 220% this year. Riot could rake in similar profits. Leasing the unused 600 MW at Corsicana could bring in $600 million annually, nearly doubling its current $313 million revenue. If Riot converted its entire 1.1 GW of capacity at Rockdale and Corsicana to hyperscaler use, those numbers could triple. Better yet, hyperscalers apparently often cover the cost of building or retrofitting these facilities. Companies like Hive Digital and Hut 8 are also making the change, with Bitcoin miners that have embraced hyperscalers posting an average year-to-date stock return of 105.8%. Riot, along with other laggards like Marathon Holdings and CleanSpark, sits at -3.4%. The math is simple: adapt or fall further behind. But Riot isn’t entirely blind to its options. The company recently spent $510 million buying Bitcoin on the open market, financed through convertible senior notes. This hints at a desire to hold more Bitcoin without expanding mining capacity. But Starboard’s plan offers a better route: use hyperscaler revenue to fund Bitcoin purchases, creating a cycle of cash flow and asset accumulation. A MicroStrategy of some sort.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2027 projects a maximum price of $2,796 and a minimum price of $2,376. By 2030, BNB’s price could surge to $8,496 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB).

If the buying activities continue to grow, the market can enter a period of stability. BNB price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin confirmed a declining market trend for the currency.

BNB/USD value has spiked up to a $666.2 high in the past 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.05% of value through the day. The bears remained on the leading edge yesterday; however, today the bulls secured the victory. Technical indicators are giving out a neutral verdict with regard to the current market trends. However, the price charts are giving out a bullish overview of the market. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly crossing above $9,000 in 2030. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price ascended over the last 24 hours, above the support at $654.4. Buyers have recently stepped in to buy the assets; however, the support floor at that level seems stable, as bulls have dominated in the past weeks and the coin is still trading on the higher end of it’s price envelope. Will BNB reach $700? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $700 mark by the end of 2024, which would be quite higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach nearly $2000 by the end of 2026 and surpass this mark at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7000 by 2030. Recent news/opinion on BNB BNB suddenly surges to $742 BNB’s surge began after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as ‘CZ,’ shared a tweet on December 3 hinting at the onset of ‘altseason’—a phase where altcoins typically outpace Bitcoin in percentage growth. Binance attributed the gains to CZ’s ‘magic operation,’ referencing a large-scale buyback program and new developments within the Binance ecosystem. Various analysts remain optimistic about BNB, crediting its rise to positive market sentiment and overall growth in the cryptocurrency market.

BNB historic price sentiment Binance coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018 BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, the Binance Coin traded near $300, rising to $425 by March. It surged further to $600 by the end of the month and peaked at an all-time high of $717.48 on June 6. After fluctuating between $488 and $605 in July and August, BNB recovered to $620 in September and recovered above $590 by the end of October. In November, BNB price went as high as $661 and at the start of December 2024, it is trading near $650 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-22 13:53:00

37967291,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112709,1734876005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SOL Poised for Explosive Growth in 2025: Why This Blockchain Could Break All Records!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sol-poised-for-explosive-growth-in-2025-why-this-blockchain-could-break-all-records/,"SOL’s impressive run lately has raised its investors’ optimism for its growth trajectory leading into 2025. However, SOL is not the only project that has the potential to dominate the crypto market next year. The new 1Fuel is also showing signs that it will break records in terms of price and ecosystem functionality. While 1Fuel’s presale is already showing evidence of its projected growth potential, there’s a chance that it might even surpass expectations. Here’s why: Get the Maximum DeFi Trading Experience with 1Fuel There is no doubt that the DeFi market is a lot more advanced than it used to be when it first started. However, one part that hasn’t seen much progress is its interoperability. The main factor responsible for this problem is the complexity associated with the crypto wallet system. Although projects like Trust Wallet help investors manage their funds, there is still a lot of room for this process to become easier. This is where 1Fuel comes in. 1Fuel is a next-generation cross-chain crypto wallet platform that features a very unique one-click cross-chain transaction system. This system, combined with its interactive and intuitive user interface, ensures that newbies and old-timers have the best trading experience. 1Fuel also offers a ton of other features such as disposable wallets for short-term transactions, a built-in transaction mixer, and cold storage to keep assets secure and anonymous. But that’s not all; 1Fuel enhances its functionality further with a decentralized P2P exchange. This exchange is powered by verified smart contracts which ensure safe and direct trading for all 1Fuel users. All of 1Fuel’s features are powered by its native token called OFT. Due to its status as a utility token and its impressive tokenomics, OFT might just be the best crypto to buy now . Green Charts Ahead for Solana in 2025 SOL is one of the few crypto projects that has somehow managed to maintain a positive outlook all year. It has surged by over 190% which is a significant price rally by every standard in today’s market. Despite this growth, many SOL enthusiasts and analysts believe that there are still higher milestones for SOL to reach next year. One analyst in particular, Inmortal, recently grabbed attention with his bold SOL price prediction. In a recent X post, Inmortal claimed that SOL will hit $500 and won’t be stopped. He added that any dips are just distractions in this upward movement. The recent price charts for SOL support Inmortal’s assertion. Over the past month, SOL has been fluctuating between $210 and $230, indicating a strong consolidation phase. Moreover, Solana’s technical indicators also look bullish. TradingView data shows it is above its 50-day EMA ($213) and 100-day EMA ($192). If SOL can manage to break through the $250 resistance level before 2024 ends, reaching the $500 mark in 2025 will be a breeze for the token. Conclusion Ready to make the most of your trading journey in 2025? SOL and 1Fuel might be your best bets in terms of making profits. While SOL is likely going to continue on its upward momentum, 1Fuel is poised to redefine earning opportunities with its ongoing crypto presale. Stage 2 of this presale is currently live, featuring OFT tokens available for just $0.012 each. Don’t miss out on a chance to acquire what could be the best crypto to buy now . Invest in OFT today!

According to the source cited by CZ, the government has implemented several forward-thinking initiatives, including the establishment of the Dubai Multi Commodity Centre (DMCC) Crypto Hub, designed to support blockchain and cryptocurrency initiatives. However, it is not known when the country purchased the BTCs in question and in which cryptocurrency wallet addresses it is kept, and the source cited by the Binance founder does not make any reference to this. In other words, this claim made by CZ is not completely confirmed.

These new rules will go into effect on January 15, 2025, in an effort to strengthen consumer protection and compliance with the UK’s financial regulations. This update affects ads for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, including hardware wallet providers, although there are restrictions to their services. FCA Registration Now Compulsory for UK Crypto Firms As part of the new policy, crypto firms are expected to be registered with the FCA before they can run an ad on Google’s platform. Affected by this are: Crypto Exchanges: Online marketplaces where users can buy, sell, and trade digital assets. Software Wallets: Programs that allow users to store and manage cryptocurrencies. Hardware Wallets: Tangible devices that store private keys for digital assets, as long as they do not provide ancillary services of trading or selling assets. On top of the FCA registration, advertisers must comply with local laws of the regions they are targeting to continue being eligible. Google’s Push for Safer Crypto Ads Google’s move reflects growing regulatory scrutiny worldwide. Recently, the FCA issued warnings over unauthorized crypto promotions , including a Solana-based memecoin project called “Retardio” that was targeting UK consumers. This was an effort to protect users from financial losses in relation to unregulated promotions. Crypto Ad Scams Continue to Infiltrate Despite Regulations Despite stricter policies, crypto scams continue to be a thorn in Google’s platform. Recent examples include: Fake Crypto Websites: A phishing ad, impersonating Sony’s blockchain project, Soneium, led users to a fake website that stole crypto assets. Fraudulent Wallet Apps: An app called WalletConnect siphoned $70,000 from users. While it impersonated a legitimate protocol, it was an advanced scam targeting mobile users only. These incidents are a reminder of the ongoing challenges in keeping the crypto space secure and the need for strict ad policies and user vigilance. Google’s new policy will be a step toward better monitoring of crypto ads, so it also aligns with the global effort to improve transparency and consumer protection in the crypto industry. As the year 2025 approaches, specifically in January, these will be changes that advertisers have to be prepared for.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-22 14:19:48

The SEC revealed that Tai Mo Shan had an agreement with Terraform Labs in 2021 to purchase Terra LUNA at a steep discount. Additionally, Tai Mo Shan bought approximately $20 million in UST to maintain the stablecoin’s 1:1 peg with the US dollar. SEC Chair Gary Gensler remarked: “The impact reverberated throughout the crypto markets, eventually costing the savings of countless investors. Regardless of the labels, crypto market participants should comply with the securities laws where applicable and not deceive the public.” The Collapse of TerraUSD TerraUSD, once the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, collapsed in May 2022, causing widespread disruption in the crypto market. It was an algorithmic stablecoin that maintained its dollar peg through software and digital asset collateral. The collapse began on May 8, 2022, when a whale dumped around $285 million in UST, causing the stablecoin to lose its peg and drop to $0.98. By May 10, UST plunged further to $0.67, triggering liquidations among leveraged traders and sparking fear and uncertainty among investors. As UST’s market capitalization exceeded the underlying LUNA reserves, it became clear that the stablecoin lacked sufficient collateral, leading to its complete collapse as panic selling ensued. The fallout prompted a formal investigation of Terraform Labs and its founder, Do Kwon, by U.S. authorities, resulting in charges and a $4.4 billion settlement. The collapse also spurred regulatory reforms like the Lummis-Gillibrand Stablecoin Act of 2024, which banned algorithmic stablecoins.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 14:25:00

After months of being dragged through the mud for losing its early advantage in artificial intelligence, the tech giant has returned with guns blazing. Its December rollout of new AI models and tools has sent investors into a frenzy, pushing Alphabet’s stock to a record $199.91 and a market cap of $2.3 trillion. The revival started with Gemini 2.0, Google’s advanced AI model that has crushed competitors in benchmarks. It is paired with other major releases like Project Mariner and Project Astra. Mariner can generate detailed research reports on command, while Astra answers real-time queries in text, video, and audio—heck, it even works through smart glasses. Google’s Veo 2 and Imagen 3 are seemingly redefining video and image generation, giving investors plenty of reasons to believe in the company’s resurgence. Advanced tech and hardware give Google a new edge One of the boldest decisions was introducing Trillium, Google’s new Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chip to challenge Nvidia’s dominance in the AI hardware market. Then there’s Willow, Google’s quantum computing chip. It is designed to handle qubits, which are those tricky quantum bits that keep most quantum projects in limbo. The company also claims it can perform tasks in five minutes that would take conventional supercomputers 10 septillion years. However, quantum computing isn’t ready for prime time yet. And let’s not forget DeepMind. AlphaFold, the AI software that predicts protein structures, bagged a Nobel Prize for its creators, Sir Demis Hassabis and John Jumper. This tech surge comes as Google reports three consecutive quarters of double-digit profit growth. Numbers don’t lie. Investors have taken notice, driving the stock price up 38% this year. While the gains are impressive, there’s still a $1 trillion gap between Alphabet and Microsoft. The question isn’t whether Google is climbing—it’s whether it can overtake the leader. An uphill battle with c ompetitors, lawsuits, and Elon Musk The competition isn’t sitting still. Microsoft is still ahead, thanks to its early bet on OpenAI and the seamless integration of AI into its flagship products. Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, threw shade at Microsoft’s reliance on OpenAI’s models during the DealBook Summit . He said, “I would love to do a side-by-side comparison of Microsoft’s own models and our models any day, any time.” But it’s not just Microsoft. Elon Musk’s xAI is building something massive in Memphis. His Colossus supercomputer, powered by 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, is expected to scale up to one million chips. That kind of computing power isn’t just for show. Elon’s chatbot, Grok, might not be a direct threat yet, but with plans to catch up by 2025, Google can’t afford to get too comfortable. And then there’s Uncle Sam. The Department of Justice is gunning for Google in a big way. After losing an antitrust case in August, it is bracing for more blows. The DOJ wants to force the sale of Chrome, cancel Google’s exclusive deal with Apple, and open up its treasure trove of user data. AI-powered startups like Anthropic and OpenAI are also nipping at Google’s heels. These companies offer tools that skip the middleman, providing direct answers instead of links. Google’s response, “AI Overviews,” might sound clever, but early data shows a drop in ad clicks—down 8% year-on-year in Q3. That’s bad news for a company that relies on $175 billion in ad revenue. Internal struggles and slow execution Google’s challenges aren’t just external. The company’s own structure has been a problem. Competing teams delayed the launch of Gemini as they vied for internal attention. When Google finally unveiled Bard, it was a flop. Critics didn’t hold back, and Alphabet’s market value took a $100 billion hit in a single day when Bard flubbed a demo. Now Gemini 2.0 is finally here, and it’s a hit. But the journey has been messy. Google insiders blame fragmented leadership and a lack of urgency for the delays. Sundar Pichai admitted that ChatGPT’s popularity caught him off guard, saying at a Stanford event, “I had a different sense of the trajectory in mind.” While his confidence in the future of AI remains high, the missteps have left scars.

Daddy Pepe (DADDPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 11,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DADDPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Daddy Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Daddy Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Daddy Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Daddy Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Daddy Pepe by entering its contract address – 9UFnMabUe7wecdEEzAYPoQPZiuTJ1hTFpNz6qtsiB3FA – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DADDPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 14:37:07

According to an executive summary shared with CryptoPotato , in 2024, the crypto industry lost over $2.361 billion to cyber threats across 165 incidents. This figure represents a 40% increase from 2023, when losses totaled $1.69 billion. Access Control Incidents Lead to More Losses Cyvers noted that access control incidents accounted for 81% of losses in 2024 despite comprising 41.6% of incidents. This type of attack led to the theft of $1.9 billion across 67 incidents, while code vulnerabilities enabled the loss of roughly $456.3 million across 98 incidents. Meanwhile, address poisoning scams were fewer, and one incident accounted for the loss of $68.7 million. Although the fraud trends in 2024 marked a 40% increase in losses year-over-year, they are still 37% below the 2022 record of $3.78 billion. This year, Ethereum emerged as the network most affected by the attacks, with more than $1.2 billion in losses. Analyzing quarterly highlights, Cyvers found that smart contract vulnerabilities dominated most incidents in Q1 2024. The third quarter saw the highest losses, amounting to $790 million, while Q4 recorded the lowest activity and losses, with a 56% decline when compared to the same quarter in 2023. Notably, Q3 was dominant in both 2023 and 2024. The Most Notable Theft Incidents The $305 million hack against the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin was one of the largest incidents in 2024, followed by the $235 million hack against the Indian crypto exchange WazirX. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project Radiant Capital lost $50 million to cybercriminals after its devices were compromised. The Singaporean crypto exchange BingX was also exploited for $52 million in digital assets. Interestingly, 2024 saw a remarkable recovery rate, with more than $1.3 billion returned to affected projects, which was partially attributed to bug bounty programs. Next year, the industry could see a rise in new cyber threat trends like quantum and artificial intelligence attacks as these technologies continue to advance. There could also be more centralized finance (CeFi) targeting cases as CeFi entities remain vulnerable to heightened risks. Additionally, pig butchering scams also pose a growing threat as they accounted for $3.6 billion in victim funds across over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions in 2024.

PEPE: The Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on the Ethereum network, inspired by the early 2000s internet meme, Pepe the Frog. It seeks to emulate the success of memecoins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, featuring no transaction taxes and embracing a pure memecoin identity with no utility. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and sparking a memecoin frenzy. Its roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. The coin incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, supporting its stability. In the current market cycle, PEPE continues to attract interest due to its strong community and unique features. BONK: Community-Driven Memecoin Boosting Solana’s Ecosystem BONK is a Solana-based memecoin with a Shiba Inu mascot, aiming to empower the Solana community by redistributing power from venture capital tokens. It surged over 100% after a Coinbase listing and airdropped 50% of its supply to Solana’s NFT and DeFi participants. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Its involvement in a growing ecosystem of decentralized apps, including BonkSwap, positions it as a notable player in cryptocurrency. Despite challenges like a high total supply, BONK’s impressive growth and integration make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run unfolds, PEPE and BONK show less short-term potential. DOGEN, embodying luxury and success, is designed for those seeking the best in life. With expected 700% presale growth and potential thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the path of successful tokens like WIF and Popcat, building a community of market leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide to UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The training for the academy is in partnership with the Algorand Foundation , an organization focused on enabling an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.59 in December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-22 15:08:26

Back in 1973, a global economic crash turned conventional investing on its head. Fast forward to today, and savvy investors are seizing dips in the chaotic market to stack up on meme coins—those quirky yet insanely profitable tokens that can 100x your portfolio in no time. Of course, meme coins aren’t just a punchline anymore. They’ve gone from being internet jokes to serious contenders in the financial world. Giants like Dogecoin blazed the trail, but now, a new wave of contenders is redefining the space. Among them, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out, not just for its hilarious acronym but for its innovative features like a P2E game, referral bonuses, and staking rewards. BTFD Coin rewrites the presale playbook by offering Stage 12 access at Stage 7 pricing of $0.000064. With a potential 837.5% ROI at the projected listing price of $0.0006, this is an opportunity not to miss. Enter the BIG50 code to claim your discounted price and ride the wave of massive gains. Meanwhile, MEME and TURBO are proving that meme coins can combine wit with utility to dominate the charts. Let’s dig into what makes these three projects the top meme coins with 100x potential, how they’re poised to shake up the market, and why they’re generating massive buzz among Gen Z and Millennial investors. BTFD Coin: The New Meme King That’s Already Raised Over $4.2 Million BTFD Coin—or “Buy the F***ing Dip” for those in the know—has burst onto the crypto scene with the energy of a turbocharged meme rocket. Its presale is already making waves , smashing through $4.2 million in just its first month. With a total of 16 presale stages, BTFD Coin’s current price sits at $0.000013 in Stage 12, with its final listing price set at $0.0006. That’s a jaw-dropping leap for those who got in early, and analysts predict even more gains once it hits exchanges. So, what’s driving the hype? For starters, BTFD isn’t just a meme; it’s got substance. Its P2E game combines entertainment with crypto rewards, giving players a chance to earn while they play. Add in a generous referral program and staking options, and you’ve got a platform that’s built to engage and reward its community. And let’s not forget its strong “Buy the Dip” philosophy—a rallying cry for every investor who knows the value of jumping in during market chaos. To see how much you could earn, consider this: an investment of $35,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000013 per coin would snag you approximately 2.69 billion BTFD Coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to a value of $1.61 million. That’s life-changing money, mate. With over 57 billion coins sold to 6,100 holders already, this is one train you don’t want to miss. Memecoin (MEME): The Viral Icon With Staking and Swapping Power MEME’s not just a coin; it’s a movement. Born out of internet culture, MEME has mastered the art of virality, and its ever-growing community is proof that memes really do make the world go round. While other meme coins fizzle out, MEME has carved its niche with robust staking and swapping features that keep investors hooked. MEME’s latest innovation is MemeSwap, a staking platform offering flexible APR rates that adjust based on demand. Whether you’re locking in for the long haul or just testing the waters, MEME’s one-click harvesting and rewards system—which includes MEME and MUSDT tokens—makes it ridiculously easy to rake in profits. And with plans to expand its staking pools, the project’s only getting stronger. What really sets MEME apart, though, is its insurance model. Yup, you read that right. MEME offers blockchain insurance to protect investors from rug pulls and sudden devaluation—a game-changer in a space that’s known for its risks. Combine that with its meme-worthy branding, and MEME is attracting both retail and institutional investors alike. Could MEME hit the same heights as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu? Its track record suggests it’s got the chops. As its community continues to grow, so does its potential to deliver those coveted 100x returns. If you’re looking for a meme coin with substance and staying power, MEME might just be your ticket. Turbo (TURBO): The Underdog With an Eco-Friendly Twist TURBO isn’t just another meme coin riding on hype; it’s got a mission. Designed to be energy-efficient, TURBO leverages cutting-edge blockchain tech to minimise its environmental impact. For eco-conscious investors, it’s a breath of fresh air in a market that’s often criticised for its carbon footprint. But TURBO’s appeal isn’t just about saving the planet. It’s also making waves with its utility. TURBO’s decentralised exchange, TurboDEX, allows for seamless trading with ultra-low fees. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newbie looking to dip your toes, TurboDEX makes the process simple and cost-effective. Community engagement is another feather in TURBO’s cap. Its active presence on social media, combined with regular AMAs and giveaways, keeps its investors in the loop and excited about what’s coming next. It’s this kind of transparency and connection that’s earned TURBO a loyal following and a spot among the top meme coins with 100x potential. While it’s still early days for TURBO, its roadmap is packed with promising developments, including NFT integrations and expanded staking options. As these features roll out, TURBO’s value proposition is only set to grow, making it a compelling pick for those looking to diversify their meme coin portfolio. How to Unlock the BTFD Coin Bonus?

Do They Know Something?,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-whales-are-gobbling-up-these-2-ethereum-eth-rivals/,"Ethereum remains the third largest crypto by market cap, and its ETF has been a key achievement this year. However, large investors are beginning to shift their attention from the king of altcoins to other alternatives — Rexas Finance and Dogecoin. Recently, these whales have bought notable quantities of these altcoins. But what is fueling this surprising interest? Is there something they know that we are missing out on? In this article, we’ll discuss these cryptocurrencies that are catching their attention and explain why Rexas Finance (RXS) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are great investments with massive returns. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Future Contender In The Crypto Market Rexas Finance (RXS) makes it easy for anyone to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). Rexas Finance turns assets like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property into tokens. This approach opens up investment opportunities that were once limited to large institutions, increasing liquidity and enabling a broader global reach. Using blockchain technology, Rexas Finance makes managing assets more efficient and inclusive. As blockchain grows in adoption, Rexas is well-positioned to tap into new markets where Ripple’s utility falls short. Rexas Finance’s presale success shows strong investor support. Now in its 10th stage, the project has sold 350 million tokens at $0.150 each. Rexas runs exciting campaigns like the Millionaire Giveaway to further engage its community, which offers winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. These strategies build optimism and highlight the project’s potential to deliver significant returns—up to ten times higher than Ethereum’s. Rexas Finance stands out with innovative tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which make tokenizing assets quick and secure. The QuickMint Bot even lets you handle tokenization directly from your smartphone or computer. Additionally, Rexas offers advanced features such as the Rexas AI Shield for smart contract security and Rexas DeFi, its decentralized finance platform. This focus on innovation and versatility sets it apart from Ripple’s narrower emphasis on payment solutions, giving Rexas the potential to scale across various industries. Rexas Finance is already gaining traction, with listings on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap. It plans to debut on major exchanges by 2025 at an expected price of $0.20. Analysts predict its value could surge to $18, which is 90x its launch price. This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking sustainable growth over speculative gains. With its focus on innovation, security, and accessibility, Rexas Finance is poised to lead the next crypto bull run. DogeCoin (DOGE): Repeating Historical Surge Pattern Dogecoin is gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency world and could even rival Ethereum. Its technical signals, like the MACD, show more people are interested in buying, which hints at a possible price increase. After a period of consolidation, Dogecoin is ready to rise and hit $0.50 or more. Many big whales are accumulating DOGE because they are confident in how much the coin will surge and yield massive investments for them. Big investors are showing confidence in DOGE. Wallets with over 1 million DOGE now own over 130 billion tokens, breaking previous records. This pattern is similar to what happened before DOGE’s massive 2021 rally, suggesting that whales are positioning themselves for another price surge. Several signs and technical patterns suggest that a rally could be on the horizon for the coin. Technical indicators like its Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) point to growing buying pressure and a possible end to the current dip in price. Some analysts, like Trader Tardigrade, note that DOGE has been forming a higher low, a sign of a potential breakout. If its higher low trend continues, Dogecoin could reach around $0.50 soon, with even higher gains likely in the longer term. Analysts suggest that DOGE is exhibiting a pattern similar to its price surge in 2027 and 2021. The coin stayed steady for a while before suddenly shooting up. With DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) now showing that it is overbought, the price might rise even more soon. Currently trading around $0.40, experts believe Dogecoin’s popularity among large investors and improving market conditions might lead to a big rally. Many agree that the coin’s strong signals and outside support make this an exciting time for its future. Conclusion Rexas Finance and Dogecoin have caught whales’ attention as they have left Ethereum and are buying these altcoins on a spree. Although Dogecoin is well known, Rexas Finance is a new crypto that has gained whales’ confidence. Its token launch is drawing near, making now a perfect opportunity to buy before its price rockets.

37969443,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631949,1734881317,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37969443.jpeg,Patricia reportedly begins customer repayment plan after 2023 cyber attack,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/patricia-begins-repayment-2023-cyber-attack/,"Nigerian crypto trading platform Patricia Technologies has reportedly commenced repaying user funds following an attack on its platform. The development is another step in the right direction to restore customer faith following the platform’s security breach in 2022. In the breach, the platform lost over 600 million naira in user funds to the bad actors. According to reports , Patricia requested a window of about two to five years to enable it to generate income from operations. In addition, the platform is still coordinating efforts with law enforcement to recoup some of the stolen funds. After the breach, the platform paused operations, halting withdrawals to file a petition with the police regarding the theft on the platform. Reimbursement efforts announced via CEO’s social media The announcement of a repayment plan on the private account of Patricia’s CEO and founder, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, may be an attempt to demonstrate to its users that it is still a trustworthy entity. The post claims that the repayment plan is already ongoing and that platform users will receive their funds in batches, meaning it could take a while before all the creditors are satisfied. Users are also advised to watch out for updates from official channels and update their details on the crypto platform. Patricia has taken steps to assure its customers of the prompt return of their funds. While investigations are still ongoing, the platform announced the conversion of user funds to its native Patricia token (PTK). The platform promised users that the token would be pegged against USDT, promising repayment in the future. During the period, Patricia mentioned that the token isn’t on-chain but will function as an internal token before it starts repayment. Patricia also made efforts to satisfy aggrieved users when it announced the delisting of DLM Trust as an escrow for repayments. However, DLM Trust came out to address the delisting, noting that it was due to disagreements between both parties. Police apprehend politician in connection to the theft According to reports, the police uncovered a lead in the case that led to the arrest of three people, including a politician, Wilfred Bonse, in November 2023. In a statement by police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi, Bonse provided help to the hackers, enabling them to launder about 50 million in stolen funds from the platform. Bonse received some of the funds in his account, information that was made available to the authorities. Adejobi mentioned that the lead provided them with enough materials to crack the case wide open. While Bonse and others were apprehended, the police spokesperson mentioned that the force was still doing all in its power to apprehend the others still at large. The Patricia platform hack underscores one of the ills in the crypto industry. While crypto exchanges need to do more about the security of their platforms, users are advised to keep their tokens safe by any means possible. One of the most used methods is through the use of offline wallets, which would provide guaranteed security. Users also need to keep their seed phrases safe from third parties, as exposing them could cause problems.

In a new interview on CNBC, Fundstrat’s head of research says that the correction in equities – which saw the S&P 500 dip from above 6,000 to 5,832 – is likely an opportunity for investors to go long rather than stay cautious. “This is another buying opportunity in our view. 2024 has proven to be a year where the market’s been strong and it has eluded many opportunities for sustained weakness. I know [December 18th’s] pullback was really painful, but to us, I think the fundamental supporting stocks are intact and I think it’s a good opportunity for investors here.” Lee notes that the volatility index (VIX) – which measures the stock market’s expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options – rose sharply on December 18th. He says that historically, such a rapid rise has correlated with market bottoms. “The market has been bleeding lower. If you look at internals for the last ten days, [December 18th] looks capitulatory because not only did we have a 90% down day, but the VIX exploded by 75%. There are only four times in history where it’s risen 60% in a day, so [December 18th] was the fifth time in its 35-year history. Of those four times, the market recovered all of its losses within a week three out of the four times. The fourth time it took a month. So I think what you had was people panicking to get out of a momentum trade that’s ending because we’re so close to year-end. But here’s the interesting thing. The forward VIX-futures curve barely moved. So it was almost as if people were seeking protection through the VIX on [December 18th].” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 traded at 5,930 points.

Here's What The Experts Think,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/is-2000-a-realistic-price-target-for-binance-coin-bnb-heres-what-the-experts-think,"Layer-1’s are arguably the best risk-to-reward plays in the entire cryptocurrency space. Binance Coin, emerging as a major winner in the 2021 bull run, is still a top five layer-1 despite increasing competition. Here’s why Binance Coin will likely remain a top ten asset by the end of the 2025 bull run. Investors In Binance Coin Can Expect Bullish Long-Term And Short-Term Price Action Binance Coin is positioning itself for a major breakout as the crypto market surges, with BNB trading at $712 following a steady climb past the $700 psychological mark. The recent recovery in Bitcoin, which hit a new all-time high weekly close around $107,000, has sparked increased buying pressure across the market, providing favorable conditions for Binance Coin to test key resistance levels as altcoin season looms on the horizon. Binance Coin’s steady growth remains a testament to the strength of its ecosystem, thriving despite its lack of hype on social media and the legal woes of CZ this year. Unlike many of its rivals, Binance Smart Chain benefits from deep liquidity, an expansive DeFi network, and its ties to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This competitive advantage has allowed Binance Coin to sustain strong demand even as alternative layer-1 blockchains see fluctuating performances such as Toncoin. Recent rallies also highlight its resilience amid market volatility. The coin has maintained its upward momentum despite previous bearish signals, holding steady at the support level around $720. If Binance Coin can successfully break past its previous all-time high of $794, it would signal renewed investor confidence and further solidify Binance Coin's role as a leading layer-1 token in its second sequential bull cycle after dominating in the notorious 2021 run. However, traders remain cautious of potential short-term pullbacks, which are currently rife within the market as Bitcoin dominance continues to suppress the price action of altcoins like Binance Coin. Despite this risk, Binance Coin’s long-term outlook remains positive, bolstered by its dominant position in the layer-1 space, ongoing development of the Binance Smart Chain, and continued investor confidence. As the bull market intensifies upon an ever-encroaching alt-coin season, Binance Coin appears well-positioned to reclaim its spot among top-performing layer-1 tokens and set new price milestones despite rampant competition from the likes of Tron, Sui, Cardano, and Kaspa.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. The current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives out a bullish prediction regarding the current market trends. Coin value has climbed up to $0.2119 over the period of the past 24-hours. However, if we talk about the overall market sentiment, then it remains on the negative side. The cryptocurrency has lost 0.33 percent of its value inline with the earlier downside. Technical indicators are giving out a bearish verdict with regards to the market scenario. However, the price charts continue to give out a bullish signal as an upturn was observed today. Why is GRT up? The Graph has returned to the highest trading levels of this year, the crypto market capitalization is also at its highest. The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general bullish market sentiment. However, the past few weeks proved to support the bears, as the selling pressure remained substantially high. Will GRT recover? The Graph is recovering this month, and the current resistance could be crucial to sending GRT to previous highs. Will GRT reach $1? Yes, GRT should rise above $1 in 2027. In that year the price will range between $0.8744 and $1.03. WIll GRT reach $10? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $10 before 2030. WIll GRT reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that GRT will get to $100 before 2030. Does GRT have a good long-term future? Per the Cryptopolitan price predictions, GRT is set to trade higher in years to come. However factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate the bullish theory.

Truth or Rumor?,https://coinpedia.org/news/uae-holding-40-billion-worth-bitcoin-truth-or-rumour/,"The post UAE Holding $40 Billion Worth Bitcoin? Truth or Rumor? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent chatter in the crypto world has revolved around a bold claim that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently witnessed its Bitcoin holdings reach an impressive $40 billion. Perhaps prominent crypto commentator Bitcoin Archive raises questions over this news citing the lack of evidence supporting this bold news. Did the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings truly surge to $40 billion, or is it just a rumor? let’s find it out. UAE Bitcoin Holdings Reach $40 Billion The UAE’s Bitcoin holdings have reportedly reached $40 billion, showcasing its growing interest in cryptocurrencies. This surge aligns with a global crypto bull market and reflects the UAE’s focus on fostering a crypto-friendly environment. Initiatives like the cryptocurrency center in Dubai have supported blockchain startups, boosting Bitcoin reserves in the country. Experts believe the UAE will continue expanding its Bitcoin holdings, setting an example for other nations and encouraging institutional investments in Bitcoin. However, earlier Binance’s Former CEO CZ hinted that UAE secretly is increasing its bitcoin reserve. No Evidence to Support the Claim Bitcoin Archive recently pointed out the news provided by Bitcoinist about the United Arab Emirates (UAE) bitcoin holding. However, the Bitcoin Archive says they didn’t provide any credible sources, links, or supporting evidence to validate the $40 billion Bitcoin acquisition. The ""Bitcoinist"" website picked it up and stated it as a fact. No sources cited, no links, nothing. Search results return nothing. This would be HUGE news that is widely reported, especially in light on the USA Strategic Reserve commitment by Trump. The headlines make absurd… pic.twitter.com/RUKBsTinzp — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 22, 2024 After searching for trustworthy information, the Bitcoin Archive found no confirmation of such a purchase. They explained that a move as big as this would make global headlines, especially since the UAE has a major impact on the crypto market. They also mentioned the ongoing discussion about Bitcoin’s role in financial reserves, such as former President Trump’s idea of a U.S. Strategic Reserve. Questions About the News Bitcoin Archive also criticized the article on “Bitcoinist.” They noted that it had a flashy headline but lacked any credible details. The author of the piece also did not provide any background information, which further raised doubts about the report’s authenticity. UAE’s Growing Bitcoin Boom Between 2023 to June 2024, the UAE saw a massive $34 billion flow into cryptocurrencies, marking a 42% jump from the previous year. Bitcoin has emerged as a key player, holding 19% of the market share, while stablecoins like Tether make up 51%. Tether even plans to launch a dirham-backed token , showing the UAE’s focus on digital assets. By 2025, crypto users in the UAE are expected to reach 3.78 million. A report also shows that 72% of UAE residents had invested in Bitcoin by early 2024, with big funds and institutions driving this growth. The UAE is quickly becoming a key player in the crypto world.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-22 15:45:38

Still, there are plenty of trends to track. Here are some of the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Hyperliquid price rally gains steam Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), which airdropped on Nov. 29, surged to a record high this week. On Sunday, it hit a high of $35.18, up from the airdrop listing price of $11, bringing its cumulative gains to almost 200%. Its market cap has jumped to $9.2 billion, and its fully diluted valuation to $33.7 billion. Hyperliquid’s performance is likely because of its strong market share in the decentralized perpetual trading industry. Data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that Hyperliquid handled perpetual futures volume of $52 billion in the last seven days. Jupiter, the second-biggest player in the industry, had a volume of $8.7 billion, while SynFutures processed $6 billion. Hyperliquid’s total value locked in its DeFi ecosystem also peaked at $3.4 billion, up from $188 million in October. Technically, HYPE price needs to rise above $34.8 to confirm the bullish breakout. This price is both its all-time high and the upper side of the ascending triangle pattern. A move above that level will point to more gains — possibly to $40. HYPE price chart | Source: crypto.news Hyperliquid was launched by Jeff Yan, the founder of Chameleon Trading. Horizen surges to 2022 highs Horizen ( ZEN ) price will be in the spotlight this week as the privacy-focused tokens continues soaring. It has risen in the last four consecutive days and surged to its highest level since May 2022. ZEN token jumped because Grayscale launched a Horizen Trust, which will give investors access to the coin. It was also listed on Gains Network, a decentralized derivatives trading platform built on the Polygon network. Investors cheered its final halving event on Dec. 12. Technicals point to more Horizen price gains since it formed a strong bottom at $6.30. It has risen above the important resistance level at $18, its highest swing on March 11. More gains could see it rise to the 23.6% retracement level at $45, which is 53% above the current level.

Immutable X price drops ahead of token unlock The third coin on this week’s list of top cryptocurrencies is Immutable X ( IMX ). The token’s price has suffered a harsh reversal and moved to its lowest level since Nov. 21. Immutable, a blockchain company based in Sydney, Australia, will be in the spotlight this week as the network unlocks over 24.5 million IMX tokens valued at over $33 million. These unlocks are part of Immutable’s tokenomics, which sees a similar number of coins released in the market each month. Immutable now has 1.69 billion IMX tokens in circulation against a supply cap of 2 billion. According to CoinMarketCap , the final unlock will happen in November 2025. The IMX token, the Ethereum Layer 2 solution for NFTs and gaming, has retreated below the major S&R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines at $1.5625. It is now approaching the ultimate support at $1.1720, which coincides with the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since August. Therefore, odds are that the coin will continue falling ahead of the unlock event on Dec. 27.

This figure is believed to be close to the liquidation threshold for MicroStrategy, the publicly traded company that owns one of the largest Bitcoin reserves. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has accumulated over 150,000 BTC, representing about 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. According to the podcast, Saylor’s average Bitcoin purchase price is estimated to be $58,000. If Bitcoin falls below this level, the company could face significant liquidation risks. Related News: Binance Founder CZ Reveals the Country with a Huge Amount of Bitcoin: “Twice as Much as the US” Podcast participants speculated that such an event could potentially lead to a financial crisis “100 times larger” than the collapses of Terra Luna and FTX, both of which sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. On the bright side, the podcast also outlined a rather optimistic scenario where Bitcoin rises to $500,000. Such a price increase would not only validate MicroStrategy’s bold strategy, but it could also make Michael Saylor the richest person in history. A Bitcoin price of $500,000, combined with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings, could make Saylor the first trillionaire in human history. Michael Saylor has been a strong advocate of Bitcoin, often describing it as “digital gold” and a long-term hedge against inflation. *This is not investment advice.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 16:06:00

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has retreated to $97,000 from the all-time high of $108,427 after the Federal Reserve pointed to just two interest rate cuts in 2025. MVRV score shows Bitcoin price is still cheap The recent Bitcoin pullback affected investors, as evidenced by spot ETF flows. According to SoSoValue , these funds had net outflows of $276 million on Friday, a day after they shed $680 million in assets. That was a sign that some investors believe that Bitcoin may have topped. Still, the Market Value to Realized Value indicator hints that Bitcoin price is still cheap even after moving to a record high last week. According to CoinGlass, the MVRV-Z score has dropped to 2.84 from last week’s high of 3.3. Historically, an MVRV-Z score figure below 3.7 is a sign that an asset is undervalued. Bitcoin MVRV indicator | Source: Coinglass The MVRV-Z score is an important indicator that looks at the market value and the relative value of a coin. It is calculated by subtracting the realized market capitalization from the circulation market value and then dividing the figure by the standard deviation. Bitcoin had an MVRV score of 3.03 in the last big correction in March this year, and 7 in the previous major correction in January 2021. Therefore, this score is a sign that the coin could recover strongly in the next few weeks. As we wrote in a recent BTC forecast , the cup and handle pattern points to a rally to $122,000 in this bullish cycle.

As shown below, the number of Bitcoins in circulation has dropped to a multi-year low of 2.24 million. There were over 2.72 million coins in exchanges in September this year. That indicates that more investors are buying and storing Bitcoins in self-custody wallets. Some of these investors are those accumulating ETFs, which now have over $109 billion in assets. Companies like Marathon Digital and MicroStrategy have also continued to accumulate Bitcoins this year. MicroStrategy now holds over 439,000 coins. Bitcoin balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass The other potential catalyst for Bitcoin is that the stablecoin market cap has jumped to almost $210 billion, up from $122 billion a year earlier. A rise in stablecoin value is usually a positive indication, underscoring how more investors are showing interest in cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s annual inflation rate has continued falling, moving to 1.12% from the 2015 high of almost 12%. This inflation rate has fallen because of the halving events and the rising mining difficulty rate.

This marks a notable shift from its peak performance in December, when it reached this year’s high of $4,106 on December 16. However, the all-time high for ETH, set at $4,877 on November 8, 2021, remains unbroken. Since reaching that high, Ethereum has been forming lower highs and lower lows, indicating bearish momentum in the market. Ethereum Market Sentiment And Support Levels The year 2024 has been tumultuous for Ethereum, with a blend of bullish catalysts and market downturns. Early in the year, Ethereum saw a 47% increase, although it lagged behind Bitcoin’s substantial gains. A key driver of optimism was the SEC’s approval of Ethereum spot ETFs in May, which not only attracted institutional investors but also contributed to a 24.7% return for that month. However, geopolitical tensions and broader market dynamics, including the Bitcoin halving, led to volatile periods, with April witnessing a 17.2% decline in ETH’s value. Despite these fluctuations, Ethereum has maintained its stronghold in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, with its Total Value Locked approaching $80 billion, underscoring its fundamental strength. However, the second quarter was less favorable, with ETH posting a -5.08% quarterly return due to external factors like the Middle East crisis. Related Reading: Sentiment For Ethereum Hits 1-year Low, Analyst Says A Massive Run Is Coming As December 2024 unfolds, Ethereum was trading at around $3,648, showing signs of recovery in the last month of the year and outperforming other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana. However, the recent dip below $3,100 has sparked discussions about the potential for further declines or a swift recovery to new highs. Market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index at 57 (greed), suggests that retail investors see the current dip as a buying opportunity rather than a reason for panic selling. This sentiment is crucial as Ethereum navigates through its support levels, with the immediate one at $2,900 being a focal point. If Bitcoin experiences a significant drop to around $90,000, it could further influence ETH’s price, potentially pushing it towards its next significant support at $2,900. Related Reading: 7.8M Ethereum Leaves Binance In Two Months—What Does This Mean for ETH? Can Ethereum Hit A New All-Time High Before 2025? Looking towards the possibility of hitting a new all-time high before 2025, several factors come into play: Institutional Adoption: The ongoing investment from institutional players, especially through ETFs, could lead to increased demand. Network Upgrades: Upcoming Ethereum upgrades and improvements in scalability could enhance investor confidence. Market Sentiment: The crypto market’s general mood, influenced by broader economic conditions, technological advancements, and regulatory news, will be pivotal. The concentration of Ethereum holdings also plays a role. The Beacon Chain Deposit Contract holds over 38 million ETH, crucial for Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake. Other significant holders include exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which could influence market liquidity and price movements through their strategic asset management. In conclusion, while Ethereum’s dip below $3,100 signals a moment of caution, the underlying fundamentals and market dynamics suggest there’s still a pathway to new highs before 2025. However, this would require positive developments in both the crypto-specific and broader economic landscapes. Investors should watch closely how Ethereum interacts with its support levels and responds to upcoming market catalysts.

On Dec. 21, Trust Wallet users took to social media to report issues with their crypto balances vanishing. One X user mentioned that their balance would occasionally appear and disappear, while another user said they nearly had a heart attack upon seeing their balance vanish. At 6:45 am UTC, Trust Wallet acknowledged the issue, noting it initially affected BNB and Trust Wallet Token (TWT) balances. The company later confirmed that other tokens were also impacted. Despite the glitch, Trust Wallet reassured its users that their funds were secure. By 8:05 am UTC, the company announced that the issue had been resolved. “Hey Trust Fam, no more glitches! The issue has been resolved and everything should be working properly now. Thanks for your understanding,” the company wrote. While the incident was a technical error, it caused panic among some users.

The charges come as the FBI reports Americans lost over $5.6 billion to crypto fraud in 2023 — a 45% increase from the previous year. According to ABC News , citing prosecutors, Beverly Hills-based Hay and Thousand Oaks-based Mayo allegedly executed multiple “rugpull” schemes between May 2021 and May 2024. They also allegedly created NFT projects to attract investors before abandoning them while keeping the funds. You might also like: SEND surges 360%, dForce jumps 160%, BTC struggles to reclaim $100k The U.S. Attorney’s Office has charged both individuals with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking. Each fraud count carries a potential 20-year prison sentence, with the stalking charge adding a possible additional five years. The pair, both 23 years-old, allegedly promoted several fraudulent projects, including the “Vault of Gems NFT,” collecting millions from investors before abandoning the ventures. The indictment details their attempts to hide their involvement by falsely attributing project ownership to others. Prosecutors also allege the defendants started a harassment campaign targeting the manager and their family. The case is a part of a broader trend in cryptocurrency crime, with the FBI reporting that while crypto-related crimes represent only 10% of financial fraud complaints, they account for nearly half of all financial losses Americans suffered to scams in 2023. Investment schemes, similar to those allegedly carried out by Hay and Mayo, caused the highest losses at $4 billion nationwide.

The New York-based firm recently filed for a new series of leveraged ETFs designed to tap into the world of crypto-focused companies. These funds aim to cater to bullish and bearish investors, amplifying daily returns through their innovative 2x long and 2x short structures. Crypto’s Heavyweights Under the GraniteShares ETF Spotlight At the heart of these new ETFs are some of the most influential companies in the crypto space. These ETFs include Riot Platforms , Marathon Digital, MicroStrategy, and Robinhood. Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital stand out as powerhouses in Bitcoin mining, boasting substantial Bitcoin reserves of 17,429 and 44,394 units, respectively. MicroStrategy leads the pack with an unmatched 439,000 Bitcoin holdings. While Robinhood continues to serve as a popular gateway for retail investors exploring stocks and cryptocurrencies. Leveraged ETFs: High Rewards, High Risks GraniteShares’ new funds are set to offer both 2x long and 2x short options. This means investors can double daily gains when stocks rise and amplify losses if they fall. For example, if Riot Platforms’ stock increases by 1%, the GraniteShares 2x Long RIOT ETF would rise by 2%. Conversely, a 1% drop in stock price leads to a 2% loss in the 2x short fund. This high-reward, high-risk approach has attracted attention, especially with the surge in crypto and stock markets this year. Leveraged ETFs like T-Rex 2x Long MSTR Daily Target fund (MSTU) and Defiance 2x Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) have outperformed expectations. They have raked in 308% and 253% returns, compared to a 150% rise in MicroStrategy’s stock over the past three months . However, when markets turn bearish, the losses can be substantial. In the last 30 days, MicroStrategy’s stock dropped by 24%, while MSTU and MSTX fell by over 50%. Historical data highlights the risks of leveraged funds. In 2022, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF, a 3x leveraged Nasdaq 100 tracker, plummeted by 79%. This sharp decline came as the index itself dropped by 32%. A Competitive Crypto ETF Landscape GraniteShares is entering an increasingly competitive ETF market. Unlike traditional funds, GraniteShares’ ETFs are designed for investors seeking to capitalize on short-term trends rather than long-term holds. These ETFs fit well with the risky and unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Leveraged ETFs are just one part of the trend as firms explore new crypto-focused financial products. Companies like YieldMax have taken a different approach by launching covered call ETFs. These funds invest in stocks and sell call options to generate monthly income for investors.

37971603,https://finbold.com/?p=221818,1734886047,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI picks 2 altcoins set to outperform Bitcoin in January 2025,https://finbold.com/ai-picks-2-altcoins-set-to-outperform-bitcoin-in-january-2025/,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) is seeking to extend its impressive 2024 run into the new year, aiming to reclaim and establish its price above the $100,000 mark. This potential surge is fueled by industry optimism, with some market players expecting the asset to climb higher , driven by the sustainability of the post-election momentum despite the current short-term volatility. While Bitcoin leads the charge, several altcoins also show strong potential to rally, possibly even outperforming BTC. With this in mind, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o for insights on which altcoin could take center stage. XRP The artificial intelligence (AI) tool highlighted that XRP’s future looks brighter than ever, thanks to recent favorable developments in a legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The latest updates from the case indicate that the chances of XRP being reclassified as a security have diminished. Additionally, Gary Gensler’s upcoming exit as the head of the SEC is viewed as a bullish trigger for the asset. There is speculation that the case could be thrown out entirely if crypto-friendly Paul Atkins is confirmed to lead the regulator. With the new administration set to take over, XRP could rally further, building on its recent breakout amid anticipation of possible approval for a related exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Overall, ChatGPT stressed that positive regulatory outcomes could spark massive institutional adoption, driving the asset’s value upwards. At the same time, the OpenAI platform noted that Ripple’s established partnerships with financial institutions for cross-border transactions further cement its role as a bridge currency, which could boost demand. It’s worth noting that XRP is among the standout winners of the current bull market, having broken out of a prolonged consolidation phase below $1. XRP is exhibiting short-term bearish sentiments aligning with the broader cryptocurrency market. As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.23, reflecting a 1.6% loss on the daily chart and an 8% decline over the past week. Notably, XRP has recorded returns of over 285% in 2024, outperforming Bitcoin’s 115% gain. XRP YTD price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, Dark Defender’s analysis, shared in an X post on December 21, indicated that XRP appears to be repeating a familiar pattern observed on its four-hour chart, but this time on the daily timeframe, signaling a potentially explosive move ahead. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender In the past, XRP dropped 21% to $1.0033 before rallying from $1.2680 to $2.9070. The current daily structure mirrors this, with a 34% dip to $1.9010. If XRP breaks above $2.90, targets of $5.85 and $8.76 could follow. Solana (SOL) The AI tool selected the decentralized finance asset Solana ( SOL ) as the second altcoin likely to outperform Bitcoin. ChatGPT-4o cited Solana’s strong fundamentals, such as high speed and low transaction costs, which have the potential to attract more users to the platform. With a stronger developer activity and a growing ecosystem, Solana is set to benefit as more projects are built on its network. This aligns with an Electric Capital report that showed Solana surpassed Ethereum ( ETH ) in new developer growth for the first time since 2016. In 2024, Solana led the blockchain ecosystem with an 83% year-on-year increase in new developers. As of press time, Solana is trading at $182, having dropped over 2% in the last 24 hours and plunging more than 17% over the past week. Year-to-date, SOL has rallied 80%. SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding Solana’s next potential move, prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez suggested the asset might be setting up for a rebound. In an X post on December 21, Martinez observed that the range between $188 and $179 is a critical support level that previously acted as resistance from March to November. This area now serves as a potential launchpad for the next move. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali Martinez Adding to the bullish outlook, Solana’s Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has dropped to 31.72, a point that has historically signaled price rebounds. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI is in oversold territory, suggesting SOL could be primed for a reversal. Despite XRP and Solana’s potential to outperform, their price movements will likely follow Bitcoin’s lead. While both altcoins have strong fundamentals and catalysts, Bitcoin’s performance will remain the primary force shaping the broader crypto market.

As of December 2024, Dogecoin has reached 9.52 million active addresses , signaling increased adoption and user involvement. Despite the surge in active wallets, DOGE has lost 14.1% over the past month and is trading at $0.39. DOGE’s price decline is due to the reduction in the broader interest in meme coins. If this continues, experts believe that Dogecoin may face challenges in reaching the $1 mark. However, Dogecoin investors have placed hopes in a new $0.04 that can boost their profits despite the dip. Pepe rides the meme coin wave as it inches closer to mainstream adoption PEPE ’s fading momentum has gained attention from investors as the token dropped from its all-time high of $0.000028, slipping 19% to its current price. The frog-themed meme coin has hit a wall due to the fading meme coin hype as the market experiences correction after the November 2024 price pump. Recent data further suggests that whales are increasing their PEPE holdings, signaling positive sentiment around the project. Yet, there are mixed signals as PEPE’s price remains bearish, with a decline of 11.3% over the past week. This is why PEPE investors set their sights on a new $0.04 DeFi coin to boost their profits.

The Red Notice serves as a worldwide request for law enforcement agencies to locate and provisionally arrest Schueler. Finnish authorities are pursuing Schueler’s arrest based on tax evasion allegations spanning from June 2, 2020, to April 2, 2024. The case has gained additional gravity as Schueler now appears on Europe’s most wanted fugitives list, where authorities detail disturbing assault allegations involving a minor.

33767162,[object Object],1734886850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin’s Third And Final Leap? Analyst Highlights Potential Mid-August Peak,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-third-and-final-leap-analyst-highlights-potential-mid-august-peak/,"Like many other cryptocurrencies , Dogecoin’s price action in the past week has been highlighted by a notable correction . Dogecoin, in particular, saw its price break below $0.3 for the first time in four weeks, leading to a bottom below $0.27. According to an interesting take by crypto analyst Master Kenobi, Dogecoin could continue on a gradual decline in the next few months before another strong move upwards. Interesting Outlook For Dogecoin Price Although Dogecoin has recovered above the $0.3 mark at the time of writing, Master Kenobi recently teased the possibility of the leading meme coin to continue on a gradual decline in the short term. Sharing his thoughts on the social media platform X, the analyst outlined a potential roadmap for DOGE, predicting a period of decline followed by an explosive rally. “What if DOGE…is gearing up for its third and final leap in such a scenario?” Kenobi speculated . According to his observation, the cryptocurrency might experience a gradual drop in value until mid-April, culminating around April 15. In terms of a price target, this decline could see the Dogecoin price falling to as low as $0.175, which would essentially erase most of its gains in the past two months or so. Following this decline, the analyst suggested, Dogecoin could embark on a strong upward trajectory starting May 5, with the rally potentially peaking in mid-August. This rally is predicted to be highlighted by a break into new all-time highs above the current one of $0.74, with an eventual peak above $1 by August 18. Timelines Put The Rally Much Closer Kenobi’s outlook on Dogecoin seems to deviate from the current sentiment among Dogecoin investors and other analysts, especially the bearish first half of his prediction. Nonetheless, it also remains a possibility, considering the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, Kenobi made it clear that his post was purely speculative. “Not saying it will happen, but it caught my eye, and I thought I’d share it with you too,” he noted. The general consensus is that Dogecoin is resuming its uptrend along the rest of the crypto market very soon. If not in the last few days of 2024, surely sometime in early 2025. In another recent analysis, Master Kenobi noted that the RSI indicator points to Dogecoin resuming its uptrend in the next few weeks. Dima James, another crypto analyst, noted that Dogecoin is still able to reach above $10 this cycle. This bullish sentiment is also echoed by another analyst known as Trader Tardigrade, who noted that Dogecoin is well on track to reaching above $1 sooner than later.

During its presale, CYBRO raised $7 million and attracted almost 20,000 early investors, showing strong market interest even before going public. 🚀 Still Early—Massive Potential Ahead Despite this incredible rally, $CYBRO is still at a low price point, leaving room for higher highs. In the medium term, the token could add more 500-600% to its value, depending on broader crypto market conditions and adoption within its ecosystem.

It enables various functions within the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn additional POL in return. This involves locking up tokens and participating in the network's consensus. POL also grants voting rights, allowing holders to influence decisions about the network's development. Additionally, the token provides access to exclusive services and features within the Polygon ecosystem. As the network expands with more services and applications, POL plays a key role due to its wide range of uses. Kaspa – A New Approach to Fast and Secure Cryptocurrency Transactions Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that uses proof-of-work for security. It uses the GHOSTDAG protocol, which lets blocks created at the same time coexist instead of being discarded. This means the Kaspa blockchain is a blockDAG, allowing high block rates and fast confirmations. Currently, it produces 1 block per second and aims for even more. Kaspa includes features like Reachability to check the network's structure, block data pruning to save space, SPV proofs for verification, and plans for subnetwork support to make future layer 2 solutions easier to implement. SUI: A Scalable and User-Friendly Layer-1 Blockchain Platform SUI is a layer-1 blockchain platform designed for global adoption. It offers a secure and scalable development platform. By using an object-centric data model and the Move programming language, SUI addresses inefficiencies in current blockchain systems. It emphasizes user experience by removing common barriers in blockchain interactions. Innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications accessible and user-friendly. SUI aims to raise the standard for user experience in Web3, potentially enhancing adoption and engagement. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Global Payments with Blockchain Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payments network that uses blockchain to enable fast and low-cost fund transfers. It does not favor any national currency and has its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens. Since it started in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. It stands out by allowing transfers of any currency type, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that aim to replace financial systems, Stellar aims to enhance them. It offers a unified network for different financial systems to work together. People can transfer funds globally using Stellar apps, and companies can build blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency conversion. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like POL, KAS, SUI, and XLM may offer some potential, they might not yield significant short-term gains. CYBRO, however, stands out as a technologically advanced DeFi platform that provides investors with unmatched opportunities to boost their earnings. Its AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, along with features like attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, delivers a superior user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals. By emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO is gaining significant attention from crypto whales and influencers. As the bull run of 2024 unfolds, CYBRO presents a promising avenue for investors aiming to expand their portfolios.

Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), used a UAE-based front company to facilitate money laundering and cryptocurrency conversion, funneling the proceeds back to Pyongyang. OFAC Imposes Sanctions In its official press release on December 17th, the OFAC stated that North Korea continues to rely on agents and proxies to access the global financial system for illicit activities. The agency added these operations are part of the country’s broader efforts to destabilize international security, now extending to Europe with increasing military ties to Russia. Sim Hyon Sop, a representative of the DPRK’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC) based in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), is said to be a key figure in these activities. Operating as an agent for North Korean financial institutions, Sim is accused of orchestrating money laundering schemes, establishing shell companies, and managing bank accounts to move illicit funds. The OFAC previously designated Sim and KKBC under Executive Order 13382, targeting entities that support WMD proliferation. Sim’s operations primarily involve digital assets to funnel money back to North Korea’s missile programs. Since 2022, Huaying has been allegedly involved in laundering millions of dollars of illicit funds derived from DPRK activities by converting cryptocurrency into fiat currency. Between 2022 and September 2023, the accused used various methods, including money mules, to facilitate these transactions. Meanwhile, Jian also helped facilitate the exchange of fiat currency and acted as a courier for Sim. OFAC is designating both Huaying and Zhang Jian, along with Green Alpine Trading, LLC, a UAE-based front company involved in the network, for their roles in supporting Sim’s illicit activities. Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith stated, “As the DPRK continues to use complex criminal schemes to fund its WMD and ballistic missile programs – including through the exploitation of digital assets – Treasury remains focused on disrupting the networks that facilitate this flow of funds to the regime. The United States, along with the UAE and our other partners, will continue to target the financial networks that enable the Kim regime’s destabilizing activities.” North Korean Hackers Execute Wide-Ranging Crypto Heist North Korea’s involvement in cybercrime has wreaked significant havoc in the crypto industry, as evidenced by a series of high-profile hacks and exploits. In August, ZachXBT reported that North Korean developers infiltrated over 25 crypto projects using fake identities, stealing $1.3 million through malicious code. In October, reports emerged that North Korean hackers linked to Lazarus Group used a fake NFT game exploiting a Chrome zero-day flaw to steal wallet credentials. The game, promoted via social engineering tactics, included malware that harvested sensitive data. Despite a fix from Google, the attackers had already executed large-scale crypto thefts. Then in November, South Korean police confirmed that North Korean hacking groups Lazarus and Andariel orchestrated the 2019 Upbit crypto heist, stealing $50 million worth of ETH. Collaboration with the FBI and Swiss prosecutors uncovered key evidence, including North Korean IP addresses and virtual asset flow patterns. The stolen funds were laundered through multiple platforms. More recently, Radiant Capital confirmed that a $50 million hack on its DeFi platform in October 2024 was carried out by a North Korea-linked hacking group. The attackers used a Telegram-based malware scheme to exploit a developer, leading to the installation of a macOS backdoor.

Despite minor market rebounds, SHIB’s price action indicates potential for growth as it hovers near critical support levels. Meanwhile, Bitcoin fell below $95,000, contributing to a wider downturn across the cryptocurrency market raising questions about stability amid ongoing volatility. Will Shiba Inu Price Recover or Dip Beyond Support Line? A crypto analyst tweeted about the potential price movement of Shiba Inu, emphasizing a critical support level. According to the analyst, Shiba Inu must maintain this support to pave the way for a possible significant price surge. The tweet highlighted a chart indicating a key horizontal support area that SHIB is currently testing. This support zone has historically been a crucial point for price stability, marking a potential reversal zone for the cryptocurrency. If the price holds at this level, the analyst predicts a substantial upward movement could follow. Source: X Shiba Inu price experienced a sharp decline from recent highs, reflecting caution across the broader cryptocurrency market. Over the past week, the meme-based crypto dropped significantly, hitting lows of $0.0000185 during Friday’s session. However, a recovery followed, pushing prices to $0.000024 on Saturday before facing resistance at this level. The rebound subsequently lost momentum. Meanwhile, most cryptocurrencies traded in the red as Bitcoin retreated after approaching the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin’s decline negatively impacted the broader crypto market, including Shiba Inu. Market sentiment remains fragile, with traders closely monitoring price movements amid broader risk aversion in digital assets. Shiba Inu Price Analysis As of the reporting time, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00002154, marking a 2% decline in the past 24 hours. The token’s price fluctuated within a range of $0.00002095 and $0.00002237, reflecting moderate market volatility during this period. If the bearish trend gains more traction, the Shiba Inu price prediction indicates a potential break below the $0.00002 support level, potentially hitting $0.000019. This comes as the cryptocurrency market continues to experience mixed signals, with SHIB facing increased selling pressure. However, if bullish momentum builds, SHIB could rebound from current levels and aim for the $0.000025 resistance. Such a rally would depend on strong buying activity and favourable market sentiment. The MACD indicator on the 4-hour chart suggests slight bullish divergence, hinting at a potential reversal. The histogram shows decreasing bearish momentum, which may pave the way for a short-term recovery if sustained. Shiba Inu Price Chart: TradingView Shiba Inu price hangs in a delicate balance, with critical support levels key to its next move. Sustained buying and favourable sentiment could spark recovery, but risks of further dips remain.

Initially seen as a joke, its value soared in 2021, breaking into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value over $50 billion. This rise was fueled by social media and support from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's strong community and broad appeal show its potential. In the current market cycle, it remains a significant player, and its active community might attract those interested in cryptocurrency.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-22 17:22:00

In a recent X tweet, Zhao shared an article claiming the United Arab Emirates holds $40 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ). The figure immediately drew attention from industry observers, particularly crypto lawyer Irina Heaver. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) holds $40 billion in Bitcoin. Source: https://t.co/qcjXOnocTn — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 22, 2024 Heaver challenged the article’s credibility, suggesting it appeared to be AI-generated content lacking evidence for its claims. Responding to the skepticism, Zhao acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the specific figure, noting, “I also wondered how they came up with the exact number; it’s challenging to collect.” Screenshot from X Zhao added that while the amount exceeded his expectations, it could be plausible given the number of high-net-worth individuals in the region. The discussion prompted Zhao to look back on his role in developing the UAE’s cryptocurrency ecosystem. He described witnessing Dubai’s change from hosting “only a handful of crypto companies” in 2021 to becoming home to thousands of blockchain-related businesses. Zhao stated, “I certainly did a lot of shilling here. But didn’t know the number was so big or how much of that could be attributed to my efforts.” The exchange has brought to light Dubai’s initiatives in the cryptocurrency sector, including the Dubai Multi Commodities Center’s Crypto Center, which has created a favorable environment for blockchain startups and digital asset investments. These regulatory frameworks and government efforts have successfully brought numerous international crypto companies to establish operations in the region. The debate over the UAE’s Bitcoin holdings comes at a time when the nation is actively positioning itself as a global cryptocurrency hub. While the exact value of national cryptocurrency holdings remains unverified, the discussion underscores the UAE’s growing influence in the crypto space.

The report covers the development of stablecoins, tokenization, cryptocurrency ETFs, decentralized finance (DeFi), and regulatory clarity. Coinbase predicts that stablecoins, often referred to as crypto’s “crucial asset,” will move beyond traditional commerce use cases. They are expected to facilitate a broader range of financial transactions, powering the next phase of global digital payments. The report notes that tokenization is a transformative force in the current market cycle. While challenges remain, on-chain tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate and stocks could become a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. Coinbase notes that ETFs have permanently changed the supply-demand dynamics for crypto assets. The success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has spurred institutional adoption, with endowments, pension funds, hedge funds, and family offices increasingly investing in crypto ETFs. Related News: Analysts Discussed: ""Bitcoin Should Never Go Below This Level, Crash Could Be 100 Times Worse Than FTX and LUNA Crashes"" Going forward, Coinbase expects more innovations in the ETF space, such as the inclusion of staking mechanisms and the elimination of cash-only requirements for ETF stake creation and redemption. These changes could improve ETF price alignment, narrow bid-ask spreads, and increase returns for investors. Despite downturns in previous market cycles, decentralized finance is poised for a resurgence thanks to new innovations and applications. Coinbase predicts that DeFi will evolve into a more robust and accessible financial ecosystem in the coming years. One of the most promising developments highlighted in the report is the shift in regulatory attitudes. Coinbase envisions a clearer and more logical regulatory framework that will benefit both the crypto industry and consumers. Regulatory clarity is expected to transform from a hindrance to a support factor, encouraging growth and stability in the market. Coinbase notes the profound impact spot Bitcoin ETFs have had on institutional adoption, describing them as a stabilizing force in the crypto market. While the focus remains on potential approvals for spot ETFs tied to tokens like XRP, SOL, LTC, and HBAR, the report tempers expectations of significant institutional demand beyond a select few assets. *This is not investment advice.

Experts suggest it could achieve growth akin to giants like Binance Coin (BNB) or Solana (SOL). With its presale price at just $0.003, LCAI’s utility-driven foundation and forward-thinking roadmap set it apart from speculative meme coins. As the presale continues at lightchain.ai , many wonder if this could be the next transformative player in the crypto space. Legacy of Crypto Giants Coins like Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL) did not get their current power in one night. Binance Coin, for example, began as a helpful token for cuts on fees at the Binance shop but its fast growth made it one of the best goods out there in the market. Solana, meanwhile caught eyes with its unmatched speed and low costs to trade fixing problems that troubled past blockchains. Both coins have a shared link—strong basics, creative tech, and strong group help. These things helped them move through market ups and downs and keep their spots as leaders in the crypto world. Lightchain AI (LCAI) reflects these early traits; giving a unique blend of cutting-edge tech and useful use that might create a way for similar lasting success. As past shows, projects ͏with a good base often give the biggest rewards. Building the Future How Lightchain AI is Poised for Success Lightchain AI is at the forefront of innovation, combining blockchain transparency with AI’s transformative potential. By introducing unique features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), it creates a platform that prioritizes efficiency, scalability, and real-world usability. These technologies enable industries to harness decentralized AI solutions while ensuring privacy and equitable access, setting Lightchain AI apart from traditional blockchain systems. The platform’s structured roadmap highlights its commitment to continuous progress, starting with foundational developments and moving toward global adoption. With a focus on industry partnerships, decentralized governance, and sustainable technology, Lightchain AI is not only addressing present challenges but also building a scalable ecosystem that positions it as a leader in the future of decentralized intelligence. Why Experts Predict 11x Growth Experts are forecasting an 11x growth potential for Lightchain A I (LCAI) based on its innovative approach and market timing. The token’s combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain positions it to capitalize on two rapidly growing sectors. Unlike many early-stage projects, LCAI boasts a strong foundation with advanced AI integration, a clear roadmap, and robust tokenomics designed for scalability and utility. The presale price of $0.003 is particularly attractive, offering significant upside compared to competitors like Solana and Binance Coin during their nascent stages. Analysts point to its ability to address real-world challenges in decentralized finance (DeFi), including scalability, efficiency, and user accessibility, as key drivers of its anticipated growth. As investor demand grows for projects that blend innovation with practicality, LCAI’s strategic focus and strong fundamentals make it a standout candidate for exponential returns. Role of AI in Blockchain Evolution Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the blockchain industry by addressing critical challenges such as scalability, security, and efficiency. By integrating AI, blockchain projects can optimize transaction speeds, enhance smart contract functionality, and improve data analysis for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications. Lightchain AI (LCAI) exemplifies this evolution by leveraging AI to create a more intelligent and adaptive blockchain ecosystem. Its AI-driven algorithms enhance network performance, reduce energy consumption, and ensure greater reliability. This integration not only makes blockchain technology more accessible but also positions LCAI as a pioneer in the AI-blockchain convergence. As the demand for smarter, more efficient systems grows, AI is set to become a cornerstone of blockchain’s future, with LCAI leading the charge. Lightchain AI vs. Meme Coins Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a decentralized platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, offering real-world applications across various industries. In contrast, meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu primarily rely on community engagement and social media trends, often lacking intrinsic utility. Currently in its presale phase, LCAI tokens are available at $0.003, presenting an opportunity for early investors to support a project with substantial growth potential. This strategic entry point allows participants to engage with a platform that emphasizes technological innovation over speculative trading, distinguishing it from meme coins. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Solana’s 2021 bull run turned small investments into fortunes; now Rexas Finance (RXS) is being eyed as the next big crypto opportunity. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The Foundation of real-world asset tokenization Solana vs. Rexas Finance: A comparative outlook Predicting RXS’s potential returns RXS: The best bet Solana’s incredible bull run in 2021 transformed small investments into fortunes and shocked everyone. The price of Solana more than tripled following growing demand in the DeFi community and NFT hype. By the close of 2022, the hype had nearly dissipated, and now investors are vying for the next opportunity as the crypto market looks ready to take its next leap. Recent developments regarding Rexas Finance have raised some eyebrows as a potential “Solana killer” owing to its robust ecosystem and tokenomics in 2024. Those who missed the Solana boom but still want to secure and accumulate wealth through the crypto boom, RXS can help you right the wrongs. Crypto whales purchased RXS token You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Rexas Finance: The Foundation of real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance is carving out a niche addressing an even larger market: real-world assets. These include real estate, gold, art, and countless others, which are also accessible online. Here’s a fun fact to remember: gold and art account for over 121.2 trillion and 65 billion dollars, respectively. At the same time, the global real estate industry alone is worth almost 379.7 trillion dollars. Rexas Finance’s tokenization initiative is opening doors of opportunities for people off the streets for investments that have remained impossible otherwise. This is not only DeFi; it is the direction of world finance. As of this date, Rexas Finance is at $0.150 for presale stage 10. It’s picking up speed, as 92.95 % of stage 10 has already been completed. After stage 10, the price will increase by 15.38% to $0.175. Early investors can expect an average 400% profit in under three years, as the token is set to hit three top-tier exchanges at $0.20. At the same time, the token is strongly positioned and ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies. This led some market analysts to forecast that Rexas Finance will have a market capitalization of $67 billion by 2025. While Solana’s trajectory towards $400 is captivating, the real opportunity lies in identifying potentially very promising businesses at an earlier stage, making RXS difficult to miss out on at $0.150. Experts expect it could reach the $50 benchmark in 2025. The plan with RXS is to start trading cheaply at $50 in 2025, which translates to more than 33,000% in profits. Solana vs. Rexas Finance: A comparative outlook The key for Solana has always been having developer bases while always maintaining usability, and this is evident in the token’s onset of growth from a few dollars to $263 at its peak. However, scalability and centralization remain key areas for the latter. Conversely, Rexas Finance creates strong foundations for sustainable growth by anticipating challenges as a blockchain company within its ecosystem. With more than just a copious number of use cases for its technology, it leads by example in integrating with real economies. With the addition of artificial intelligence for yield enhancement and a treasury system aimed at decentralization, it has opportunities to go above and beyond Solana. Predicting RXS’s potential returns If RXS replicates Solana’s success, an investment of $400 at the present presale value of $0.150 could generate returns of a whopping $133,333.33 should it hit $50 in the next few years. This projection is based on its growing adoption, unique ecosystem, and potential to disrupt traditional asset markets. The growth trends evident across its adoption, innovative systems, and propensity to pursue the evolution of asset integration will give Rexas plenty of opportunities in the coming years. Additionally, RXS’s earning potential is further anchored by attributes like its listing in several crypto exchange trackers and its ability to showcase CertiK-audited contracts. The token’s existence is backed by a collection of clearly defined milestones borne of institutional interest, thereby ensuring longevity and growth irrespective of market trends. RXS: The best bet Rexas Finance offers everyone a unique chance to invest a mere $400 and make over $133,000 in weeks. The RXS token presale has picked up pace and is expected to aggravate the crypto landscape by tokenizing real-world assets and sophisticated blockchain technologies. RXS is expected to move its 11th presale stage soon. Now could be the time to invest in this project, understand the future of asset ownership, and trade with blockchain.

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino is unveiling Tether’s vision to launch a platform that will enable people to interact with artificial intelligence using their mobile phones, reports Bloomberg. Tether plans to launch the AI platform in the first quarter of 2025 as the company rakes in net profits of more than $10 billion this year. Ardoino says at least half of the profits will be allocated to AI and other investments next year. “Next year we plan to deploy at least half of the profits in investment. Our investment is just at the beginning.” Data from CoinMarketCap shows that USDT now has a market cap of about $140 billion, up by nearly $50 billion this year. Demand for the dollar-pegged asset surged as the crypto market rallied with Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaching the six-digit mark. In a report published earlier this month, Tether says the number of wallets holding USDT rose by 71% in 2024. The firm says that at the start of Q4 2024, there were 109 million on-chain wallets holding USDT– more than twice the number of wallets holding Bitcoin.

Historical chart patterns suggest that this might be the case after the social sentiment around the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently hit a low. Noteworthy, this is the lowest that this metric has gotten to since the beginning of 2024. Low Retail Investors’ Sentiment in Bitcoin Market The social sentiment went to an average ratio of four to five positive versus negative Bitcoin-related comments. In other words, there are fewer positive Bitcoin-related statements than negative ones. At Santiment, a blockchain analytics platform, analysts believe such low retail investor sentiment could signal an incoming Bitcoin breakout. In its December 22 post on X, Santiment wrote , “Vocal traders are now showing severe FUD, and that’s good news for contrarians who know markets move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations.” More Analysts Expect Bitcoin Price Correction Comparatively, Santiment is not alone in this, as other analysts and market experts expect a price correction for Bitcoin. The coin’s daily chart produced three consecutive red candles for the first time since the first week in November. Recall that this was when the United States presidential elections were held, and Republican politician Donald Trump won. In an earlier post, popular analyst Elja Boom wrote that Bitcoin could be set to recover above $100,000 in the short term. He based his expectation on emerging fractals on the daily chart while adding that such a trend has happened before. Bitcoin Trades Below $97,000 According to CoinMarketCap data, BTC’s price has decreased by approximately 11.32% from its all-time high (ATH) of $108,000, which it accomplished on December 17. The coin currently trades at $95,751.75 after losing 6.87% of its 24-hour price gain. The anticipated recovery could come before the end of the year or not. However, crypto analyst Rekt Capital sees the possibility of the correction extending by another week. To give credence to this prediction, the analyst shared an instance in 2017 when Week 7 and Weeks 8 and 9 were corrective. Another example is 2021, when Week 6 and Week 8 were corrective.

However, despite this lull, the XRP price has managed to maintain its critical support levels and is currently positioning itself for a potential recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Investment: Trump Crypto Project Grabs 722 ETH At $2.5 Million Interestingly, technical analysis highlights the $2.20 mark as a key level to watch for XRP going forward. This was noted in an analysis by popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who emphasized that XRP’s next major move could hinge on its outcome on this threshold. Key Levels To Watch: $2.20 Support And $2.70 Resistance The cryptocurrency market has faced significant selling pressure since December 17 led by Bitcoin’s break below support levels, leading to notable price corrections across various cryptocurrencies. XRP, in particular, saw its price fall from $2.708 on December 17 to bottom at $1.98 on December 20. This represented a 27% in three days. After it reached $1.98, the XRP price rebounded and regained the $2 price level. As it stands, XRP is now trading around $2.2, although it is still down by 7% in the weekly timeframe. XRP’s movement around the $2.2 price level has captured the attention of crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who suggested two ways the cryptocurrency can go from here. According to Ali Martinez, XRP’s ability to hold above the $2.20 support is crucial for its short-term bullish outlook. If this level remains intact, the token might enter a consolidation phase, but another attempt at the $2.70 resistance remains in play. From here, a strong bullish momentum above $2.7 could as well send the cryptocurrency above $3 for the first time in years. On the other hand, a break below $2.20 could trigger another quick XRP price decline toward $1.96 before it starts to attract fresh buying interest. Image From X: ali_charts Whale Accumulation Up Amid Crypto Market Correction On-chain data from Santiment suggests that XRP has captured the interest of whales during this recent downturn. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP coins have accumulated an additional 80 million XRP since December 17, which points to strong confidence in the token’s long-term potential among whale addresses. This accumulation could provide a cushion against further declines below the $2 mark and set the stage for an eventual recovery.
