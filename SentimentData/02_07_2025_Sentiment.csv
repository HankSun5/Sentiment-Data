For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the underlying currents that drive these movements is paramount. Currently, all eyes are on the Bitcoin network volume , which has settled into a fascinating state of equilibrium. This stabilization isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a crucial signal that could herald significant shifts in the near future for the king of cryptocurrencies. Understanding Bitcoin Network Volume Stabilization: A Crucial Indicator When we talk about Bitcoin network volume , we’re referring to the total value of transactions processed on the Bitcoin blockchain over a specific period. It’s a powerful metric, reflecting the overall activity and liquidity within the network. Recently, this vital indicator has found a steady footing, stabilizing around the $58.7 billion mark. This isn’t an arbitrary number; it falls squarely within a previously identified ‘balance zone’ ranging from $40 billion to $80 billion. Think of it like a pendulum that has temporarily stopped swinging wildly and is now resting in its central position. This period of stabilization often precedes a more decisive move. Historically, periods of high volatility are often followed by consolidation, where the market takes a breath, allowing supply and demand to find a temporary balance. The current volume suggests that neither buyers nor sellers are overwhelmingly dominating the market, creating a tense calm before a potential storm. This delicate balance means market participants are likely gathering strength for the next significant push. CryptoQuant Analysis Unveils Key Insights for BTC Price Movement Leading the charge in dissecting these market dynamics is CryptoQuant, a renowned on-chain analytics platform. Their senior analyst, Axel Adler Jr., has provided invaluable insights into what this stabilization could mean for future BTC price movement . According to Adler Jr.’s observations, the relationship between network volume and price peaks or troughs is often quite clear: Volume Nearing Upper Boundary ($80 Billion): Historically, when the network volume approaches or exceeds the upper end of this balance zone, it has often coincided with or immediately preceded significant price peaks. This suggests a surge in activity and interest, often marking a local top before a correction. It indicates a period of high participation, potentially driven by speculative fervor. Volume Dropping Below Lower Boundary ($40 Billion): Conversely, a sustained drop in volume below the $40 billion threshold has typically signaled weakening network activity and a potential lack of interest, often preceding or accompanying price declines. This indicates a drying up of liquidity and participation, as market players pull back. The current $58.7 billion figure places Bitcoin’s network volume squarely in the middle of this crucial range. This mid-range positioning, as highlighted by CryptoQuant analysis , implies a period of indecision or accumulation. It’s a waiting game where market participants are assessing their next moves, and the direction of the next significant price trend remains uncertain, yet imminent. This period allows for a build-up of pressure, which will eventually be released. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Trading Volume and Future Trends? The current state of Bitcoin trading volume is a fascinating study in market psychology. A stabilized volume in the mid-range suggests a few key possibilities for the immediate future: Consolidation Before Expansion: The most common interpretation is that Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase. This is a period where the price trades within a relatively narrow range, building energy for a breakout. The direction of this breakout—up or down—will largely depend on which side (buyers or sellers) eventually gains the upper hand, likely signaled by a decisive shift in volume. Accumulation or Distribution: For astute traders, a stable volume can indicate either accumulation (smart money buying up assets quietly) or distribution (smart money selling off assets quietly). Without a clear volume surge or drop, it’s hard to distinguish, making other indicators crucial. This phase often tests the patience of market participants. Awaiting a Catalyst: Often, markets in consolidation are simply waiting for a catalyst. This could be a major economic announcement, regulatory news, significant institutional adoption, or even a technical breakout from a key chart pattern. These external factors can quickly disrupt the current equilibrium. Understanding these potential scenarios is vital for anyone looking to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. The current stability is not a sign of stagnation, but rather a coiled spring, ready to release its energy in one direction or another. This period offers an opportunity for strategic positioning, but also demands caution. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: Actionable Strategies for Investors Given the current insights from the CryptoQuant analysis regarding Bitcoin network volume , what actionable steps can investors and traders take? Navigating the complex world of crypto market trends requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some key considerations: Monitor Volume Closely: Pay keen attention to any sustained deviations from the $58.7 billion mark. A decisive push towards $80 billion could signal an impending bullish move, while a drop below $40 billion might warn of further downside. Volume often confirms price trends, adding conviction to breakouts or breakdowns. Combine with Price Action: Volume should never be viewed in isolation. Observe how price behaves within the consolidation range. Are there higher lows or lower highs forming? A break above or below key support/resistance levels, especially on increased volume, is a strong signal that a new trend is forming. Utilize Other Technical Indicators: Complement your volume analysis with other tools like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands. These can provide additional confirmation or divergence signals, offering a more holistic view of market health. Stay Informed on Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate decisions, inflation data, and geopolitical events can significantly impact the crypto market, overriding technical signals. Global events can often serve as the catalyst that breaks consolidation. Risk Management is Key: In periods of uncertainty, disciplined risk management becomes even more critical. Define your entry and exit points, set stop-losses, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Capital preservation should be a top priority during these waiting periods. This period of stability offers a unique opportunity for strategic planning rather than reactive trading. By understanding the signals, you can position yourself more effectively for the next major shift in the market. The Broader Impact on Crypto Market Trends Bitcoin’s status as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its movements often dictate the broader crypto market trends . When Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins often follow suit, or experience increased volatility as capital flows into or out of them based on speculative plays. A decisive move by Bitcoin, once it breaks from its current volume equilibrium, will likely cascade throughout the entire digital asset ecosystem, impacting everything from major altcoins to emerging DeFi projects. This interdependency underscores the importance of keeping a vigilant eye on Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics, particularly its network volume. It’s not just about Bitcoin; it’s about the health and direction of the entire crypto space. As institutional adoption continues to grow and regulatory clarity emerges, the underlying network health, as reflected by stable and growing transaction volumes, becomes an even more critical metric for long-term investors seeking stability and growth in their portfolios. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key as Bitcoin Awaits Its Next Move The stabilization of Bitcoin network volume at $58.7 billion is more than just a data point; it’s a compelling narrative of a market in suspense. As highlighted by the insightful CryptoQuant analysis , this balance zone between $40 billion and $80 billion has historically been a precursor to significant BTC price movement . While the exact direction remains to be seen, the message is clear: a major shift is brewing. Whether it’s an explosive surge or a cautious retreat, the cues will likely come from how Bitcoin trading volume evolves from its current equilibrium. For anyone invested in or observing the crypto market trends , this is a period demanding vigilance, careful analysis, and strategic positioning. The next chapter for Bitcoin is about to unfold, and understanding its network’s pulse will be your guide.

After celebrating an impressive 300,000 orders for their newly launched vehicle, Xiaomi is under fire for being unable to commit to a fast delivery timeline for the orders. Xiaomi hits customers with year-long delivery delays Xiaomi is under fire from a wave of angry customers after revealing that the deliveries of its newly launched YU7 electric SUV could take up to 60 weeks. The YU7, which debuted on June 27, 2025, attracted widespread interest. According to Xiaomi, it received around 240,000 orders in just 18 hours. However, only a limited number of units were available for immediate delivery. By Tuesday, Xiaomi’s official app showed estimated wait times of between 38 to 60 weeks for new orders, sparking outrage among buyers who say they were blindsided by the delay. Customers let off some steam on Sina’s Black Cat complaint platform, a Chinese consumer rights website. Since Friday, more than 400 buyers have submitted formal complaints, citing that Xiaomi was not transparent about the delivery timeline. The customers are complaining that the company did not reveal the extended delivery window until after they had completed their orders, at which point they had already made a non-refundable deposit of 5,000 yuan, approximately $698. “I would not have placed the order if I had known it would take over a year,” one user wrote on the Black Cat platform. Dozens of other buyers echoed this sentiment. Customers also raised concerns about possible financial penalties, particularly the risk of missing out on China’s current tax exemption for electric vehicles, which is scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. A delayed delivery into 2026 could leave some buyers paying thousands more than they initially anticipated. Xiaomi has not officially commented on the controversy . However, the company’s CEO, Lei Jun announced on Weibo that he would address “frequently asked questions” about the YU7 rollout during a livestream event scheduled for Wednesday. Earlier this year, Xiaomi dealt with consumer frustration over a fatal crash involving its first model, the SU7 sedan, and over delivery timelines and unclear options for that vehicle as well. The reality of EV production The YU7’s launch was widely anticipated. The vehicle was positioned as a direct rival to Tesla’s Model Y, the best-selling SUV in China currently. The YU7 comes in at a base price of 253,500 yuan, approximately $35,360, which is about 4% cheaper than the Model Y. Xiaomi’s CEO, Lei Jun, has repeatedly stated that the company intends to challenge Tesla’s dominance in the SUV industry with the YU7, just as the SU7 has outperformed Tesla’s Model 3 in monthly sales since December. But the YU7’s popularity probably beat the company’s expectations, which impacted its ability to deliver. On its part, Xiaomi’s EV production facility in Beijing has grown aggressively. Monthly output increased from 4,000 units in March 2024 to 28,000 units in May 2025, and it plans to expand further with new factories on two nearby plots of land. However, the delivery delays bring the discrepancies between Xiaomi’s marketing ambitions and its operational capacity in the EV industry to the fore.

The recent plunge of the US Dollar to its lowest point since February 2022 is one such seismic event, sending ripples across the global economy and prompting questions about its potential impact on the volatile crypto landscape. This isn’t just a fleeting dip; it signals deeper shifts in economic sentiment and central bank strategies. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating today’s interconnected financial world, especially those looking at the future of digital assets. What’s Driving the US Dollar’s Unprecedented Decline? The mighty US Dollar , long considered a bastion of stability, has been steadily losing ground. Its recent fall below key support levels, hitting lows not seen since early 2022, isn’t a random occurrence. Several intertwined factors are contributing to this significant depreciation, creating a complex scenario for investors and policymakers alike. Shifting Fed Policy Expectations: The primary catalyst appears to be a recalibration of expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s interest rate trajectory. After an aggressive hiking cycle to combat inflation, markets are now pricing in potential rate cuts earlier than previously anticipated. Lower interest rates typically make a currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield, leading to capital outflows and a weaker dollar. Cooling Inflation Data: Recent economic indicators suggest that inflation in the US is gradually moderating. While good news for consumers, it reduces the urgency for the Fed to maintain restrictive monetary policy. This perceived easing of inflationary pressures directly influences Fed policy expectations. Improved Global Economic Outlook (Relative): While the US economy has shown resilience, other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, are showing signs of stabilization or even modest improvement. This narrows the growth differential that previously favored the dollar, as investors find more attractive opportunities elsewhere. Rising Risk Appetite: A weakening dollar often coincides with a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more willing to venture into riskier assets like emerging market stocks or cryptocurrencies, rather than holding onto safe-haven assets like the dollar. The Currency Market’s New Reality: A Shift in Global Dynamics The weakening US Dollar has profound implications for the broader currency market and international trade. A cheaper dollar makes US exports more competitive globally, which could provide a boost to American manufacturers. Conversely, imports become more expensive for US consumers, potentially contributing to inflationary pressures domestically, even as the Fed aims to cool them. For other nations, a weaker dollar can be a mixed blessing. Countries holding significant dollar-denominated debt may find their repayment burden eased, as it takes less of their local currency to service the debt. However, nations heavily reliant on dollar-denominated imports, such as oil, might face higher costs. The euro, yen, and other major currencies have seen appreciation against the dollar, reflecting this shift in relative strength and impacting their respective economies. Consider the following dynamics in the current currency market : Factor Impact on USD Current Trend Interest Rate Differentials Higher rates attract capital Narrowing (Fed potentially cutting) Inflation Outlook Lower inflation, less need for high rates Cooling Economic Growth Strong growth attracts capital Moderating Geopolitical Stability Safe-haven demand for USD Volatile This intricate dance of economic indicators and market sentiment shapes the daily movements of the currency market , creating both challenges and opportunities for investors worldwide. Deciphering Fed Policy Signals: More Than Just Interest Rates Understanding the Federal Reserve’s actions, or anticipated actions, is paramount when analyzing the US Dollar ‘s trajectory. Fed policy is a complex beast, extending beyond simple interest rate adjustments. The central bank employs various tools and communications strategies to steer the economy, and the market’s interpretation of these signals is often as impactful as the actions themselves. Forward Guidance: The Fed’s communication about its future policy intentions is crucial. Any hint of a dovish pivot (leaning towards lower rates) or hawkish stance (leaning towards higher rates) can send immediate shockwaves through the currency market . The recent emphasis on data dependency and a less aggressive tone has been a key factor in the dollar’s decline. Quantitative Tightening (QT): Beyond interest rates, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction, known as quantitative tightening, also influences liquidity and market rates. While less direct than rate hikes, the shrinking of the Fed’s asset holdings can reduce overall dollar supply in the financial system. However, market focus has largely shifted to rate cuts as the more immediate driver. Dual Mandate: The Fed operates under a dual mandate: maximizing employment and maintaining price stability (controlling inflation). As inflation shows signs of cooling, the market perceives that the Fed might prioritize supporting employment or avoiding a recession, potentially leading to earlier rate cuts. The market is constantly trying to front-run the Fed, leading to periods of significant volatility. The current sentiment suggests that the market believes the Fed’s tightening cycle is over, and the next move will be downwards, putting sustained pressure on the US Dollar . Global Economy on Edge: Navigating Uncertainty The weakening US Dollar is not an isolated event; it is a symptom and a driver of broader shifts in the global economy . As the world grapples with persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and the lingering effects of supply chain disruptions, the stability of major currencies becomes a focal point. A significant depreciation of the dollar can reverberate across international trade, commodity markets, and investment flows. Inflationary Pressures: While a stronger dollar helps import cheaper goods and thus combat inflation, a weaker dollar could rekindle inflationary pressures in the US by making imports more expensive. For other nations, a weaker dollar can ease their own inflationary burdens if they import dollar-denominated goods. Commodity Prices: Most global commodities, including oil, gold, and industrial metals, are priced in US Dollar s. When the dollar weakens, these commodities become cheaper for buyers using other currencies, which can lead to increased demand and potentially higher prices in dollar terms. This dynamic often makes gold an attractive hedge during periods of dollar weakness. Emerging Markets: Many emerging economies hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar can provide a much-needed reprieve, reducing the cost of servicing these debts and freeing up capital for domestic investment. Conversely, a strong dollar can cripple these economies. Geopolitical Factors: Global stability, or lack thereof, always plays a role. Ongoing conflicts and trade disputes can lead to capital flight to perceived safe havens. While the dollar traditionally serves this role, prolonged weakness might prompt investors to seek alternative safe havens, including certain cryptocurrencies. The current environment is characterized by a delicate balance between growth, inflation, and policy responses, making the future trajectory of the global economy highly uncertain. The Crypto Market Impact: A Haven or a Hazard? The relationship between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning world of digital assets is increasingly intertwined. A weakening US Dollar can have a significant crypto market impact , influencing everything from Bitcoin’s price to stablecoin dynamics. Bitcoin as a ‘Digital Gold’: Historically, Bitcoin has often been touted as a hedge against inflation and a store of value akin to gold. When the US Dollar weakens, some investors may reallocate capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as an alternative asset that is not directly controlled by central banks. This narrative gains traction during periods of fiat currency instability. Stablecoin Implications: The vast majority of stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, are pegged to the US Dollar . While a weakening dollar doesn’t directly de-peg them, it does mean that the purchasing power of these stablecoins decreases in real terms. For crypto investors holding significant stablecoin reserves, this erosion of value could prompt a shift into other cryptocurrencies or assets. Increased Risk Appetite: As mentioned, a weaker dollar often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment in traditional markets. This increased appetite for risk can spill over into the crypto space, encouraging investors to move into more volatile assets like altcoins, seeking higher returns. Accessibility and Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also make crypto assets relatively cheaper for international investors holding stronger currencies, potentially increasing global demand and liquidity in the crypto markets. While the correlation isn’t always direct or immediate, the macroeconomic backdrop, particularly the strength or weakness of the US Dollar , remains a critical factor influencing the broader crypto market impact and investor sentiment. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility In an environment where the US Dollar is experiencing significant fluctuations and the global economy is in flux, investors need a robust strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversification is Key: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes, including traditional assets like equities and bonds, as well as alternative assets like gold and cryptocurrencies. This can help mitigate risks associated with the weakening US Dollar . Monitor Fed Policy Closely: Keep a keen eye on statements and actions from the Federal Reserve. Any shifts in their rhetoric or policy decisions regarding interest rates or quantitative easing/tightening will directly impact the currency market and, by extension, other asset classes. Understand Your Exposure: Assess your portfolio’s exposure to the US Dollar , both directly and indirectly. If you hold dollar-denominated assets, understand how a continued decline might affect their value in your local currency. For crypto investors, be mindful of stablecoin holdings. Consider Global Opportunities: A weaker dollar can make investments in non-US markets more attractive. Explore opportunities in economies whose currencies are strengthening against the dollar, or in companies with significant international revenue streams. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unnerving, maintaining a long-term investment perspective is often beneficial. Focus on fundamental analysis and avoid making rash decisions based on daily market swings. These insights can help investors make informed decisions in a volatile currency market , whether they are focused on traditional assets or exploring the potential of the crypto market impact . Conclusion: A New Era for Global Finance The recent decline of the US Dollar to its lowest point since February 2022 is more than just a headline; it signals a potentially transformative period for the global economy and financial markets. Driven by evolving Fed policy expectations and shifting economic fundamentals, this weakness in the world’s primary reserve currency creates both challenges and unique opportunities. For those in the cryptocurrency space, these macroeconomic shifts are particularly pertinent, as they can influence capital flows, investor sentiment, and the very narrative around digital assets as alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. Navigating this new era requires vigilance, adaptability, and a comprehensive understanding of how interconnected global finance truly is. As the currency market continues to evolve, staying informed about these macro trends will be crucial for making strategic decisions, whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newcomer to the world of digital assets. The ripple effects of the dollar’s performance will continue to shape the financial landscape for months to come, making it imperative to be prepared for the ongoing shifts and potential for significant crypto market impact .

This consolidation phase has continued as the leading digital asset enters the third quarter of the year. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , BTC may perform even more poorly over the next three months, as this quarter has historically been its weakest. BTC in A Waiting Game Bitfinex analysts say BTC is in a waiting game, with reduced profit-taking and cooling signs seen in overall on-chain and exchange activity. The cryptocurrency bottomed at $99,830 last week, triggering significant liquidations across the futures market. Both long and short traders were hit with liquidations totaling hundreds of millions each. Bitcoin-denominated open interest also declined 7.2% from 360,000 BTC to 334,000 BTC. Bitfinex said the liquidations and decline in open interest indicated a forced de-leveraging event that cleared speculative positions on both sides. The flush reflected a highly reactive environment where overextended traders were caught off guard, leading to a short-term reset. With open interest now rebalanced by the flush, analysts believe the market is better positioned for decisive action. There are expectations of deviations above and below the $100,000-$110,000 range in the near term as Q3 progresses. Moreover, there have often been seasonality changes in market conditions between Q2 and Q3 in the past. BTC has recorded an average return of 27.12% in Q2 and 6.03% in Q3 since 2013. With market volatility expected to reduce this quarter, experts believe range-bound price action will continue for longer. Market Structure Still Healthy On a general note, the ongoing consolidation phase marks the first notable slowdown in bitcoin’s momentum since April 9, when the asset fell to $74,000 due to fear driven by escalating tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. Since then, BTC has rallied roughly 50% to new all-time highs (ATHs), showing resilience. Although the momentum from that uptrend has begun to weaken, the broader market structure remains healthy with higher support zones intact. On-chain data suggests BTC is in a transition phase and could either enter correction mode or continue with sideways reaccumulation. A continued lack of spot volume and intensified profit-taking could trigger a significant decline.

SHIB is pushing against resistance and could break out if momentum stays. At the same time, Ethereum remains steady, backed by solid staking data and ongoing ETF flows. In contrast, Web3 ai stands out with its focus on usability. Rather than chasing trends, it puts $WAI to work by powering features, rewards, and access within its platform. With more than $8.6 million raised already, early buyers from Stage 1 now see a clear path to a 1,747% return. Shib Technicals Tighten Near Key Resistance The current price movement for Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows the asset staying above its $0.00001100 support level. This marks a shift following recent declines. The token now hovers close to a descending trendline, approaching a resistance area near $0.00001234 to $0.00001238. A move above this range could lift SHIB to $0.00001368, depending on sustained volume levels. Short-term indicators suggest a buildup around the 200-hour moving average. This adds strength to a possible breakout. SHIB’s price staying above $0.00001170 means the $0.00001200 pivot level becomes a key marker. If it reclaims this level and holds, SHIB could move into a short-term bullish structure. Ethereum Price Maintains Support Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,511 after dropping 9.4% from its recent high above $2,800. Despite the dip, more than 35 million ETH are now staked, reducing liquid supply and supporting price. Long-term interest in ETH remains strong, with 22.8 million ETH held by accumulation addresses. Analysts are tracking the 50-week exponential moving average as an important signal. Historically, ETH has made large moves after crossing this level. Meanwhile, spot Ether ETFs have now seen 19 days of continuous inflows, totaling $1.37 billion. This points to consistent institutional attention. Web3 ai’s $WAI: Real Use Fuels Long-Term Value Instead of just riding on market excitement, Web3 ai connects its $WAI asset to real utility. Users will need $WAI to access a wide range of features like AI tools, discounted subscriptions, and governance voting. This means $WAI acts as the main fuel for all platform functions. It also burns a set amount yearly, which helps support long-term value as demand grows. The presale so far has raised more than $8.6 million. Over 23.5 billion $WAI have been sold, and the current price in Stage 9 is $0.000443. The launch price is fixed at $0.005242, making the return for early Stage 1 buyers potentially 1,747%. This structure allows clear tracking and builds trust across all stages. Looking ahead, the platform will offer tools for DeFi planning, scam alerts, portfolio handling, and risk checks, all available through mobile, web, and browser. Web3 ai supports cross-chain use on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, and Polygon. Since access depends on $WAI, wider adoption could shrink supply quickly. With prices still low, many see $WAI as one of the top crypto options to watch in 2025. The Bottom Line SHIB’s ability to maintain support and challenge resistance shows signs of a possible short-term move. Ethereum’s steady metrics, high staking, and rising institutional flows show it remains a strong force. Meanwhile, Web3 ai is growing fast with a strong use-based model. With $WAI required for access, and over $8.6 million already raised, the project continues to gain traction. The 1,747% ROI makes it a standout choice for those exploring serious utility-backed crypto options for 2025.

The study notes that Bitcoin already rebounded from $101,000 to about $108,000 in the past week as traders digested a potent cocktail of cooling inflation, thawing geopolitics and an increasingly dovish Federal Reserve stance. Perfect Storm Brewing For Bitcoin Bitwise’s proprietary Cryptoasset Sentiment Index has surged to its most optimistic reading since May—“now clearly signal[ing] a bullish sentiment again,” the authors write. Behind that surge lies an unprecedented torrent of capital into exchange-traded products: cumulative net inflows to global Bitcoin ETPs have reached a year-to-date record of $14.3 billion, with five consecutive sessions last week adding another $2.2 billion—or roughly 20,763 BTC—to the pile. “Cumulative net inflows … signal potential upside opportunity for the price of Bitcoin,” Bitwise says, adding that US spot ETFs are now on a 14-day winning streak that could eclipse the 16-day record set shortly after launch in early 2024. Related Reading: Warning Signs? Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Take Profits as Leverage Spikes Why are investors suddenly embracing risk? Bitwise points to what it calls a “decline in macro uncertainty.” July may deliver new US trade accords with Canada, while Washington and Tehran have struck a surprisingly conciliatory tone; former President Donald Trump has even floated lifting sanctions if Iran remains peaceful. On top of that, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has tied the timing of a resumption of rate cuts to progress on tariff talks—an alignment that leaves the door open to looser policy within weeks. The report sums up the mood: “The trifecta of declining geopolitical risks, trade policy uncertainty and potential monetary policy stimulus should continue to lift market sentiment and provide a significant tailwind for Bitcoin and other crypto assets.” *** 𝗡𝗘𝗪 *** We have just published our latest 𝗕𝗶𝘁𝘄𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗹𝘆 𝗕𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗶𝗻 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗿𝗼 𝗜𝗻𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿 report for 𝗝𝘂𝗹𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱!

Whale wallets (1,000 BTC or more) withdrew 8,740 BTC from exchanges last week, exchange reserves sank to 2.898 million BTC—just 14.6 % of supply—and net selling pressure on spot venues fell from $2.2 billion to only $0.5 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Freezes Over $100,000 As OG Whales ‘Dump On Wall Street’: Expert Derivatives paint a more nuanced picture: futures open interest slid by 20,000 BTC, and bearish perpetual funding rates hint at lingering short bias, but options markets show traders quietly standing down—put-call open interest fell to 0.59 while one-month implied volatilities eased toward 38%. Bitwise interprets the combination as “short-term consolidation” in the face of an intact longer-term uptrend. Traditional markets are also thawing. Bitwise’s Cross-Asset Risk Appetite (CARA) index jumped from 0.31 to 0.49, reinforcing evidence that capital is rotating back into growth-sensitive trades. Some 70% of tracked altcoins beat Bitcoin last week, a breadth thrust historically associated with early-cycle bull phases. In its bottom-line assessment, Bitwise stops short of price targets but leaves little doubt about direction: as long as geopolitical détente, trade breakthroughs and an accommodative Fed converge with relentless ETF inflows, “a decisive return in global risk appetite” is likely to keep Bitcoin on an upward trajectory. Should US spot ETFs secure just three more sessions of net inflows this week—surpassing their 2024 record—the firm suggests the market may discover how quickly a supply-constrained asset can react when the macro wind blows at its back. At press time, BTC traded at $106,840.

Based on his previous influence on price, analysts believe his latest developments could trigger another substantial move. First Rally Driven by CEO’s Messaging In November 2024, XRP experienced a substantial rally, rising from approximately $0.50 to over $2 within weeks. Analysts attribute this surge in part to Garlinghouse’s announcements about growing institutional support for XRP-based investment products. He confirmed that several major asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Funds, and 21Shares, had filed for XRP ETFs. At the time, he noted that “institutional interest in XRP products is stronger than ever.” That public statement helped shift investor sentiment, setting the stage for XRP’s 580% increase through January 2025, when prices briefly exceeded $3. New CEO Update Fuels Bullish Optimism Recently, Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple will withdraw its cross-appeal in the ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case. This move signals a near conclusion to a multi-year legal dispute that has traditionally weighed on XRP’s price. At the time of the announcement, XRP was valued at approximately $2, and it has remained relatively stable since. Analysts see parallels between this update and the prior period when Garlinghouse’s messages preceded a strong market rally. By removing a major legal uncertainty, this step could prompt fresh interest from investors and institutions. Some believe this development sets the groundwork for a renewed bullish trend. One prominent voice on X, known as XFinanceBull, has noted the similarity in market dynamics. He referenced Garlinghouse’s previous role in guiding XRP into a new price range and believes that the current signals could generate a similar effect. With XRP trading around $2.19 as of report time, another surge of 580% would place the token near $15. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation Grows Around Potential 10X Move In addition to the cross-appeal announcement, Garlinghouse’s social media activity has intensified speculation. A repost featuring his XRP tattoo prompted widespread community attention. One user queried whether the tattoo represented his ongoing commitment to XRP, and Garlinghouse responded simply with “1,000%” . This brief reply sparked excitement among supporters, including influencer Alex Cobb, who interpreted the response as an indication that XRP could appreciate tenfold. If XRP did indeed increase by 1,000% from its current price of $2.19, it would reach approximately $22–$24 per coin. At that level, XRP’s market capitalization would approach $1.4 trillion, surpassing the value of major corporate giants such as Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway. However, analysts caution that this scenario is highly speculative and relies on numerous assumptions about future demand, regulatory conditions, and overall market behavior.

In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, one company continues to stand out with its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy has once again delivered phenomenal results, cementing its position as a pioneer in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. The latest news from Michael Saylor, the visionary founder of MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), reveals a staggering $4.4 billion gain in Bitcoin value during the second quarter of this year. This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a bold vision and a remarkable Bitcoin Investment Strategy that continues to yield impressive returns. How Did MicroStrategy Achieve Such a Significant Bitcoin Gain? MicroStrategy’s Q2 performance is nothing short of extraordinary. Michael Saylor shared on X that the company achieved a 7.8% Bitcoin yield in the second quarter. This yield translated into an astounding gain of 41,407 BTC, which, at current valuations, amounts to approximately $4.4 billion. For context, this significant gain wasn’t from trading; it’s a result of the appreciation of their existing substantial MSTR Bitcoin Holdings . MicroStrategy has consistently pursued a strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, viewing it as a primary treasury reserve asset rather than a speculative short-term trade. This long-term ‘HODL’ approach has allowed the company to weather market volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin’s upward trajectory over time. Let’s break down the core elements contributing to this success: Consistent Accumulation: MicroStrategy began its Bitcoin acquisition journey in August 2020 and has continued to add to its reserves through various market conditions. This dollar-cost averaging approach has helped them build a substantial position at an attractive average price. Unwavering Conviction: Michael Saylor’s conviction in Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and a superior store of value has been a guiding principle. This belief has allowed the company to maintain its strategy even during periods of significant price corrections. Market Timing (Fortuitous): While not purely speculative, MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation coincided with a period of growing institutional interest and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, contributing to its price appreciation. Transparency and Leadership: Saylor’s open communication about their strategy and holdings has fostered trust among investors and positioned MicroStrategy as a leader in the Corporate Bitcoin Adoption space. What Does This Mean for MSTR Bitcoin Holdings and the Broader Market? MicroStrategy’s latest achievement reinforces its status as the largest publicly traded company with significant Bitcoin reserves. This isn’t just about their balance sheet; it sends a powerful message to the financial world. When a NASDAQ-listed company can demonstrate such substantial gains from its digital asset strategy, it legitimizes Bitcoin as a viable and lucrative investment for corporate treasuries. The sheer scale of MicroStrategy’s holdings means their actions often influence market sentiment and discussions around institutional crypto adoption. Here’s why their success matters beyond their own books: Aspect Impact on MicroStrategy Broader Market Implication Shareholder Value Increased equity value, attracting more investors. Demonstrates a new avenue for corporate value creation. Balance Sheet Strength Enhanced financial stability and liquidity. Encourages other companies to consider Bitcoin for treasury. Market Perception Solidifies its reputation as a leading Bitcoin proxy stock. Boosts confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability as an asset. Innovation Leadership Positions MicroStrategy at the forefront of financial innovation. Sparks broader discussions on integrating digital assets into traditional finance. What is Michael Saylor’s Strategy Going Forward? Michael Saylor Strategy has always been clear: Bitcoin is the future of corporate treasury. His vision extends beyond simply holding Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into the very fabric of MicroStrategy’s financial operations. Saylor frequently articulates his belief that Bitcoin is a superior asset for long-term wealth preservation and growth, far outperforming traditional fiat currencies and even gold over extended periods. He views Bitcoin as an essential hedge against inflation and a foundational element for the digital economy. Saylor’s public statements and actions suggest a continued commitment to this strategy. He often emphasizes the scarcity of Bitcoin, its decentralized nature, and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. This long-term perspective is crucial. Unlike many institutional investors who might dabble in crypto for short-term gains, MicroStrategy’s approach is deeply rooted in a philosophical belief about Bitcoin’s fundamental value. This conviction is a key differentiator and a significant factor in their ability to maintain their position as the largest corporate holder. Can Other Companies Adopt a Similar Bitcoin Investment Strategy? MicroStrategy’s success naturally prompts the question: Can other companies replicate this? While MicroStrategy has certainly paved the way, adopting a comprehensive Bitcoin Investment Strategy requires a specific set of considerations and a strong conviction from leadership. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, given Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. Here are some insights for other corporations considering a similar path: Leadership Conviction: As seen with Michael Saylor, strong leadership that understands and believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value is paramount. Without this, internal and external pressures during market downturns can derail the strategy. Risk Management: While the gains are significant, the risks of volatility must be thoroughly understood and managed. This includes assessing potential impairment charges under accounting rules and maintaining sufficient liquidity. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Companies must navigate these complexities and ensure compliance with all relevant laws and accounting standards. Long-Term Horizon: MicroStrategy’s success is largely due to its long-term holding strategy. Companies looking for quick profits might find Bitcoin’s volatility challenging. A commitment to a multi-year horizon is often necessary. Shareholder Communication: Transparent communication with shareholders about the rationale, risks, and performance of the Bitcoin strategy is vital to maintain trust and support. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: What’s Next? The success of MicroStrategy is a powerful case study for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, more companies might look to diversify their treasury holdings with digital assets. The emergence of Bitcoin ETFs and clearer regulatory frameworks could further de-risk the process for institutional investors, making it more accessible for mainstream corporations. MicroStrategy’s Q2 gains aren’t just a win for them; they serve as a beacon, highlighting the potential for innovative treasury management in the digital age. This ongoing narrative will undoubtedly continue to shape discussions around the future of finance, blurring the lines between traditional assets and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. As the digital transformation accelerates, MicroStrategy’s pioneering spirit in the Bitcoin space will likely be studied for years to come. A Concluding Thought: The Power of Conviction MicroStrategy’s latest financial triumph with its MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy underscores the power of conviction in the face of market skepticism. The $4.4 billion gain in Q2 is not merely a financial milestone; it’s a validation of a bold, long-term vision. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have demonstrated that with a clear strategy and unwavering belief, digital assets can be a profound source of value creation for publicly traded companies. Their journey continues to inspire and educate, proving that innovation in corporate finance is not just possible, but potentially immensely rewarding.

But the latest announcement could mark its most significant turning point yet. This week, BlockDAG confirmed official partnerships with two prominent U.S. sports franchises — the Seattle Seawolves (two-time Major League Rugby champions) and the Seattle Orcas (a top Major League Cricket contender). These announcements don’t just signal a new marketing chapter for the Layer 1 network — they hint at what could soon be one of the largest crypto sponsorship deals in U.S. history. The final regulatory greenlight is pending, but sources close to the project say the deal is already locked. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11 and a massive 100 million BDAG token airdrop already underway, the project’s momentum is undeniable. Investors are rushing to secure BDAG at the fixed $0.0016 price before the countdown officially begins. From the Field to the Blockchain: What These Deals Mean for BlockDAG Sponsoring sports teams isn’t new in crypto — but few projects enter with the groundwork BlockDAG has laid. Rather than splashy, overpriced logo deals, these partnerships are part of a calculated U.S. expansion strategy. The Seattle Seawolves , known for their championship runs and loyal fanbase, bring BlockDAG into the American rugby scene — a sport with increasing digital crossover appeal. Meanwhile, the Seattle Orcas represent one of cricket’s fastest-growing U.S. franchises, tapping into a global audience with deep Web3 overlap. These aren’t isolated marketing stunts. They’re entry points into fan ecosystems primed for digital engagement — perfect for BlockDAG’s community-driven roadmap. With mining, airdrops, and testnet interactions at the center of the platform, onboarding millions of sports fans could mark a new user acquisition frontier. The $600 Million Target and a Record-Setting Presale While crypto prices oscillate, BlockDAG’s presale trajectory has been remarkably stable — and explosive. Already crossing the $328 million mark with over 200,000 BDAG holders , the project’s goal of hitting $600 million is no longer distant speculation. Part of that success stems from a deliberate rollout: X1 Miner App (now with over 2M users) introduced mobile-first mining 18,000+ ASIC miners sold, laying the groundwork for scalable rewards A testnet with active smart contract deployment and no-code dApp tools Strategic referral systems and “Buyer Battles” to gamify buying The ongoing airdrop campaign — allocating 100 million BDAG tokens — is amplifying this momentum. Participants can earn by testing the network, engaging socially, or referring others. Unlike most passive airdrops, BlockDAG’s campaign is tied to ecosystem participation, providing both traction and telemetry. The Sponsorship That Could Change the Game At the heart of this story lies something bigger. While the Seawolves and Orcas mark major wins, they’re also precursors to what the team is calling a “massive U.S. sponsorship deal” — one that’s already confirmed and only awaiting regulatory clearance. Though BlockDAG hasn’t revealed the name yet, internal posts suggest it could rival some of the largest crypto marketing campaigns to date. What sets this apart is timing and infrastructure. Projects like FTX entered the sponsorship game with unproven models and shaky backend support. BlockDAG, by contrast, is launching these deals alongside real ecosystem milestones: Mainnet deployment is part of the upcoming six-week rollout 40% of presale tokens will be airdropped to wallets during that window DeFi protocols, oracles, indexers, and DEX infrastructure will go live Users will be running nodes and mining pools before tokens hit exchanges In short, it’s not just branding — it’s branding that coincides with product activation. Why BDAG Is Booming Now Between the fixed presale price ($0.0016 until August 11 ), the surge in media exposure, and the expanding infrastructure, BDAG’s appeal as the “best crypto to buy now” is building fast. The project’s launch price is set at $0.05, meaning early buyers are looking at a potential 3,025% ROI — and that’s before any exchange-based speculation or price discovery. Institutional interest is quietly circling. The hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work structure appeals to developers frustrated by scalability bottlenecks. At the same time, the project’s CertiK audit, mobile-friendly UX, and no-code development tools make it retail-accessible in ways Layer 1 competitors like Kaspa and Avalanche haven’t been able to fully achieve. In crypto, most marketing ends with the announcement. For BlockDAG, these sports deals are only the beginning. With a proven presale engine, real tech traction, and a multi-layer launch strategy, this Layer 1 isn’t playing the game — it’s rewriting the playbook. And with the price fixed at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG might be one of the last major projects offering this kind of access before launch.

Meme coins had their wild run, but the spotlight is shifting. People want real use, open systems, and ideas that reward action over hype. Unstaked is right at the center of this change. It’s introducing a concept called “Proof of Intelligence,” but it’s not alone. ONDO, APT, and HYPE are also getting noticed. Here’s why these four projects are creating serious buzz this year. Unstaked ($UNSD): Turning AI Work Into Real Crypto Power Unstaked is flipping the script. Instead of hype coins that rise on noise, it links value to what AI agents actually do. These agents will work across digital spaces, carrying out tasks that are tracked and stored on-chain. It’s the core of what Unstaked calls its “Proof of Intelligence” system. This isn’t just a cool idea, it’s already pulling in big numbers. The presale is in Stage 22 with a price of $0.012091, and more than $10.5 million has been raised. Once it goes live, the token is set to launch at $0.1819, showing a possible 2,700% return for those getting in early. The AI agents haven’t launched yet. They’ll go live after the presale, giving early supporters a real shot at shaping how this network works. That’s why many are calling Unstaked the best crypto to invest in 2025, because it’s not just another token; it’s access to an entirely new kind of digital economy. ONDO (ONDO): Turning Real Assets into On-Chain Yield ONDO is stepping up by linking the world of traditional finance with decentralized tools. Its focus is on turning assets like U.S. Treasuries into tokens, letting crypto users access steady, yield-based returns without leaving the blockchain. As more people chase lower-risk options, ONDO’s setup is starting to catch serious interest. What really sets ONDO apart is its growing ties with platforms that meet institutional standards. As the rules around crypto slowly become clearer, ONDO’s early move into tokenized finance could give it an edge. It may not be driven by memes, but for those focused on stable returns, ONDO is a smart choice in the best crypto to invest in 2025 conversation. Aptos (APT): Building for Builders Behind the Scenes Some blockchains race for speed or grab attention through branding. Aptos is doing something else, focusing on tools that make life easier for developers. Made by former Meta engineers, Aptos uses the Move language to create safe, scalable contracts that power next-gen apps and wallets. More developers are now choosing Aptos for its mix of flexibility and strength. It’s not trying to go viral; it’s laying a solid base. That quiet approach is winning over those who want long-term potential. Aptos easily earns a place among the best crypto to invest in 2025 for its strong focus on building the future. HYPE (HYPE): Fueling Crypto Through Crowd Energy HYPE lives up to its name but adds a smart twist. Unlike many meme tokens, it gives users real ways to earn through content, community interaction, and social boosts. People don’t just hold HYPE, they get rewarded for showing up and joining in. With viral marketing, influencer tie-ins, and gamified tools, HYPE knows how to keep attention. Its value may rise and fall with the buzz, but it’s not built on empty hype. For those who see how online culture shapes value in Web3, HYPE is a bold entry on the best crypto to invest in 2025 radar. The Projects Making 2025 a Turning Point Speculation still makes waves, but 2025 is shaping up around a clear purpose. Unstaked links tokens to real AI tasks. ONDO brings yield from real-world assets. Aptos is ready for developers building what’s next. And HYPE turns engagement into a value engine. So if you’re wondering what the best crypto to invest in 2025 really is, it may not be about hype alone. It’s about tools that work, systems that reward effort, and platforms that keep growing long after the noise fades. These four are leading that charge.

Traders are split between waiting for breakout confirmations or preparing for deeper pullbacks. But while legacy meme coins and large-cap Layer 1s battle resistance, analysts are pointing toward a new contender quietly building momentum underneath the surface, MAGACOIN FINANCE. And this one, they say, could offer a far more explosive upside as capital rotates into the next narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Altcoin Analysts Say Has Asymmetric Upside While SHIBA, XRP, and Solana fight for momentum, one presale token is already showing signs of real acceleration. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a contender analysts say could outpace the broader market over the next cycle. Several analysts have pointed to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s similarities with early-stage political memecoins that later produced exceptional returns. While every project carries inherent risk, the structural setup, market timing, and branding of MAGACOIN FINANCE distinguish it from a crowded field of short-lived tokens. Investors recognise the project’s promise. The pace of participation in the current token sale stage appears to accelerate as many believe it to be one of the rare chances in recent months, as assets already have established valuations. The summer entry into MAGACOIN FINANCE for early buyers could provide potential returns as the project goes from presale to top-tier public exchanges. SHIBA INU Approaches a Tipping Point SHIBA INU has been under pressure for most of the year, but the technical picture may be shaping up to form a reversal. Per analysts studying the charts, a Falling Wedge pattern has appeared, which is a setup known to be bullish. Shibarium upgrade that focuses on congestion relief and validator improvements brings renewed interest among developers. Yet, the overall market still perceives SHIBA as extremely reactive to sentiments. Due to this, many traders are waiting for a confirmed move above resistance levels before entering fresh trades. XRP Holds the Line Amid Regulatory Watch One of the most news-sensitive tokens in the market is XRP. Ripple’s negotiation with the SEC has become a key factor influencing investor expectations and as per some analysts, it could trigger breakout if one is achieved. Whale behavior is confident as whales are accumulating at recent consolidation zones in large numbers. Some think that the traction ETFs have gotten and the growing use of the XRP Ledger in DeFi could be important catalysts. Currently, XRP’s price action remains compressed and traders await a breakout. Solana’s Stability Isn’t Translating to Price Momentum Solana has earned praise in recent months for its consistent network performance. No outages, high uptime, and improving infrastructure have given the ecosystem a foundation of credibility. Yet despite these strengths, the token continues to wrestle with resistance zones and bearish moving average clusters. Technical indicators are tightening, signaling a potential breakout or breakdown scenario. Solana’s long-term positioning remains intact, but the near-term direction hinges on whether buyers step in with conviction at current support ranges. Final Thoughts: Momentum Is Shifting SHIBA INU, XRP, and Solana are still in the game—but their next moves depend heavily on sentiment, regulation, and breakout confirmation. They remain important holdings, but they’re no longer the only plays in town. MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the interest of investors who aren’t waiting for headlines—they’re positioning ahead of them. The next major cycle could be shaped by tokens like this, the ones that enter strong while the market is still distracted.

Following this development , developers will soon be able to submit their own AI agents to the company for review. Those AI agents will draft a series of practice notes behind the scenes, and if the company deems them helpful, the bot is unleashed to write notes that will be visible on the service. Keith Coleman, a product executive at X who oversees the Community Notes program, said humans will still read those AI-created notes, which will only be shown if individuals with different opinions find them helpful. This is how the system works for notes created by X users. Meanwhile, AI-generated notes might begin to show up later this month. Analysts revealed growing adoption of Community Notes among social media platforms X first rolled out a crowd-sourced fact-checking program when the company was called Twitter, long before Musk’s takeover in 2022 . For now, several developments have been made on this social media platform. To illustrate, its emphasis on Community Notes has grown since Musk took ownership, and has recently been embraced by other companies, including TikTok from ByteDance Ltd. and Meta Platforms Inc. In March, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, revealed intentions to begin testing its new plan to combat misinformation. This was the latest step in a broader effort to stop removing users’ posts and reduce how frequently it penalizes individuals on its services. Based on Musk’s argument on Community Notes, it is an act of defense against misinformation, referring to it as hoax kryptonite. Despite this claim, the fact-checking process has repeatedly flagged Musk for posting misleading information. In the meantime, the CEO of Tesla s uggested earlier this year that there is a possibility that governments and traditional media could manipulate the system. Coleman refers to community notes as the best fact-checking system available Keith Coleman commented on the topic of discussion. In an interview, Coleman highlighted that with the help of AI agents, they can provide many more notes quickly with less effort. Still, according to him, in the end, it is up to people to decide what is useful enough to share. Afterwards, the product executive at X concluded that they believe this mix is really powerful. Currently, there are “hundreds” of notes submitted every day to X, Coleman said. However, he did not have a goal for what that number would be with the addition of AI; he only wanted it to be a “substantial” number. Coleman added that other companies’ use of community notes proves that they believe it is the best fact-checking system. He is also optimistic that having humans check the AI notes before publishing will produce a “feedback loop” that can help enhance the bots, too. Coleman explained that this is a new way of getting feedback. He continued that the model can get better from one person’s opinion and input from many different people. Interestingly, Coleman explained that the AI agent can run on any technology, which is not necessarily Grok itself. Notably, Musk’s AI company xAI developed the bot.

This substantial capital injection is earmarked to further accelerate its ambitious Bitcoin treasury strategy , a clear signal of the evolving landscape of corporate finance in the digital age. This development is not just about a single company’s financial success; it reflects a broader, compelling trend of businesses integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy and Why is it Gaining Traction? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin (BTC) as part of its corporate reserves, much like it would hold traditional fiat currencies or gold. This approach represents a fundamental shift from conventional treasury management, driven by several compelling factors: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its decentralized nature and fixed supply. Growth Asset: Beyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin offers the potential for significant capital appreciation, providing an alternative avenue for corporate wealth growth. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury portfolio can diversify a company’s assets, reducing reliance on traditional financial instruments and potentially enhancing overall risk-adjusted returns. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s progressive stance on technology and financial innovation, potentially attracting a new generation of investors and talent. This strategic pivot is gaining momentum as more companies recognize the long-term value proposition of digital assets, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate them into core financial planning. How is The Blockchain Group Leading the Charge? The recent funding secured by The Blockchain Group is a testament to its commitment to this innovative treasury approach. The €11 million ($13 million) funding round was structured thoughtfully, combining different financial instruments to maximize impact and investor confidence: €1 Million Capital Increase: This direct equity infusion demonstrates a strong belief in the company’s underlying value and future prospects. €10 Million in Convertible Bonds: These bonds offer investors the flexibility to convert their debt into equity, aligning their interests with the company’s long-term growth and success in its Bitcoin ventures. A significant highlight of this funding round is the caliber of investors involved. Asset manager TOBAM and, notably, Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, subscribed to these instruments at an impressive 30% premium. This premium speaks volumes about their conviction in The Blockchain Group’s vision and the future trajectory of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. The company’s existing Bitcoin holdings further solidify its position. With 1,794 BTC already on its balance sheet, The Blockchain Group is not just talking about a Bitcoin treasury strategy ; it is actively executing it, placing it among a select group of publicly traded companies with substantial Bitcoin reserves. Funding Breakdown for The Blockchain Group Funding Instrument Amount (EUR) Amount (USD Equivalent) Capital Increase €1,000,000 $1,300,000 Convertible Bonds €10,000,000 $11,700,000 Total Funding €11,000,000 $13,000,000 What Does This Mean for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The Blockchain Group’s success story adds significant weight to the narrative of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption . While pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla have grabbed headlines with their multi-billion dollar Bitcoin acquisitions, this funding round highlights that the trend is broadening, reaching companies of various sizes and industries. This wave of adoption is driven by several strategic advantages for businesses: Balance Sheet Optimization: Companies are seeking ways to optimize their balance sheets, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where holding cash can lead to erosion of purchasing power. Market Signal: A company holding Bitcoin can send a powerful signal to the market about its forward-thinking approach, potentially attracting investors who are bullish on the digital asset space. Competitive Edge: Early adopters might gain a competitive edge by familiarizing themselves with the complexities of digital asset management, security, and regulatory compliance before it becomes mainstream. The move by The Blockchain Group validates Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate, strategic component of a modern corporate treasury. It encourages other companies to seriously evaluate the benefits and implications of incorporating digital assets into their financial frameworks. Is This the Future of BTC Investment for Institutions? The participation of institutional investors like TOBAM and the endorsement from Bitcoin luminary Adam Back, who subscribed at a premium, unequivocally signals growing institutional confidence in BTC investment . This isn’t just retail enthusiasm; it’s smart money recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term value store and a strategic asset. For institutions, Bitcoin offers: Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against inflation and currency debasement. Growth Potential: Exposure to a nascent, high-growth asset class. Portfolio Diversification: Low correlation with traditional assets, offering diversification benefits. The willingness of sophisticated investors to pay a premium for exposure to a company with a strong Bitcoin treasury strategy suggests that the market is beginning to price in the strategic value of Bitcoin holdings. This trend could pave the way for more institutional capital flowing into Bitcoin, not just through direct purchases but also through investments in companies that strategically integrate Bitcoin. Navigating Your Own Digital Asset Strategy: Benefits and Challenges For any company considering embarking on its own digital asset strategy , The Blockchain Group’s journey offers valuable insights. While the benefits are compelling, it is crucial to approach this with a clear understanding of the challenges: Key Benefits: Potential for High Returns: Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests significant upside potential. Brand Innovation: Positioning your company as a leader in embracing new financial technologies. Access to New Capital: Attracting investors interested in the crypto space. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, impacting balance sheet valuations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving and varies by jurisdiction. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities in how Bitcoin is treated for accounting and tax purposes. Companies looking to adopt a digital asset strategy should consider a phased approach, starting with thorough research, developing clear internal policies, ensuring secure storage solutions, and consulting with legal and financial experts familiar with digital assets. A New Era for Corporate Finance The Blockchain Group’s successful $13 million funding round is more than just a financial milestone for one company; it is a powerful validation of the growing legitimacy and strategic importance of Bitcoin in corporate finance. With visionary investors backing their ambitious Bitcoin treasury strategy , this French company is at the forefront of a significant paradigm shift. As corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to gain traction, and as more institutions recognize the potential of BTC investment , we are witnessing the dawn of a new era where a robust digital asset strategy is not just an option, but a vital component of forward-thinking business models. This development will undoubtedly inspire other enterprises to explore the transformative potential of decentralized finance and digital assets.

A significant milestone has just been reached that could reshape how we think about digital assets and their integration into mainstream finance. Prometheum Capital , a registered broker-dealer and a subsidiary of Prometheum, has received crucial authorization to provide correspondent clearing services for third-party broker-dealers. This development, announced via a Business Wire press release, isn’t just another regulatory approval; it’s a foundational step towards broader adoption of blockchain-based assets in the United States. Prometheum Capital: A Crucial Bridge to Compliant Digital Assets For years, the digital asset space has grappled with regulatory ambiguity, particularly in the United States. Many innovative projects have struggled to gain traction within traditional financial frameworks due to a lack of clear guidelines and compliant pathways. This is where Prometheum Capital steps in. As a registered broker-dealer, Prometheum operates within the existing regulatory structure, a stark contrast to many decentralized crypto entities. The recent authorization allows Prometheum Capital to offer correspondent clearing services. What does this mean? Essentially, it enables other broker-dealers to access Prometheum’s infrastructure for the custody, execution, and recordkeeping of on-chain securities . This is a big deal because it provides a regulated, compliant channel for firms to engage with digital assets that are classified as securities, without having to build their own complex regulatory and technical stacks from scratch. It’s about creating a trusted bridge between the burgeoning world of blockchain and the established rules of Wall Street, offering a pathway for legitimate innovation within defined legal boundaries. Unpacking On-Chain Securities: The Future of Ownership Before diving deeper into the implications, let’s clarify what on-chain securities are. Unlike traditional stocks or bonds held in a centralized ledger, on-chain securities represent ownership interests or financial instruments issued and managed directly on a blockchain. Think of a company’s shares, a bond, or even real estate ownership, all tokenized and recorded on a distributed ledger. The appeal of on-chain securities is multifaceted: Enhanced Transparency: Transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing a clear audit trail. Increased Efficiency: Automated processes and smart contracts can streamline issuance, transfer, and settlement, reducing manual errors and delays. Fractionalization: High-value assets can be divided into smaller, more affordable units, increasing accessibility for a broader range of investors. Global Accessibility: Blockchain networks operate 24/7, potentially allowing for global trading without geographical or time constraints. While the concept has been around, widespread adoption has been hampered by the absence of regulated infrastructure. Prometheum’s approval directly addresses this gap, providing the necessary plumbing for these innovative assets to thrive within the existing financial ecosystem. The Crucial Role of Digital Asset Clearing In traditional finance, clearing is a vital post-trade process that ensures transactions are settled smoothly and risks are minimized. When you buy or sell a stock, a clearinghouse acts as an intermediary, guaranteeing that the buyer receives the shares and the seller receives the payment, even if one party defaults. This process is fundamental to maintaining market integrity and stability. The introduction of digital asset clearing services by Prometheum Capital for on-chain securities is transformative. It brings this essential layer of trust and efficiency to the blockchain space. Here’s how it works and why it matters: Aspect Traditional Clearing Prometheum’s Digital Asset Clearing Assets Handled Stocks, bonds, derivatives On-chain securities (tokenized assets) Infrastructure Centralized ledgers, legacy systems Blockchain-based, integrated with traditional systems Key Services Trade confirmation, settlement, risk management Custody, execution, recordkeeping for on-chain assets Regulatory Oversight Highly regulated (e.g., SEC, FINRA) Operating under existing US securities laws By offering custody, execution, and recordkeeping services, Prometheum effectively provides the full suite of post-trade services necessary for on-chain securities to be traded and held securely and compliantly within the existing financial ecosystem. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk and operational complexities for firms looking to enter the digital asset space. Navigating Blockchain Regulation: A US Perspective The regulatory environment for digital assets in the US capital markets has been a complex and often contentious topic. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has largely asserted that many cryptocurrencies and digital tokens qualify as securities, subjecting them to stringent federal securities laws. This stance has led to numerous enforcement actions and a cautious approach from many financial institutions. Prometheum’s strategy has been to embrace this regulatory reality head-on. Rather than attempting to operate outside existing frameworks, Prometheum has diligently worked to register and comply with relevant authorities, including the SEC and FINRA. Their authorization to provide clearing services is a direct result of this compliance-first approach. It signals a potential shift in how digital assets can be integrated into the US financial system – not through a complete overhaul of laws, but by carefully applying existing regulations to new technologies. This development is particularly significant because it offers a template for other firms seeking to engage with digital assets in a compliant manner. It demonstrates that a path exists for innovation within the confines of established financial oversight, potentially paving the way for more regulated digital asset offerings and services in the future. It’s a testament to the idea that innovation and regulation can coexist, fostering a more secure and trustworthy market. Impact on US Capital Markets: A New Era of Digital Finance? The implications of Prometheum Capital’s authorization extend far beyond just one company; they could profoundly influence the entire landscape of US capital markets . This move addresses a critical bottleneck that has hindered the widespread adoption of digital assets by institutional players: the lack of regulated infrastructure for securities-classified tokens. Here’s why this is a game-changer for institutional adoption: Lowered Barriers to Entry: Traditional financial institutions, wary of regulatory risks, can now access digital asset markets through a compliant and regulated pathway. This significantly reduces their legal and operational exposure. Increased Liquidity and Efficiency: As more institutions participate, the liquidity for on-chain securities is expected to grow. The inherent efficiency of blockchain technology, combined with regulated clearing, can lead to faster settlement times and lower transaction costs. Innovation in Financial Products: The ability to compliantly clear on-chain securities opens the door for the creation of new, innovative financial products, such as tokenized real estate funds, digital bond offerings, or fractionalized ownership of illiquid assets. Global Competitiveness: By providing a regulated framework, the US can solidify its position as a leader in the evolving digital finance space, attracting capital and innovation that might otherwise go to more permissive jurisdictions. While the path forward will undoubtedly have its challenges, including the need for further technological integration and ongoing regulatory dialogue, Prometheum’s move marks a pivotal moment. It signifies a maturation of the digital asset industry, moving beyond speculative trading into the realm of integrated, regulated financial services. Benefits of Prometheum’s Clearing Services The authorization for Prometheum Capital brings a cascade of benefits for various stakeholders: For Broker-Dealers: They can now offer their clients access to on-chain securities without building their own complex, compliant infrastructure. This expands their product offerings and client base. For Issuers of On-Chain Securities: Companies looking to raise capital through tokenized securities now have a clearer, more legitimate path to market, potentially attracting a wider pool of institutional investors. For Investors: Enhanced investor protection through regulated custody, execution, and recordkeeping. This builds trust and encourages participation in the digital asset space. For the Market as a Whole: Increased transparency, reduced settlement risk, and greater efficiency contribute to a more robust and resilient financial system. It also fosters innovation by providing a compliant sandbox for new digital asset products. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While this is a significant step forward, the journey towards full integration of digital assets into traditional finance is not without its hurdles: Technological Interoperability: Ensuring seamless communication and data exchange between traditional financial systems and blockchain networks remains a complex challenge. Scalability: As adoption grows, the underlying blockchain infrastructure must be able to handle a massive increase in transaction volume without compromising speed or security. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While Prometheum has found a path, the broader regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving. Continuous dialogue and adaptation will be necessary. Market Education: Both institutional and retail investors need to be educated on the unique characteristics, benefits, and risks associated with on-chain securities. Competition: As the market matures, more players will likely enter the regulated digital asset space, leading to increased competition and the need for continuous innovation. Actionable Insights for the Future What does this mean for you, whether you’re an investor, a financial professional, or a blockchain enthusiast? For Financial Institutions: It’s time to seriously evaluate strategies for integrating digital assets into your offerings. Prometheum’s model provides a blueprint for compliant entry. For Digital Asset Projects: Focus on building products and services that can operate within existing regulatory frameworks. Compliance is no longer an afterthought but a prerequisite for mainstream adoption. For Investors: Stay informed about regulated digital asset offerings. This development signals a safer environment for engaging with on-chain securities, but due diligence remains paramount. For Policymakers: Continue to foster an environment that balances innovation with investor protection. Clear and consistent regulation is key to unlocking the full potential of digital assets. A Compelling Step Forward for Digital Finance The authorization of Prometheum Capital to offer correspondent clearing services for on-chain securities marks a monumental stride in the evolution of digital finance. It addresses a long-standing need for regulated infrastructure, paving a compliant path for blockchain regulation and the broader adoption of digital assets within US capital markets . By enabling seamless custody, execution, and recordkeeping for on-chain securities , Prometheum Capital is not just facilitating transactions; it’s building trust and legitimacy, crucial elements for any asset class to gain widespread acceptance. This development promises to unlock new opportunities for investors, issuers, and financial institutions alike, heralding a new era where the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology are fully embraced within a regulated framework.

In a notice published on July 1, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance outlined what crypto ETF issuers must include in their filings. The guidance covers everything from how net asset value is calculated and how service providers are selected, to detailed descriptions of custody practices and potential conflicts of interest. SEC Framework Targets Clarity for Token-Based Funds It applies specifically to spot and derivative-based crypto ETPs that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934. The move reflects the SEC’s evolving stance on crypto oversight. As token ETPs grow in popularity, particularly following strong inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, the regulator appears to be laying the groundwork for more structured disclosure norms across a wider range of digital assets. Yes, this is what everyone wants, what makes sense and what we think will happen and why we so bullish (95% on most of the coins) approval. Q is what will the standards be. We think they'll likely be loose enough where the vast majority of Top 50 coins would be ok to be ETF-ized. https://t.co/1AUZOmpe1O — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 1, 2025 Notably, the new disclosure standards come as the SEC and exchanges work together on a generic listing framework. This framework could allow certain token-based ETFs to bypass the traditional 19b-4 rule change process. If adopted, it would mark a significant shift. Exchanges could reportedly list a qualifying crypto ETP after a 75-day review, reducing red tape and speeding up time to market. Agency Urges Tailored Disclosures as ETF Market Expands Further, the SEC stated that each issuer must tailor disclosures to its specific structure. However, it also flagged several key areas that will receive close scrutiny. These areas include how underlying assets are selected and valued. In addition, the SEC will examine how custody and insurance are managed. It will also assess whether any affiliated entities create conflicts of interest. Moreover, issuers must explain the mechanics of creation and redemption—especially during volatile or illiquid market conditions. On the same day, the agency approved Grayscale’s request to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund into a spot ETF. The fund, which holds a diversified basket of crypto tokens, will now trade on US exchanges, marking one of the first regulated multi-asset digital funds to do so. So far, the market has welcomed single-asset Bitcoin ETFs. However, multi-token products like Grayscale’s are still relatively rare. Now, the SEC’s expanded guidance could change that. If issuers meet the detailed disclosure requirements, more such funds may enter the market. Industry participants have long called for consistent treatment of crypto ETFs. Now, with this latest signal, the SEC seems ready to respond. It aims to bring more structure to the fast-evolving space. At the same time, it remains committed to protecting investors.

Yet, one persistent challenge has been the fragmented nature of liquidity across different chains. Imagine trying to use your digital dollars seamlessly across various blockchains without cumbersome transfers or costly rebalancing. This is precisely the hurdle Circle, a leading dollar-backed stablecoin issuer, aims to overcome with its groundbreaking announcement: the upcoming launch of Circle Gateway . What is Circle Gateway and Why Does it Matter? Circle recently revealed via X (formerly Twitter) its plans to release ‘Circle Gateway,’ a developer service designed to revolutionize how developers and users manage USDC across multiple blockchain networks. Set to launch on Avalanche (AVAX), Base, and Ethereum testnets starting in July, this service is poised to transform the landscape of cross-chain liquidity . At its core, Circle Gateway offers unified USDC balance management. What does this mean for the everyday builder or user in the crypto space? It means an end to the frustrating need for prefunding and constant rebalancing of assets across different chains. In the current environment, if you want to use USDC on Ethereum and then move it to Avalanche, you often have to bridge it, which can be slow, expensive, and require you to manage separate balances on each chain. Circle Gateway aims to consolidate this experience, making it as simple as managing a single balance. Key Features and Benefits of Circle Gateway: Unified USDC Balance Management: Access your USDC across supported chains from a single interface, simplifying operations. Instant Cross-Chain Liquidity: Execute transactions and move value between chains almost instantly, without delays associated with traditional bridging. Eliminates Prefunding: Developers no longer need to pre-allocate funds on various chains, reducing capital lock-up and operational complexity. Removes Rebalancing Needs: The service handles the underlying complexities of moving liquidity, freeing developers from manual rebalancing tasks. Enhanced Developer Experience: Provides a streamlined toolkit for building applications that leverage multi-chain USDC seamlessly. Unlocking True Cross-Chain Liquidity with USDC The concept of cross-chain liquidity is fundamental to the future of DeFi. As more Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions emerge, each with its own ecosystem and user base, the ability to move assets freely and efficiently between them becomes paramount. Fragmented liquidity leads to inefficiencies, higher slippage, and a poorer user experience. Circle’s initiative with Circle Gateway directly addresses this pain point, making USDC a truly fluid asset across the crypto landscape. Consider the current state versus the future envisioned by Circle Gateway : Aspect Current Cross-Chain Experience Circle Gateway Experience USDC Management Separate balances per chain; manual tracking. Unified balance across supported chains. Liquidity Movement Bridging required; often slow and costly. Instant and seamless. Developer Burden Managing prefunding and rebalancing. Automated, reducing operational overhead. Capital Efficiency Capital locked in separate chain pools. Optimized; less capital required for operations. This shift represents a significant leap forward, promising to make DeFi more accessible and efficient for everyone involved. The Role of USDC: A Pillar Among Stablecoins USDC , issued by Circle, stands as one of the most widely adopted and trusted dollar-backed stablecoin s in the cryptocurrency market. Its strong regulatory compliance, transparent reserves, and widespread integration across exchanges, DeFi protocols, and payment systems make it an ideal candidate for spearheading advancements in cross-chain liquidity . The decision to build Circle Gateway around USDC leverages its existing network effect and establishes it even further as a foundational asset for the multi-chain future. The stability of a stablecoin like USDC , combined with the newfound fluidity offered by Circle Gateway , will unlock new use cases for decentralized applications. Imagine a scenario where a user can provide liquidity to a DeFi protocol on Base using USDC , then instantly shift that same USDC to participate in a lending pool on Avalanche, all without leaving a single application interface or incurring multiple transaction fees for bridging. This level of seamlessness is what developers and users have long awaited. Revolutionizing Blockchain Interoperability for a Unified Future The launch of Circle Gateway is more than just a new service; it’s a critical step towards achieving true blockchain interoperability . Interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other, sharing data and assets. While various bridging solutions exist, they often come with their own set of complexities and risks. Circle Gateway simplifies this by providing a unified layer for USDC , effectively creating a more cohesive ecosystem. This approach fosters innovation by allowing developers to focus on building compelling applications rather than wrestling with underlying infrastructure challenges. As more chains are integrated into the Circle Gateway framework, the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain world moves closer to reality. This enhanced blockchain interoperability will accelerate the adoption of Web3 technologies by making them more user-friendly and efficient. Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the promise of Circle Gateway is immense, like any new technology, its success will depend on various factors, including developer adoption, security audits, and the seamless integration of more blockchain networks. However, the benefits for the broader crypto ecosystem are clear. By simplifying the movement of the most widely used dollar stablecoin , Circle is laying a crucial piece of infrastructure for a future where decentralized applications are truly chain-agnostic. For developers, this means the ability to build more robust, capital-efficient, and user-friendly DeFi protocols, payment systems, and Web3 applications. For users, it means a less fragmented, more intuitive experience when interacting with their digital assets across different ecosystems. The availability on Avalanche, Base, and Ethereum testnets in July marks an exciting initial phase, allowing builders to experiment and provide feedback before a full mainnet launch. Concluding Thoughts: A Leap Towards a Seamless Crypto Experience Circle’s upcoming Circle Gateway is set to be a pivotal development in the journey towards a more interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. By tackling the persistent challenge of fragmented cross-chain liquidity for USDC , Circle is empowering developers and users alike with a powerful tool that promises to simplify asset management and unlock new possibilities within decentralized finance. This innovation not only streamlines operations but also paves the way for a truly unified and interoperable future for digital assets. Get ready to experience USDC like never before, flowing seamlessly across the digital frontier.

Experts Share Predictions on Long-Term Cycle Targets,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-ada-and-xrp-break-4-again-by-2026-experts-share-predictions-on-long-term-cycle-targets/,"As crypto markets cycle into a new growth phase, attention is turning toward high-profile assets like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) — both of which have histories of sharp rallies but have struggled to reclaim previous highs in recent years. With analysts sharpening their forecasts for 2026 and beyond, one question looms large: can either asset realistically break above the $4 mark again? Price targets for ADA and XRP vary widely, but consensus estimates offer valuable insight into which asset might lead the next leg of the bull market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Joins the Conversation as the Early-Stage Alternative As ADA and XRP position themselves for long-term gains, capital is also rotating into fresh presale tokens with greater short-term upside. One of the most talked-about early-stage plays of 2025 is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a politically themed memecoin that’s quietly raised over $10 million during its presale. Unlike traditional Layer 1s, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t built on infrastructure utility — it’s built on narrative momentum, community-driven growth, and strategic scarcity. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens and a full audit by HashEx, the project has started to attract the kind of repeat buyer activity usually reserved for breakout memecoins. What’s drawing attention is how sharply the project is accelerating: wallet activity, social engagement, and early conversions are all outpacing typical presale norms. While ADA and XRP may deliver in the long term, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a speculative favorite for those seeking multi-bagger upside before 2026. Cardano (ADA) Faces Resistance Below $4 While Cardano remains one of the most widely held Layer 1 assets, expert predictions suggest it may struggle to cross the $4 threshold by 2026. According to CoinCarp and Coinpedia, ADA is likely to retest the $2.05 range by late 2025 if it maintains its current technical structure. For 2026, the most bullish scenarios place the token between $2.75 and $3.25 — solid gains from current levels, but still short of $4. Other sources, including Investing Haven and Changelly, paint a more conservative picture. Investing Haven sets its 2026 target between $1.25 and $3.03, while Changelly’s aggregated models cap ADA’s upside just below $3.25. Benzinga, which also tracks broader market conditions, puts its maximum ADA forecast at just $0.88 for 2026. Across all models, the common thread is clear: ADA’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, but the market isn’t expecting a break above $4 in the current cycle. Most forecasts point to a longer-term target of $5–$10 by 2030, but patience may be required. XRP Stands a Better Chance at Reclaiming $4 Ripple’s XRP, by contrast, is generating more bullish sentiment. A combination of regulatory clarity, growing institutional adoption, and renewed ETF speculation is driving interest — and analysts are taking notice. Some technical analysts, such as EGRAG Crypto, suggest a “blow-off top” between $22 and $27 by 2026, though these are considered highly speculative. Mainstream projections are more conservative but still optimistic. Benzinga places XRP’s 2026 range between $2.71 and $8.60, while Coinpedia, Investing Haven, and Changelly forecast a range of $2.21–$6.01 depending on adoption speed and macroeconomic conditions. Importantly, several models peg the $4 mark as highly realistic — with some placing it closer to the midpoint of XRP’s expected 2026 price range. Long-term forecasts even suggest the token could target $9–$12 or more by 2030, assuming adoption in cross-border payments continues to grow. For investors weighing upside in this cycle, XRP appears to offer a more credible path to breaking $4 before 2026 — positioning it as one of the more aggressive large-cap bets over the next 12 to 18 months. Final Thoughts: A Tale of Two Strategies ADA and XRP remain strong candidates for long-term portfolio inclusion — but their paths to $4 are very different. Cardano is likely to continue grinding slowly higher with steady development and institutional appeal. XRP, on the other hand, has a clearer shot at breaking $4 in the current cycle, especially if broader adoption and ETF support materialize. But in a market always looking for what’s next, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now in the frame — offering early entry to a fast-moving project that could surprise the field while the majors play the long game.

For those deeply invested in or simply observing the cryptocurrency market, understanding the underlying currents of traditional finance, particularly the strength or US Dollar Weakness , is paramount. When the dollar tumbles to multi-year lows, it’s not just a headline for currency traders; it sends ripples across asset classes, including digital currencies. This profound movement signals a broader economic rebalancing, driven by a confluence of monetary policy adjustments, evolving trade relationships, and fiscal strategies. Understanding the Plunge: Why the US Dollar Weakness is Facing Multi-Year Lows? The recent depreciation of the US Dollar to levels not seen in years is a complex phenomenon, reflecting a shifting global economic landscape. This isn’t a sudden drop but rather the culmination of several influential factors that have been brewing over time. When we talk about “multi-year lows,” it means the dollar’s value, relative to a basket of other major currencies (often measured by the Dollar Index or DXY), has reached its weakest point in several years. This decline has significant implications for everything from international trade to investment flows, and even the relative attractiveness of alternative assets like Bitcoin. Several key elements are contributing to this significant shift: Monetary Policy Divergence: Central banks globally are adopting different strategies, impacting currency valuations. Trade Dynamics: Ongoing negotiations and agreements (or lack thereof) reshape economic relationships. Fiscal Health: Government spending and taxation policies influence investor confidence and economic outlook. Global Economic Recovery: As other economies show signs of strength, demand for the dollar as a safe haven can decrease. The Central Bank Factor: How Interest Rate Cuts are Shaping the Dollar’s Fate? One of the most potent forces behind the dollar’s recent slide is the anticipation and implementation of Interest Rate Cuts by the Federal Reserve. When a central bank lowers its benchmark interest rate, it generally makes the country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors. Why? Because lower rates mean lower returns on fixed-income investments, such as government bonds, denominated in that currency. Investors seeking higher yields will naturally look elsewhere, leading to capital outflows and a depreciation of the domestic currency. Consider the following impacts of a dovish monetary policy: Yield Differentials: If other major central banks maintain or raise their rates while the Fed cuts, the yield advantage shifts away from dollar-denominated assets. This encourages investors to move capital to economies offering better returns. Stimulating the Economy: Rate cuts are often implemented to stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. While beneficial for the domestic economy, the initial reaction can be a weaker currency as liquidity increases. Inflation Expectations: Lower rates can sometimes fuel inflation expectations. If investors anticipate that the purchasing power of the dollar will erode due to rising prices, they may seek out assets that offer a hedge against inflation, further reducing demand for the dollar. The market’s expectation of future rate cuts is often as influential as the cuts themselves, creating a forward-looking pressure on the dollar’s value. This dynamic plays a crucial role in the broader Forex Market Trends . Navigating Global Trade Deals : A New Era for Currency Dynamics? Beyond monetary policy, the landscape of Global Trade Deals has emerged as a significant determinant of currency valuations, particularly for the US Dollar. Trade policies, tariffs, and international agreements directly influence the flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. When major economies like the U.S. engage in trade negotiations or disputes, the uncertainty and potential economic consequences can weigh heavily on their respective currencies. Let’s look at how trade dynamics impact the dollar: Trade Balances: A country’s trade balance (exports minus imports) is a fundamental driver of its currency’s value. If trade deals lead to a widening trade deficit for the U.S. (meaning it imports more than it exports), demand for the dollar to pay for those exports decreases, putting downward pressure on the currency. Investor Confidence: Positive progress on trade deals can boost investor confidence in a country’s economic outlook, attracting foreign investment and strengthening its currency. Conversely, trade tensions and prolonged disputes can deter investment, leading to currency weakness. Supply Chain Realignment: As countries re-evaluate their supply chains in response to trade policies, it can alter the demand for specific currencies used in international transactions. For instance, if production shifts away from the U.S. due to tariffs, demand for the dollar in those supply chains might diminish. The ongoing discussions surrounding trade agreements, particularly with major partners, create a constant backdrop of speculation and adjustment in the currency markets, making them a vital component of the current Forex Market Trends . Beyond the Headlines: The Broader Economic Impact of Policy Shifts The confluence of declining Interest Rate Cuts , shifting Global Trade Deals , and evolving tax policies creates a multifaceted Economic Impact that extends far beyond currency exchange rates. These policy shifts influence various aspects of the global economy, from inflation and growth prospects to commodity prices and investor sentiment. Understanding these broader implications is crucial for navigating the current financial environment. Here’s how these shifts manifest economically: Economic Aspect Impact of US Dollar Weakness & Policy Shifts Inflation A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive, potentially contributing to domestic inflation. However, if the weakness is due to a slowing economy, inflationary pressures might be offset. Export Competitiveness A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper for foreign buyers, boosting export volumes and potentially supporting economic growth. Commodity Prices Many global commodities (like oil and gold) are priced in USD. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for buyers using other currencies, often leading to an increase in their dollar price. This can be seen as a benefit for commodity-producing nations. Corporate Earnings U.S. multinational corporations benefit from a weaker dollar as their foreign earnings translate into more dollars. This can boost stock market performance. Global Debt For countries or companies with significant dollar-denominated debt, a weaker dollar makes their debt burden lighter when converted back to their local currency, potentially easing financial stress. For cryptocurrency investors, the Economic Impact of a weaker dollar is particularly relevant. A depreciating dollar can make alternative assets, like Bitcoin, more attractive as a hedge against inflation or as a store of value outside the traditional fiat system. When confidence in the primary reserve currency wanes, investors often seek diversification, which can drive capital into the crypto market. This dynamic is a key aspect of current Forex Market Trends and their broader implications. What Do These Forex Market Trends Mean for Your Portfolio? The current Forex Market Trends , characterized by US Dollar Weakness driven by Interest Rate Cuts and shifts in Global Trade Deals , present both opportunities and challenges for investors across various asset classes. Understanding how these macro-economic shifts can influence your portfolio is key to making informed decisions. Opportunities: Diversification into Non-USD Assets: As the dollar weakens, assets denominated in other strong currencies or non-fiat assets like gold and cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) can become more appealing. They may offer a hedge against dollar depreciation and potentially higher returns. Export-Oriented Investments: Companies that derive a significant portion of their revenue from exports will likely benefit. Their products become cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially increasing sales and profitability. Consider investing in sectors with strong international exposure. Emerging Markets: A weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for emerging market economies that have borrowed in dollars. This can improve their economic outlook and make their equity and bond markets more attractive to foreign investors. Commodity Exposure: Since many commodities are priced in dollars, a weaker dollar typically leads to higher commodity prices. Investments in commodity-related funds or companies can offer a potential upside. Challenges: Import Costs: For businesses heavily reliant on imports, a weaker dollar means higher costs for raw materials and finished goods, which can erode profit margins or lead to higher consumer prices. Inflationary Pressures: While some inflation can be healthy, a rapidly weakening dollar can contribute to significant inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power if not managed correctly by central banks. Uncertainty: The very nature of currency fluctuations introduces uncertainty. Predicting the exact trajectory of the dollar requires careful monitoring of economic indicators and policy announcements. Actionable Insights: Review Your Portfolio’s Currency Exposure: Assess how much of your portfolio is directly or indirectly exposed to the US Dollar. Consider diversifying into assets denominated in other major currencies or global indices. Consider Hard Assets and Digital Gold: Assets like physical gold and cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often seen as stores of value that can perform well during periods of fiat currency debasement or uncertainty. Stay Informed on Central Bank Policies: Keep a close eye on announcements from the Federal Reserve and other major central banks regarding interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening. These are primary drivers of currency movements. Monitor Trade Negotiations: Developments in international trade agreements can swiftly alter currency valuations. Understanding the implications of these deals is crucial. The current Economic Impact of these shifts demands a proactive approach to portfolio management, focusing on resilience and strategic diversification. Looking Ahead: Will the Dollar Rebound or Continue its Descent? The question on many investors’ minds is whether the current US Dollar Weakness is a temporary dip or the beginning of a prolonged decline. Predicting currency movements with absolute certainty is impossible, given the multitude of interconnected factors at play. However, by analyzing potential future developments in Interest Rate Cuts , Global Trade Deals , and broader Economic Impact , we can form an educated outlook on future Forex Market Trends . Several scenarios could unfold: Further Weakness: If the Federal Reserve continues with aggressive Interest Rate Cuts , or if other major economies recover more strongly, the dollar could see continued depreciation. Persistent trade deficits or a lack of progress on critical Global Trade Deals could also exacerbate this trend. Modest Rebound: A sudden shift in economic data, such as unexpected strength in U.S. employment or inflation, could prompt the Fed to pause or reverse its rate-cutting stance, providing some support to the dollar. Geopolitical tensions or a global economic slowdown could also see the dollar regain its safe-haven appeal. Range-Bound Trading: The dollar might enter a period of relative stability, trading within a defined range as competing forces (e.g., U.S. fiscal stimulus versus global recovery) balance each other out. This could be a period of consolidation for the Forex Market Trends . Key indicators to watch include inflation data, employment figures, GDP growth rates, and statements from central bank officials. Furthermore, any significant breakthroughs or breakdowns in major Global Trade Deals will continue to be critical drivers of currency market sentiment. The interplay of these factors will ultimately determine the dollar’s trajectory and its ripple effect on the global Economic Impact . Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Economic Landscape The current period of US Dollar Weakness marks a significant juncture in global finance, driven by a powerful combination of anticipated Interest Rate Cuts , evolving Global Trade Deals , and the broader Economic Impact of these policy shifts. For investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these fundamental Forex Market Trends is not just academic; it’s essential for strategic decision-making. While a weaker dollar can present challenges for certain sectors, it also opens up opportunities in diversified assets, export-oriented businesses, and potentially, the burgeoning digital asset market. As the global economy continues to navigate these complex dynamics, staying informed and adapting investment strategies will be paramount to thriving in this evolving financial landscape.

These colossal holders, with their immense digital assets, possess the power to ripple through the market with a single transaction. Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news of an early Ethereum ICO participant making significant waves, offloading a substantial portion of their holdings. This isn’t just about a big sale; it’s a testament to the life-changing wealth generated by early crypto investments and a fascinating case study in market dynamics. Who is This Ethereum Whale and What Did They Do? Imagine investing a tiny sum and seeing it multiply into hundreds of millions. That’s the reality for one particular Ethereum whale , an early investor who participated in Ethereum’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) at an astonishingly low price of just $0.31 per ETH. Over the past year, this whale has systematically sold a staggering 356,600 ETH, translating to a jaw-dropping $892 million in realized profits. The average selling price? A remarkable $2,501 per ETH. This monumental profit-taking was brought to light by vigilant on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who further noted a recent sale of another 1,000 ETH. Despite these massive offloads, this whale still retains a considerable 24,619 ETH, signaling continued significant exposure to the asset. The scale of this operation is truly immense. To put it into perspective: Initial Investment Cost: Based on the 356,600 ETH sold, the original investment at $0.31 per ETH would have been approximately $110,546. Realized Gain: A mind-boggling $892 million from a roughly $110K investment. This represents an ROI of over 800,000%! Strategic Selling: The sales occurred over a year, suggesting a methodical approach rather than a single panic dump. This could be indicative of a planned diversification strategy or a response to perceived market peaks. Decoding the Impact on ETH Price and Market Sentiment When an Ethereum whale moves such a large volume of ETH, it naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the ETH price . While a single sale of 1,000 ETH might seem minor in the grand scheme of Ethereum’s daily trading volume, the cumulative 356,600 ETH sold over a year is significant. Such sustained selling pressure, even if gradual, can contribute to market volatility or cap upside movements. Here’s how whale movements can influence the market: Selling Pressure: Large sell orders increase the supply of ETH on exchanges, which can depress prices if demand doesn’t keep pace. Market Psychology: News of a major holder selling can trigger FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among retail investors, potentially leading to cascading sell-offs. Conversely, if a whale is buying, it can instill confidence. Liquidity Absorption: The market’s ability to absorb such large orders without significant price dislocation is a sign of its maturity and liquidity. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem has largely handled these sales without a catastrophic collapse, which speaks to its underlying strength. The fact that the whale sold at an average of $2,501, even as ETH has seen higher highs and lower lows, suggests a strategic, rather than opportunistic, selling pattern. It implies a long-term view of profit realization, potentially diversifying assets or preparing for future ventures. The Unbelievable Reality of Early ICO Profits The story of this Ethereum whale vividly illustrates the incredible potential for ICO profits that early cryptocurrency investments offered. The Ethereum ICO, held in 2014, was a landmark event that laid the groundwork for the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT booms we see today. Investing in ETH at $0.31 per token was a bet on a nascent technology, a vision that many dismissed as impossible. The journey from $0.31 to an average selling price of $2,501 is nothing short of extraordinary. This massive appreciation highlights several key aspects of early crypto adoption: Metric Details Original ICO Price $0.31 per ETH Whale’s Average Sale Price $2,501 per ETH ETH Sold (Past Year) 356,600 ETH Realized USD Value $892,000,000 Remaining Holdings 24,619 ETH These figures underscore the speculative yet immensely rewarding nature of pioneering investments in disruptive technologies. For every success story like this, there are countless others who missed out or sold too early. It serves as a powerful reminder of the long-term potential of holding high-conviction assets, despite market volatility. The Power of On-Chain Analysis in a Transparent World How do we know about these massive transactions? This is where the power of on-chain analysis comes into play. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, is transparent. Every transaction, every transfer of assets, is recorded on a public ledger, accessible to anyone with the right tools and knowledge. While the identity of the whale remains pseudonymous, their wallet addresses and the history of their transactions are entirely visible. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa utilize sophisticated tools and techniques to track these movements, identify patterns, and infer market behaviors. This level of transparency is a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering insights that are often unavailable in traditional financial markets. Key aspects of on-chain analysis include: Wallet Tracking: Monitoring large or historically significant wallet addresses. Transaction Volume: Analyzing the flow of assets to and from exchanges. Holding Periods: Determining how long assets are held before being moved or sold. Flows to Exchanges: Often indicates an intent to sell, as assets need to be on an exchange to be traded for fiat or other cryptos. This transparency allows for a more informed understanding of market dynamics, helping both institutional and retail investors make better decisions. It also provides a level of accountability, albeit pseudonymous, for major market participants. Broader Implications for the Crypto Market The actions of this Ethereum whale are not isolated events; they contribute to the broader narrative and sentiment within the entire crypto market . Whale movements are often seen as indicators of smart money positioning. While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they can influence short-term trends and investor confidence. For the crypto market, such large profit-taking events can be viewed in several ways: Market Maturity: The ability of the market to absorb such significant sales without a catastrophic crash demonstrates growing liquidity and resilience. Wealth Redistribution: These sales represent a transfer of wealth from early adopters to new entrants, potentially broadening the base of ETH holders. Long-Term Confidence: The fact that the whale still holds a substantial amount of ETH suggests they maintain some long-term conviction in Ethereum’s future, even after realizing massive gains. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile waters of digital assets. While individual whale actions can cause ripples, the underlying fundamentals of a project like Ethereum, its ongoing development, and increasing utility often prove to be more significant in the long run. What Can We Learn from This Whale’s Journey? The story of this Ethereum ICO whale offers several actionable insights for both seasoned and nascent crypto investors: The Power of Early Adoption: While replicating ICO-level returns is rare today, it underscores the potential rewards of identifying and investing in truly groundbreaking technologies early on. Long-Term Vision Pays Off: Holding through multiple market cycles, bear markets, and FUD requires immense conviction. This whale’s patience yielded extraordinary returns. Importance of On-Chain Monitoring: For serious investors, understanding how to track on-chain movements can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential shifts. Diversification is Key: Realizing profits and diversifying into other assets or traditional investments is a prudent strategy, even for crypto whales. Don’t Panic Over Whale Sales: While significant, individual whale sales rarely trigger market collapse. Focus on fundamental analysis and broader market trends. A Lasting Impression The saga of the Ethereum ICO whale serves as a compelling narrative in the history of cryptocurrency. It highlights the immense wealth creation potential that early participation in pioneering projects can offer, transforming modest investments into staggering fortunes. Furthermore, it underscores the invaluable role of on-chain analysis in providing transparency and insights into the movements of the market’s largest players. As the crypto market continues to evolve, the actions of these ‘whales’ will undoubtedly remain a focal point of interest, shaping sentiment and offering crucial data points for investors worldwide. Their strategic moves, whether buying or selling, are a constant reminder of the dynamic, often dramatic, nature of digital asset investments.

This increased its total holdings to 13,350 BTC (over $1.4 billion at current prices). The company also wants to raise over $5.4 billion to acquire up to 210,000 BTC by 2027 through its “555 Million Plan.” Metaplanet will control roughly 1% of all Bitcoin that ever existed and become the world’s second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin if it succeeds. CEO Simon Gerovich said the company’s year-to-date yield from its Bitcoin strategy is already 349%, and investors have responded enthusiastically. Metaplanet’s supporters said using 0% bonds gives the company access to “free” capital without issuing new shares or taking on costly interest payments, but critics say the company’s approach is too dependent on Bitcoin’s price going up. They warn the community that Metaplanet could face enormous paper losses, declining investor confidence, and potential challenges repaying its bond obligations if the cryptocurrency experiences a sharp downturn (as it has many times before). Metaplanet issues bonds to buy more Bitcoin Metaplanet made headlines when it raised about ¥30 billion through zero-interest ordinary bonds (about $208 million). The company can now access a large pool of capital without any immediate cost, dilution of shareholder equity, or long-term interest obligations because they don’t have to pay any interest over the life of the bonds. Private institutional investor, EVO Fund, subscribed to the entire bond offering at 0% interest, which showed growing institutional interest in Bitcoin-based strategies in Japan, where investors seek alternative stores of value due to ultra-low interest rates and a weakening yen. It could also be a gamble that Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings will appreciate over time, increasing the company’s valuation and ability to repay the bond principal when it matures. Metaplanet first allocated a portion of the $208 million to repurchase and cancel one of its previous bond series, worth ¥1.75 billion (about $12 million) with an interest rate of 0.36% per year, before buying new Bitcoin. It then used the remainder of the proceeds to buy 1,005 new BTC at an average price of $107,601 per coin, for a total cost of about $108 million. The company now holds 13,350 BTC and is ahead of well-known corporate holders like Tesla and Galaxy Digital. Metaplanet plans to hold 210,000 BTC Metaplanet’s holdings have quadrupled to 13,350 BTC from just 3,350 BTC three months ago, and the company plans to more than double its current position within the next six months to about 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. It aims to increase that number to 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026 and accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 (1% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist). Metaplanet plans to raise $5.4 billion through bond issuance, private placements, and other capital market instruments under the “555 Million Plan” to fund this large-scale accumulation effort. Zero-interest bonds look smart but carry risk Zero-interest loans may carry no interest, but they are still debt obligations that must be repaid fully at maturity. Metaplanet has no recurring revenue stream from these holdings to help it repay its bond debt because Bitcoin is a non-productive asset and doesn’t yield income, pay dividends, or offer intrinsic returns unless sold. The company is essentially wagering that the value of Bitcoin will rise enough by the time the bonds mature to cover both the principal repayment and deliver substantial gains. Metaplanet can sell just a fraction of its holdings at a higher price, repay its zero-interest debt in full, and retain most of its position, possibly doubling or tripling the net asset value on its books if Bitcoin rises steadily over the next two years. However, the company will be holding debt that still needs to be paid, while its core asset depreciates on its balance sheet if the price of Bitcoin stalls or falls significantly. This scenario would undermine Metaplanet’s balance sheet and investor narrative because it would have to liquidate part of its holdings at a loss. The collapse of Archegos Capital, Terra-Luna’s death spiral , or even WeWork’s implosion under unsustainable growth promises are cautionary tales of a broader danger many companies have faced when borrowing heavily to invest in assets that do not generate income. Each case shows how aggressive financial engineering and optimistic growth projections masked deeper fragilities that only became visible when external conditions shifted. They also expose how quickly investor confidence can turn into panic when expectations aren’t met, especially when debt is involved. Metaplanet’s capital strategy assumes that Bitcoin is a sound store of value and a high-growth asset that will appreciate enough to cover long-term debt commitments. The combination of a falling asset and a fixed debt repayment schedule that could cause a liquidity crunch or a sharp decline in investor trust poses a great danger to the company’s confidence in Bitcoin. Metaplanet could face serious challenges refinancing future obligations if capital markets tighten or institutional backers become less willing to underwrite zero-interest debt for crypto-heavy firms. Similarly, the company is in an increasingly fragile position where even small missteps could trigger scrutiny as it grows its Bitcoin holdings and debt obligations. The regulatory tone could shift quickly if Japan’s financial regulators begin to question the prudence of allowing a listed firm to fund large, speculative bets with zero-cost leverage. Investors push up the stock after Bitcoin buy Confidence in Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy remains high, at least in the short term, as investors pushed the company’s stock price up by 10% almost immediately after it disclosed it had raised millions through zero-interest bonds and used a large portion of it to buy another 1,005 Bitcoin. Metaplantet is announcing ambitious goals, raising capital to buy more Bitcoin, and outlining a roadmap that could see it hold up to 210,000 BTC by 2027 in an environment where many companies remain cautious about digital assets. The company’s boldness attracted media attention and investor interest, especially among those who see Bitcoin as undervalued or believe it could one day replace fiat currencies as the world’s dominant store of value. However, Metaplanet’s gains are only real if Bitcoin’s price remains high. The company’s balance sheet could quickly take a hit, and the same investors who are currently cheering the strategy could just as easily retreat, pulling down the stock price in the process if the price of Bitcoin were to drop by 20% or 30% suddenly. Metaplanet’s stock has clearly done well, but the question is whether the current valuation reflects long-term value or short-term speculation. The market seems to be giving Metaplanet the benefit of the doubt.

This isn’t just about a disagreement; Trump’s remarks suggest potential further challenges for Musk’s vast empire, extending beyond the immediate concerns of EV policy changes . For anyone tracking the dynamic intersection of innovation, politics, and the future of the tech industry , these statements carry significant weight. What exactly did Trump say, and what could it mean for the man behind Tesla, SpaceX, and X? What Did Donald Trump Really Say About Elon Musk? The recent comments from Donald Trump regarding Elon Musk have quickly become a focal point of discussion. According to reports from financial news outlets Odaily and JinSe Finance, Trump indicated that Musk is particularly vexed by the reversal of certain electric vehicle mandates. More intriguingly, Trump hinted that this setback might not be an isolated incident, suggesting that ‘additional consequences could follow.’ This veiled warning from a former president, who remains a highly influential figure, raises questions about the political headwinds Elon Musk might face. These remarks are more than just casual observations; they signal a potential deepening of the intricate relationship between political power and corporate innovation. Trump’s words suggest a level of awareness, perhaps even a strategic intent, regarding the pressures on key figures within the tech industry . Understanding the Impact of EV Policy Changes on Tesla At the heart of Elon Musk’s reported frustration lies the landscape of EV policy changes . While the specific ‘electric vehicle mandate’ Trump referenced isn’t explicitly detailed, it likely pertains to shifts in government incentives, regulations, or environmental policies that directly impact the electric vehicle market, particularly Tesla’s dominant position within it. Historically, government support, through tax credits, emissions standards, or infrastructure development, has played a crucial role in accelerating EV adoption. The withdrawal or weakening of such mandates can present significant challenges for EV manufacturers. For Tesla, a company that has heavily relied on regulatory credits and favorable policy environments, any adverse EV policy changes could translate into: Increased production costs. Reduced consumer incentives, potentially slowing sales. Heightened competition in a less regulated market. A shift in market dynamics that forces strategic re-evaluation. This shift underscores the vulnerability of even the most innovative companies to the whims of political and regulatory environments. For Elon Musk , who has often navigated these waters with a unique blend of defiance and pragmatism, this is a tangible obstacle. What Does This Mean for the Broader Tech Industry? Trump’s suggestion of ‘additional consequences’ for Elon Musk extends the narrative far beyond just EV policy changes . It raises a critical question for the entire tech industry : are we entering an era where political influence directly impacts the operational freedom and growth trajectories of leading tech companies and their founders? Musk’s ventures span multiple critical sectors, including space exploration (SpaceX), artificial intelligence (xAI), and social media (X, formerly Twitter). Potential impacts on the broader tech industry could include: Increased Scrutiny: Other tech giants might face similar political pressure, leading to more intense antitrust investigations, data privacy regulations, or content moderation debates. Investment Uncertainty: Investors might become warier of sectors or companies perceived as politically vulnerable, potentially redirecting capital. Innovation Roadblocks: Political interference or unpredictable policy shifts can stifle innovation by creating an unstable environment for long-term planning and investment in R&D. The case of Elon Musk serves as a high-profile example of the growing intersection between technology, politics, and national interest, reminding us that even the most disruptive innovators operate within a framework of evolving governmental oversight. Navigating the Complexities of Regulatory Challenges When Donald Trump speaks of ‘additional consequences,’ he alludes to a range of potential regulatory challenges that could impact Elon Musk’s various enterprises. These aren’t necessarily about direct retaliation but rather the tightening of existing regulations or the introduction of new ones that could complicate business operations. Possible areas of increased regulatory challenges could include: Antitrust Investigations: Scrutiny over market dominance in EVs, space launch services, or social media platforms. Environmental Regulations: Beyond EV mandates, new rules concerning manufacturing processes, battery disposal, or carbon emissions across all industries. Labor Laws: Increased oversight on worker rights, unionization efforts, or employment practices. Data Privacy and Content Moderation: Particularly relevant for X, new laws could impose stricter requirements on data handling, censorship, or platform liability. International Trade Policies: Tariffs or restrictions on imports/exports of critical components or finished products, impacting global supply chains. For Elon Musk , whose companies often push the boundaries of technology and established norms, navigating these intricate regulatory challenges requires a delicate balance of compliance, lobbying, and strategic adaptation. The political climate can significantly influence the severity and enforcement of these regulations. What’s Next for Elon Musk’s Empire? The recent comments from Donald Trump undoubtedly add another layer of complexity to the already multifaceted journey of Elon Musk . Known for his audacious goals and unconventional approach, Musk has built an empire that defies traditional corporate structures. However, even a visionary like Musk is not immune to the pressures of political and regulatory landscapes. What might this mean for Elon Musk’s immediate and long-term strategy? It could necessitate a more cautious approach to public commentary, a stronger focus on government relations, or even a re-evaluation of investment priorities in politically sensitive areas. His ability to innovate and disrupt has often been accompanied by controversy, and these latest political remarks highlight the ongoing tension between groundbreaking entrepreneurship and established power structures. Ultimately, how Elon Musk responds to these implied warnings and potential regulatory challenges will be a defining factor in the trajectory of his various companies and his legacy as one of the most influential figures of our time. The recent remarks from Donald Trump serve as a potent reminder that the path of innovation, especially for a figure as prominent as Elon Musk , is rarely smooth. The frustration over EV policy changes appears to be just one facet of a potentially broader set of regulatory challenges that could impact not only Tesla but the entire tech industry . As the interplay between politics and technology intensifies, monitoring these developments becomes crucial for investors, industry leaders, and consumers alike. The future of innovation, spearheaded by figures like Elon Musk , will increasingly depend on their ability to navigate not just technological hurdles, but also the complex and often unpredictable currents of political will.

This isn’t just another corporate expansion; it signifies a powerful convergence of established enterprises with the decentralized future, marking a pivotal moment for institutional adoption within the crypto industry . For anyone tracking the evolution of digital assets, NIP Group’s strategic acquisition of state-of-the-art mining equipment from Fortune Peak and Apex Cyber Capital is a development worth exploring in depth. NIP Group’s Bold Leap into Bitcoin Mining : What’s the Strategy? The recent announcement from NIP Group, detailed in a Globe Newswire press release, confirms their decisive step into the realm of digital asset generation. This isn’t a cautious dip of the toe; it’s a significant commitment designed to establish NIPG as a formidable player in the Bitcoin mining landscape. The core of this initiative lies in the acquisition of specialized mining hardware, which is the engine room for generating new Bitcoin. What makes this move particularly compelling? Direct Asset Generation: By engaging in Bitcoin mining , NIP Group isn’t just investing in crypto; they are actively participating in the creation of new BTC, directly contributing to their asset base. This offers a unique avenue for revenue diversification and asset accumulation, distinct from simply buying Bitcoin on the open market. Projected Output: The company anticipates producing approximately 60 BTC per month. To put that into perspective, at current market prices, this represents a substantial monthly revenue stream, underscoring the scale and ambition of their new venture. This projected BTC production figure highlights the potential for significant returns on their investment in mining infrastructure. New Operational Division: To manage this complex operation, NIPG is establishing a dedicated Digital Computing Division. This signals a long-term commitment and the integration of crypto operations into their core business structure, rather than treating it as a peripheral experiment. It suggests a strategic vision that sees digital asset operations as a fundamental component of their future growth. This strategic pivot is more than just about accumulating Bitcoin; it’s about building a robust foundation in the digital economy, leveraging cutting-edge technology to create new value streams. It’s a testament to the growing recognition among traditional corporations of the intrinsic value and long-term potential of decentralized networks. Expanding into Digital Infrastructure : A Strategic Imperative? NIP Group’s foray into Bitcoin mining is not an isolated event but a calculated expansion into what they term ‘digital infrastructure.’ This phrase is key to understanding their broader vision. In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, digital infrastructure encompasses everything from data centers and cloud computing services to the underlying networks that power the internet and, increasingly, blockchain technology. Why is a company like NIP Group, which traditionally might operate in different sectors, making such a significant move into this space? The answer lies in the strategic imperative to adapt and innovate in a world increasingly reliant on digital assets and decentralized systems. Building out a robust digital infrastructure offers several compelling advantages: Future-Proofing Business Models: As the world shifts towards a more digitized economy, companies that own and operate critical digital infrastructure will be better positioned for future growth and resilience. This move allows NIP Group to participate directly in the foundational layer of the new digital economy. Diversification of Revenue Streams: Relying on a single or limited set of revenue streams can be risky. By entering Bitcoin mining , NIP Group is diversifying its income sources, adding a high-growth, technology-driven component to its portfolio. The consistent BTC production offers a new, tangible asset stream. Leveraging Technological Expertise: Operating large-scale computing infrastructure, whether for traditional data processing or crypto mining, requires significant technical expertise. NIP Group’s decision to manage these operations through its new Digital Computing Division suggests they are either developing or acquiring the necessary talent and resources to excel in this specialized field. Capitalizing on Emerging Markets: The digital asset space is still relatively nascent but growing at an exponential rate. By investing in digital infrastructure now, NIP Group is positioning itself to capitalize on the immense opportunities that this emerging market presents, potentially securing a first-mover advantage among traditional Nasdaq-listed entities. This strategic direction underscores a proactive approach to embracing technological disruption, transforming NIP Group into a more diversified and technologically advanced entity. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Industry ? NIP Group’s entry into Bitcoin mining is more than just a company news item; it’s a bellwether for the broader crypto industry . When a Nasdaq-listed entity with a traditional business background makes such a significant commitment, it sends a powerful signal to the market. This development contributes to a growing trend of institutional validation and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Consider the implications: Increased Institutional Adoption: NIP Group joins a growing list of public companies and institutional investors that are either directly holding Bitcoin, offering crypto-related services, or, in this case, actively participating in its generation. This trend lends significant credibility to the entire crypto industry , moving it further away from niche status and into the mainstream financial landscape. Legitimacy and Trust: The involvement of regulated, publicly traded companies like NIP Group helps to build trust and legitimacy around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It suggests that the asset class is maturing and becoming a viable, long-term investment and operational area for established businesses. Market Dynamics: As more large entities enter the mining space, it could influence market dynamics. Increased competition might drive efficiency and innovation in mining technology, but it could also lead to greater centralization of mining power, which is a point of ongoing debate within the decentralized community. Energy and Sustainability Focus: With larger corporations entering, there’s often an increased focus on sustainable practices. While not explicitly stated, future developments might see NIP Group addressing energy consumption and seeking renewable sources for their Bitcoin mining operations, aligning with broader ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) trends that are becoming increasingly important for public companies. This move by NIP Group serves as a strong indicator that the digital asset revolution is not just for tech startups and individual enthusiasts; it’s a fundamental shift that established corporations are actively embracing to secure their place in the future economy. Unpacking the Potential: The Promise of Consistent BTC Production The stated goal of approximately 60 BTC per month in BTC production is a critical detail, highlighting the immediate and long-term financial implications for NIP Group. This isn’t merely about holding Bitcoin; it’s about generating it consistently, turning a capital expenditure into a stream of valuable digital assets. Let’s break down the significance of this consistent production: Cost-Effective Accumulation: Mining can often be a more cost-effective way to acquire Bitcoin over the long term compared to direct market purchases, especially if the operational costs (electricity, hardware maintenance) are managed efficiently. It allows for dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin ownership. Revenue Stability (with caveats): While Bitcoin’s price is volatile, a consistent monthly BTC production provides a predictable quantity of digital assets. NIP Group can choose to hold these assets for long-term appreciation or sell them to cover operational costs and generate fiat revenue, providing a degree of financial flexibility. Scalability and Growth: The initial acquisition of machines is likely just the beginning. If successful, NIP Group could scale up its operations, increasing its monthly BTC production and expanding its footprint in the Bitcoin mining sector. This growth potential is a significant draw for corporations looking for new avenues of expansion. Hedging Against Inflation: For many corporations, holding Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against inflation and a store of value in an uncertain economic climate. By actively producing Bitcoin, NIP Group is not just buying into this hedge but is actively creating it, strengthening its balance sheet with a decentralized, censorship-resistant asset. The ability to consistently generate BTC production positions NIP Group uniquely within the market. It allows them to participate directly in the network’s security and value creation, rather than being a passive observer or simply a market participant. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for NIP Group in Crypto? As NIP Group embarks on this exciting journey into the crypto industry , it’s crucial to acknowledge that while the opportunities are immense, the path is not without its challenges. The world of Bitcoin mining is dynamic and requires careful navigation. Potential challenges and considerations for NIP Group : Energy Costs and Sustainability: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive. Managing energy costs efficiently and exploring renewable energy sources will be paramount for long-term profitability and meeting environmental expectations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and mining is still evolving globally. NIP Group will need to stay agile and compliant with changing laws and policies, which can vary significantly across jurisdictions. Hardware Obsolescence: Mining hardware (ASICs) becomes obsolete relatively quickly as new, more efficient models are released. Continuous investment in upgrading equipment will be necessary to maintain competitive hash rates and profitability. Bitcoin Price Volatility: While BTC production is consistent, the fiat value of that production is subject to Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. NIP Group will need robust risk management strategies to handle market fluctuations. Competition: The Bitcoin mining space is highly competitive, with large, established players and new entrants constantly vying for hash rate and profitability. Despite these challenges, NIP Group’s entry represents a powerful vote of confidence in the long-term viability and growth of the digital asset ecosystem. Their strategic focus on digital infrastructure , coupled with a commitment to consistent BTC production , positions them as a forward-thinking company ready to embrace the next frontier of technological and financial innovation. A Vision for the Future NIP Group’s acquisition of mining machines and the establishment of its Digital Computing Division is more than just a business decision; it’s a statement about the future. It underscores the increasing institutional recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and mining as a viable, strategic business operation. This bold move by NIP Group is set to inspire other traditional companies to explore similar ventures, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. As they commence their BTC production , the entire crypto industry will be watching to see how this strategic leap into digital infrastructure unfolds, potentially setting a new precedent for corporate engagement in the digital asset revolution.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Shows Bearish Divergence – Altseason Could Be Near Bitcoin Whales Lead Market Activity as Profit Realization Surges Recent data from CryptoQuant suggests that a significant shift in realized profits on Binance may be influencing short-term price trends. CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk highlighted a major event on June 16, when over $2.6 billion in profits were realized on Binance alone, the second-largest spike of its kind on the platform. This activity was followed by immediate selling pressure and market reaction, suggesting that profit-taking from large investors remains a core factor in the current price movement. According to Crazzyblockk, the June 16 event saw a total of $4.5 billion in realized profits across centralized exchanges, with Binance accounting for nearly 58% of that volume. “This milestone is more than just a data point — it’s a reminder of Binance’s unmatched influence on global crypto markets,” the analyst wrote. He emphasized Binance’s role in price discovery and how whale behavior on the platform often serves as a proxy for broader market sentiment. As institutional participants and high-net-worth investors execute large moves on Binance, their actions can foreshadow phases of trend reversals or sustained accumulation. The data also shows the importance of tracking realized profit and loss (PnL) metrics, especially on high-volume exchanges. The event reflects what Crazzyblockk described as “strategic profit-taking by sophisticated participants,” many of whom rely on Binance’s infrastructure for executing high-liquidity trades. Long-Term Holder Selling Seen as Constructive Rotation In a separate QuickTake post, CryptoQuant analyst Yonsei Dent offered a different perspective by analyzing long-term holder activity. Dent observed that although Bitcoin has been trading sideways between $100,000 and $110,000 since May, on-chain indicators such as Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) and Binary CDD show persistent selling from long-term holders. These are entities that have held their coins for more than six months, indicating a redistribution of supply. However, Dent argues that this selling may not imply weakness. “Despite this steady LTH selling, the price hasn’t broken down. This means the market is absorbing the sell pressure—implying new demand is coming in,” he explained. According to Dent, this dynamic, a rotation from older holders to new buyers, is common during mid-to-late stages of a bull market. Related Reading: Warning Signs? Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Take Profits as Leverage Spikes He also noted increased activity from coins held for one to three years, possibly reflecting profit-taking from previous cycle participants. Ultimately, Dent suggested the market may be undergoing a quiet redistribution, a phase that could lay the groundwork for future upside if buy-side demand remains strong.

Standing out right now are BlockDAG (BDAG), Cronos (CRO), Filecoin (FIL), and Litecoin (LTC), each offering different strengths and growth setups. BlockDAG is stirring buzz with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release and airdrop deal that opens a low entry point. Cronos is building momentum through its DeFi and cross-chain ecosystem upgrades. Filecoin looks undervalued with potential for a longer-term bounce. Litecoin, meanwhile, is in a tight trading range and gearing up to benefit from its halving cycle. 1. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release: Discounted Entry & Airdrop Buzz BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about coins to watch in 2025. This Layer 1 project, built on advanced DAG infrastructure, brings high scalability, lightning-fast confirmation speeds, and strong parallel processing. As part of the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, a special offer gives buyers access to BDAG coins at just $0.0016, valid until August 11. It is a rare window to grab coins before the price climbs. This moment follows a record-setting presale that raised $327 million and saw 23.4 billion coins sold. A six-week power plan has been rolled out to reward early users and maintain momentum as the project transitions toward coin unlocks and access. On top of that, a $100 million airdrop in June 2025 brought in new participants and kept energy high. BlockDAG is also eyeing listings on top-tier centralised exchanges this year, aiming to boost visibility and liquidity. It is a major move as the full network rollout nears. 2. Filecoin (FIL): Bear Market Moves But Long-Term Hope Filecoin (FIL) trades at $2.33 and continues to face downward pressure. While its decentralised storage model is seeing greater adoption, price action has lagged, staying under key moving averages. The daily trading volume hit $151 million, higher than normal, but sentiment and technical signals remain bearish. Most analysts expect the price to hover between $2.24 and $2.33 for now. Looking ahead, though, Filecoin is not being counted out. Projections say it could rebound to $4.44 by 2026 if demand for decentralised storage grows and the broader crypto market strengthens. Those with patience may find value here over time. 3. Cronos (CRO): Climbing Back Strong with Key Upgrades Cronos (CRO) has made real strides in 2025, helped by big developments like the 2024 launch of its zkEVM network. This upgrade made the network more scalable and EVM-compatible, helping Cronos gain traction in DeFi and NFTs. Its close ties with the Crypto.com ecosystem have only added to its momentum. The Cross-Bridge Mainnet Beta has expanded interoperability, pulling developers toward the platform. Despite a 30 to 43% price drop this year, CRO has bounced back by 50% in the last three months and now trades around $0.11. Optimism around its growth is rising, with forecasts suggesting CRO could hit $0.26 in 2025. With DeFi and cross-chain tools growing, more upside may be ahead. 4. Litecoin (LTC): Sideways Now, but Primed for a Breakout Litecoin (LTC) is priced at $86.37, down by 1.84% today, and has been moving sideways between $75 and $93. Even though it trades under key averages, LTC shows strong support at $75 and resistance near $93. A break above $86 could set up a quick move toward $100 and beyond, with analysts expecting average prices between $101 and $107 in July. The 2027 halving event could boost prices by tightening supply. Litecoin’s fast confirmation speeds and cheap fees still support its usage. End-of-year predictions range from $77 to $230, with $150 seen as a middle ground if adoption picks up. Insights on the Top-Performing Cryptos Today To wrap it up, the top-performing cryptos today are packed with opportunity. BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release and exclusive price window stand out, especially with a $100 million airdrop already in motion. Cronos continues to rise, backed by zkEVM upgrades and better cross-chain tools. Filecoin might be slow now, but its storage model could shine as adoption spreads. Litecoin is holding steady and could explode with its next halving on the horizon. These projects each offer a different kind of upside. For anyone trying to get ahead of the curve in 2025, they’re worth serious attention.

As speculation builds around a potential spot ETF approval for XRP, analysts are watching closely for what could follow—a broad rotation into altcoins with strong fundamentals, real-world relevance, and high upside potential. Solana is already benefitting from this capital rotation narrative. But another project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is quietly building the kind of momentum that typically precedes breakout cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Force in the Altcoin Rotation While large caps like Solana stand to benefit, the real opportunity may lie in projects still under the radar. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of those rare assets showing strategic strength before mainstream exposure. This meme-alt hybrid is seeing increasing traction for its disciplined launch structure, verified smart contract audit, and scarcity-based supply model. Investors seeking early exposure before major listings are paying close attention—and for good reason. Previous presale phases filled quickly, and the current momentum suggests that capital is rotating into this rising asset faster than most expect. Why an XRP ETF Could Reshape the Altcoin Landscape For years, XRP has carried the weight of regulatory uncertainty. Now, with ETF approval on the table and court victories stacking in Ripple’s favor, the market is recalibrating its outlook. The introduction of a regulated ETF would mark a defining moment—not just for XRP, but for how institutional investors engage with the broader altcoin market. By legitimizing XRP in the eyes of large capital allocators, an ETF could serve as the spark that sets off a new wave of altcoin flows. Historically, ETF approvals have acted as launchpads for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP could follow suit, with spillover effects rippling into other large-cap and mid-cap altcoins. Solana Is Poised to Capitalize on Institutional Rotation Solana has steadily positioned itself as a top-tier Layer 1 platform. While some competitors continue to struggle with congestion and downtime, Solana’s recent record of uptime and growing ecosystem strength is earning renewed confidence from institutional and retail investors alike. Analysts are especially focused on futures markets and ETF speculation. A growing number of asset managers are now eyeing Solana as a high-speed, low-cost alternative to Ethereum. Meanwhile, validator income and developer activity continue to climb—two of the strongest signs of blockchain health and long-term viability. If altcoin capital begins rotating aggressively post-XRP ETF approval, Solana is well positioned to lead the large-cap pack into the next market phase. Final Thoughts If an XRP ETF is approved, it won’t just lift one token—it could recalibrate the entire altcoin market. Capital always chases potential, and in this cycle, that potential is increasingly shifting toward new narratives. Solana is emerging as an institutional favorite, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a strategic entry point for investors seeking high ROI plays at an early stage. For those watching the next altcoin wave form, now may be the time to look beyond the familiar and into the assets quietly gaining strength.

Recently, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan made waves by reaffirming the firm’s audacious $200,000 Bitcoin price target for 2025. This isn’t just a hopeful guess; it’s a projection rooted in what they see as undeniable market forces. But while Bitcoin enjoys this bullish spotlight, Bitwise expresses a more tempered view on the prospects of other major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). What drives this divergence in confidence? Let’s dive into the fascinating details of Bitwise’s latest crypto outlook. Unpacking Bitwise’s Bold Bitcoin Price Target: Is $200K Achievable? Imagine Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, soaring to a staggering $200,000. For many, it sounds like a dream, but for Bitwise, it’s a tangible goal by 2025. Matt Hougan’s confidence stems from several powerful factors converging in the market. He points to a significant shift: the increasing legitimization of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class. This isn’t just retail enthusiasm; it’s a structural change driven by institutional adoption. Scarcity and Demand: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, coupled with rising demand, creates a classic supply-demand imbalance that favors price appreciation. Halving Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event further reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically leading to upward price pressure in the months following. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: While global economic conditions remain complex, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, attracting traditional investors. This long-term optimism for the Bitcoin price target stands out, especially given the market’s recent volatility. Bitwise’s conviction suggests they view current price fluctuations as temporary noise, rather than a derailment of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The Surge of Institutional Bitcoin Demand: A Game Changer? The narrative around Bitcoin has dramatically shifted from a niche digital curiosity to a recognized asset class, largely thanks to the influx of institutional capital. This growing institutional Bitcoin demand is arguably the most significant catalyst underpinning Bitwise’s bullish outlook. What does this look like in practice? Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs have seen unprecedented inflows, signaling a strong appetite from large funds, wealth managers, and even pension funds. Corporate Adoption: More corporations are exploring or already holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, viewing it as a treasury reserve asset. Financial Product Development: Major financial institutions are building out infrastructure and offering crypto-related services, from custody solutions to derivatives, further integrating Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. This institutional embrace provides deeper liquidity, greater stability, and a stamp of legitimacy that was previously missing. It transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a more mature investment vehicle, attracting capital that previously remained on the sidelines. Bitwise Crypto Outlook: A Nuanced Perspective on the Market’s Future While Bitwise’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin is clear, their broader Bitwise Crypto Outlook offers a more nuanced view of the wider altcoin market. The firm remains optimistic about the second half of 2025, driven by several overarching themes that benefit the entire crypto ecosystem, not just Bitcoin: Progressive Crypto Legislation: Clearer regulatory frameworks are emerging globally, which can provide certainty and foster innovation, attracting more mainstream participation. Growing Stablecoin Adoption: The increasing use of stablecoins for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions signifies real-world utility and broader acceptance of digital assets. Technological Advancements: Continuous innovation in blockchain technology, scaling solutions, and new decentralized applications (dApps) continues to expand the utility and potential of the crypto space. However, within this optimistic general outlook, Bitwise draws a distinction, expressing less confidence in Ethereum and Solana reaching new all-time highs compared to Bitcoin’s projected surge. This differentiation is crucial for understanding their investment philosophy. Why a Cautious Ethereum (ETH) Forecast? Understanding the Challenges Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Yet, Bitwise’s Ethereum (ETH) Forecast suggests a more conservative trajectory compared to Bitcoin. Why the caution? Scalability Concerns: Despite significant upgrades like the Merge, Ethereum still faces challenges with network congestion and high transaction fees during peak demand. While Layer 2 solutions exist, the base layer’s scalability remains a hurdle for mass adoption. Competition from Alt-L1s: Ethereum faces fierce competition from other Layer 1 blockchains (like Solana, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain) that offer faster transactions and lower fees, attracting developers and users away from the Ethereum ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory status of ETH, particularly whether it could be classified as a security, remains a point of debate and potential risk, unlike Bitcoin which is largely accepted as a commodity. Dilution of Focus: While Ethereum’s ecosystem is vast, its very breadth can lead to a dilution of focus for investors who might prefer the singular, clear value proposition of Bitcoin as digital gold. This isn’t to say Ethereum won’t grow, but rather that its path to new highs might be more challenging and less direct than Bitcoin’s, facing more headwinds from competition and inherent technical limitations. The Road Ahead for Solana (SOL) Future: Navigating Volatility and Competition Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the blockchain space, known for its high throughput and low transaction costs. However, Bitwise’s assessment of Solana (SOL) Future also carries a note of caution, similar to Ethereum, regarding its potential to reach new highs. Network Stability Issues: Solana has experienced several network outages and periods of instability in the past, which can erode user and developer confidence, despite efforts to improve resilience. Centralization Concerns: Critics often point to Solana’s relatively higher centralization compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, particularly concerning its validator set and initial token distribution. This raises questions about long-term decentralization and security. Intense Competition: Like Ethereum, Solana is in a highly competitive race with numerous other Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains vying for market share in the dApp and DeFi sectors. Standing out and maintaining dominance is a continuous challenge. Tokenomics and Inflation: While SOL has a strong community, its tokenomics and inflationary schedule can also influence its price trajectory, potentially creating selling pressure. For Solana, overcoming these challenges and consistently demonstrating reliability and true decentralization will be key to unlocking its full potential and sustaining long-term growth. Beyond the Forecasts: Navigating Crypto Market Dynamics It’s essential for investors to understand that while expert forecasts like Bitwise’s provide valuable insights, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile and subject to rapid shifts. The optimism for H2 2025, driven by factors like legislation and stablecoin adoption, paints a promising picture for the broader market. However, the distinction between Bitcoin and altcoins highlights a critical aspect of crypto investing: not all digital assets move in lockstep, and their individual fundamentals and market narratives play a significant role in their performance. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio Given Bitwise’s insights, what does this mean for you as an investor? Here are some actionable takeaways: Consider Bitcoin as a Core Holding: Bitwise’s strong conviction in Bitcoin, backed by institutional demand, suggests it could be a foundational asset in a diversified crypto portfolio. Evaluate Altcoins with Caution: While Ethereum and Solana offer immense technological potential, their paths to new highs might be more complex. Thorough research into their specific challenges, competitive landscape, and regulatory risks is paramount. Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A balanced portfolio across different asset classes and crypto categories can mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Legislation: Regulatory clarity is a significant tailwind. Keep an eye on developments in crypto legislation as it can profoundly impact market sentiment and adoption. Long-Term Perspective: The $200,000 Bitcoin target is for 2025. Crypto investing often rewards a long-term view, weathering short-term volatility for potential long-term gains. Conclusion: Bitwise’s Vision for a Transformative Crypto Future Bitwise’s latest outlook provides a compelling roadmap for the coming years in the crypto space. Their unwavering confidence in a $200,000 Bitcoin price target , fueled by surging institutional Bitcoin demand, paints a powerfully optimistic picture for the original cryptocurrency. Simultaneously, their more cautious stance on the immediate prospects for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) reaching new highs serves as a reminder that the crypto market is not a monolith; each asset has its unique set of opportunities and challenges. As the industry matures, driven by clearer legislation and stablecoin adoption, understanding these nuanced perspectives from experts like Bitwise will be crucial for navigating the transformative journey ahead.

However, the conversation is starting to shift beyond legacy assets to emerging altcoins with untapped potential. One name gaining noticeable traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-focused project that’s attracting retail attention thanks to its active ecosystem and early-stage price structure. The project has sold out more than 50% in phase 5 of its presale at a price of $0.03 today. MUTM has already managed to raise more than $11.4 million and attracted more than 12,600 investors to the project. As traders scan the market for the next crypto to explode, Mutuum Finance stands out, and its rapid growth trajectory is becoming harder to ignore. Ethereum Stays Low‑Volatile Around $2,426 as ETF Flows Strengthen Ethereum (ETH) is climbing up and trading around $2,426 making it resilient. In the last seven days, it has been trading within the range of $2,400-$2,500, but improved institution flows in Ethereum ETFs have reportedly received $206 million of new inflows over the last week. Technical indicators underscore vital support at $2,370 with resistance observed at the $2,550-$2,600 area, which, according to analysts, could result in a breakout in case the ETF trend continues to be fruitful. As Ethereum is looking at a possible boom, attention also focuses on the new altcoins, one of which is being talked more and more about Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,600 early adopters and more than $11.4 million raised, the project is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. USD-Pegged Stablecoin Token and $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance in its strategic moves to build more on its DeFi platform is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to very risky algorithmic stablecoins, this token is designed to maintain its worth even during market volatility. The project is all about security and integrity. Mutuum Finance platform is also already verifiably audited by the CertiK, which once again proves the team focus on transparency, reliability, and sustainability. Mutuum Finance has also introduced a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, where it is ready to give out the rewards of 50,000 USDT to bring convenience to the intended audience. The bounty is split into four categories, such as the critical, major, minor, and low. This will equate all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it. Investor Rewards To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be more than hype, with over $11.4 million raised, 12,600+ investors onboarded, and a presale price still at just $0.03. Phase 6 will bring a price increase, making now the window for maximum upside. Backed by a CertiK audit, $50K security bounty, and $100K in community rewards, MUTM is becoming a standout in DeFi.

Just as Bitcoin’s trajectory can be influenced by global liquidity, the stability and direction of the US Dollar outlook hold immense sway over financial markets worldwide. Recently, a significant voice from Wall Street, Bank of America (BofA), issued a compelling warning: the prevailing bearish view on the U.S. dollar might be becoming ‘complacent.’ This isn’t just a ripple in the currency pond; it’s a potential seismic shift that could impact everything from commodity prices to your crypto portfolio. Is Your Dollar Complacency a Risky Bet? BofA’s Urgent Warning For months, the narrative surrounding the U.S. dollar has largely been one of decline. Analysts and investors alike have bet heavily against the greenback, anticipating a significant weakening. This widespread bearishness has led to what Bank of America describes as ‘complacency,’ suggesting that the market might be overlooking crucial factors that could trigger a dollar rebound. But why is this complacency considered a risk? Historically, periods of extreme market positioning, especially against a major currency like the dollar, often precede a sharp reversal. When too many participants are on one side of a trade, any slight shift in fundamental data or sentiment can trigger a rapid unwinding of positions, leading to unexpected volatility. BofA’s concern stems from: Extreme Positioning: Net short positions on the dollar have reached levels that, in the past, have often marked a turning point for the currency. Underestimated Resilience: The market might be underestimating the U.S. economy’s ability to withstand global headwinds, or the Federal Reserve’s potential to maintain higher rates for longer than anticipated. Narrative Overload: The dominant narrative of a weakening dollar, driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and a slowing economy, may have become so entrenched that it blinds investors to alternative scenarios. This environment of widespread dollar complacency creates a fertile ground for a surprise rally, catching many off guard and potentially leading to significant losses for those heavily positioned against the dollar. Unpacking the Evolving US Dollar Outlook : Beyond the Conventional Wisdom The conventional wisdom driving the bearish dollar view centers on a few key pillars: anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, a slowing U.S. economy, and the potential for other global economies to catch up or even surpass U.S. growth. However, BofA’s warning challenges this perspective, urging investors to consider a more nuanced US Dollar outlook . What factors could propel the dollar higher, defying the consensus? Several catalysts could disrupt the current narrative: Sticky Inflation: If U.S. inflation proves more persistent than expected, forcing the Federal Reserve to maintain a tighter monetary policy for longer, the interest rate differential could continue to favor the dollar, attracting capital inflows. Global Growth Divergence: While the U.S. economy might be slowing, if other major economies (like Europe or China) face even greater challenges or slower recoveries, the dollar could regain its safe-haven appeal. The ‘least ugly shirt in the hamper’ scenario often benefits the dollar. Geopolitical Risks: Heightened global instability, whether from conflicts, trade tensions, or political uncertainty, typically sends investors flocking to the perceived safety of U.S. assets, boosting dollar demand. Fiscal Policy Impact: Large U.S. government spending and borrowing could also lead to higher bond yields, making dollar-denominated assets more attractive relative to others. These elements suggest that the path for the dollar is not a one-way street, and the current bearish consensus may be underestimating the currency’s underlying resilience and the complex interplay of global economic forces. Navigating Dynamic Forex Market Trends : What’s Shifting Beyond the Dollar? While the U.S. dollar’s potential rebound is a significant concern, it’s crucial to view it within the broader context of evolving forex market trends . Currency movements are interconnected, and a dollar reversal would undoubtedly send ripples across other major currency pairs. Understanding these broader dynamics is key for a comprehensive market view. Consider the interplay with other major currencies: Currency Pair Consensus View (Bearish USD) BofA’s Implied Warning (Potential USD Rebound) EUR/USD Euro strengthens as ECB tightens and EU economy recovers. Eurozone faces persistent inflation/growth challenges, ECB pivots slower than Fed, USD strength returns. USD/JPY Yen strengthens as BoJ exits negative rates and global yields fall. BoJ remains dovish, U.S. yields stay elevated, maintaining dollar strength against yen. GBP/USD Sterling gains on Bank of England hawkishness and improved UK economic outlook. UK inflation persistence and recession risks limit BoE’s flexibility, making sterling vulnerable to USD strength. These dynamics illustrate that a shift in the dollar’s trajectory would not occur in isolation. It would necessitate a reassessment of fundamental drivers for all major currency pairs, challenging many prevailing assumptions in the forex market trends . Decoding Global Currency Shifts : Interconnected Economies and Capital Flows The U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency means its strength or weakness is intrinsically linked to broader global currency shifts and the flow of international capital. Major economic developments in one region can have a cascading effect, influencing currency valuations across the board. Understanding these interconnections is vital for anticipating market movements. Consider the following influences on global currency dynamics: Trade Balances: Persistent trade deficits or surpluses can impact currency demand. A nation that imports more than it exports typically sees its currency weaken as it sells its own currency to buy foreign goods. Capital Flows: Investment decisions, whether direct foreign investment or portfolio investment (like buying bonds or stocks), drive capital flows. If investors perceive better returns or greater stability in U.S. assets, capital flows into the U.S., strengthening the dollar. Central Bank Policies: Divergent monetary policies among major central banks (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, People’s Bank of China) create interest rate differentials, influencing where capital flows for higher yields. Commodity Prices: Many commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. A stronger dollar can make commodities more expensive for non-dollar buyers, potentially impacting demand and inflation globally. Conversely, a weaker dollar can boost commodity prices. Geopolitical Stability: As mentioned, periods of global uncertainty often lead to a flight to safety, with the dollar being a primary beneficiary. This ‘safe-haven’ demand can override other economic fundamentals. These factors collectively paint a picture of how intertwined the world’s economies are, and how even subtle shifts in one area can trigger significant global currency shifts , with the dollar often at the epicenter. Key Economic Indicators : Your Compass for the Dollar’s Trajectory For investors seeking to navigate the complex waters of currency markets, monitoring key economic indicators is paramount. These data points provide critical insights into the health of an economy, influencing central bank decisions and, consequently, currency valuations. BofA’s warning underscores the need for vigilance, making a keen eye on these indicators more important than ever. Which economic indicators should you be closely watching to gauge the dollar’s potential direction? Inflation Data (CPI, PCE): These reports are crucial for understanding price pressures. If inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed might be compelled to keep rates elevated, supporting the dollar. Conversely, rapidly falling inflation could pave the way for rate cuts, weakening the dollar. Employment Reports (Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate): A strong labor market suggests economic resilience, which can support the dollar. Weak employment figures could signal an economic slowdown, pressuring the currency. Retail Sales: A gauge of consumer spending, which is a major component of GDP. Robust retail sales indicate a healthy economy, while declines can signal weakness. Manufacturing and Services PMIs (Purchasing Managers’ Indexes): These surveys offer a forward-looking view of economic activity in key sectors. Strong readings suggest expansion, while weak readings indicate contraction. Interest Rate Decisions and Central Bank Commentary (FOMC Meetings): The Federal Reserve’s stance on monetary policy is arguably the most significant driver of the dollar. Pay close attention to rate hike/cut expectations and any forward guidance from Fed officials. Treasury Yields: The yields on U.S. government bonds reflect investor expectations about future interest rates and economic growth. Higher yields tend to attract foreign capital, boosting the dollar. By diligently tracking these economic indicators , investors can gain a clearer understanding of the underlying forces shaping the dollar’s performance and make more informed decisions, moving beyond mere complacency. Bank of America’s warning against dollar complacency serves as a potent reminder that market consensus, while powerful, is not infallible. The prevailing bearish sentiment on the U.S. dollar, fueled by expectations of aggressive rate cuts and a slowing economy, may be overlooking the currency’s inherent resilience and the complex array of factors that could trigger a significant rebound. From persistent inflation to global growth divergences and geopolitical uncertainties, numerous catalysts could shift the US Dollar outlook . For those navigating the interconnected world of finance, particularly cryptocurrency enthusiasts who understand the volatility of sentiment, staying informed about broader forex market trends and key economic indicators is paramount. As global currency shifts continue to unfold, a vigilant and adaptable approach will be key to identifying opportunities and mitigating risks in an ever-evolving landscape. The message is clear: don’t let complacency lead to missed opportunities or unexpected setbacks.

While long-term conviction remains strong in these large-cap assets, a growing number of analysts and early-stage investors are beginning to explore new, narrative-driven opportunities. One such project gaining momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently entered watchlists as a potential standout in this evolving market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Investor Focus With Strategic Setup In the wake of slowing movement from Ethereum and Avalanche, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly gaining visibility as an early-stage project with calculated upside potential. Built around a narrative that aligns with current macro trends, the project’s token distribution strategy has created increasing demand from forward-looking investors. Analysts note that previous entry rounds sold out rapidly, reflecting both rising interest and the project’s ability to attract capital at an early stage. Its structured rollout and upcoming milestones are seen as pivotal catalysts in an environment where investors are prioritizing new growth stories over static large-cap positions. Summer entries into MAGACOIN FINANCE could still position early buyers for a projected return as the project advances toward public listings. Ethereum’s Upgrade Momentum Meets Market Caution The foundation of Ethereum remains strong for the long term after the finalized scope of the Fusaka fork. Some technical alterations made by the developers for efficiency of execution layer include setting of gas ceilings, limit on size of contracts and new opcodes. Being currently tested in development networks, the improvement proposals look to place Ethereum in a position to keep scaling and adopting. However, market movement around Ethereum has slowed. Traders are now in a wait-and-watch mode as volatility stays within limits and long-term outlook is positive but global fears and lower inflows are keeping traders cautious. After some positive on-chain factors, such as increased staking and institutional ETF interest, Ethereum could be limited to accumulation. Avalanche Shows Growth, but Momentum Stabilizes Avalanche has attracted interest from institutional investors in the past few weeks. The blockchain’s integration into European-regulated exchange-traded products and ongoing expansion—showcased at Summit London—shows that it is now widely recognized as an enterprise-grade blockchain. However, there weren’t any significant technical upgrades introduced. Although institutional interest is on the rise, Avalanche’s price has undergone a significant devaluation. Investors who profited from earlier price cycles are now seeking to reposition into smaller, more dynamic stocks with stronger catalysts in the near term. Conclusion While Ethereum and Avalanche continue to build foundational infrastructure, market participants are shifting part of their attention toward earlier-phase assets with room for faster expansion. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered this narrative as a structured, thematically aligned project that offers more than speculation—it presents a roadmap-backed opportunity with the potential to outperform in upcoming cycles.

When Jerome Powell , the Chair of the Federal Reserve, speaks, investors and analysts worldwide listen intently. His recent comments on the nation’s economic health and the trajectory of inflation offer a compelling glimpse into the central bank’s strategic thinking, especially concerning its Federal Reserve Policy . For those navigating the volatile crypto landscape, understanding these macroeconomic signals is absolutely vital, as they often dictate broader market sentiment and liquidity. Powell’s nuanced remarks underscore a period of cautious optimism, suggesting a steady hand at the tiller amidst evolving global trade tensions. Jerome Powell’s Latest Insights: Navigating the Economic Landscape Jerome Powell recently delivered a clear assessment of the U.S. economy, characterizing it as being in a solid shape . This reassuring statement comes at a time when global economic uncertainties, particularly those stemming from escalating trade disputes, are a major concern for investors. Powell highlighted that, when factoring out the direct effects of new tariffs, inflation appears to be progressing precisely as anticipated. This distinction is crucial, as tariffs can introduce artificial price increases that do not necessarily reflect underlying economic demand or health. His insights provide a foundational understanding for anyone interested in the future direction of the economy: Economic Resilience: The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate robust performance, supported by strong employment figures and consumer spending. Inflationary Trajectory: Excluding the volatile impact of tariffs, core inflation metrics are moving in line with the Fed’s targets, indicating a stable pricing environment. Prudent Approach: The Federal Reserve’s current stance is one of patience, allowing economic data to fully unfold before making significant policy shifts. This careful observation of economic indicators, free from the noise of trade-induced volatility, is central to the Fed’s strategy, aiming to ensure sustainable growth without overheating the economy. Understanding the Current Inflation Outlook: Is It Stable? The Inflation Outlook is a critical barometer for central banks, guiding their monetary policy decisions. Jerome Powell explicitly stated that inflation is ‘on track’ when tariff impacts are excluded. This seemingly simple statement carries significant implications. Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can directly increase consumer prices. However, these are often considered ‘supply-side’ shocks rather than indicators of underlying demand-driven inflation. What does ‘on track’ mean for the average consumer and investor? Target Adherence: It suggests that the underlying inflation rate, often measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is moving towards or holding steady around the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. Excluding Volatility: By excluding tariffs, the Fed aims to see through temporary price spikes to assess the true inflationary pressures driven by wage growth, consumer demand, and business investment. Anticipated Summer Rise: Powell also noted that higher inflation readings are anticipated over the summer. This could be due to seasonal factors, the lagged effect of earlier economic strength, or perhaps the eventual, broader pass-through of tariff costs despite the Fed’s attempt to isolate them. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, a stable inflation outlook often translates to less urgent demand for inflation hedges like Bitcoin, but it also signals a predictable economic environment that can foster broader market confidence. Federal Reserve Policy: The Prudent Path Forward The core of the Federal Reserve’s approach, particularly regarding its Federal Reserve Policy on interest rates, is currently defined by patience. Powell confirmed that the Fed paused its rate changes in direct response to the ‘scale of new tariffs.’ This highlights the central bank’s adaptability and its commitment to assessing evolving economic conditions before making significant moves. The Fed’s dual mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability. In this context, ‘patience’ isn’t inaction; it’s a strategic waiting game: Data-Dependent Decisions: The Fed remains highly data-dependent, scrutinizing incoming economic reports on employment, inflation, and GDP growth. Risk Management: By pausing, the Fed aims to mitigate potential risks arising from trade tensions, which could disrupt supply chains, dampen business investment, and ultimately slow economic growth. Communication is Key: Clear communication from the Fed, like Powell’s statements, helps manage market expectations and reduces volatility, providing a clearer roadmap for investors. This cautious stance means that while the economy remains strong, the Fed is unlikely to rush into further rate adjustments, preferring to observe the full impact of global trade dynamics. Decoding the US Economic Outlook: Strength Amidst Uncertainty The assertion that the US Economic Outlook is in ‘solid shape’ provides a foundation for understanding the Fed’s current policy. This strength is multifaceted, encompassing various indicators: Robust Labor Market: Continued low unemployment rates and steady job creation signal a healthy employment picture. Consumer Confidence: Strong consumer spending, which accounts for a significant portion of economic activity, indicates confidence in future economic conditions. Moderate Growth: While not booming, the economy is experiencing steady, sustainable growth, avoiding the pitfalls of excessive expansion that could lead to overheating. However, this strength is not without its caveats. The ongoing trade disputes, particularly the imposition of tariffs, introduce an element of uncertainty. Businesses face higher costs, and supply chains are being re-evaluated, which could eventually weigh on corporate profits and investment. The Fed’s strategy of patience acknowledges these headwinds, aiming to provide stability as the economy navigates these external pressures. Future of Interest Rate Decisions: What to Expect? The phrase ‘waiting remains the prudent approach’ from Jerome Powell offers significant insight into the near-term future of Interest Rate Decisions . It signals that the Federal Reserve is in a holding pattern, preferring to maintain the current federal funds rate unless compelling economic data suggests a shift is necessary. This ‘wait-and-see’ approach is directly tied to the Fed’s assessment of the economy’s strength and the evolving impact of tariffs. What does this mean for markets and your portfolio? No Immediate Hikes or Cuts: Barring unforeseen economic shocks, significant interest rate movements are unlikely in the immediate future. Data Dependency: Future decisions will hinge heavily on how inflation actually behaves over the summer, how trade tensions evolve, and whether economic growth remains robust. Market Stability: A predictable interest rate environment can reduce uncertainty for businesses and investors, potentially fostering a more stable market for both traditional assets and cryptocurrencies. For crypto investors, stable interest rates in traditional finance can sometimes lead to capital flowing into alternative assets seeking higher returns, though this correlation is complex and influenced by many factors. Conversely, sudden shifts in Fed policy can trigger significant volatility across all asset classes. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors While the Fed projects confidence, challenges persist. The primary challenge remains the unpredictable nature of global trade relations and their potential to disrupt economic forecasts. Investors should: Monitor Trade Developments: Keep a close eye on trade negotiations and any new tariff announcements, as these directly impact corporate costs and consumer prices. Diversify Portfolios: A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional assets and carefully selected cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks associated with economic shifts. Stay Informed on Inflation: Pay attention to core inflation data, distinguishing it from tariff-induced price changes, to understand true economic pressures. Understand Fed Nuances: Recognize that ‘patience’ is a strategic policy, not a lack of direction, and indicates the Fed’s commitment to long-term stability. For the crypto market, a stable macro environment, as signaled by Powell, might reduce immediate pressure for safe-haven assets, but the underlying narrative of decentralized finance continues to attract long-term interest. A Compelling Summary: The Fed’s Steady Hand In essence, Jerome Powell ‘s recent statements paint a picture of a resilient US Economic Outlook , guided by a patient and data-driven Federal Reserve Policy . The current Inflation Outlook appears to be on a manageable path, especially when isolated from the transient effects of tariffs. This approach suggests that significant Interest Rate Decisions are not imminent, allowing the economy to absorb global trade pressures without immediate policy intervention. For all market participants, including those deeply invested in the crypto space, the Fed’s commitment to stability and careful observation offers a degree of predictability in an otherwise uncertain global economic landscape. This measured strategy aims to ensure sustainable growth, paving the way for continued economic health and a more stable environment for innovation and investment.

Though China continues to enforce a sweeping ban on cryptocurrency activities, recent comments from senior People’s Bank of China (PBOC) officials have reignited debate over stablecoins — digital assets typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng recently acknowledged that stablecoins could “revolutionize international finance,” especially in a geopolitical climate where traditional payment systems are vulnerable to weaponization through sanctions. Pan highlighted the strategic importance of building alternative infrastructure to avoid such risks, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum in June, Former PBOC chief Zhou Xiaochuan also spoke at the event, warning that dollar-linked stablecoins might facilitate dollarization. At the same time, other officials floated the idea of yuan-based stablecoins to boost China’s ambitions of internationalizing its currency. US crypto push spurs Chinese reassessment The renewed focus in China comes as the US doubles down on its digital dollar agenda. Just hours before Chinese officials addressed the Lujiazui Forum, the US Senate passed a landmark bill to regulate stablecoins — a major win for the crypto industry and President Donald Trump’s digital asset strategy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent further amplified support, claiming that stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s role, not undermine it. He cited greater trust in the US regulatory oversight compared to centralized digital currencies like the e-CNY. Stablecoins, already gaining ground for their ability to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper, are forecasted to grow to $3.7 trillion in supply by 2030, with most currently backed by US dollars and short-term Treasuries. Hong Kong emerges as a launchpad for China’s stablecoin ambitions Beijing has historically viewed crypto as a threat to capital controls and financial stability. Yet experts now see a critical opportunity. Robin Xing, Chief China Economist at Morgan Stanley, noted that stablecoins are not new currencies, but new distribution channels for existing ones. China must embrace sovereign currency tokenization to stay competitive. Xing and others suggest that Hong Kong could be a regulatory sandbox for offshore yuan-linked stablecoins . Hong Kong has already introduced a legal framework for fiat-referenced stablecoins, and tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly preparing license applications. JD.com’s Chief Economist Shen Jianguang warned that China risks falling behind without a serious push into stablecoins. Founder Richard Liu has said the firm aims to cut cross-border payment costs by 90% and reduce settlement times to under 10 seconds using stablecoins. Meanwhile, Zhejiang China Commodities City Group Co., operator of the world’s largest wholesale market, also announced intentions to enter the space via licensing. China pushes ahead with dual-track digital strategy China’s current digital currency efforts have struggled to gain traction. The e-CNY, the state-backed digital yuan, has seen limited adoption. At the same time, mBridge, a cross-border project with several central banks, faced uncertainty after the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) withdrew over concerns that it could be used to skirt sanctions. Despite setbacks, Pan announced plans for an international e-CNY center in Shanghai, signaling Beijing’s continued ambitions in digital finance. To move forward, experts suggest a dual-track strategy. The National Institution for Finance and Development Chairman Li Yang said China should expand traditional efforts like CIPS and currency swaps while leveraging Hong Kong’s capabilities to pilot yuan stablecoins. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, Hong Kong’s stablecoin efforts could become Beijing’s alternative to sidestep SWIFT, alongside CIPS and mBridge. Still, hurdles remain. Stablecoins are currently used more for crypto trading than global commerce. Regulatory uncertainties persist, especially regarding whether they qualify as currencies or financial instruments. Eswar Prasad, a Cornell professor and author of The Future of Money, cautioned that yuan-linked stablecoins may struggle without deeper reforms. “Without unifying onshore and offshore yuan markets, these stablecoins won’t gain much traction,” he said Yet he also believes they may catalyze reform, nudging China toward more market-oriented policies. As the US continues to cement its lead in the digital currency race, China is now at a critical crossroads in either cautiously observing or stepping boldly into the future of global finance through stablecoin innovation.

This significant funding is earmarked specifically for its ambitious Bitcoin accumulation strategy, marking one of the largest such raises by a NYSE-listed company to date. This development underscores a growing trend of established corporations embracing digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. Why Are Companies Like DDC Enterprise Pursuing Bitcoin Accumulation? The decision by DDC Enterprise to commit such substantial capital to Bitcoin is not an isolated incident but rather a reflection of a broader paradigm shift in corporate treasury management. For years, Bitcoin has been lauded by proponents as ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and a store of value in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. Companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional fiat reserves to diversify their balance sheets and potentially enhance long-term shareholder value. Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns on the rise, Bitcoin offers a decentralized asset with a capped supply, making it attractive as a potential safeguard against currency debasement. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, appealing to companies seeking to capitalize on the nascent digital economy. Strategic Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin can also be a strategic move, positioning a company as forward-thinking and innovative in a rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. Unpacking DDC Enterprise’s Monumental Capital Raise The $528 million capital raise by DDC Enterprise represents a significant vote of confidence from institutional investors in the company’s vision and the future of Bitcoin. The initial closing of this raise, as reported by Business Wire, positions DDC at the forefront of corporate Bitcoin adoption among NYSE-listed entities. The funding mechanisms employed by DDC Enterprise are particularly noteworthy: Stock Purchase Agreements: The company entered into agreements with various investors, including prominent names like Anson Funds, Animoca Brands, and QCP Capital. This direct equity investment signals strong belief in DDC’s strategic direction and its ability to execute on its corporate Bitcoin strategy . Animoca Brands and QCP Capital, both deeply rooted in the blockchain and crypto space, lend significant credibility and expertise to DDC’s venture. Convertible Bond Issuance: The inclusion of convertible bonds provides DDC with flexible financing, allowing investors to convert their debt into equity under certain conditions. This structure is often favored in growth-oriented strategies, offering a balance between debt and equity financing. This multi-faceted approach to funding highlights DDC’s sophistication in navigating complex financial markets to achieve its strategic objectives. The involvement of both traditional investment funds (Anson Funds) and crypto-native entities (Animoca Brands, QCP Capital) bridges the gap between conventional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space, creating a powerful synergy for DDC’s future endeavors. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? The bold move by DDC Enterprise is likely to serve as a strong precedent for other NYSE-listed company ies contemplating similar strategies. As more public companies allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, it could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s market dynamics, potentially leading to increased stability and institutional validation. Key implications include: Aspect Potential Impact Market Validation Further legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class for institutional investors and corporations. Demand & Scarcity Increased corporate buying pressure on a finite supply could drive long-term price appreciation. Regulatory Scrutiny More corporate adoption may prompt clearer regulatory frameworks, benefiting the broader crypto ecosystem. Accounting Practices Pushes for standardized accounting practices for digital assets on corporate balance sheets. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price might be speculative, the long-term trend of institutional and corporate adoption is undeniable. DDC Enterprise’s substantial capital raise for Bitcoin accumulation is a clear indicator that digital assets are moving from the periphery to the core of global financial planning. Challenges and Considerations for DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin Accumulation While the prospects of corporate Bitcoin holdings are exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. DDC Enterprise, like any company embarking on a significant digital asset strategy, will need to navigate several complexities: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can impact a company’s balance sheet in the short term. Managing this volatility requires robust risk management strategies. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Companies must remain agile and compliant with changing laws across different jurisdictions. Security: Safeguarding large quantities of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacks and theft. This often involves cold storage solutions and multi-signature wallets. Accounting & Reporting: Current accounting standards for digital assets can be complex, requiring careful consideration for financial reporting and tax implications. DDC Enterprise’s success in this venture will largely depend on its ability to effectively mitigate these risks while maximizing the potential benefits of its corporate Bitcoin strategy . A Glimpse into the Future: The Evolving Corporate Bitcoin Landscape The $528 million capital raise by DDC Enterprise for its Bitcoin strategy is more than just a corporate finance story; it’s a testament to the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. It signals a future where digital assets are not just speculative investments for individuals but integral components of corporate treasuries worldwide. As an e-commerce company, DDC Enterprise’s move is particularly interesting, suggesting a potential future where digital assets play a larger role in transactional business models beyond just treasury management. This bold step by a NYSE-listed company like DDC Enterprise reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a legitimate asset class, capable of attracting significant institutional capital. It sets a powerful precedent, encouraging other traditional businesses to re-evaluate their financial strategies and consider the strategic advantages of digital asset integration. The journey of Bitcoin accumulation for DDC Enterprise will be closely watched by analysts and investors alike, as it could very well pave the way for a new era of corporate finance.

Among the projects standing out are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Avalanche, and Ethereum, each capturing unique investor interest for very different reasons. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Meme-Powered Altcoin with Political Punch MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as one of the most watched meme-powered altcoins in 2025. Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on social hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE brands itself as both a decentralised political memecoin and a hybrid altcoin, combining ideological appeal with a clear community-first structure. Built around themes of anti-centralisation and cultural resonance, MAGACOIN FINANCE uses a zero-tax model to attract traders seeking more than short-lived pumps. It’s a fully audited smart contract by Hashex, and its policy of no venture capital control has positioned it as one of the more transparent meme projects to launch this cycle. The token’s growing community, now boasting tens of thousands of engaged members, adds to its momentum. Early supporters highlight the project’s potential for sustained traction as the broader market seeks fresh narratives beyond the usual suspects, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Rumours of future exchange listings and increased wallet activity hint that MAGACOIN FINANCE could remain a key meme-driven player through Q4 2025 and beyond. Avalanche: Altcoin Fundamentals Stay Strong Memecoins rely on culture and virality, but Avalanche has emerged as a popular choice for traders seeking speed, scalability, and real-world applications. AVAX was trading at $18 when it experienced a price correction on June 30 2025. Many supporters think that the current AVAX price is a good entry point. Avalanche has the processing power of approximately 6,500 transactions per second due to its architecture, comprising the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. In both the DeFi space and the gaming sphere, this makes it a worthy competitor of Ethereum. Using technical analysis, AVAX is projected to trade at $20 at the end of 2025. In the longer term, the price may range between $30 to $35 in the first half of Q3. Moreover, it may peak at $50 by the end of the year in a bullish case. Avalanche’s 9000 mainnet upgrade, coupled with partnerships from financial players such as Mastercard, is progressively reassuring ecosystem use cases and investor confidence. Avalanche’s solid fundamentals and continuously growing development ecosystem align with the profile of a typical altcoin that traders prefer. It has institutional adoption and looks to be solid. This asset appears to be well-suited for Q4 2025 and makes sense for those seeking to balance meme plays with prudent layer-1 investments. Ethereum: The Settlement Layer Holds Steady Ethereum cannot be overlooked if you’re looking to grow in Q4. Ethereum is often referred to as the ‘settlement layer of everything’ as it diversifies from DeFi and NFT roots. The Pectra upgrade in May 2025 enabled users to utilise smart accounts and pay fees with multi-tokens. This certainly improved the Pectra’s experience and competitiveness against faster Layer-1 platforms such as Solana and Sui. Institutional activity remains a significant catalyst. To bolster their value proposition, businesses are increasingly tokenising real-world assets on Ethereum. Predictions for the cost of ETH suggest that if the price can breach the $3,000 resistance by the end of the quarter, it may have significant upside potential. If the uptrend persists, midterm targets could reach $3,500 to $4,000. Ethereum boasts the largest developer network and a rapidly growing Layer 2 ecosystem, thanks to applications like Arbitrum and Optimism, which will make this top blockchain protocol the backbone of DeFi and AI. The Bigger Picture: Mixing Narratives and Fundamentals In Q4 2025, while Ethereum and Avalanche follow traditional cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention through cultural relevance and community-driven momentum . It appeals to investors seeking more than fundamentals — those drawn to virality, ideology, and early-stage upside. As legacy altcoins stall, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a standout narrative for the next wave of crypto growth .

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Avalanche (AVAX): A Scalable Ethereum Rival Making Waves in 2025 Avalanche (AVAX) has emerged as a leading Layer 1 blockchain network aiming to rival Ethereum in smart contract capabilities. Launched in 2020, Avalanche is popular among developers for its scalability and speed. It is compatible with Ethereum's Virtual Machine, allowing easy migration of smart contracts. Avalanche's key strength is its use of subnets to boost transaction throughput. The network claims to handle up to 6,500 transactions per second, far surpassing Ethereum. This scalability has attracted a growing community and positions Avalanche as a strong competitor in decentralized applications. Historically, AVAX has experienced significant growth. In the years leading up to 2025, the token saw substantial price increases, reflecting confidence in its technology. Though it faced fluctuations, AVAX has shown resilience and potential for long-term growth in the dynamic crypto market Analysts have provided optimistic long-term predictions for AVAX. Some forecasts suggest the token could continue to rise in value over the coming years, driven by strong fundamentals and adoption. While predictions vary, many believe AVAX has considerable room for growth. In the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising due to its advanced technology and scalability. Its capped supply and the burning of transaction fees contribute to its scarcity. With ongoing developments and an active community, Avalanche remains a significant player in the cryptocurrency space. Chainlink's Rise: Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects off-chain data to smart contracts through oracles. These oracles act as bridges, providing essential real-world information to blockchain applications. Without them, smart contracts can't execute properly. Chainlink uses multiple oracles to ensure there's no single point of failure, making the data secure, accurate, and always available. Since its creation in 2017, Chainlink has become a leader in the oracle space. Its native token, LINK, is used for payments within the ecosystem and for staking by node operators. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain solutions grow, the need for reliable off-chain data increases. This demand positions Chainlink and LINK at the heart of the evolving crypto landscape. Historically, LINK reached an all-time high of $52.88 in May 2021. While it hasn't returned to that peak yet, the expanding crypto market suggests potential for future growth. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has more than doubled since last year, signaling a market that's starting to heat up. Experts have varied predictions for LINK's future. Some believe it could surge to $40 in the near term, while long-term forecasts extend beyond $100 by 2030. These predictions reflect the optimism surrounding Chainlink's technology and its role in the blockchain ecosystem. With its robust technology and strategic position, Chainlink is poised to play a key role in the future of decentralized applications. As the demand for accurate off-chain data grows, LINK could be a significant player in the next phase of DeFi's evolution. Conclusion With the bull run in full swing, traders are shifting their focus from established coins like AVAX and Chainlink, which have less short-term potential. They are prioritizing memecoins that offer the possibility of significant returns. Among these, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits. This innovative project uses artificial intelligence to identify lucrative meme coins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive trading signals before the hype begins. By combining smart analysis with a fully automated AI trader, Codename:Pepe crypto empowers investors to profit in the chaotic memecoin market.

Do you keep an eye on emerging projects that could potentially reshape the digital asset landscape? If so, then the latest announcement from Binance Alpha is bound to capture your attention. On July 4, Binance Alpha, a specialized platform within the broader Binance ecosystem dedicated to showcasing promising early-stage crypto projects, will officially add CROSS (CROSS) to its roster. This move signals a significant opportunity for early adopters and a testament to Binance’s commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain space. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter for Investors? Binance Alpha serves as a crucial bridge between innovative, nascent crypto projects and a vast community of eager investors. Unlike the main Binance Exchange, which typically lists more established assets, Alpha focuses on the very early stages of a project’s lifecycle. It’s designed to give a spotlight to tokens that show strong potential, often identified through vigorous community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. For investors, Binance Alpha offers a unique proposition: access to projects before they potentially gain mainstream traction. This ‘first-mover’ advantage can be incredibly lucrative, though it naturally comes with higher risks. The platform’s selection process is rigorous, ensuring that only projects with genuine utility, a strong development team, and a vibrant community are considered. This curated approach helps filter out some of the noise in the crowded crypto market, presenting users with what Binance believes are truly promising ventures. Think of Binance Alpha as a launchpad for tomorrow’s crypto giants. It provides liquidity and exposure to projects that might otherwise struggle to gain visibility, simultaneously offering users a chance to participate in their growth from the ground floor. It’s a win-win: projects get the platform they need, and investors get early access to innovation. Diving Deep into CROSS Crypto: What to Expect from This New Addition? The upcoming addition of CROSS crypto to Binance Alpha on July 4 has generated considerable buzz. While specific details about CROSS are still emerging, its selection by Binance Alpha suggests it aligns with the platform’s criteria for community engagement and relevance to emerging market trends. Typically, early-stage projects listed on Alpha are those that are innovating in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), metaverse applications, or fundamental blockchain infrastructure. Investors looking into CROSS should consider several key aspects: Project Vision: What problem does CROSS aim to solve? What is its unique value proposition in the crypto ecosystem? Technology & Roadmap: Is the underlying technology robust? Does it have a clear, achievable roadmap for future development? Community & Team: How active and engaged is the CROSS community? Who are the core developers and advisors behind the project? Their experience and transparency are vital. Market Fit: Does CROSS address a genuine market need or capitalize on a significant trend? While the allure of an early-stage project is strong, it’s crucial to remember that these investments carry inherent volatility and risk. Comprehensive due diligence is paramount. Engage with the project’s community, read their whitepaper, and understand their tokenomics before making any investment decisions. The opportunity to be early is exciting, but being informed is empowering. The Power of Binance Wallet in Facilitating Seamless On-Chain Trading One of the standout features of Binance Alpha, and a key enabler for projects like CROSS, is its seamless integration with the Binance Wallet for on-chain trading . This integration is a game-changer for accessibility and user experience. Traditionally, interacting with early-stage projects often required navigating complex decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or managing multiple wallets and bridges. Binance Alpha simplifies this by bringing on-chain trading directly into the familiar and secure environment of the Binance Wallet and Exchange. What does this mean for you? Direct Ownership: When you engage in on-chain trading, you’re interacting directly with the blockchain. This means you have direct custody of your assets, enhancing security and transparency. Reduced Friction: The integration removes many of the technical barriers that often deter new users from exploring decentralized finance. You can execute trades for early-stage tokens with the same ease as trading more established assets on the main exchange. Enhanced Security: Leveraging the robust security infrastructure of Binance Wallet, users can trade with greater confidence, knowing their assets are protected by industry-leading security protocols. Transparency: All on-chain transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, providing a level of transparency that is a cornerstone of the decentralized ethos. This streamlined approach to on-chain trading via Binance Wallet is a significant step towards making early-stage crypto investments more accessible to a broader audience, fostering greater participation and liquidity for promising projects. Navigating Early-Stage Crypto Investments: Tips for Prudent Engagement Investing in early-stage crypto projects can be incredibly rewarding, but it demands a strategic and cautious approach. The potential for high returns is often mirrored by high risks. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this exciting, yet volatile, segment of the market: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Never invest based on hype or a single social media post. Deep dive into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and tokenomics. Understand their long-term vision. Understand the Risks: Early-stage projects are speculative. They may fail, face regulatory hurdles, or struggle to gain adoption. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Start Small and Diversify: Instead of putting all your capital into one early-stage project, consider allocating smaller amounts across several promising ventures. This diversification can help mitigate risk. Monitor Community and Development: A strong, active community and consistent development updates are positive signs. Engage with the project’s official channels (Telegram, Discord, X) to stay informed. Set Realistic Expectations: While some early investments yield astronomical returns, many do not. Be patient, and don’t expect overnight riches. Crypto markets are cyclical and unpredictable. Security First: Always use secure wallets and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Binance account. Be wary of phishing scams and fraudulent links. By adopting a disciplined and informed approach, you can significantly improve your chances of success in the dynamic world of early-stage crypto investments. The Road Ahead: What Does CROSS Mean for the Crypto Ecosystem? The listing of CROSS on Binance Alpha on July 4 is more than just another token addition; it represents a continued evolution in how promising crypto projects gain visibility and liquidity. It underscores Binance’s strategic role in nurturing the next generation of blockchain innovation. For the broader crypto ecosystem, such listings signify a healthy and expanding market, where new ideas and technologies can find a platform to flourish. As CROSS begins its journey on Binance Alpha, it will be interesting to observe its development, community growth, and market performance. Its success could pave the way for similar projects, further solidifying Binance Alpha’s position as a premier destination for early-stage crypto discovery. Whether you’re an experienced trader or a curious newcomer, keeping an eye on projects like CROSS offers valuable insights into the cutting edge of decentralized technology.

But picking the right coins can be tough. With thousands of options, how does one spot coins that can grow instead of falling when the market shakes? This blog looks at four names that could stand out when the bull market takes off. Aave, Hedera, BlockDAG, and Filecoin all have real strengths that could set them apart. If the goal is to find the best altcoins to watch that are more than just hype, these projects deserve a closer look. Read on to learn why these could be worth tracking in the coming months. 1. BlockDAG: Building Strong Tech With Real-World Uses BlockDAG (BDAG) focuses on creating real technology that can be used in daily life, not just creating hype. Up to now, BlockDAG (BDAG) has collected $327 million from its $600 million presale target. The team combines Proof-of-Work and DAG technology to deliver fast transactions. This setup is planned to support future projects, including AI-based networks and decentralised infrastructure systems. A key reason BlockDAG is seen as one of the best altcoins to watch is how wisely the funds are being used. The project is running a 100M BDAG airdrop that gives rewards to people who join tasks like testing the platform, sharing on social media, and making referrals. Up to now, 23.4 billion coins have been sold, proving strong interest from buyers. BlockDAG is currently in Batch 29, with the price at $0.0276. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release offer, coins can be bought at a special rate of $0.0016 until August 11. This is close to early batch prices. With a launch price set at $0.05, those who bought in Batch 1 have already seen returns of 2,660% from the batch 29 price. With security audits done, more exchange listings coming soon, and 2 million mobile miners already on board, BlockDAG is well-prepared to be a strong player in the next bull run. 2. Aave: Trusted DeFi Solution With Room To Grow Aave keeps earning a place on lists of best altcoins to watch for good reason. It offers tools that let people lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto without needing middlemen. Features like flash loans, stable interest rates, and support across blockchains make Aave a leading choice in DeFi. It keeps improving, helping its platform stay strong even as markets change. The latest update, V3, made Aave faster, cheaper, and safer. After finding support near $220, Aave rose more than 10% and now trades over $260. Many believe more growth could come, as the charts show more loans being taken out and growing demand for its tools. 3. Hedera: Fast And Efficient Network Hedera (HBAR) runs on Hashgraph tech, which allows very quick transactions with very low fees. This setup is useful for many tasks, from digital IDs to supply chains and small payments. Global firms help guide its growth, which is a key reason Hedera is seen as one of the best altcoins to watch for the next bull market. HBAR trades near $0.1428. It was quiet in the last month, but signs show momentum may be building again. A new tool called Hedera CLI is making it easier for developers to work on the network. As more firms join in, many expect steady price gains in the coming months. 4. Filecoin: A Decentralised Answer For Data Storage Filecoin (FIL) solves a real need in the Web3 space by offering safe, decentralised data storage. This is useful for both people and companies that want to store files without depending on big tech providers. Filecoin works closely with IPFS and is used for storing large datasets and video files. Growing interest in this area keeps pushing demand higher, which is why Filecoin is on many lists of best altcoins to watch for the next bull cycle. Filecoin’s price is being watched in the $2.30 to $2.50 range, where a breakout may happen if buying interest rises. Analysts looking further ahead see a chance for prices to climb toward $7 if demand keeps growing. Final Verdict As the market gears up for the next bull run, it makes sense to focus on coins that offer more than empty talk. Aave brings proven DeFi tools that people use daily. Hedera’s speed and low-cost support real-world uses. Filecoin meets a rising need for secure, decentralised storage. Yet, BlockDAG may offer the most promise, with clear plans, strong funding, and a system designed for both speed and practical uses. Its presale deals and fresh mining and tech ideas make it a project that could stand out among the best altcoins to watch in the next bull run.

But new data shows long‑term holders have quietly built up a huge stash of ETH. This might set the stage for a big move when markets heat up. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful? VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years According to on‑chain trackers, close to 30 million ETH is now sitting in wallets that have never spent a single coin. These so‑called accumulation addresses only take in Ethereum and don’t send any out. That’s an all‑time high for this group of holders. They’ve piled in even though Ether is trading far below its peak. Many of these investors seem to believe a rally is coming. $ETH on-chain activity is spiking. The sleeping giant is about to wake up! pic.twitter.com/1Pq6L0g5hH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 28, 2025 Rising Hoards Signal Confidence The pace of ETH going into cold wallets has shot up sharply over the past few months. It’s a bigger build‑up than in past cycles. If history is any guide, that sort of move usually precedes a price surge. Long‑term holders often buy early and hold tight before a big run. This kind of confidence from big players can spark wider interest. Network Traffic Hits Peak Based on reports, daily transactions on Ethereum just topped 1,500,000. That’s the most since early 2023. A rise in on‑chain transfers often points to more users, more apps and more trading. When people send coins or use smart contracts, they fuel network fees and show real demand. High activity can pull in more traders looking to catch the next wave. Technical Barriers Remain ETH is trading near $2,460 and it hasn’t cleared two key hurdles yet. The 50‑day moving average sits just above price, as does the 200‑day line. Those are tough barriers for any asset. Momentum tools aren’t screaming “buy” yet, either. The RSI sits around 49 and the MACD has flattened out after a stretch of weak readings. On‑balance volume is low, which means big buyers are still cautious. Related Reading: Crypto Bombshell: Developer Claims XRP Could Hit $20,000 What Comes Next For ETH? Even with strong on‑chain signs, price needs to break past $2,600 before bulls can charge ahead. If Ethereum can push through that level, the road to $3,000 would look clear. Traders will watch for volume spikes and a steady move above those moving averages. If it fails, the big holders could be stuck on the sidelines, holding bags that lose value.

XRP and DOGE Traders Are Watching,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-this-political-meme-crypto-be-the-dark-horse-of-2025-xrp-and-doge-traders-are-watching/,"Smart traders in 2025 are no longer waiting for mainstream headlines. They’re following whale movements, early inflows, and fresh token launches that offer outsized return potential. While XRP and Dogecoin continue to lead meme and utility narratives, a third contender is quickly climbing investor watchlists. MAGACOIN FINANCE, a political meme coin with rising traction and fixed tokenomics, is gaining early interest from both retail buyers and crypto analysts. With major bonus offers live and repeat buyer behavior increasing, this coin could surprise the market as a dark horse pick for the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Heats Up While XRP and DOGE make headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is moving fast under the radar. Built as a political meme coin with a fixed token supply, the project has no venture capital control and no surprise emissions. Every token is distributed transparently, with a capped total supply. This scarcity model stands out in a market filled with tokens that inflate over time. Crypto forums and early-stage groups have taken notice. MAGACOIN FINANCE is seeing high-volume repeat participation, meaning early users are coming back and doubling down. That’s often the first signal that a presale coin is getting the attention of investors. Security matters too, and that’s why the project’s smart contract has been audited by HashEx, giving new buyers more confidence in the code. As political narratives grow louder in the crypto space, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping in with perfect timing. It speaks to a niche audience, offers early entry pricing, and is getting serious attention from traders who want more than recycled tokens and stale roadmaps. XRP Whale Wallets Are Surging to All-Time Highs XRP is experiencing a historic spike in whale activity. In June 2025, the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP reached a new peak — over 2,700 large holders now control significant positions. This marks the highest whale count in the asset’s 12-year history. Whale transactions above $1 million also hit record levels. These large transfers often signal strategic positioning ahead of key announcements or expected rallies. Over the last month, mid-size whales added 260 million XRP to their holdings. In one of the year’s most talked-about transfers, Ripple moved $438 million worth of XRP to a single wallet, fueling speculation about a major institutional deal or future product. XRP-linked funds also attracted over $11 million in inflows in a single week, bringing the yearly total to $206 million. Whales are active. Institutions are watching. XRP remains one of the most trusted plays in this cycle, but it’s no longer the only one. Dogecoin Accumulators Are Back in Force Dogecoin isn’t just a meme anymore, it’s a whale target again. Over the past month, DOGE whales have picked up more than 1 billion tokens. The largest surge came in April, when over 800 million DOGE changed hands in under two days. That kind of volume signals renewed confidence. Whale transactions on the Dogecoin network jumped 41% on June 13, totaling over $23 billion in value moved in a single day. At the same time, daily active addresses surged by nearly 35%, pushing Dogecoin ahead of Ethereum and Bitcoin in short-term user growth. The SEC also acknowledged the filing of a Dogecoin ETF in May. While it hasn’t been approved yet, the move sparked excitement across investor channels. An ETF approval would open DOGE to broader institutional access. With high-volume trades and growing activity, Dogecoin is once again proving it has staying power, but investors looking for early-stage upside are also scouting alternatives. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be The Next Political Meme Coin There’s a pattern forming. Political tokens that strike the right timing — and get distribution right — tend to outperform. MAGACOIN FINANCE is hitting both of those targets in 2025. It combines a powerful narrative with early-stage availability and high-conviction buying behavior. While XRP and DOGE remain strong, they’re already near full market exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started with early wallet activity rising and buyer confidence holding strong, this token could become the next breakout in the political meme coin category. For those watching for the next move before the crowd arrives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one to keep on the radar.

The latest groundbreaking news comes from Italy, where UniCredit, the nation’s second-largest bank, has announced its intention to offer a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF-linked product to its select clientele. This move is not just a ripple; it’s a significant wave that could reshape how institutional money interacts with digital assets, opening new avenues for sophisticated crypto investment and broader market acceptance. UniCredit’s Landmark Step into Digital Assets For years, traditional financial institutions have approached the volatile world of cryptocurrencies with caution, often citing regulatory uncertainties and market risks. However, the landscape is rapidly evolving, and UniCredit’s decision marks a pivotal moment. By offering a product tied to a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, UniCredit is not merely dipping its toes; it’s making a definitive statement about the growing legitimacy and demand for digital assets among its high-net-worth and institutional clients. What does this mean for UniCredit? It positions the bank at the forefront of financial innovation in Europe, allowing it to meet the evolving demands of its clientele who are increasingly looking for exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership or managing digital wallets. This strategic move could serve as a blueprint for other major European banks contemplating their entry into the crypto space, potentially triggering a domino effect across the continent. The offering is initially targeted at “select clients,” suggesting a phased approach that prioritizes high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors who are more accustomed to complex financial products and have a higher risk tolerance. This controlled rollout allows UniCredit to fine-tune its processes, manage regulatory compliance, and gather crucial feedback before potentially expanding the service to a wider client base. BlackRock’s Strategic Play in the Bitcoin Market The partnership with BlackRock is a crucial element of UniCredit’s announcement. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has been a dominant force in the ETF market for decades. Their recent foray into the spot Bitcoin ETF space with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has been nothing short of spectacular, attracting billions in inflows since its launch. The success of IBIT has validated the immense institutional and retail demand for regulated, accessible Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock’s involvement lends an unparalleled level of credibility and infrastructure to UniCredit’s offering. Investors gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin through a product managed by a globally recognized and trusted asset manager, mitigating some of the perceived risks associated with the nascent crypto market. This collaboration highlights a growing trend where established financial giants are leveraging each other’s strengths to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. For BlackRock, this partnership with UniCredit represents an expansion of their global reach and influence within the digital asset sector. It allows them to tap into a new pool of European investors through an established banking network, further solidifying their position as a key player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Appeal of Bitcoin ETF-Linked Products So, why are financial institutions and their clients increasingly drawn to Bitcoin ETF -linked products? The answer lies in a blend of accessibility, regulatory clarity, and ease of integration into existing investment portfolios. Unlike direct Bitcoin ownership, which often requires navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, understanding self-custody solutions, and managing private keys, an ETF-linked product simplifies the process significantly. Key Advantages for Investors: Simplified Access: Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through their existing brokerage accounts with UniCredit, eliminating the need to set up new accounts on crypto exchanges. Regulatory Comfort: While the product itself is offered by UniCredit, its link to a regulated BlackRock ETF provides a layer of comfort regarding compliance and oversight that many traditional investors seek. Custody Solutions: Investors do not have to worry about the security and custody of their Bitcoin; these aspects are handled by the ETF provider (BlackRock) and its custodians. Portfolio Integration: These products can be seamlessly integrated into diversified investment portfolios alongside traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, making asset allocation straightforward. Liquidity: ETFs are generally highly liquid, allowing for easy buying and selling during market hours. While the exact structure of UniCredit’s “ETF-linked product” might vary (it could be a certificate, a structured note, or another derivative instrument that tracks the ETF’s performance), the core benefit remains the same: providing a regulated, convenient, and familiar pathway for clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The Expanding Landscape of Crypto Investment for Institutions UniCredit’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a strong indicator of a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a steady increase in traditional financial players, from hedge funds to pension funds and corporate treasuries, allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets. This trend is driven by several factors: Why Institutions are Embracing Crypto: Diversification: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer a low correlation with traditional asset classes, providing potential diversification benefits and enhancing portfolio resilience. Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s limited supply is seen by some as a potential hedge against currency debasement. New Asset Class: Digital assets represent an entirely new asset class with unique characteristics and growth potential, attracting forward-thinking investors. Client Demand: As retail and institutional clients become more aware of and interested in crypto, financial institutions are compelled to offer relevant products to retain and attract business. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and ongoing regulatory developments globally are providing more clarity and confidence for institutions to enter the space. This increasing institutional involvement is vital for the long-term maturation of the crypto market. It brings greater liquidity, reduces volatility (over time), and enhances the overall legitimacy of digital assets in the eyes of mainstream finance and the general public. The entrance of players like UniCredit and BlackRock signifies a critical step towards Bitcoin becoming a widely accepted and integrated component of global financial portfolios. What Does This Mean for Future Institutional Adoption? The UniCredit-BlackRock collaboration sets a powerful precedent, particularly in the European market. It sends a clear message that major banks are no longer content to merely observe the crypto revolution from the sidelines. Instead, they are actively seeking ways to participate and cater to the growing demand for digital asset exposure. Potential Implications: Increased Competition: Other European banks will likely feel pressure to follow suit, either by developing their own crypto-linked products or partnering with existing players. Product Innovation: We could see a proliferation of more sophisticated crypto investment products, potentially including derivatives, structured products, or even products linked to other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Regulatory Harmonization: As more institutions enter the space, there will be increased pressure on regulators to provide clear and consistent frameworks, which could further accelerate adoption. Mainstream Acceptance: Each time a major bank offers a crypto product, it chips away at the perception of crypto as a niche or speculative asset, moving it closer to mainstream financial acceptance. For investors, this trend means more choices and potentially more secure, regulated ways to gain exposure to the digital asset market. However, it also underscores the importance of due diligence. Even with institutional backing, crypto investments carry inherent risks due to market volatility and evolving regulatory landscapes. Investors should always understand the underlying assets, the structure of the product, and their own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Bridging the Worlds of TradFi and Digital Assets UniCredit’s move to offer a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF-linked product is far more than just a new financial offering; it’s a profound symbol of the ongoing convergence between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. It underscores the undeniable demand for regulated crypto exposure, validates Bitcoin’s growing role as a legitimate asset class, and highlights the proactive steps major institutions are taking to adapt to this new financial paradigm. As the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, such initiatives by UniCredit and BlackRock are paving the way for a more integrated, accessible, and potentially transformative future for global investment.

When the head of the world’s most influential central bank, the Federal Reserve, speaks, everyone listens. Recently, Jerome Powell, the esteemed Chairman of the Federal Reserve, found himself once again in the crosshairs of direct criticism from former U.S. President Donald Trump. His response? A concise yet powerful affirmation: “I’m very focused on doing my job.” This seemingly simple statement carries profound implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve, the stability of the US Economy , and the broader financial landscape that indirectly influences crypto valuations. Understanding the Core Conflict: Jerome Powell vs. Donald Trump The tension between Jerome Powell and Donald Trump is not new. It’s a recurring theme that underscores a fundamental debate about the role and autonomy of central banks. During his presidency, Trump frequently and vociferously criticized Powell and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies, particularly when the Fed raised rates. Trump often argued that these rate hikes were hindering economic growth, strengthening the dollar too much, and undermining his administration’s efforts to boost the economy. His criticisms were unprecedented for a U.S. president, openly challenging the traditional independence of the central bank. Powell, throughout these periods of intense political pressure, consistently maintained a stance of non-partisanship and commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and maintaining price stability. His recent statement, reiterated in the face of renewed attacks, serves as a powerful reminder of this unwavering dedication. It signals that the institution’s decisions will be guided by economic data and its statutory objectives, rather than political expediency or short-term electoral cycles. Why is the Federal Reserve’s Independence So Crucial? The concept of an independent central bank is a cornerstone of modern economic governance in many developed nations. But why is this autonomy so highly valued, and why does political interference raise so many alarms? The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, was designed to operate free from direct political influence precisely to avoid the pitfalls of short-term political thinking. Long-Term Stability: An independent Fed can make tough, unpopular decisions (like raising interest rates during an economic boom to prevent inflation) that are necessary for long-term economic health, without fear of immediate political backlash or losing elections. Credibility and Predictability: When markets trust that the Fed’s decisions are based on economic fundamentals rather than political whims, it enhances the credibility of monetary policy. This predictability helps businesses and consumers plan for the future, fostering investment and stability. Avoiding Inflationary Pressures: Historically, when central banks have been subjected to political pressure to print money or keep interest rates artificially low to stimulate growth before elections, it often leads to rampant inflation, eroding purchasing power and destabilizing the economy. Protecting the Financial System: An independent Fed can act decisively during financial crises, implementing measures to stabilize markets and prevent systemic collapse, even if those measures are politically unpopular in the short term. The attacks from Donald Trump , while vocal, have so far failed to compromise the Fed’s operational independence, largely due to Powell’s steadfastness and the institutional strength of the Federal Reserve itself. This resilience is vital for maintaining investor confidence, both domestically and internationally. The Intricacies of Monetary Policy and Its Reach At the heart of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities lies Monetary Policy . This refers to the actions undertaken by a central bank to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote national economic goals. The Fed has several key tools at its disposal: The Federal Funds Rate: This is the target rate for overnight lending between banks. By adjusting this rate, the Fed influences interest rates throughout the economy, impacting everything from mortgage rates to business loans. Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT): These involve the buying or selling of government securities and other assets in the open market. QE injects liquidity into the financial system, while QT removes it. These actions directly affect long-term interest rates and the overall money supply. Reserve Requirements: The amount of funds that banks must hold in reserve against deposits. While less frequently used now, it’s a powerful tool to influence the amount of money banks have available to lend. Discount Rate: The interest rate at which commercial banks can borrow money directly from the Federal Reserve. When Jerome Powell states he is “focused on doing his job,” it means he is committed to using these tools to navigate complex economic conditions – balancing the fight against inflation with the goal of sustaining maximum employment. This is a delicate act, requiring careful analysis of economic data, foresight, and a willingness to make difficult choices that might not always be popular but are deemed necessary for the nation’s financial health. How Does This Impact the US Economy and Beyond? The stability and direction of the US Economy are profoundly influenced by the Federal Reserve’s actions. When interest rates are low, borrowing becomes cheaper, encouraging investment, spending, and job creation. Conversely, when rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can cool down an overheated economy and combat inflation. The ripple effects of these decisions are global, given the U.S. dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency. For the cryptocurrency market, the connection is often indirect but significant. Higher interest rates in the traditional financial system can make less risky assets, like government bonds, more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a looser monetary policy, characterized by lower rates and increased liquidity, can make riskier assets more appealing, as investors seek higher returns. The perception of economic stability, heavily influenced by the Fed’s actions, also plays a role in investor sentiment towards volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Consider the recent period of high inflation. The Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates to bring prices under control. While this led to concerns about a potential recession, it demonstrated Powell’s commitment to price stability, even in the face of political and public pressure to ease up. This commitment is what gives the Fed its credibility and allows it to effectively steer the economy through turbulent waters. Navigating the Challenges: What Does Steadfastness Mean for the Future? The challenges facing the Federal Reserve are multifaceted. Beyond political critiques, they include managing persistent inflation, navigating geopolitical uncertainties, responding to rapid technological changes, and addressing issues like financial stability in an increasingly interconnected global economy. Jerome Powell ‘s unwavering focus on his job signifies a dedication to evidence-based decision-making, rather than succumbing to external pressures. This steadfast approach suggests several key implications for the future: Data-Driven Decisions: The Fed will likely continue to prioritize economic data (inflation figures, employment reports, GDP growth) in its policy deliberations, rather than political rhetoric. Independence Reinforced: Powell’s public stance reinforces the institutional independence of the Federal Reserve, setting a precedent for future chairs and potentially deterring future attempts at direct political interference. Market Confidence: A perceived independent and competent central bank generally fosters greater confidence in financial markets, reducing uncertainty and encouraging long-term investment. Potential for Volatility: While independence is positive, it also means the Fed will make decisions that might be unpopular in the short term if they are deemed necessary for long-term stability. This could lead to periods of market volatility as participants adjust to policy shifts. Ultimately, Powell’s statement is a testament to the principles that underpin effective central banking. It’s a declaration that the institution’s primary allegiance is to its dual mandate and the economic well-being of the nation, not to any political agenda. Concluding Thoughts: The Enduring Importance of Central Bank Autonomy The ongoing narrative of Donald Trump ‘s criticisms against Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve highlights a critical aspect of modern governance: the delicate balance between democratic accountability and institutional independence. Powell’s calm and resolute response, emphasizing his dedication to his professional duties, underscores the vital importance of an autonomous central bank for a stable and predictable financial environment. In a world where economic certainty is increasingly prized, the Fed’s ability to make decisions free from political coercion is not just an academic ideal but a practical necessity for the health of the US Economy and its ripple effects across global markets, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. His commitment ensures that the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability remains the guiding star for U.S. monetary policy, providing a crucial anchor in often turbulent economic seas.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has given crypto firms incorporated locally but targeting offshore markets until June 30 to either secure a license or halt operations. The directive, aimed at strengthening regulatory oversight, has already prompted exchanges like Bitget and Bybit to consider relocating staff abroad . However, the new rules are not expected to disrupt Binance’s local operations, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. Hundreds of Singapore-based Binance employees, most of whom work remotely, will not need to relocate as their roles are largely internal and non-customer facing, the report said. Over 400 Binance Staff Still in Singapore, Focused on Back-Office Functions Bloomberg’s analysis of LinkedIn profiles shows more than 400 individuals list Singapore as their location while working for Binance. According to Bloomberg, despite Singapore's tightening regulation of unlicensed crypto businesses, Binance still plans to retain hundreds of remote workers in Singapore. These employees are mainly engaged in back-end compliance, human resources, data analysis and technical… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 1, 2025 According to the outlet, most Singapore-based roles focus on internal functions such as compliance, human resources, data analytics and technology. The absence of a formal office setup further distances these employees from regulatory scrutiny. While Singapore has built a reputation as a leading Asian hub for digital assets, its regulators have grown increasingly cautious following several high-profile crypto failures in 2022, including the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. New MAS Rule Targets Local Entities, But Binance’s Structure Keeps It Outside Scope The latest rule draws a clear boundary. Firms incorporated in Singapore and offering token services abroad must now comply with local licensing requirements. However, Binance appears to fall outside the direct scope of this regulation. The company has no official headquarters and describes itself as “remote-first.” In addition, the MAS provided further clarification. Remote employees based in Singapore will not trigger licensing requirements if they work for a foreign firm. This applies only when the firm serves customers outside Singapore. The exemption falls under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022. Despite being placed on MAS’ Investor Alert List since 2021, Binance has not exited Singapore entirely. The listing effectively bars it from serving local customers. However, the company continues to operate in a legal grey area. Yet for now, its Singapore workforce looks set to remain in place, showing how regulatory enforcement continues to grapple with the borderless nature of global crypto operations.

This trend signals a deeper integration of cryptocurrency into corporate finance strategies, moving beyond speculative interest to a more calculated approach to treasury management. If you’ve been watching the crypto markets, you know that institutional involvement is key, and this development is nothing short of revolutionary. Public Companies Bitcoin Surge: A New Era of Corporate Treasury? The latest data from CNBC reveals a compelling story: public companies increased their Bitcoin buying by a substantial 18% in the second quarter, accumulating approximately 131,000 BTC. This significant acquisition underscores a growing confidence among corporations in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For years, the narrative focused on individual investors and early adopters, but now, boardrooms are actively considering and implementing strategies to hold digital assets. What’s driving this surge? It appears to be a multi-faceted approach. Companies are looking to diversify their balance sheets, hedge against inflation in an uncertain economic climate, and potentially boost shareholder value through exposure to a high-growth asset class. This strategic shift is often described as following a ‘Strategy playbook,’ indicating a more formalized and deliberate process rather than ad-hoc investments. Traditionally, corporate treasuries focused on low-risk, liquid assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market instruments. However, with persistent inflation concerns and a desire for higher returns, some forward-thinking public companies are re-evaluating this conventional wisdom. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, offers a unique value proposition as a decentralized, finite asset, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ Why Are Public Companies Outpacing Bitcoin ETFs? For a long time, the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs was seen as the primary gateway for institutional capital into the crypto market. These investment vehicles offer a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. While ETFs still represent the largest collective holders of Bitcoin, the recent trend shows public companies making direct, significant moves. Several factors might explain this divergence: Direct Control and Flexibility: By directly holding Bitcoin, companies retain full control over their assets, allowing for greater flexibility in their treasury management strategies. ETFs, while convenient, involve fees and an indirect relationship with the underlying asset. Regulatory Environment: The report hints at a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. A less stringent or more predictable regulatory landscape could embolden companies to make direct investments, reducing perceived compliance risks. This signals a potential shift from a cautious ‘wait-and-see’ approach to more proactive engagement. Strategic Advantage: For some companies, holding Bitcoin isn’t just about investment; it’s about signaling innovation, attracting talent interested in the digital economy, and potentially gaining a first-mover advantage in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Shareholder Value: Companies like MicroStrategy have famously used Bitcoin acquisitions as a core part of their strategy to enhance shareholder value, demonstrating that a well-articulated digital asset strategy can be positively received by the market. While Bitcoin ETFs continue to play a vital role in broadening access to Bitcoin, the direct approach taken by public companies suggests a deeper conviction and a willingness to navigate the complexities of direct ownership for potentially greater returns and strategic benefits. Understanding the Crypto Treasury Strategy The concept of a crypto treasury involves a company integrating digital assets, primarily Bitcoin, into its corporate balance sheet. This goes beyond mere speculative trading; it’s about viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset for long-term growth and stability. Companies adopting this strategy are essentially transforming a portion of their liquid assets into a digital store of value. Key aspects of a robust crypto treasury strategy include: Risk Assessment: Thorough evaluation of Bitcoin’s volatility, security risks, and regulatory uncertainties. Custody Solutions: Implementing secure and compliant methods for storing large amounts of Bitcoin, often involving third-party institutional custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for digital assets on financial statements, which can vary by jurisdiction. Shareholder Communication: Clearly articulating the rationale and benefits of holding Bitcoin to investors and the market. Early pioneers like MicroStrategy set the precedent, demonstrating how a publicly traded company could successfully integrate Bitcoin into its core financial strategy. Their success, despite market fluctuations, has provided a blueprint and confidence for others to explore similar paths. The benefits extend beyond potential price appreciation, encompassing diversification, a hedge against currency debasement, and an attractive proposition for tech-savvy investors. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Fading Trend or Mainstream Ascent? Analysts suggest that this particular strategy of companies aggressively accumulating Bitcoin might ‘fade over time’ as Institutional Bitcoin Adoption becomes more mainstream. What does this mean? It doesn’t necessarily imply a decrease in corporate interest in Bitcoin, but rather a maturation of the market. As Bitcoin adoption becomes truly mainstream, the initial advantage of being an early corporate holder might diminish. The ‘novelty’ factor could wear off, and Bitcoin might be viewed simply as another asset class rather than a groundbreaking, shareholder-value-boosting strategy in itself. This evolution could lead to a more standardized approach to digital asset management within corporations, perhaps through diversified portfolios that include various digital assets, or through more integrated financial products. However, the broader trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is undeniably on an upward trajectory. Pension funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, and traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets. The current surge in public company buying is a strong indicator of this broader institutional embrace, moving Bitcoin from the fringes of finance to a recognized, albeit still volatile, asset class. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Investment for Corporations For companies considering a similar path, or for investors watching this trend, understanding the implications is crucial. The decision to integrate Bitcoin into a corporate treasury is not one to be taken lightly. It requires a deep understanding of the asset, a robust risk management framework, and clear communication with stakeholders. Key Considerations for Corporations: Long-Term Vision: Is Bitcoin a short-term tactical play or a long-term strategic asset aligned with the company’s core mission? Regulatory Clarity: Staying abreast of evolving regulations is paramount to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal pitfalls. Security Protocols: Implementing industry-leading security measures to protect digital assets from theft and cyberattacks. Market Volatility: Developing strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility on financial statements. This trend has profound implications for the broader crypto market. Increased corporate demand can provide a more stable and less speculative foundation for Bitcoin’s price, reducing its reliance on retail sentiment. It also legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious financial asset, potentially paving the way for even greater institutional inflows and the development of more sophisticated financial products around it. Conclusion: The Corporate Shift Towards Digital Assets The narrative is clear: public companies are not just dabbling in Bitcoin; they are making substantial, strategic investments that are reshaping the landscape of corporate finance. Their aggressive Bitcoin buying , which has now consistently surpassed the inflows into Bitcoin ETFs , signals a growing conviction in the digital asset’s potential. This shift, driven by a desire to boost shareholder value and adapt to a changing regulatory environment, highlights the emergence of the crypto treasury as a legitimate and powerful tool for modern corporations. While some analysts predict a normalization of this aggressive accumulation as Institutional Bitcoin Adoption becomes more widespread, the underlying trend points to a future where digital assets play a much more prominent role in corporate balance sheets. This evolution is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and its increasing acceptance as a valuable, long-term asset, moving it ever closer to mainstream financial integration. As this fascinating story unfolds, it will be exciting to see how many more companies embrace this innovative approach to treasury management.

Giants rise, markets surge, and narratives shift — but when the dust settles, it’s always the unexpected names that deliver the biggest wins. Right now, Ethereum is growing its empire, XRP is fighting battles in boardrooms and courtrooms, and Solana is sprinting through technical upgrades. They’re all solid players, sure, but what if the next true winner isn’t already in the spotlight? While the big names battle for inches, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gearing up for a leap. With early investors locking in massive bonuses during its limited buying window, analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform Ethereum, XRP, and Solana by Q4. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Sleeper Pick is Ready to Explode While the top-tier coins battle resistance and regulatory bottlenecks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is writing its own script. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a culture-backed, scarcity-driven, hybrid altcoin, which is built for momentum. Here’s why MAGACOIN is rapidly climbing investor watchlists: MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into a powerful demographic and cultural movement. Fueled by viral energy and political relevance, it’s more than hype — it’s identity-driven crypto. With Donald Trump strongly expanding the market through 2025, MAGACOIN is perfectly positioned to ride the narrative wave. Pre-viral Phase That Actually Reward Early Adopters The supply model is designed to mimic successful deflationary projects. With staking mechanisms launching soon and previous rounds selling out quickly, this is a play built for upward pressure — not dilution. Additionally, MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t waiting for institutions — it’s powered by the people. The same way Dogecoin and Shiba captured hearts and wallets, MAGACOIN is igniting a grassroots surge. Analysts watching meme-alt cycles see this project entering pre-viral phase, the sweet spot before explosive growth. Ethereum’s Expansion is Impressive, But It’s Not Without Friction With over 35 million ETH staked and nearly 1 million new addresses added weekly, ETH’s fundamentals are rock-solid. Legislative wins like the GENIUS bill have given ETH a regulatory tailwind, and major players like BTCS and SharpLink Gaming are doubling down on long-term positions. Yet behind the bullish headlines, cracks are forming. Exchange inflows are rising, indicating a wave of selling. $163 million in liquidations hit the market in a single day. For the average investor, Ethereum is looking more and more like a mature stock — slow, steady, but not explosive. XRP and Solana Head Toward the Ceiling With XRP holding above $2.16, whales are accumulating. There’s a 98% chance of ETF approval and it is already building momentum. Ripple is even reportedly battling Coinbase for the acquisition of Circle, which would be a game-changer for the stablecoin sector. But volatility still hangs overhead. The SEC lawsuit is nearing a conclusion, yet delays in ETF decisions have dulled enthusiasm. XRP’s global payments use case is promising, but until the court dust settles and partnerships materialize, it’s a cautious climb — not a rocket launch. On the other hand, Solana has rebounded with strength. DEX volumes are booming, daily transactions are up 25%, and stablecoin activity has surged over 150% YTD. Technical forecasts predict a run toward $220, and ETF excitement has brought in fresh retail interest. Final Thoughts Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are powerful — but they’re also heavily institutional, slower moving, and already well-discovered by the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is what those early investors dreamt of: high upside, viral potential, cultural heat, and first-mover advantage. If you missed Ethereum at $10, XRP at $0.001, or Solana before it lit up DeFi — MAGACOIN FINANCE might just be your chance to rewrite history, not regret it again.

These digital assets, often born from internet culture and community spirit, have transcended their whimsical origins to become significant players in the market. Now, the convergence of this vibrant segment with traditional finance vehicles is creating ripples, as Tuttle Capital pushes forward with its ambitious plans for a 2x leveraged Meme Coin ETF . This development signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in how investors can access and engage with these unique digital assets. Meme Coin ETF: A Game-Changer for Digital Assets? For years, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have captivated investors with their meteoric rises and passionate communities. While often seen as speculative, their market capitalization and trading volumes are undeniable. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) provides a regulated, accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without directly owning it. The idea of a Meme Coin ETF , therefore, represents a fascinating bridge between the decentralized, often volatile world of meme cryptocurrencies and the regulated, structured environment of traditional financial markets. But what exactly does a ‘2x leveraged’ aspect add to this equation? It means the fund aims to deliver two times the daily performance of its underlying meme coin index. For instance, if the index of meme coins goes up by 5% in a day, the ETF aims to go up by 10%. Conversely, if the index drops by 5%, the ETF would aim to drop by 10%. This amplification of returns (and losses) introduces a layer of complexity and risk, making it a product geared towards short-term, active traders rather than long-term holders. The potential implications are vast: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors can gain exposure to meme coins through their brokerage accounts, bypassing crypto exchanges. Enhanced Liquidity: An ETF could bring more institutional capital and trading volume to the meme coin market. Mainstream Validation: The existence of such a product on major exchanges could lend further legitimacy to the meme coin sector. However, the amplified volatility of leveraged products, combined with the inherent unpredictability of meme coins, presents a unique risk profile that demands careful consideration from potential investors. Tuttle Capital’s Strategic Move: What Does it Mean? The latest buzz comes directly from Tuttle Capital , a firm that has consistently demonstrated its interest in innovative financial products within the crypto space. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Tuttle Capital has submitted an amendment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set July 16 as the effective date for its proposed 2x leveraged meme coin ETF. This isn’t just a casual update; it’s a significant procedural step. An ‘effective date’ is often misunderstood. It’s the date on which a registration statement filed with the SEC becomes effective, allowing the securities to be publicly offered. While it doesn’t guarantee an immediate launch, it’s a crucial prerequisite. As Balchunas noted, effective dates frequently coincide with the actual debut of an ETF. This suggests that Tuttle Capital is confident in its ability to meet regulatory requirements and is actively preparing for a potential launch around that time. Tuttle has a history of adjusting dates for various crypto-related funds, indicating a proactive approach to navigating the regulatory landscape and bringing novel investment vehicles to market. This move highlights Tuttle Capital’s strategic foresight, attempting to be at the forefront of the next wave of crypto financial products, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum-focused funds to embrace the broader, more dynamic altcoin market, specifically the high-octane meme coin segment. Understanding Leveraged Crypto ETF Mechanics To truly grasp the significance of Tuttle Capital’s filing, it’s essential to understand how a Leveraged Crypto ETF operates, especially one targeting a volatile asset class like meme coins. Unlike a standard ETF that tracks an index one-to-one, a leveraged ETF uses financial derivatives (like swaps or futures contracts) and debt to amplify the returns of the underlying index. For a 2x leveraged ETF, the goal is to provide twice the daily return of its benchmark. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Daily Reset: Leveraged ETFs typically reset their leverage daily. This means their performance is designed to achieve the stated multiple (e.g., 2x) on a day-to-day basis, not over longer periods. Compounding Effect: Over multiple days, the compounding of daily returns can lead to performance that deviates significantly from two times the underlying index’s performance. In volatile or trending markets, this can be either beneficial or detrimental. Decay: Due to daily rebalancing and compounding, leveraged ETFs are often subject to ‘volatility decay’ or ‘beta decay,’ meaning their performance can lag behind their stated multiple over extended periods, particularly in choppy or sideways markets. Consider this hypothetical scenario for a 2x leveraged meme coin ETF: Day Meme Coin Index Change 2x Leveraged ETF Target Change Actual ETF Performance (Simplified) Day 1 +5% +10% +10% Day 2 -3% -6% -6% (from new base) Day 3 +2% +4% +4% (from new base) While appealing for short-term gains, the amplified swings mean these products are generally not suitable for long-term buy-and-hold strategies. They are complex instruments designed for sophisticated investors who actively manage their portfolios and understand the inherent risks of daily rebalancing and amplified exposure. Navigating SEC ETF Approval: The Road Ahead The path to SEC ETF Approval for any cryptocurrency-related product has historically been fraught with challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has maintained a cautious stance on crypto ETFs, primarily citing concerns over market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the underlying digital asset markets. While the SEC approved Bitcoin futures ETFs relatively early, spot Bitcoin ETFs faced years of rejections before finally seeing approval in January 2024, following a landmark court ruling against the SEC in the Grayscale case. A leveraged meme coin ETF presents an even more complex proposition for regulators. The volatility of meme coins is significantly higher than that of Bitcoin or Ethereum. Adding 2x leverage further magnifies this risk. The SEC’s primary mandate is investor protection, and they will scrutinize the fund’s structure, liquidity, custody arrangements, and its ability to accurately track its underlying index without undue risk to retail investors. Key regulatory considerations for the SEC likely include: Market Surveillance: Can the underlying meme coin markets be effectively monitored to prevent fraud and manipulation? Valuation: How will the meme coins be accurately priced and valued for the ETF? Custody: Are there secure and regulated custodians for the underlying assets or derivatives? Investor Suitability: How will the product be marketed to ensure only appropriate investors engage with such a high-risk vehicle? While the effective date is a positive sign, it’s not a final green light. The SEC could still delay or even reject the fund if it finds outstanding issues. However, the fact that Tuttle Capital is moving forward with an effective date suggests ongoing dialogue and progress in addressing regulatory concerns. The broader trend indicates a gradual softening of the SEC’s stance on crypto products, albeit with continued vigilance, especially for more complex and volatile offerings. Crypto Investment Funds: Diversifying Your Portfolio The emergence of a potential 2x leveraged meme coin ETF underscores the rapid expansion and diversification within the landscape of Crypto Investment Funds . What began with simple Bitcoin trusts has evolved into a sophisticated ecosystem of products designed to cater to various risk appetites and investment goals. Beyond spot Bitcoin ETFs, we now see: Bitcoin Futures ETFs: Providing exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through futures contracts. Ethereum Futures ETFs: Similar to Bitcoin futures, but for Ethereum. Actively Managed Crypto Funds: Where fund managers make decisions on buying and selling various cryptocurrencies. Basket ETFs: Funds that hold a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies, not just one. The appeal of these funds lies in offering investors a familiar, regulated wrapper to access the crypto market. For many, navigating direct crypto purchases, self-custody, or understanding decentralized finance (DeFi) can be daunting. ETFs and other structured funds simplify this, providing liquidity, transparency, and often, the backing of established financial institutions. However, diversification within crypto investment funds doesn’t eliminate risk. Each fund carries its own set of unique risks, from market volatility to regulatory changes specific to its underlying assets or structure. A leveraged meme coin ETF, while offering potential for amplified returns, also comes with magnified risks due, to the inherent volatility of meme coins and the complexities of leverage. For investors considering these options, it’s crucial to: Understand the Underlying Asset: Know what you’re investing in (e.g., meme coins, Bitcoin, etc.). Grasp the Fund Structure: Is it spot, futures, leveraged, actively managed? Each has different implications. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: High-volatility, leveraged products are not for everyone. Stay Informed: The crypto market and its regulatory environment are constantly changing. The growth of these funds signifies a maturing crypto market, attracting more traditional capital and integrating digital assets further into the global financial system. This institutional embrace is a testament to the enduring potential seen in cryptocurrencies, moving them from the fringes to the mainstream. Challenges and Opportunities: What’s Next? The road ahead for Tuttle Capital’s 2x leveraged meme coin ETF, and indeed for the broader crypto ETF market, is filled with both exciting opportunities and formidable challenges. On the opportunity side, such a product could further democratize access to a high-growth, albeit volatile, segment of the crypto market. It could also spur further innovation in financial products, leading to more tailored investment vehicles for various digital assets. However, the challenges are significant: Extreme Volatility: Meme coins are notorious for their price swings, and 2x leverage amplifies this, posing considerable risk for investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: Despite the effective date, the SEC’s oversight will remain intense, especially concerning investor protection for a product of this nature. Market Education: There’s a critical need to educate investors about the unique risks of leveraged products and meme coins to prevent unintended losses. Operational Complexities: Managing a leveraged ETF with highly volatile underlying assets requires robust operational frameworks and risk management strategies. If successful, this ETF could pave the way for a new generation of leveraged altcoin ETFs, offering traders more sophisticated tools. If it faces significant hurdles or poor performance post-launch, it could set back the narrative for similar complex crypto products. The July 16 effective date is a marker in this ongoing journey, indicating that the conversation is advancing from theoretical possibility to tangible reality. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investment? Tuttle Capital’s strategic move to set July 16 as the effective date for its 2x leveraged meme coin ETF is more than just a procedural update; it’s a testament to the relentless innovation and evolving regulatory landscape within the cryptocurrency space. While the actual launch remains contingent on final SEC considerations, this development signifies a critical step towards bringing highly speculative yet incredibly popular digital assets into a more traditional investment framework. The potential launch of such a product would not only provide a novel avenue for investors seeking amplified exposure to meme coins but also highlight the increasing maturity of the crypto market as it continues to attract sophisticated financial instruments. As always, with high potential rewards come high risks, and investors must exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before engaging with complex, leveraged crypto products. The coming weeks will be pivotal in determining whether this audacious offering truly marks a new era for crypto investment funds.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved a new ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) by Grayscale that includes some of the biggest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. This new product is set to become the largest multi-token digital asset ETF in the world. This is a major step forward and could soon open doors for individual spot ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Spot ETFs directly track the real-time price of a cryptocurrency, and their approval is considered a huge deal for any coin. Why This Matters for XRP Price Since the ETF approval news, XRP’s price has shown some action. On the charts, XRP recently broke above a key resistance level between $2.19 to $2.20, but is now trying to hold above this range to confirm new support. If XRP can stay above this level, it may aim for the next resistance at $2.25, with a possible wick towards $2.32 to $2.35, an area where strong resistance is expected. If it fails to hold above $2.19, however, the price might drop back to around $2.10 to $2.05. At the moment, XRP’s price trend looks neutral, moving sideways without strong momentum. What The Experts Are Saying? Analyst Casi Trades said, “After reaching $2.30 resistance, price wasn’t able to hold the $2.25 support level. Instead, it’s now pulling back to retest the top of the consolidation, ~$2.18 to $2.16. This isn’t a breakdown (yet), but this test matters.” If the price manages to stay above this zone and reclaim $2.25, it could spark a rally toward $2.69 and higher. Early signs of seller weakness are already showing on smaller timeframes, showing this pullback might be temporary. However, if $2.16 breaks, the price risks dropping to the next support around $1.90.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|ADA|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-02 02:42:19

It was the only major platform that did not delist any tokens added between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2024. This, according to CryptoQuant, reflected a “rigorous” listing strategy and operational stability. Binance Leads in Listing Quality and Rewards The latest stats reveal that Binance distributed over $2.6 billion in airdrops in 2024 alone. In doing so, the crypto exchange captured more than 94% market share in the rewards segment. Programs such as Launchpool and Megadrop have managed to attract millions of participants, thereby strengthening user engagement and solidifying their dominance in token rewards. As of June 2025, the crypto exchange continues this trajectory, and projections indicate continued leadership in listing quality and reward distribution. For investors, these metrics position Binance as a stable and reliable exchange for participation in crypto markets. This dominance extends to liquidity metrics across major crypto assets as well. Binance Leads Bitcoin Liquidity CoinGecko recently reported that Binance leads Bitcoin liquidity across all depth levels, and holds approximately $8 million in depth on both sides within a +/- $100 range, ahead of Bitget and OKX. It accounts for around 32% of BTC liquidity among top exchanges. Interestingly, within a tighter +/- $10 range, Binance is the only platform with over $1 million liquidity on each side. In Ethereum liquidity, Bitget overtook Binance within a +/- $2 range, but Binance regained dominance at wider depths, and maintained a 25% liquidity share, compared to its 32% share in BTC. For XRP, Binance, Bitget, and Coinbase collectively control 67% of liquidity within a +/- $0.02 range. In the case of Solana markets, the crypto exchange holds around a 20% liquidity share at a +/- $1 range, while for Dogecoin, Binance’s liquidity remains balanced with Bitget, OKX, and Coinbase. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant had previously reported Binance emerging as the leader in proof-of-reserves (PoR) transparency among major crypto exchanges as it maintains a reserve coverage consistently above 100% and publishes monthly, timely PoR reports. OKX closely follows by maintaining full capital backing with regular monthly disclosures.

For those deeply entrenched in the fast-paced cryptocurrency ecosystem, efficiency isn’t just a goal—it’s a necessity. This drive for smarter, faster interactions is precisely why the recent Grammarly acquisition of Superhuman is sending ripples across the tech landscape, promising a future where your inbox works for you, not against you. The Strategic Grammarly Acquisition : Unpacking the Superhuman Deal On Tuesday, Grammarly, a household name synonymous with writing assistance, announced its significant move to acquire Superhuman, the acclaimed AI-powered email client. While the financial specifics of this monumental Superhuman deal remain undisclosed, the implications for the future of digital communication are vast. Superhuman, co-founded by Rahul Vohra, Vivek Sodera, and Conrad Irwin, had previously secured over $114 million in funding from prominent backers such as a16z, IVP, and Tiger Global, with its last valuation reaching an impressive $825 million, according to venture data analytics firm Traxcn. This acquisition is not just about adding an email client; it’s a strategic fusion of two powerhouses aiming to redefine how professionals interact with their most crucial communication channel. Shishir Malhotra, CEO of Grammarly, articulated the vision behind this acquisition, stating, “With Superhuman, we can deliver that future to millions more professionals while giving our existing users another surface for agent collaboration that simply doesn’t exist anywhere else. Email isn’t just another app; it’s where professionals spend significant portions of their day, and it’s the perfect staging ground for orchestrating multiple AI agents simultaneously.” This statement underscores the core belief that email, far from being a legacy tool, is the prime frontier for advanced AI integration. Revolutionizing Communication with Advanced AI Email Capabilities The core of this acquisition lies in Grammarly’s ambition to significantly enhance its AI email capabilities. Superhuman has already been at the forefront of integrating artificial intelligence into the email experience, rolling out features designed to streamline daily workflows. These include: AI-Powered Scheduling: Automatically suggesting optimal times for meetings based on context and availability. Intelligent Reply Generation: Crafting quick, context-aware responses to emails, saving precious time. Smart Categorization: Organizing inboxes by automatically sorting and prioritizing emails, reducing clutter and improving focus. Rahul Vohra, CEO of Superhuman, who along with other key employees will transition to Grammarly, echoed this sentiment: “Email is the main communication tool for billions of people worldwide and the number-one use case for Grammarly customers. By joining forces with Grammarly, we will invest even more in the core Superhuman experience, as well as create a new way of working where AI agents collaborate across the communication tools that we all use every day.” This synergy promises to deepen the intelligence embedded within our inboxes, making email not just a communication tool but a highly efficient command center. The Vision for Comprehensive Productivity AI This Grammarly acquisition isn’t an isolated event but rather a clear indication of Grammarly’s broader strategy to build a comprehensive Productivity AI suite. The company’s recent history shows a pattern of strategic moves aimed at expanding its AI footprint beyond just grammar and spelling correction: Date Strategic Move Impact on Productivity AI Last Year Acquisition of Coda Integrated collaborative productivity software, promoting Coda’s co-founder Shishir Malhotra to Grammarly CEO, signaling a shift towards broader productivity tools. May (Recent) $1 Billion Non-Dilutive Investment from General Catalyst Secured substantial funding without equity dilution, indicating strong investor confidence in its AI-driven expansion and providing capital for aggressive growth in the productivity space. Current Acquisition of Superhuman Deepens AI integration into email, a primary communication channel, paving the way for sophisticated AI agent orchestration and enhanced workflow automation. Grammarly’s approach is to weave AI into the fabric of daily professional life, making every interaction more efficient and intelligent. This extends beyond simple text correction to actively assisting users in managing their workflows, prioritizing tasks, and communicating more effectively across various platforms. Orchestrating the Future with Advanced AI Agents A key theme emerging from this acquisition is Grammarly’s intent to build advanced AI agents for emails, leveraging Superhuman’s cutting-edge technology. Imagine a future where your AI assistant doesn’t just proofread your emails but actively manages them: Contextual Understanding: AI agents will grasp the nuances of your conversations, understanding intent and sentiment. Proactive Assistance: They will anticipate your needs, drafting replies, suggesting actions, and even initiating tasks based on email content. Cross-Platform Collaboration: These agents will be designed to work seamlessly across various communication tools, not just email, creating a unified AI-powered workspace. Grammarly emphasized that email remains one of the top use-cases for its customers, making it the ideal “staging ground” for these sophisticated AI agents. This signifies a shift from reactive AI (correcting mistakes) to proactive, collaborative AI (assisting and automating tasks). For professionals in high-stakes environments like cryptocurrency trading or blockchain development, where rapid, accurate communication is paramount, such an evolution could be a game-changer, freeing up valuable time for strategic thinking and decision-making. What This Means for the Future of Work The Grammarly-Superhuman merger is more than just a corporate acquisition; it’s a significant step towards a new paradigm of work. It signals a future where AI isn’t just a tool for automation but a collaborative partner, enhancing human capabilities and streamlining complex digital interactions. As AI continues to evolve, its integration into fundamental applications like email will redefine productivity benchmarks, allowing professionals to focus on higher-value tasks while intelligent agents handle the mundane. This move firmly positions Grammarly as a leader not just in writing assistance, but in the broader landscape of intelligent productivity solutions.

BlockDAG is dominating crypto circles in 2025, and with good reason. With over $327 million raised, 23.5 billion BDAG coins sold, and more than 2 million users mining through its X1 mobile app, BlockDAG (BDAG) is more than just hype; it’s a fast-moving ecosystem. Now, things are heating up even more. The BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release has unlocked a rare $0.0016 price level until August 11, giving early buyers a chance to secure what could be the most profitable entry point before the official launch price of $0.05 goes live. This isn’t just a low entry. It’s a calculated reward for those acting early and locking in what may be the steepest upside available in any crypto presale this year. With a possible 3,025% return built into this pricing, BDAG is becoming impossible to ignore. Why the World Is Watching BlockDAG Right Now BlockDAG’s momentum is not just built on hype; it’s backed by strong architecture. The platform blends Kaspa-like DAG scalability with Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work security and full EVM compatibility. This gives BlockDAG the ability to scale up to 15,000 transactions per second while supporting smart contracts and maintaining decentralization. But here’s the key: it’s already working. The live testnet supports actual smart contract deployment A no-code builder is already live and onboarding users A developer academy is attracting builders well before launch Over 18,250 ASIC mining rigs have been sold The X1 mobile miner app brings in gamified mining, already with millions onboard This is not some concept or future promise. BlockDAG is functioning now, and the $0.0016 price is a real-time opportunity to get in early on something tangible. Massive 100M BDAG Airdrop Is Creating Serious Buzz BlockDAG isn’t just building quietly in the background. It’s going loud. A 100 million BDAG coin airdrop is live, and unlike passive giveaways, this one demands action. Participants need to interact with the testnet, use the X1 miner, refer others, and stay active in the ecosystem. It’s not just a reward, it’s a loop that fuels growth and helps stress-test the network. In parallel, BlockDAG is lining up a major U.S.-based sponsorship. While specifics are still under wraps, there’s already chatter that this could rival the kind of branding visibility Polygon achieved in mainstream sports deals. That means BDAG might soon reach well beyond crypto circles. With airdrops and national marketing aligned, BlockDAG is primed for maximum exposure right as it approaches launch. Here’s Why the $0.0016 Offer Can’t Be Ignored Right now, Batch 29 pricing is at $0.0276. But until the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, you can still claim BDAG at just $0.0016. That’s a massive difference from the listing price. For a project with a functioning testnet, global mining infrastructure, and $327 million already raised, this pricing is an unusually generous entry point. Opportunities like this don’t usually stick around. As the exchange listing gets closer, pricing will tighten, and the early access window may shut permanently. Is BlockDAG the Next Billion-Dollar Layer 1? Signs Point to Yes Analysts are already calling BlockDAG a potential successor to Kaspa, but with even more to offer. It combines EVM support, real usage tools, and a stronger focus on onboarding real users from day one. With 200,000 wallet holders already, a growing base of developers, and confirmed exchange plans and marketing underway, BDAG is looking like a future top-tier asset. BlockDAG’s entire strategy is built around growth, and it’s working: Launch with liquidity Reward early adopters Scale with real tools Go global with branding and tech That’s not just theory, it’s the playbook in action. Don’t Wait: This Crypto Move Has a Deadline BlockDAG is no longer just an exciting project. It’s a fully formed ecosystem with momentum, market interest, and an unfolding launch plan that rewards early action, quickly earning its place as the hottest crypto to buy right now. The $0.0016 price is only available until August 11. Once the next batch triggers or exchange trading begins, the chance to lock in this level disappears. And in crypto, missing the right timing can be the difference between small gains and life-changing ones.

US Ethereum Spot ETFs Have Recently Seen Continuous Inflows In a new post on X, the analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the netflow related to the US Ethereum spot ETFs is looking. Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to a given cryptocurrency without having to directly own tokens of it. Related Reading: Ethereum At Risk? If $2,200 Cracks, $1,160 May Be Coming These ETFs trade on traditional platforms, so traders taking this route don’t have to bother with digital asset exchanges and wallets. For investors only familiar with the traditional mode, this fact can make the ETFs the preferrable mode of investment. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot ETFs for Ethereum in mid 2024, half a year after Bitcoin’s approval went through near the start of the year. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows how the aggregate netflow has been like for the US ETH spot ETFs during the past few months. As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum spot ETFs saw outflows earlier in the year, but the trend has been different since the final third of April. Save for a week in May, a net amount of capital has been pouring into these investment vehicles. “As ETH rebounded from $2.2K to $2.5K, institutional appetite followed,” notes Glassnode. “Spot ETH ETFs recorded 106K ETH in net inflows last week – marking the 7th consecutive week of positive flows.” Ethereum isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has recently been enjoying ETF inflows. As the analytics firm has pointed out in another X post, the number one digital asset, Bitcoin, is also seeing demand pick up. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin has also been seeing a green netflow for the US spot ETFs, but due to a week of outflows in early June, the streak only stands at three weeks for the asset. During the latest week, around 15,000 BTC flowed into the ETFs. In USD terms, that’s equivalent to $1.6 billion. For comparison, inflows amounted to $258.6 million for Ethereum. Clearly, while both have seen demand, there is a clear difference of scale involved between the two. Related Reading: Dogecoin Under Pressure: Only Top 10 Coin Where Loss-Taking Exceeds Profit From the graph, it’s apparent that the US Bitcoin spot ETFs saw an acceleration of demand over the course of June. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the trend would keep up in this month of July. ETH Price Ethereum crossed the $2,500 level earlier, but it seems the coin has since faced a pullback as its price is back at $2,400.

For years, the path to launching a SEC ETF that holds cryptocurrencies directly has been fraught with regulatory hurdles, extensive paperwork, and prolonged waiting periods. However, a significant shift appears to be on the horizon, promising to streamline this complex journey and potentially unlock a new era for crypto investments. What’s Driving the SEC ETF Breakthrough? For a long time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has maintained a cautious stance on crypto-related financial products, particularly those directly holding digital assets. The existing framework for listing new ETFs on exchanges, primarily through the 19b-4 filing process, has proven to be a cumbersome and often frustrating experience for issuers. This process requires exchanges to propose rule changes to list new products, which then undergo a lengthy review and public comment period by the SEC. It’s a resource-intensive endeavor, demanding significant time, legal expertise, and financial commitment from both the exchanges and the prospective ETF issuers. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while a monumental step, still involved this arduous 19b-4 pathway for each individual product. Now, sources like Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett indicate that the SEC is actively working with exchanges to develop general listing standards. This proactive approach suggests a recognition of the growing maturity of the digital asset market and an understanding that the current ad-hoc system is unsustainable for broader adoption. The goal is clear: to create a more efficient, predictable, and less burdensome route for bringing new token-based ETFs to market, fostering innovation while maintaining investor protection. Unpacking the New Token-Based ETFs Listing Framework The proposed shift is nothing short of revolutionary for the digital asset space. Instead of each new token-based ETF requiring a unique 19b-4 filing, the SEC is aiming for a system where a token, once it meets pre-defined listing criteria, would allow issuers to bypass this step entirely. Issuers would then only need to submit an S-1 Securities Registration Statement, which is a standard registration form for new securities offerings. Following this, the ETF could be listed on an exchange after a 75-day waiting period. To illustrate the significance of this change, consider the contrast between the old and proposed new processes: Aspect Current Process (e.g., Spot Bitcoin ETFs) Proposed New Process (for Token-Based ETFs) Primary Filing 19b-4 Rule Change (by exchange) AND S-1 Registration (by issuer) S-1 Registration (by issuer) ONLY Regulatory Burden High; lengthy SEC review, public comments, significant feedback loops Significantly Reduced; streamlined review based on pre-set criteria Approval Timeline Variable, often many months to years for 19b-4 Potentially faster; 75-day wait post S-1 submission for eligible tokens Scope Token-specific, requires individual approval for each new product/asset Token-agnostic, applies to any token meeting general standards This simplified pathway is expected to dramatically reduce the paperwork and feedback burden on both the issuers, who currently face immense compliance costs, and the SEC itself, which has been overwhelmed by the volume of filings. It represents a move towards a more programmatic and less discretionary regulatory approach, which could foster greater predictability in the market. Accelerating Crypto ETF Approval: Benefits and Hurdles The implications of a streamlined crypto ETF approval process are vast, promising a cascade of benefits across the digital asset ecosystem: Increased Market Access: More ETFs means more avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This could lead to a significant inflow of capital from institutional and retail investors. Enhanced Liquidity: With more regulated products, liquidity in the underlying crypto markets could improve as institutional participants find easier entry points. Reduced Costs for Issuers: Less regulatory overhead translates to lower legal and operational costs for companies looking to launch these funds, potentially leading to more competitive fees for investors. Greater Innovation: A clearer path encourages more diverse token-based ETF offerings, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to potentially include a wider array of digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: Establishing general listing standards provides much-needed clarity for the industry, allowing for better long-term planning and investment. However, challenges remain. While the process may be streamlined, the SEC’s core mandate of investor protection will not diminish. The agency will still scrutinize the underlying assets, market manipulation concerns, and the robustness of the ETF’s structure. The exact criteria, once set, will dictate which tokens are eligible, and there will inevitably be a period of adjustment as the industry adapts to these new standards. Furthermore, the 75-day waiting period, while shorter than current 19b-4 timelines, still requires careful planning from issuers. Key Criteria for ETF Listing Process: Market Cap, Volume, and Liquidity While specific listing criteria have not yet been formally set or publicly detailed, early indications suggest that the SEC will focus on fundamental metrics that demonstrate a token’s maturity and stability. The reported considerations include market capitalization , trading volume , and liquidity . These are critical indicators that traditional finance regulators often rely on to assess the health and integrity of an asset market. Market Capitalization: This refers to the total value of all circulating units of a cryptocurrency (price per token multiplied by circulating supply). A higher market capitalization generally indicates a larger, more established, and less volatile asset. It suggests a broader investor base and greater resilience to price manipulation. Trading Volume: This measures the total amount of a specific cryptocurrency that has been traded over a given period (e.g., 24 hours). High trading volume signifies strong market interest and activity, making it easier for large orders to be filled without significantly impacting the price. It also suggests a more efficient price discovery mechanism. Liquidity: This refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. For cryptocurrencies, high liquidity means there are many buyers and sellers, and trades can be executed quickly and efficiently. Illiquid assets are prone to significant price swings, making them riskier for ETF structures that need to manage redemptions and creations smoothly. The SEC’s focus on these metrics is a pragmatic approach, leveraging established financial principles to evaluate novel assets. By setting clear, data-driven thresholds, the commission aims to ensure that only sufficiently robust and mature digital assets underpin these new ETFs, thereby mitigating risks for investors and maintaining market integrity. This structured approach to the ETF listing process is a significant step towards regulatory harmonization. The Future Landscape of Digital Asset ETFs This proactive move by the SEC could herald a new era for digital asset ETFs . If successful, it could pave the way for a broader range of token-based ETFs beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Imagine ETFs based on leading DeFi tokens, layer-1 blockchain protocols, or even baskets of various digital assets, similar to sector-specific equity ETFs. This expansion would provide investors with diversified exposure to the rapidly growing crypto economy through familiar and regulated investment vehicles. Such a development would also signify a deeper integration of the crypto market into the mainstream financial system. It could attract more institutional investors who are currently hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties or the complexities of direct crypto custody. The increased institutional participation, in turn, could bring greater stability and maturity to the crypto markets. While an SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics, the ongoing discussions with exchanges are a strong indicator of the commission’s evolving strategy and a clear signal that the future of digital asset investment is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Investments The SEC’s reported efforts to streamline the token-based ETF listing process mark a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. By moving towards general listing standards and simplifying the approval pathway, the commission is signaling a shift from reactive oversight to a more proactive and structured regulatory framework. This initiative promises to reduce significant burdens on issuers, accelerate the introduction of diverse crypto-backed financial products, and ultimately provide millions of investors with easier, regulated access to the burgeoning digital asset economy. While the specifics of the listing criteria are yet to be finalized, the focus on market capitalization, trading volume, and liquidity suggests a pragmatic approach aimed at fostering responsible innovation. The journey towards mainstream crypto adoption is long, but this potential breakthrough could be a monumental leap forward.

Despite the volatility earlier this year, all three projects are showing renewed stability, with strong investor engagement and ecosystem activity reinforcing their momentum. But beyond these headline assets, a lesser-known token—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is quietly building speculative appeal for early-positioned investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Watchlist Status MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting some early interest from traders who are looking for high-risk, high-reward setups outside of the large-cap spotlight. Still in its pre-sale phase, the token is positioning itself as a breakout contender—particularly for those aiming to secure entry before broader exposure. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its fusion of market speculation with narrative appeal. It operates at the intersection of meme coin culture and political branding—an unconventional combination that has fueled similar assets during previous rotation cycles. XRP Shows Stability Amid Institutional Utility XRP has remained stable throughout June, trading within a narrow range of $2.08 to $2.16. With short-term projections aiming for $2.27 to $2.41, it’s starting to draw renewed interest from investors who value consistent price action in an otherwise unpredictable market. Backed by Ripple’s mission to streamline cross-border payments for institutions, XRP offers a clear utility that many digital assets can’t claim. As regulatory developments progress and Ripple secures more international partnerships, XRP is increasingly seen as a reliable option for those seeking exposure to fundamentally grounded altcoins. Solana Benefits From Speed and Developer Traction Solana continues to post strong network performance metrics, processing tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining some of the lowest fees in the industry. Even though there have been concerns about outages in the past, the network is still popular among DeFi and NFT developers because of its low fees and wide adoption. Solana continues to build on its momentum, with more developers jumping in and recent upgrades improving the network’s core performance. As adoption grows, many see Solana holding its ground as one of the key platforms powering Web3 apps and smart contracts. Avalanche Begins Technical Recovery Avalanche (AVAX) is entering a technical rebound phase. Currently trading around $17.29, AVAX has dropped over 8.30% in the past week. Analysts note a breakout from a falling wedge—a classic bullish reversal signal—with resistance near $19 now in focus. While still far from its former highs near $146, the setup has encouraged traders to watch AVAX as it attempts to reclaim lost ground. Momentum traders and technical analysts see a path toward $20+, pending continued market support. Altcoins Are Moving — and MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Entering the Conversation XRP, Solana, and Avalanche are showing strength where it counts—through consistent price action, growing adoption, and visible network activity. These large-cap players may continue to serve as anchors in any upcoming market rally. But as capital rotation begins, smaller, narrative-driven tokens are beginning to attract speculative flows. For those eyeing early-stage asymmetry, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an entry window that won’t remain open forever.

Transparency: Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent record of transactions, enhancing accountability. Webus’s move suggests a vision where payments are faster, cheaper, and more accessible. By leveraging XRP, known for its efficiency in facilitating international transfers, Webus aims to position itself as a leader in next-generation payment solutions. This could involve direct crypto payments for services, or even backend treasury management where XRP is used to optimize liquidity for various fiat currencies. Revolutionizing Engagement: The Promise of Blockchain Loyalty Programs Beyond payments, a significant portion of Webus’s strategy is dedicated to enhancing customer engagement through blockchain loyalty programs. Traditional loyalty programs often suffer from limitations such as lack of transparency, expiry dates, and limited redemption options. Blockchain technology offers a powerful antidote to these challenges: Comparison: Traditional vs. Blockchain Loyalty Programs Feature Traditional Loyalty Programs Blockchain Loyalty Programs Transparency Opaque, controlled by company Transparent, verifiable on public ledger Flexibility Limited redemption options, points expire Tokenized rewards, potentially tradable/transferable Security Centralized databases, prone to hacks Decentralized, cryptographically secure Interoperability Isolated to single brand Potential for cross-brand loyalty ecosystems Value Proposition Points often devalue or expire Tokens can hold/increase value, true ownership By tokenizing loyalty points on the XRP Ledger, Webus could offer customers digital assets that are truly owned by them, potentially tradable, and redeemable for a wider array of goods and services. This approach could foster deeper customer loyalty and create a more dynamic, valuable rewards ecosystem, setting a new standard for customer retention strategies. Navigating the Landscape: The Role of Institutional Crypto in Mainstream Adoption The conditional nature of the agreement, pending SEC registration and underwriter approval, highlights the ongoing interplay between innovation and regulation in the crypto space. This development is a prime example of how institutional crypto investments are becoming increasingly common, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy. Large corporations like Webus are not just dabbling; they are making significant, strategic commitments. This trend signifies several key shifts: Maturation of the Crypto Market: As more institutions engage, the market gains legitimacy and stability, moving beyond its early, volatile reputation. Demand for Utility: Companies are increasingly looking beyond speculative gains to the practical applications of blockchain and digital assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: With greater institutional involvement comes increased regulatory attention, aiming to ensure investor protection and market integrity. The SEC’s role here is crucial in setting precedents for how such financial instruments are handled. Webus International’s proactive step could encourage other NASDAQ-listed entities to explore similar avenues, accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital assets for operational efficiency and competitive advantage. Potential Challenges and the Road Ahead for Webus International While the $100 million equity line presents immense opportunities, Webus International will undoubtedly face challenges. The primary hurdle is securing the necessary SEC registration and underwriter approval, which can be a complex and time-consuming process given the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. Furthermore, the inherent volatility of the crypto market, though mitigated by XRP’s utility-focused design, still poses a risk for treasury management. Successfully integrating new blockchain technologies into existing legacy systems requires significant technical expertise and operational adjustments. Webus will need to navigate these complexities while also educating its customer base on the benefits and use cases of its new crypto-enabled services. Competition from existing fintech giants and emerging blockchain startups will also demand continuous innovation and agility. A Game-Changer for Webus International and the Broader Ecosystem? The securing of a $100 million equity line to expand its XRP strategy is more than just a financial transaction for Webus International; it’s a strategic declaration. It positions Webus at the vanguard of businesses leveraging digital assets for core operational improvements and enhanced customer experiences. This move could set a precedent for how public companies integrate blockchain and cryptocurrencies into their long-term growth strategies. For the XRP ecosystem, Webus’s commitment further validates XRP’s utility beyond cross-border payments, showcasing its potential in loyalty programs and broader treasury management. As more enterprises recognize and act on the transformative power of blockchain, the ripple effect of such investments will undoubtedly accelerate the global shift towards a more decentralized and efficient financial future. This investment is a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with digital assets, and Webus International is actively shaping that future, one innovative step at a time.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading below $106k while Ether continues to struggle within the sub-$2,400 region. XRP, Ripple’s native coin, is not left out as it lost 3% of its value in the last 24 hours. However, analysts remain optimistic about its short to medium-term performance amid strong fundamentals. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas raised the odds of a spot XRP ETF XRP is currently trading in the red but could rally higher soon if analysts’ predictions hold.

The pair is also efficient, suggesting that the bears might not sweep any liquidity to the upside before dropping lower. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 48 shows that XRP is losing its buying pressure, with sellers now taking control of the market. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is still within the positive territory but could dip into the negative zone soon. If the bearish trend persists, XRP could test the $2.06 support level over the next few hours. A drop below this level could trigger a further selloff that could see XRP test the $1.90 low for the second time in three weeks. However, the fundamentals are currently in favour of an XRP rally. If the bulls regain control, XRP could test last month’s high of $2.34. In the event of an extended rally, XRP could touch the $2.65 level for the first time since May. Key areas of interest to traders remain the $2.06 support level, the 50-day EMA support at $2.18, the first resistance level at $2.34, and the high of $2.65 it achieved in May, prior to the Iran-Israel conflict.

This strategic purchase of 5,025 Bittensor TAO tokens for $1.65 million marks a pivotal moment, showcasing a growing convergence between established enterprises and the innovative world of decentralized finance and artificial intelligence. Oblong’s Bold Move: Unpacking the Bittensor TAO Acquisition The news, outlined in a recent press release, confirms Oblong’s commitment to building a significant reserve of Bittensor TAO tokens . With an average price paid of $328.38 per token, this investment follows previous reports detailing Oblong’s successful $7.5 million fundraising through a common stock offering. This earlier financial maneuver was explicitly linked to the company’s stated intent to pursue a strategy focused on accumulating TAO, signaling a well-thought-out pivot rather than an impulsive venture. Oblong, traditionally known for its IT solutions, is now positioning itself at the forefront of a fascinating intersection: corporate technology and decentralized AI. This acquisition is more than just a treasury allocation; it represents a strategic alignment with a technology that could redefine various industries. For a Nasdaq-listed entity to make such a direct and public move into a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency, especially one tied to cutting-edge AI, speaks volumes about their long-term vision. Why Are Bittensor TAO Tokens Catching Institutional Eyes? To understand the significance of Oblong’s move, one must first grasp what Bittensor TAO tokens represent. Bittensor is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s a decentralized machine learning network. Imagine a global, open-source marketplace where AI models are trained and rewarded. Here’s why it’s gaining traction: Decentralized AI Marketplace: Bittensor allows AI models to collaborate and share intelligence in a peer-to-peer network, fostering innovation without central control. Incentivized Contribution: Participants who contribute valuable machine intelligence to the network are rewarded with TAO tokens, creating a robust ecosystem. Open-Source Collaboration: It promotes transparency and collaborative development in AI, a stark contrast to proprietary, closed AI systems. Scalability and Efficiency: By distributing the computational load, Bittensor aims to make AI development more accessible and efficient. This unique proposition makes TAO a compelling asset for companies looking to integrate advanced AI capabilities or simply gain exposure to the burgeoning decentralized AI crypto sector. Oblong’s decision suggests they see tangible value in this innovative approach to AI development. Oblong’s Strategic Shift: A Nasdaq Company’s Crypto Investment The OBLG crypto investment strategy is a clear signal of the evolving landscape where traditional businesses are no longer shying away from digital assets. For Oblong, this isn’t merely speculative; it’s likely viewed as an investment in future technology and potential new revenue streams. What could this mean for Oblong’s core business? Diversification: Adding a high-growth, technology-driven asset to their balance sheet. Innovation Hub: Potentially leveraging Bittensor’s decentralized network to enhance their existing IT solutions or develop new AI-powered services. Market Positioning: Becoming an early adopter and leader in integrating decentralized AI, setting them apart from competitors. Talent Attraction: Drawing in talent interested in the cutting edge of AI and blockchain. This move highlights a growing trend where a Nasdaq company crypto venture is seen not as a risk, but as a strategic imperative to stay competitive in a rapidly digitizing world. Oblong is betting on the future of AI being decentralized, and their balance sheet reflects that conviction. The Broader Trend: Institutional Interest in Decentralized AI Crypto Oblong’s move is part of a larger narrative unfolding in the financial and technological spheres: the increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency, particularly those linked to tangible technological advancements like AI. The AI boom has been undeniable, and now, the intersection of AI with blockchain, specifically decentralized AI crypto projects, is gaining significant traction. Why are more and more traditional entities looking at this space? The potential benefits are vast: Access to Cutting-Edge Technology: Decentralized networks often foster rapid innovation and provide access to technologies not yet available in traditional markets. Efficiency and Cost Savings: Blockchain-based solutions can offer more efficient and transparent operations. New Business Models: Cryptocurrencies and blockchain enable entirely new ways of conducting business, creating new markets and revenue opportunities. Competitive Edge: Early movers can establish significant advantages in emerging markets. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges. The cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, and regulatory frameworks are still evolving. Technical complexities and security risks are also considerations. Despite these hurdles, the long-term potential seems to outweigh the immediate risks for companies like Oblong, especially given the current growth trajectory of AI. What Does This Mean for the OBLG Crypto Strategy and Beyond? The implications of Oblong’s OBLG crypto strategy extend beyond just their balance sheet. This acquisition could serve as a blueprint for other Nasdaq-listed companies considering similar ventures. It validates the utility and long-term vision of projects like Bittensor, potentially paving the way for broader institutional adoption of AI-focused cryptocurrencies. For investors, this development offers a fascinating case study. It underscores the importance of looking beyond traditional metrics and understanding how companies are integrating emerging technologies into their core strategies. It also highlights the growing importance of AI-centric tokens within the broader crypto market, suggesting a future where utility and real-world application drive value. Actionable Insights: For Investors: Monitor Oblong’s integration of TAO into its business model. Research other decentralized AI projects that might attract similar institutional interest. For Businesses: Evaluate how decentralized technologies, particularly AI, could enhance your operations or open new market opportunities. For Crypto Enthusiasts: This move validates the long-term vision of decentralized AI and its potential to attract significant capital from traditional sectors. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Corporate Crypto Adoption Oblong’s substantial Bittensor TAO acquisition is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic declaration. It signals a future where Nasdaq-listed companies are actively participating in and shaping the decentralized AI landscape. This bold OBLG crypto investment highlights the increasing confidence in blockchain-powered AI solutions and sets a precedent for how traditional tech firms might engage with the crypto market going forward. As the lines between conventional finance, IT, and decentralized technology continue to blur, Oblong’s move positions it as a pioneer in this exciting new frontier.

If so, you’re likely to find the latest news from the US Senate a significant moment. In a move that has many in the digital asset community breathing a collective sigh of relief, President Donald Trump’s budget bill has advanced without the inclusion of any cryptocurrency tax provisions. This outcome, as reported by CoinDesk, marks a temporary pause in direct federal taxation efforts on digital currencies through this particular legislative vehicle. What Just Happened with Cryptocurrency Tax? The core of the recent development lies in the passage of the U.S. Senate’s budget bill. For months, there has been speculation and active lobbying regarding how cryptocurrencies would be treated under new tax laws. Many feared that the budget bill would be an opportune moment for lawmakers to introduce new, potentially burdensome, tax obligations on crypto transactions. However, as the bill moved through the legislative process, these specific provisions were ultimately left out. This means that for now, the existing framework for cryptocurrency tax remains largely unchanged by this specific piece of legislation. This decision, or rather, non-decision, by the US Senate , highlights the ongoing complexity and evolving nature of how governments are approaching digital assets. It underscores that while there is growing interest in regulating the crypto space, there isn’t yet a clear, unified path forward, especially concerning taxation. Why Did the US Senate Exclude Crypto Provisions? The exclusion of cryptocurrency tax provisions wasn’t for lack of trying by some lawmakers. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known proponent of digital assets and a vocal advocate for clear crypto legislation, had previously attempted to include a provision in the bill. Her proposal aimed to exempt small cryptocurrency transactions under $300 from taxes. This initiative was designed to ease the burden on everyday users and encourage the use of crypto for minor purchases, much like how foreign currency gains under $200 are typically exempt from taxation. So, why was it left out? Several factors could be at play: Legislative Priorities: Budget bills are often complex, focusing on broad fiscal policies. Specific, niche tax provisions might be deemed too contentious or too detailed for a sweeping budget bill. Lack of Consensus: The understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies vary widely among lawmakers. Reaching a consensus on specific tax rules for digital assets can be challenging. Complexity of Implementation: Designing effective and enforceable tax rules for a global, decentralized asset class like crypto is inherently difficult. Focus on Broader Issues: Lawmakers might be prioritizing other pressing economic issues, deferring detailed crypto regulation to future, more targeted legislation. The omission suggests that while there’s a recognition of crypto’s growing presence, the legislative body isn’t yet ready to implement comprehensive new tax rules through a broad budget bill. The Proposed Crypto Exemption: A Glimpse into Digital Asset Taxation Senator Lummis’s proposal for a $300 exemption from cryptocurrency tax offers a valuable insight into potential future approaches to digital asset taxation . The idea behind such an exemption is to foster the adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. Currently, every transaction involving crypto, even small ones, can technically trigger a taxable event if there’s a gain. This creates a significant compliance burden for users and can discourage the use of crypto for payments. The benefits of such an exemption would be: Reduced Compliance Burden: Simplifies tax reporting for small transactions. Encourages Adoption: Makes using crypto for daily purchases more practical. Fairness: Aligns crypto taxation with existing exemptions for foreign currency. While this specific proposal didn’t make it into the budget bill, it sets a precedent for future discussions and highlights a desire among some lawmakers to create a more user-friendly tax environment for digital assets. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation in the US? The absence of cryptocurrency tax provisions in this budget bill does not mean the end of the conversation around crypto regulation . Far from it. The legislative landscape for digital assets in the US is dynamic and constantly evolving. This recent development simply means that this particular avenue for immediate tax changes has been closed, at least for now. We can expect future legislative efforts to address various aspects of crypto, including: Clarity on Securities vs. Commodities: Defining what constitutes a security versus a commodity in the crypto space remains a key regulatory challenge. Stablecoin Regulation: Lawmakers are increasingly focused on stablecoins, given their growing market capitalization and potential systemic importance. Consumer Protection: Efforts to protect investors from fraud and market manipulation in the crypto space are ongoing. Broader Tax Reform: While this bill omitted crypto, future tax reform efforts could still include specific provisions for digital assets. The crypto industry, alongside its advocates in the US Senate and House, will continue to push for clear, sensible rules that foster innovation while protecting consumers. This recent outcome serves as a reminder that legislative progress can be slow and often requires multiple attempts and significant debate. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders For individuals holding or transacting with cryptocurrencies, this news provides a moment of clarity and perhaps a temporary reprieve. However, it’s crucial to remember a few key points: Existing Rules Still Apply: This bill’s omission doesn’t change current IRS guidance on digital asset taxation . Cryptocurrencies are generally treated as property for tax purposes, meaning gains and losses from sales or exchanges are taxable. Stay Informed: The legislative landscape is fluid. Keep an eye on news from the US Senate, Treasury, and IRS for any future announcements or proposed bills that could impact crypto. Consult a Professional: Given the complexity, always consider consulting a tax professional experienced in cryptocurrency if you have significant holdings or transactions. A Temporary Reprieve, Not a Final Verdict The advancement of the budget bill without cryptocurrency tax provisions is undoubtedly positive news for the digital asset community. It signals that immediate, broad-stroke tax changes via this specific legislative channel have been avoided. However, it’s essential to view this as a temporary reprieve rather than a final verdict on crypto taxation. The conversation around crypto regulation and how best to integrate digital asset taxation into the broader financial system will continue to evolve. The efforts of lawmakers like Senator Lummis highlight the ongoing push for more practical and crypto-friendly tax policies. As the industry matures, so too will the legislative approaches, making it crucial for all participants to remain vigilant and informed.

While XRP and Cardano remain on the radar of long-term holders, analysts are increasingly watching a new wave of Layer-1s gaining serious ground—including SUI, Avalanche (AVAX), and the rapidly ascending MAGACOIN FINANCE. The question now is clear: will the established giants continue delivering returns, or is the spotlight moving to altcoins with tighter supply dynamics and untapped upside? The Altcoin Building Quiet Momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE While XRP, Cardano, SUI, and AVAX jockey for market share, one early-stage token has begun generating the kind of attention usually seen just before liftoff. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging not from hype, but from structure—carefully timed release mechanics, strong asymmetric upside potential, and high-conviction buying behavior. Each allocation round has closed quickly, and analysts tracking early-stage presales are increasingly tagging it as a strategic high-reward move. It’s drawing attention for the same reason breakout tokens do—strong positioning, limited supply dynamics, and a market narrative that hasn’t yet reached the mainstream. XRP: ETF Momentum Meets Resistance XRP’s momentum has been driven by both regulatory progress and growing institutional attention. The ongoing review of the Franklin XRP ETF application by the SEC could be a game-changer if approved, potentially opening the floodgates to billions in new inflows. But short-term price action tells a more cautious story. After a failed breakout above resistance, XRP has entered a compression phase. Traders are watching key support zones closely. If ETF approval lands, a rally is on the table—but for now, capital is also rotating into altcoins with less uncertainty and more explosive structure. Cardano: Ecosystem Strength but Slower Gears Cardano continues to deliver on-chain milestones—from increased transaction volumes to smart contract development and upcoming scalability upgrades. Its ecosystem has expanded steadily, and plans for XRP integration hint at a future driven by cross-chain interoperability. However, ADA’s pace has been deliberate, and that’s led some short-term investors to seek faster-moving opportunities. While long-term believers remain confident, the broader market appears more eager to chase altcoins poised for sharper Q3 acceleration. SUI: Quietly Building Under the Surface SUI’s fundamentals remain among the strongest in the Layer-1 category. Daily transactions have exploded, and Total Value Locked (TVL) continues to grow, showing real user adoption across DeFi protocols. Technically, SUI is printing a falling wedge pattern—often a bullish setup. Analysts note that a breakout above its resistance zone could unlock a rally of over 40%, driven by renewed confidence in the chain’s ultra-fast finality and ecosystem expansion. The disconnect between its technical strength and current momentum is narrowing fast. That’s why it’s now being closely watched by investors hunting for undervalued execution plays. Avalanche: Network Growth and Real-World Utility Avalanche has quietly reclaimed attention in recent weeks. A surge in daily transactions and wallet activity, driven by new memecoin launches and real-world asset initiatives, has positioned it as a serious Layer-1 contender for Q3 growth. A recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern could confirm the start of a broader recovery move. Add in Ethereum capital inflows and strategic upgrades like Proof of Reserves for DeFi transparency, and AVAX is starting to look primed for a return to the Layer-1 spotlight. Final Thoughts: The Spotlight Is Shifting XRP and Cardano aren’t going away—but their pace has left room for faster contenders to rise. Layer-1s like SUI and AVAX are backed by strong metrics and near-term catalysts. And MAGACOIN FINANCE? It’s quickly becoming the wildcard with the sharpest upside. When the next rally ignites, those already positioned in the right altcoin may not just ride the wave—they’ll define it.

This isn’t just another regulatory update; it’s a significant leap forward for institutional crypto adoption and mainstream accessibility to digital assets. What Does This SEC Approval Mean for Investors? The news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, confirms a long-awaited development that many in the crypto community have been anticipating. But what exactly does the SEC approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund as an ETF entail for you, the investor, and the broader market? Enhanced Accessibility: Previously, investing in Grayscale’s fund might have involved navigating private placements or specific trusts. With an ETF, it becomes as simple as buying shares on a traditional stock exchange, making it accessible to a much wider range of investors, including those who prefer regulated investment vehicles. Increased Liquidity: ETFs are known for their high liquidity. This conversion means more trading volume and easier entry and exit points for investors, reducing potential price slippage and improving overall market efficiency for these digital assets. Regulatory Legitimacy: An ETF structure brings a layer of regulatory oversight and investor protection that is often sought by traditional financial institutions and risk-averse investors. This stamp of approval from the SEC lends significant credibility to the digital asset space. Diversified Exposure: Unlike single-asset ETFs (like a spot Bitcoin ETF), the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund offers exposure to a basket of prominent cryptocurrencies, providing inherent diversification for investors seeking broad market exposure without managing individual crypto wallets. Diving Deeper into the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund’s Assets One of the most compelling aspects of this new Grayscale ETF is its diversified portfolio. The fund is designed to provide exposure to the largest and most liquid digital assets, mirroring a significant portion of the cryptocurrency market’s capitalization. The approved ETF will include a carefully selected mix of: Asset Significance Bitcoin (BTC) The pioneer cryptocurrency, often seen as ‘digital gold’ and the cornerstone of the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) The leading smart contract platform, foundational for DeFi, NFTs, and a vast ecosystem of dApps. XRP A digital asset focused on fast, low-cost international payments and remittances. Solana (SOL) A high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability, attracting a growing developer community. Cardano (ADA) A proof-of-stake blockchain platform emphasizing research-driven development and sustainability. This strategic selection ensures that investors gain exposure to established market leaders as well as innovative, high-growth potential altcoins, all within a single, regulated investment product. It represents a mature approach to offering crypto ETF products that cater to a broader investment mandate beyond just Bitcoin. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for Institutional Crypto? While the SEC approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund is a monumental step, it also raises questions about the future trajectory of digital asset investments. This decision could potentially open the floodgates for more diversified crypto ETFs and similar regulated products. The regulatory landscape is continuously evolving, and this move by the SEC indicates a growing understanding and perhaps acceptance of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. However, challenges remain. Market volatility, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the need for robust custody solutions are ongoing considerations. This approval sets a precedent, but each new product will still undergo rigorous scrutiny. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and understand the inherent risks associated with digital asset investments, even within regulated vehicles. Actionable Insights for Navigating the New Grayscale ETF Landscape With the advent of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ETF, investors have new avenues to consider. Here are a few actionable insights: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: While an ETF provides regulatory comfort, the underlying assets (cryptocurrencies) are still volatile. Ensure this investment aligns with your overall financial goals and risk appetite. Consider Diversification: This ETF offers inherent diversification within the crypto space. However, it’s also crucial to ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes, not just digital assets. Stay Informed: The crypto market and its regulatory environment are dynamic. Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and performance updates related to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund and other similar products. Consult a Financial Advisor: For complex investment decisions, especially those involving emerging asset classes, seeking advice from a qualified financial professional is always recommended. In conclusion, the SEC approval of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund’s conversion to an ETF marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies increasing mainstream acceptance and provides a regulated, accessible pathway for investors to gain diversified exposure to leading digital assets. This development is not just about one fund; it’s about the continued maturation of the digital asset ecosystem and the growing bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. It’s a powerful testament to the relentless efforts of companies like Grayscale in pushing for clearer regulatory frameworks and broader investment opportunities.

The process that started as a somewhat tentative exploration of digital solutions has become an all-out race to update monetary infrastructures among various global nations. More than 100 countries are currently studying or testing their digital currencies. CBDC revolution comes into shape CBDCs are more of an overhaul of what money should be. Unlike alternative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum , CBDCs are online equivalents of a national currency, given the equivalent value of the government-issued paper notes. Still, they have the stability and the support of classical cash paired with the efficiency and creativity of digital currency. The drive towards CBDC development has never been as high before. According to the latest figures given by the Bank for International Settlements, among central banks, 93% already work on CBDCs, and many have shifted the focus to actual pilot programs and policy designs. The current uptake indicates that the world has realized that digital currencies are not just experimental technology but needed infrastructure in the future of finance. Who is taking the front seat in global CBDCs China has become the leader in implementing CBDC DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) or the digital yuan. China has already conducted billions of dollars of digital yuan transactions through huge pilot programs in large cities such as Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, showing the practical feasibility of retail CBDCs on a large scale. The European Central Bank has been thorough in its methodology in the digital euro project, involving research and consultations with stakeholders. Protecting privacy and living in harmony with cash are of primary importance in the design, highlighted by the ECB officials due to the current issue of people being afraid that the central bank could spy on them and become financially excluded. The United States Federal Reserve has been cautious and has concentrated on research and international cooperation rather than being in a hurry to do anything. Federal Reserve officials say they are less concerned with being the first country to distribute CBDC and more interested in getting its design correct, with the global consequences of the digital dollar. The Bank of England is still exploring that idea further through extensive research papers and consultation with the public. The Bank of Japan has already conducted proof-of-concept experiments with lower-level CBDC functions and system stability tests. Technical architecture and design of consideration Technical and policy decisions relating to the CBDC development are pretty complex and will determine the future of digital money. Central banks must balance against set priorities – privacy and transparency, innovation and stability and financial inclusion and security. A decision on wholesale versus retail CBDCs is a basic design choice. The wholesale CBDC is aimed at interbank payments and high-dollar transactions , giving the possibility of transforming settlement systems and cross-border payments. The availability of retail CBDCs to consumers and businesses can change how people conduct everyday transactions and the transmission of monetary policy. Privacy protection is a critical aspect of the design of CBDC. Though central banks have understood that privacy is essential, they have also taken note of the regulatory need in combating AML (anti-money laundering) and terrorist financing. Such a delicate balance between finding the right balance needs advanced technical solutions, such as ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and techniques of differential privacy. Functionality when not online is another major factor, which would ensure that the digital currencies can be used even when not connected to the network or when there is low connectivity. This would be necessary to facilitate the universal accessibility of physical cash. Policy and economic implication CBDCs have severe implications for the effectiveness of the monetary policy and financial stability. There is a chance that central banks might gain greater insight into the flow of money and the economy and be in a better position to react to economic shocks and targeted intervention. Commercial banks’ disintermediation is a significant issue in CBDC design. If consumers directly own digital currency with the central banks, the traditional banks may lose deposits and have difficulties in their lending operations. Some possible methods the central banks are considering to counter this risk are interest rates and holding curbs. The DCC implementation may revolutionize cross-border payment. Transactions across borders, which nowadays require days to complete and come with exorbitant costs, might be made instant and cost-effective. This will, however, need the coordination of central banks and solving intricate regulatory and technical interoperability issues. Financial inclusion is one of the most significant potential uses of enhancing CBDC. Digital currencies would offer banking services to the unbanked, allowing them to send remittances at a lower cost and allowing a more efficient provision of government payments and social assistance. Difficulties and risks Although it is possible to note the potential benefits of CBDCs, central banks have to consider many essential issues. Cybersecurity may be the biggest threat since digital currencies may become the focus of sophisticated attacks. Central banks have to adopt a high level of security without compromising performance and experience. The public stakeholders have been focused on privacy issues. The citizens are concerned about government spying and the possibility of surveillance of transactions. Central banks must balance what people are rightfully entitled to in providing privacy and what they require in compliance with regulation and law enforcement. There are also permanent difficulties of technical complexity – CBDCs must be linked with current payment systems, regulatory regimes and international norms. Designing systems that can be up and running 24/7 and resilient thrusts on complexity even further. Relationships with the existing system of payments must be considered well when CBDCs coexist. Central banks need to be sure that digital currencies should co-exist with cash and private means of payment, not substitute them, and thus preserve choice and competition in the payment environment. The road ahead is to emerge. Since the pace of creating CBDC is growing worldwide, some main trends are starting to appear. As the number of countries launching their CBDC grows, so will the need to have interoperability between various systems of different CBDCs. International bodies strive to develop harmonized parameters and procedures to enable cross-border transactions of CBDC. Public-private partnerships are becoming necessary for the successful implementation of CBDC. Central banks are partnering with technology providers, financial establishments and payment providers to exploit already established expertise and infrastructure and remain regulatory supervisors. Launch plans of CBDC differ significantly across jurisdictions and continue to evolve as priorities, technical capacity and regulatory frameworks differ. Although certain countries might issue retail CBDCs by the end of the current decade, others will engage in less ambitious plans, which may also take the position to the end. Consequences of cryptocurrency system The entire cryptocurrency world has some significant implications for the development of CBDC. Although the demand that CBDCs and cryptocurrencies address, and the markets where they operate, resemble each other, their co-existence will probably transform the digital asset market. CBDCs can popularize the idea of digital funds and speed up the transition to digital payment, which can cause beneficial spillover into cryptocurrency consumption . The interoperability of both, however, is not transparent in most jurisdictions. CBDCs’ programmability properties have the potential to add components of DeFi (decentralized finance), which would allow smart contracts and automated transactions in the classic monetary environment. Such would confuse the boundary between conventional finance and cryptocurrency innovation. Conclusion On a worldwide scale, exploring the possibility of using central bank digital currencies is a breakthrough in monetary history. Since central banks are transitioning to implementation and not research, today’s choices will define future generations’ financial fabric. Technical, economic and social factors are complicated and require serious negotiations. The central banks must coordinate innovation and stability, efficiency and privacy, nationalistic interest and international collaboration. The risk is significant – inadequate design or launching of CBDCs might destroy the public confidence in digital money and INGRESS – redraw the process of financial innovation. The following period of CBDC development will play a critical role in defining whether crypto can make good on its potential to become more efficient, inclusive and resilient money. With pilot programs in full swing and the horse being put at the launch starting gates, the world awaits to be surprised as to whether CBDCs will bring about a whole new era of digital finance or endure the pressures that have traditionally undermined monetary innovations. The CBDC revolution cannot be summed up in terms of technologies – it is the redefinition of the infrastructure that modern economies rely on in the digital world. To succeed, it will be necessary to achieve levels of collaboration between central banks, governments, technology providers and consumers never-before-seen to design digital currencies that satisfy the interests of all parties to the system without undermining the stability and trust that are the hallmarks of the modern monetary system.

However, the facts tell a different story. To set the record straight: a judgment has already been made, and Ripple has decided to drop its cross-appeal. But as for the SEC’s appeal, it hasn’t officially been dismissed yet. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel clarified that both parties still need to file formal paperwork to dismiss their appeals. While it seems certain this will happen, the SEC is still going through its internal approval process. When a social media user asked whether there’s a chance the SEC might vote to continue its appeal, Fagel explained that the SEC had already agreed to dismiss it as part of a prior settlement plan, though that plan was contingent on the court vacating an injunction, which didn’t happen. Now, there’s no reason for the SEC not to move ahead with dropping the appeal outright. They already voted to dismiss it (as part of a settlement contingent on the district court vacating the injunction, which the court declined to do). There is no reason for them not to vote to just dismiss it outright at this point, and they will do so. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 1, 2025 Once the SEC completes its internal vote, both the SEC and Ripple will jointly file papers to officially end the appeals. At that point, the district court’s judgment will take full effect, and this long-running legal chapter will finally close. This clarification follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s recent statement, where he announced, “Ripple is dropping our cross-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop theirs, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all and focusing on what’s most important — building the Internet of Value.” Until the formal paperwork is filed, the appeals process technically remains open, though all signs point to its official end in the coming weeks.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-02 03:55:40

For Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders, the answer has become painfully urgent. Recent data shows that nearly 65% of SHIB investors are currently sitting on losses, despite the token’s once-historic surge during the 2021 bull market. That has prompted both retail and smart-money investors to shift their attention elsewhere. And right now, the meme coin attracting the most buzz and momentum is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) —a rising star that’s rapidly becoming the go-to asset for those looking to get in early on the next potential Dogecoin or Shiba Inu-style run. The SHIB Dilemma: Big Name, Fading Gains According to data from the IntoTheBlock website, the number of Shiba Inu wallets holding losses has skyrocketed. A total of 65% of all investors are currently in the red, putting them in the lead. In contrast, only 32% of investors are seeing a profit at this level, and 3% are sitting at breakeven, meaning the coins last moved around the price at which the meme coin is currently trading. While the established trend suggests that the Shiba Inu price will continue to decline, pushing more investors into losses, the CoinCodex prediction indicates a change in the tide. The 5-day prediction sees an 8.8% rise to $0.00001278 in the new week. The unfortunate reality is that those seeking a 10x or 50x return are unlikely to find it by continuing to hold SHIB. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE)—a new meme coin that’s not only grabbing headlines but is backed by real innovation and growing investor confidence. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Where Momentum Meets Utility What sets Little Pepe apart from the typical meme coin hype machine is its unique blend of viral branding and genuine blockchain utility. It’s not just another frog-themed token hoping to catch lightning in a bottle. Instead, LILPEPE is being developed as the first-ever Layer 2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins, offering unmatched speed, low fees, and resistance to sniper bots. The platform also includes a meme coin Launchpad—a tool that allows new meme tokens to be created and launched seamlessly within the LILPEPE ecosystem. This positions LILPEPE not just as a token, but as the backbone of the next wave of meme-based cryptocurrencies. And the response has been massive. Within just weeks of launching its presale, Little Pepe has already sold out two stages, raised over $2.3 million, and is now in its third presale phase, priced at $0.0012 per token. Demand continues to surge as the project confirms listings on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs), with plans also underway to debut on the world’s largest crypto exchange. This move could send its price soaring once it hits the open market. Viral Growth Amplified by Massive Giveaway LILPEPE’s clever marketing isn’t just about technical innovation. The team has also launched the “Little Pepe $777K Giveaway”, which will see 10 winners each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. This high-stakes promotion has sent engagement through the roof and attracted tens of thousands of new eyes to the project. This level of attention—and the momentum behind it—mirrors the early stages of previous meme coin breakouts. However, with a clearer roadmap, a solid tech foundation, and a price point still under a penny, LILPEPE appears to be the next logical move for those seeking to escape stagnant assets like SHIB. A Better Entry Point for Bigger Gains What makes LILPEPE especially attractive to new and seasoned crypto investors is its favorable risk-to-reward profile. With SHIB, most of the massive growth has already occurred, and further upside is limited unless it achieves mainstream adoption on a massive scale. Meanwhile, LILPEPE offers early entry into a project with a small market cap, high community energy, and a real chance to lead a meme coin renaissance. As meme coins remain a central fixture in the speculative side of crypto, LILPEPE offers everything investors look for—low cost, high upside, technical uniqueness, and the kind of virality that turns small buys into massive windfalls. Conclusion: Don’t Be Late Again Many watched from the sidelines as Dogecoin and SHIB turned small investments into six- or seven-figure fortunes. By the time most people jumped in, the significant gains had already been lost. Now, the market is giving investors another chance—but this time, it’s coming from Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . With SHIB struggling and 65% of its holders underwater, now might be the best time to make a switch. LILPEPE is not just hype—it’s backed by innovation, already selling out presale stages, and gearing up for major listings that could send it to the moon. If you missed the first meme coin revolution, LILPEPE might just be your shot at redemption.

Among the best altcoins to buy now, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out alongside Bitcoin, XRP, and Polkadot. Each has its strengths, but analysts agree MAGACOIN FINANCE is the standout pick for this quarter. Investors searching for new altcoins 2025 are shifting capital away from older large-cap tokens into more community-driven options. MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding this trend thanks to its strong political narrative, capped supply, and transparent development roadmap. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Altcoin to Buy Now MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about altcoins in 2025. Many experts rank it as the top pick on every altcoin watchlist Q3 2025. Its grassroots community and narrative-driven approach give it staying power in a crowded market. Every phase of its presale sold out faster than expected. Investors trust its third-party smart contract audit and fixed supply — rare qualities that make it more than just another meme coin. Analysts often compare MAGACOIN FINANCE to early-stage Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but with a major difference: it has a clear governance plan and real-world utility. This decentralized political meme coin combines meme energy with practical tools for holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Bitcoin: Price Prediction and Momentum Bitcoin remains the market leader and sets the tone for the entire sector. Experts expect Q3 2025 to mirror the pattern seen in previous post-halving years like 2013, 2017, and 2021 — strong rallies driven by rising on-balance volume and tighter Bollinger Bands. Some forecasts put Bitcoin’s price between $130,000 and $135,000 by the end of the quarter. A key driver for Bitcoin is the inflow of institutional money through spot Bitcoin ETFs. New filings, including the Trump Media & Technology Group’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, have added fresh liquidity. This momentum often spills over into trending altcoins. While Bitcoin benefits from its post-halving narrative and ETF tailwinds, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings something different — a political meme coin with utility, capped supply, and strong community governance. Both coins have momentum but attract different types of investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE, XRP, and Polkadot: Analyst Highlights XRP has been on the move since Ripple finalized its SEC settlement on June 28, 2025. The resolution confirms XRP is not a security in secondary sales. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the SEC will drop its appeal, clearing the path for more adoption. Many forecasts put XRP’s Q4 2025 price around $5.05, assuming steady growth. But some traders want bigger upside potential. They’re rotating funds into MAGACOIN FINANCE for its early-stage narrative and political edge. Polkadot is still a top choice for developers. Its Q3 outlook is supported by new parachains, the XCM v5 upgrade, and elastic scaling, which attract more builders to its ecosystem. Analysts expect Polkadot to trade between $3.50 and $4.70 this quarter. However, newer coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing attention away from legacy projects. Its mix of meme coin appeal, political messaging, and capped supply makes it one of the top altcoins to watch in Q3 2025. Final Thoughts Bitcoin and XRP prove older coins still have plenty of fuel in the tank. Polkadot remains key for Web3 developers. But for those hunting the next big narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the standout in the altcoin market Q3 2025. It combines meme power, political energy, and real governance under one roof — a mix that makes it more than just hype. Investors who missed out on early DOGE and SHIB see MAGACOIN FINANCE as their second chance. Keep an eye on this political meme coin as traders look for fresh stories and top altcoins to buy now.

With the XRP price today maintaining key support and the Binance Coin (BNB) market outlook showing signs of fatigue, some traders are waiting for a stronger directional signal. In the middle of this consolidation, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces new momentum. Its BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release gives buyers one last shot at a price tier once thought to be off the table at $0.0016 until August 11. That figure isn’t just symbolic; it opens a route to outsized ROI, with BlockDAG’s confirmed $0.05 launch already in sight. With $326 million raised and 23.4 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s traction raises a critical question: is this the top decentralized crypto to watch now? Binance Coin (BNB) Market Outlook: Slowing Development Sparks Concern The Binance Coin (BNB) market outlook reflects an unusual mix of steady prices and weakening fundamentals. While BNB maintains price levels without sharp declines, development metrics tell a different story. Recent figures show a significant 85% drop in smart contract activity, a signal that core developer interest may be fading. This loss of momentum is compounded by limited expansion outside traditional DeFi. Sectors like gaming and NFTs remain underrepresented in the Binance ecosystem, leaving the broader network reliant on a single vertical. Despite steady interest in derivatives, technical indicators for BNB remain neutral with little upward or downward pressure. Unless the Binance Coin ecosystem sees renewed development and broader use cases, this stagnation could continue. The current market calm may be less of a foundation and more of a pause that needs intervention to avoid further drift. XRP Price Today: Holding Key Levels with Room to Move The XRP price today continues to hover above critical support, suggesting underlying strength despite recent volatility. After peaking at $2.2191, XRP has settled into a tight range, now trading just above $2.180 and maintaining position above the 100-hourly simple moving average. Traders are watching a key resistance level at $2.220. A successful push above this threshold could set the stage for further gains, with targets in sight at $2.250 and $2.320. Technical indicators are leaning bullish, with the MACD trending upward and RSI holding comfortably above 50. Still, downside risks remain if XRP slips below $2.1450. For now, the XRP price today is showing signs of resilience, giving the market reasons to stay engaged while looking for a clearer breakout. BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Offer Brings Back $0.0016: High Potential, Low Entry BlockDAG has redefined what late-stage presale participation can look like. Through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the project has opened access to the early pricing of $0.0016, a level that hadn’t been available for many batches. This is a bold move for a presale already nearing completion. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, the upside from this reactivated price tier could reach 29x. This isn’t just speculation; BlockDAG’s previous presale rounds delivered a 2,660% gain from Batch 1 to Batch 29. The structure rewards consistent contributors, those engaging with testing, content creation, referrals, and presale activity. With more than $326 million already committed and over 23.4 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is quickly nearing the finish line. The opportunity is time-sensitive, available only until August 11. After that, this pricing window will close for good, locking future buyers into higher tiers. This is not a general discount; it’s a targeted opportunity crafted for users ready to engage with the ecosystem on a deeper level. The result is a presale that doesn’t just keep pace, it accelerates toward its final stage with a compelling invitation to serious participants. To Summarize As the market holds steady, the contenders for top decentralized crypto are becoming easier to identify. XRP maintains technical support and solid trading behavior. The Binance Coin (BNB) market outlook stays stable, but its growth narrative is weakening. In contrast, BlockDAG continues to push forward. Its BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release revives a rare pricing level that blends affordability with massive upside. With over $326 million raised and a capped supply structure, the economics are designed to benefit those who act early. This final-stage offer closes August 11, and with momentum growing, BlockDAG may be the standout for those seeking growth in a market still waiting for its next major move.

TRX recorded a 0.6% gain during the same timeframe, bringing its current trading price to $0.2788. Zooming out to a weekly view, TRON has posted a 2.4% increase, standing out among major assets amid an otherwise lukewarm market. This movement has caught the attention of on-chain analysts tracking deeper signals in the TRON ecosystem. According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, TRON’s long-term price behavior reveals increasing resilience and a diminishing susceptibility to extreme volatility. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It Reduced Drawdowns Point to Market Maturity In a recent post titled “TRX Drawdowns Highlight Growing Resilience,” Darkfost shared drawdown analysis as evidence that TRON has become structurally more stable over time. He explained that drawdown metrics, which measure the peak-to-trough decline in an asset’s price, can serve as a reliable tool for identifying strategic market entry points. Darkfost highlighted four major TRX drawdown periods since 2020: a 61% drop in March 2020, a 70% fall in June 2021, a 55% decline in January 2022, and a 40% decrease in January 2025. Each of these correction phases was followed by significant recoveries. However, the drawdown depth has consistently decreased with each cycle, a development the analyst interprets as a sign of increasing investor confidence and capital retention in the TRON network. “With TRX now trading around $0.27, each of these drawdowns has proven to be profitable in hindsight,” Darkfost noted. He added that the trend suggests that TRON is evolving into a more stable asset class with stronger market positioning. Contributing to this stability is the ongoing flow of capital and growing ecosystem usage, particularly for stablecoin transactions. TRON has become a dominant layer for Tether (USDT) transfers, and data from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn supports this view. TRON Surpasses Ethereum in Stablecoin Settlement In a separate post, Maartunn reported that TRON processed a record $23.4 billion in daily USDT transfers on June 25, 2025, an all-time high for the network. This figure significantly surpasses the $9.9 billion handled by Ethereum on the same day, highlighting the divergence between the two blockchains. Maartunn pointed out that TRON has outperformed Ethereum in USDT transfer volume since mid-2022, noting that the gap between the two networks continues to widen. “The chart doesn’t just show a record; it highlights the growing gap between TRON and Ethereum,” he wrote. While Ethereum’s USDT activity has declined roughly 39% since its November 2024 peak, TRON remains in an upward trend. This transition signals a growing role for TRON as the main settlement layer for Tether transactions, while Ethereum appears to be shifting toward other use cases.

Each is flashing key technical signals that suggest possible breakouts this summer, fueled by a mix of fundamental drivers and growing investor confidence. But while these large-cap names show strength, a new project is quietly rising in the background. MAGACOIN FINANCE, an early-stage altcoin, is now emerging as a potential breakout leader—one that’s capturing trader attention as capital rotates beyond the usual names. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Newcomer Drawing Attention While AVAX, ADA, and XRP dominate headlines, a different kind of momentum is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE . Still in its presale phase, the project has already raised over $10 million and is rapidly gaining visibility across trading forums and Telegram communities. Built around scarcity-focused tokenomics and a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a community-driven altcoin positioned for high-risk, high-reward upside. It’s not chasing Layer-1 utility or DeFi dominance—instead, its early success mirrors the trajectory of politically themed meme tokens that have outperformed in past cycles. Early buyer activity continues to grow, and analysts are beginning to label the project a potential breakout contender for 2025. As traders rotate out of more saturated altcoins in search of untapped opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched closely as a fresh narrative with strong traction. Avalanche (AVAX): Subnet Growth and Enterprise Use Cases Drive Momentum Avalanche has shown impressive resilience, consolidating near $18–$19 while quietly building momentum behind the scenes. Analysts are closely watching the $22–$23 range, with many citing bullish accumulation and ongoing partnerships as strong indicators of a coming breakout. AVAX is also gaining recognition for its subnet architecture—a scalable model attracting real-world finance and gaming applications. If these adoption trends accelerate through Q3, price targets of $60–$90 are on the table, especially with institutional attention starting to return to scalable Layer-1 ecosystems. Cardano (ADA): Smart Contract Strength Could Power a Move Toward $2 Cardano is once again building technical strength just below the $1 mark, and bulls believe a clean break above this level could open the door to a rally toward $2. Recent smart contract upgrades, along with increasing DeFi activity and the Hydra scaling solution, are adding fuel to the bullish case. Viewed as a long-term hold, ADA’s appeal lies in its lower volatility and consistent development roadmap. With potential ETF approval and ecosystem growth in the pipeline, ADA could regain momentum heading into the latter half of the year. XRP: Bullish Pattern Forms as Regulatory Catalysts Clear XRP remains one of the most watched altcoins on the market—and for good reason. It’s currently consolidating above $2.10, forming a cup-and-handle pattern that has historically preceded major price surges. Resistance near $2.20–$2.40 remains the final hurdle before a potential run toward $3–$5. With whale wallets growing, ETF listings in Canada, and renewed optimism around regulatory clarity in the U.S., XRP is increasingly seen as a prime breakout candidate. Analysts argue that if the resistance levels break, XRP could quickly reclaim price territory last seen in the 2017–2018 cycle. Final Thoughts: A Three-Coin Rally and One Emerging Dark Horse Avalanche, Cardano, and XRP are all aligned technically and fundamentally for strong moves heading into Q3. Breakouts above key resistance levels could trigger fast rallies, especially as market optimism returns. But for those willing to look beyond the familiar, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly earning a spot on high-upside watchlists. In a cycle where narrative, momentum, and early positioning often drive outsized returns, this newcomer may be one of the quietest but most promising breakout stories of the year.

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $2.120 zone. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.320 zone. The price is now trading below $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend losses if it fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to extend gains above the $2.320 resistance and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below the $2.250 and $2.220 support levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below the $2.150 level. A low was formed at $2.148 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.327 swing high to the $2.148 low. The price is now trading below $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.20 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.220 level. The next resistance is $2.2380. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.327 swing high to the $2.148 low. A clear move above the $2.2380 resistance might send the price toward the $2.2850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.30 resistance or even $2.320 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.40. Fresh Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.150 level. The next major support is near the $2.120 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.120 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.020 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.150 and $2.120.

While established tokens remain core to many portfolios, analysts are increasingly focused on high-upside presales that offer exponential return potential before listings go live. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, BlockDAG, Qubetics, and Mutuum Finance are capturing the attention of forward-looking investors preparing for the next bull run. With structural innovation, token scarcity, and strategic momentum, these presales are rising to the top of analyst forecasts for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Structured for Strategic Ascent MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the highest-conviction opportunities in 2025. Analysts highlight its scarcity-based supply model and rapidly intensifying presale activity as key indicators of its breakout potential. Early entry rounds have moved quickly, and accumulation patterns suggest growing interest from investors seeking asymmetric upside. With clearly defined token mechanics and strong momentum building around anticipated listings, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being positioned as a rare early-phase opportunity in a market where such setups are increasingly hard to find. Previous phases sold out instantly, and sentiment continues to grow as market participants look for tokens that combine cultural relevance with structural strength. Qubetics: Final Presale Phase Nears Completion Qubetics is wrapping up its final presale phase with strong demand and a sharp reduction in total supply — down from 4 billion to 1.36 billion. This shift toward scarcity has elevated investor expectations, especially with an official listing planned on a top-tier exchange. Built as a cross-chain Web3 ecosystem, Qubetics aims to unify fragmented blockchain tools under one development platform. Its QubeQode IDE and aggregator model are designed to streamline decentralized app creation across multiple chains. With its security audit nearing completion and a clear roadmap toward launch, analysts are projecting major upside, particularly if exchange listings align with current adoption momentum. Mutuum Finance: DeFi Innovation Backed by Solid Fundamentals Mutuum Finance has earned attention as one of the few presale projects delivering on both innovation and investor confidence. The platform combines decentralized lending, a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, and a Layer 2 scaling model — all within a transparent, CertiK-audited ecosystem. Investor incentives and smart tokenomics have propelled the project to raise significant capital in a short time. Analysts are watching closely as each presale phase narrows the gap between entry and launch valuation. With forecasts projecting multi-fold returns, Mutuum Finance is becoming a serious contender for investors targeting the DeFi resurgence in 2025. BlockDAG: Speed, Scale, and Adoption in Motion BlockDAG blends the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graph technology with Proof of Work security, creating a network capable of supporting high-volume decentralized applications. The project’s no-code dApp builder and X1 mobile mining app are already attracting mass user activity. With over 23 billion tokens sold and exchange listings lined up, BlockDAG is one of the largest active presales in the market. Analysts cite its consistent price growth and expanding ecosystem as signals of a potential long-term infrastructure play. Final Thoughts: The Power of Early Positioning As 2025 approaches, the smartest capital is flowing into projects that combine strong fundamentals with early-stage access. MAGACOIN FINANCE leads that charge, with analysts calling it a top-tier opportunity based on structural scarcity and growing market traction. Presales like Qubetics, Mutuum, and BlockDAG are also riding high on utility, ecosystem innovation, and strategic rollouts — setting the stage for powerful moves once listings commence. For investors seeking more than momentum — those looking to be early, strategic, and aligned with what’s next — the time to act is narrowing.

The recent pullback has placed ENA within a cautious range between $0.2507 and $0.2659 over the past day, with price action stalling below key resistance as a sizable token unlock looms. According to Tokenomist data , roughly 40.63 million Ethena ( ENA ), valued at $10.34 million, are set to be unlocked today, July 2. This represents 0.67% of the current circulating supply. With only 39% of the total 15 billion ENA maximum supply in circulation so far, today’s unlock is part of a broader vesting schedule that could introduce periodic supply pressure. Such unlocks could boost sell-side liquidity and affect sentiment in the short run, but Ethena’s prior unlocks have been absorbed without lasting downside. However, the timing creates a degree of uncertainty, especially given the drop in trading volume and interest in derivatives prior to the event. You might also like: Ethena Labs and Securitize enable 24/7 swaps between USDtb and BlackRock’s BUIDL In the last 24 hours, volume has dropped by almost 29% to $115 million, while Coinglass data indicates that derivatives volume has dropped 37.7% to $316.75 million. Open interest has also eased slightly to $319.06 million, reflecting some trader hesitation ahead of the unlock. On the technical side, ENA is still under pressure . Most major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, flash sell signals. The token’s persistent trading below its 20-day EMA and SMA suggests weak short-term momentum. The relative strength index is approaching oversold territory at 41.4, but it is still neutral. ENA price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While momentum and MACD indicators show early signs of recovery, they are not strong enough to reverse the overall trend. The Bollinger Bands’ narrowing indicates less volatility. The price is still trading near the lower band, which is a warning sign that may indicate a sharp breakdown or a reversal based on volume confirmation. If ENA manages to hold above the $0.25 support zone and absorbs today’s token unlock without a breakdown, renewed volume could drive a move back toward $0.28. A close above that level would open the path to retest the $0.30–$0.32 range. Failure to hold $0.25, particularly under continued low volume and increased token circulation, could expose ENA to further downside. A decisive break below $0.245 would weaken the structure, putting the $0.22–$0.23 zone in focus and dragging sentiment with it.

This move means, for the first time in nearly five years of legal battles between the SEC and Ripple, everyday investors in the U.S. can now gain exposure to XRP through a regulated investment product on the New York Stock Exchange. The Grayscale ETF includes multiple major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP, making it the biggest multi-token crypto ETF in the market. Many in the crypto space are calling this a massive moment for XRP, hinting it could soon clear the path for individual spot XRP ETFs to be approved next. Biggest news from today IMO… xrp will now be accessible to everyday investors via Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF. After nearly 5yrs of SEC vs Ripple litigation. And now anyone will be able to easily access xrp in SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Full circle moment. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 2, 2025 Crypto analysts and XRP supporters are celebrating as this approval signals a shift in the SEC’s stance toward XRP. Around 17 more XRP ETFs are reportedly waiting for SEC approval. While the exact number isn’t officially confirmed, multiple applications are in line, and today’s development has significantly increased the hope that more approvals could start rolling in over the coming months. [post_titles_links postid=”477484″] Why does this matter? Until now, U.S. investors faced hurdles buying XRP through exchanges due to regulatory uncertainty and the ongoing Ripple-SEC lawsuit. With this new ETF, investors can simply buy shares backed by XRP, just like any traditional stock, without dealing with crypto exchanges or wallets. This move could bring massive inflows of capital into XRP, as institutional investors and traditional traders who previously avoided direct crypto exposure can now safely invest in it. At the same time, XRP’s price chart is tightening, showing signs of a breakout setup. If Bitcoin rallies and market conditions remain strong, XRP could soon make a major move upward.

This breach, affecting platforms like Replicandy and Peplicator, saw attackers mint and dump NFTs, crashing floor prices. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in the crypto market, with its presale in Phase 5 at $0.03, having raised $11,400,000 and sold over 575 million tokens to 12,600 holders. Offering a robust DeFi lending model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) projects a 60x surge to $1.8 by late 2025, drawing investors seeking the next big crypto. This contrast highlights the crypto market’s volatility and potential. Pepe projects plummet after exploit Investigators are tracing a sophisticated hack that drained $1 million from NFT projects tied to Matt Furie. ZachXBT reports that attackers, likely North Korean IT workers, seized smart contract control, minting new NFTs and selling them to crash prices. Projects like Replicandy and Peplicator lost $310,000, with funds funneled through wallets to exchanges like MEXC. Suspect developers, including one posing as US-based, showed red flags like Korean language settings and Asian time zone activity. This breach exposes vulnerabilities in hiring practices within the crypto market. Consequently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a secure alternative, bolstered by rigorous audits and transparency. Mutuum Finance presale surges forward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03, a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01. Over 50% of this phase is filled, signaling a narrowing window to buy at this rate. Phase 6 will bring a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, with the launch set at $0.06, ensuring a 100% ROI for current buyers. Having raised $11,400,000 and attracted 12,600 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) showcases strong investor confidence. Moreover, its CertiK audit, scoring 95.00 with no vulnerabilities, solidifies its reliability in the crypto market, making it a top crypto to buy now. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing the meaning of DeFi by establishing a dual-lending system: Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer. A smart contract, implemented on the Peer-to-Contract system, will help to change the interest rate in a real-time manner thus making the lending and borrowing stable. On the other hand, Peer-to-Peer lending allows direct negotiable transactions that suit volatile assets. This flexibility supports the needs of different users in order to create more transparency and efficiency. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, minimizing depegging risks compared to algorithmic alternatives. This stablecoin will streamline transactions and boost liquidity. Furthermore, the team’s Layer 2 strategy aims to cut gas fees, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a scalable, user-focused platform in the crypto market. Security and rewards drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, achieving a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The team has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering rewards across four severity tiers to enhance security. Additionally, a leaderboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. These initiatives underscore Mutuum Finance’s focus on trust and community engagement, making it a standout crypto investment. Future value in focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised for significant growth, with its $0.06 launch price guaranteeing a 2x return from the current $0.03. Analysts project a climb to $1.8 by late 2025, a 60x increase, driven by its lending model, stablecoin, and Layer 2 advancements. The crypto market is buzzing with interest as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility over speculative projects like those tied to Furie’s exploit. Investors are flocking to secure tokens before Phase 6’s price jump. Join the presale now to capitalize on this promising crypto investment, blending security, innovation, and high-yield potential.

This downturn was largely driven by investor apprehension surrounding the upcoming US trade, as U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he is not thinking about extending a current pause on reciprocal tariffs that is set to expire on July 9. Japanese equities were hit especially hard, shedding significant value after comments from President Donald Trump cast doubt on the possibility of a trade agreement with Tokyo. Gold hovered above $3,330 per ounce on Wednesday, holding an over 1% gain from the previous session. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.23% to around 39,500, while the broader Topix Index declined 0.6% to 2,814 on Wednesday, marking a second consecutive day of losses for Japanese equities. The Japanese yen weakened toward 144 per dollar on Wednesday, pulling back from over three-week highs. The selloff came after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 35% tariff on Japanese imports, aiming to pressure Tokyo into making trade concessions. Tokyo aims for a ""win-win"" trade deal with the U. S., according to Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko Aoki, despite President Trump's threats of high tariffs on Japanese goods. Trump has expressed frustration over Japan's low purchases of American rice and cars, warning that tariffs could increase to 30% or 35%. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.04% to around 3,450, while the Shenzhen Component dropped 0.5% to 10,420 on Wednesday, paring gains from the previous session. China's President Xi Jinping on Tuesday vowed to tighten oversight of aggressive price-cutting by domestic firms, amid growing concerns over persistent deflation. Market focus is now shifting to the upcoming Politburo meeting later this month. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.68% to 24,202 in early Wednesday trade, snapping a three-session losing streak as markets reopened after Tuesday’s holiday. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.05% trading around 83,676 in early deals on Wednesday, after gains in the previous session, as traders remained cautious amid ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Market participants also continued to monitor trade negotiations between India and the US ahead of President Donald Trump’s July 9 deadline for tariffs, as well as developments in the Middle East. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.74% to around 8,554 on Wednesday, after pausing in the previous session, boosted by rallies in mining and real estate stocks. The Australian dollar weakened to around $0.656 on Wednesday, retreating gains from the previous session, as weaker-than-expected domestic data dampened investor sentiment. The Ai Group Industry Index for the Australia's manufacturing sector fell to -29.3, extending its downward trend. The Ai Group Australian Industry Index edged down by 1.8 points to -11.9 in June, indicating continued contraction. Australia’s retail sales grew by 0.2% month-on-month in May, after a flat reading in April but fell short of forecasts for a 0.4% rise. In addition, building permits rose by 3.2% month-over-month to 15,212 units in May 2025, less than anticipated, adding to concerns about a weakening economic outlook. Private house approvals in Australia climbed by 0.5% month-over-month to an eight-month high of 9,454 units in May 2025. On the downside, Australian pizza chain Domino’s dropped up to 19%, after announcing CEO Mark van Dyck’s departure. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed after the Senate passed President Trump’s sweeping budget bill, with investors also keeping an eye on trade developments. Looking ahead, investors are focused on ADP’s private payrolls report due Wednesday and the closely watched June jobs report on Thursday for further clues on the strength of the labor market and potential Fed policy moves. U.S. stock futures held steady on Wednesday, following a mixed performance in the previous session: Dow +0.23% ; S&P 500 +0.28% ; Nasdaq +0.37% .

The first short-term track approach, dubbed “Pontes”, will connect DLT platforms with Eurosystem TARGET services, to be launched by 2026. The track will ensure the free flow of cash, securities and collateral across Europe. Meanwhile, before the launch of the Pontes pilot in Q3 2026, the ECB will consider DLT-based trial and experiment requests. Piero Cipollone , Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, believes that although DLT and tokenization are relatively nascent, they “are likely to offer new ways of improving the settlement of financial transactions.” “The decision is in line with the Eurosystem’s commitment to supporting innovation without compromising on safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures,” the release read. Long-Term ‘Global Level’ Approach The ECB has laid out its long-term track plan, “Appia,” which will facilitate operations at the global level. The bank noted that this approach will analyse more DLT-based solutions and collaborate with public and private stakeholders. “This will also include international operations, such as foreign exchange settlement, and engagement in international initiatives,” the ECB noted in a report outlining the results of the exploratory work. The ECB is yet to define the precise approach to be followed in the long-term, it added. However, the central bank will focus on “improving the efficiency and competitiveness of current financial markets for securities and payments, without compromising on safety.” ECB Aims to Finish Digital Euro Prep Phase by October Cipollone said last year that the bank is looking to finish the preparation phase of the digital euro by October 2025 . However, lawmakers are hesitant to trust the central bank, raising doubts about whether a digital euro could debut . The ambiguity came after an outage that occurred with the TARGET 2 (T2) payment system early this year. Big transactions are held in the T2 payment platform. The ECB is looking to finish its digital euro testing phase by October 2025. #ECB #DigitalEuro #CBDC https://t.co/7KtBkaP5QW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 11, 2025 The bank already conducted exploratory work on new techs like DLT between May and November 2024. During the trial, 64 participants conducted over 50 experiments. Piero Cipollone added that Pontes and Appia approaches will be built on these technologies, given their recent developments and how they have sparked growing interest across the financial sector.

Announcing that he had purchased another BTC in a post on his social media account, Kiyosaki admitted that this investment may have been wrong, but stated that he stood by his long-term belief. “I bought another Bitcoin today. I could be wrong. But it wouldn’t be the first time. I still believe that Bitcoin will reach $1 million soon. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong; but if I’m right, I’m a winner, not a loser,” he said. While Kiyosaki predicted that the BTC price could reach $1 million in the future, he added that people should not act impulsively with the herd mentality. Related News: Ripple-backed Company's $100 Million XRP Announcement Causes a Stir Kiyosaki also touched on the difference between the investment approaches of the rich and the poor in his post. According to him, while the poor focus on prices, the rich look at the amount of assets they have: “I don't really care about the current price of gold or silver. What matters is how many ounces of gold or silver I have. Same goes for Bitcoin. I look at the price, but what I really focus on is how many Bitcoins I have.” Kiyosaki stated that he bought his first Bitcoin at $6,000 and wanted to buy more with all the “fake money” he had at the time. Reiterating his $1 million BTC target for 2030, the famous economist said, “Those who will be rich in the future will be those who have the most Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

This milestone happened amid broader shifts in the regulatory landscape, especially as the SEC is reportedly exploring a more simplified listing process for crypto ETFs. This could potentially allow issuers to skip the lengthy 19b-4 application in favor of a faster S-1 filing. Analysts also raised the odds of approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs to 95%, with decisions expected by October. Bloomberg experts also expat a near-term green light for a basket-based crypto ETF and elevated approval chances for other altcoins like Dogecoin and Cardano.Overall, the SEC’s evolving stance could be the start of a new era of crypto investment access through traditional markets. Grayscale Gets ETF Nod Grayscale secured approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Digital Large-Cap Fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The fund is composed of the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization according to the CoinDesk Five Index. Bitcoin (BTC) holds the dominant share at 80.2%, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at 11.3%. Solana (SOL) makes up 2.7%, XRP accounts for over 4.8%, and Cardano’s ADA holds a 0.81% weighting. A crypto ETF is a type of investment fund that tracks the price of one or more cryptocurrencies and trades on traditional stock exchanges, just like stocks. Instead of buying and holding the actual crypto, investors can gain exposure to its price movements through the ETF. Some ETFs hold the cryptocurrencies directly (spot ETFs), while others track futures contracts or indexes. Crypto ETFs make it easier and safer for traditional investors to access the crypto market without needing a crypto wallet or exchange account. Approval from the SEC Historically, Grayscale’s crypto trusts offered investors arbitrage opportunities by exploiting the premium or discount to the fund's net asset value (NAV), largely due to their lock-up periods and the absence of in-kind redemptions. However, as the firm continues to convert these trusts into ETFs, such profit windows have gradually closed. According to Grayscale, the goal of the newly approved ETF is for its share value to track the weighted prices of the underlying digital assets, minus any expenses and liabilities. Grayscale is known for pioneering crypto investment vehicles, and provided a gateway for traditional investors to gain digital asset exposure without directly holding cryptocurrencies. This conversion is a turning point for both the firm and the broader industry as it reflects a trend toward more regulatory maturity and mainstream acceptance. The company’s efforts to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF were initially blocked by the SEC, which started a legal battle that began in June of 2022. After more than a year, a federal judge sided with Grayscale in August of 2023 by declaring the SEC’s denial “arbitrary and capricious.” This victory allowed Grayscale to proceed with its ETF plans. Today, its Bitcoin ETF has the highest expense ratio on the market at 1.5%, but also ranks as the leading revenue-generating Bitcoin investment product. SEC Eyes Faster Crypto ETF Process The United States SEC is also reportedly considering a streamlined listing process for crypto ETFs. This could significantly reduce the time and complexity involved in bringing these products to market. According to crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett , the SEC may allow ETF issuers to bypass the traditional 19b-4 application—which is a form that currently must be submitted before listing a financial product on a public exchange. Instead, issuers would file a form S-1, which initiates the registration process. After a 75-day review period, if the SEC does not raise objections, the issuer could proceed to list the ETF without the usual back-and-forth negotiations with regulators. This potential change could be a huge step in modernizing the SEC's approach to crypto products and improving efficiency in the listing process. While the proposed structure could drastically reduce approval timelines and regulatory friction, details about eligibility criteria for the cryptocurrencies that might qualify are still unclear. The lack of specificity on which digital assets could be fast-tracked under the new system leaves room for speculation and continued lobbying from fund managers and industry participants eager to see a broader range of crypto ETFs approved. As it stands, the SEC has not confirmed these changes, and ETF issuers are still awaiting formal clarification. The conversation around ETF innovation took place at a time when the SEC already approved the first-ever staked crypto ETF in the US. The REX Shares Solana ETF (STAK) recently received the green light, and incorporates staking rewards into its investment model. This approval could pave the way for other altcoin and staking-enabled ETFs, especially as the SEC now faces a wave of pending applications involving Litecoin, Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, and Ethereum. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart , these proposals face final deadlines later in 2025, with some potentially reaching a decision as early as October. If the SEC moves forward with the simplified listing process, it could unlock a whole new era of crypto investment vehicles. Analysts Up Altcoin ETF Approval Odds Meanwhile, analysts raised the likelihood of SEC approval for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin spot ETFs to 95%. Bloomberg ETF experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart shared the updated forecast in a post on X , and pointed to the increasing momentum and regulatory developments that could lead to a wave of approvals in the second half of 2025. The same 95% probability was also assigned to the potential approval of a spot ETF tracking a basket or index of crypto assets, which could be granted as early as this week. While the final decision on the Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs is expected by October, optimism continues to build across the altcoin ETF landscape. Other cryptocurrencies are also in the mix, with analysts assigning a 90% approval probability to spot ETFs for Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche. These decisions are slated for the fourth quarter.. More niche projects like Sui and Tron have lower chances of approval in the near term, with odds at 60% and 50%, respectively, for the ETFs filed by Canary Capital. These figures suggest that while the mainstream altcoins may soon achieve ETF status, lesser-known tokens face a more uncertain regulatory path. On the other hand the SEC’s hesitancy around staking is still very evident, especially after it delayed its decision on whether the Bitwise spot Ether ETF could include staking features. The regulator also postponed its decision on approving the Osprey Bitcoin Trust for trading. Despite this cautious approach, the wave of upcoming ETF approvals could be the start of a transformative period for altcoin exposure in traditional financial markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|SOL|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-02 05:29:44

In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont has signed a bill into law prohibiting state agencies from accepting or holding cryptocurrency, marking a clear policy shift away from public sector crypto engagement. Meanwhile, Swiss regulators have directed Swissquote, the parent company of the crypto-enabled Yuh app, to address a surge in phishing and impersonation scams, which have targeted users through hundreds of fraudulent websites. Connecticut Draws a Line on State Crypto Holdings with New Law Signed by Governor Lamont Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont has signed into law a bill that formally restricts the state government’s use and custody of digital assets. House Bill 7082, which was passed by both chambers of the state legislature earlier this year, was signed on Monday and is set to take effect on Oct. 1. Draft of House Bill 7082 (Source: LegiScan ) The new law specifically prohibits Connecticut’s government from “accepting or requiring payment in the form of virtual currency” and from “purchasing, holding, investing in or establishing” any form of cryptocurrency reserve . In doing so, Connecticut becomes one of the first US states to formally enshrine such restrictions, even as the federal government and other states push forward with bold pro-crypto initiatives. A Rebuff to the National Momentum The legislation, introduced by state Representative Jason Doucette in February, effectively places a hard stop on the integration of digital assets into state operations. It arrives in sharp contrast to federal initiatives introduced by President Donald Trump, including an executive order earlier this year establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” These national-level directives seek to expand the federal government’s digital asset holdings through both purchases and seizures, positioning the US as a potential global leader in state-backed crypto reserves. Connecticut’s decision to move against digital asset integration comes at a time when a political rift is emerging around cryptocurrency policy, both at the federal and state levels. President Trump’s close ties to crypto industry figures and his broader push to make the US a hub for blockchain innovation has amplified these divisions. While Connecticut now stands firmly against state-level digital asset reserves, other states are moving in the opposite direction. Texas Governor Greg Abbott approved a bill in June to create a state-managed cryptocurrency reserve. Similarly, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed legislation in May to establish a state-held Bitcoin treasury, and similar proposals are being explored in states like Wyoming and Florida. Meanwhile, several other states have attempted but failed to enact similar legislation in 2025. Legislative efforts in South Dakota, Montana, and Pennsylvania to create Bitcoin reserves were unsuccessful, reflecting ongoing concerns over volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and ideological opposition. This divergence of strategy among the states suggests that digital asset policy is becoming a new axis of partisan and regional disagreement, akin to previous battles over cannabis legalization, environmental regulation, and healthcare. Beyond banning crypto use in state transactions and reserves, HB 7082 also updates licensing rules for crypto-related businesses operating in Connecticut. The legislation includes additional compliance requirements for money transmission licensees dealing in digital assets, further tightening the regulatory framework in a state known for its cautious approach to fintech innovation. These changes could have implications for crypto exchanges and fintech startups seeking to operate in Connecticut, potentially leading to an outflow of crypto-related business to more permissive jurisdictions. A Fork in the Road for State-Level Crypto Policy With the passage of HB 7082, Connecticut joins a minority of US states opting to explicitly restrict government engagement with digital assets. Whether this conservative posture becomes a model for other skeptical legislatures or a footnote in a larger wave of crypto adoption remains to be seen. The disconnect between state and federal strategies, and between states themselves, highlights the current disjointed regulatory landscape of the US crypto ecosystem. As the industry continues to mature—and as political influence shapes its future—Connecticut’s stance may be viewed either as prudent risk management or as a missed opportunity to participate in the evolving digital economy. With the bill set to take effect in October, Connecticut officials now face the task of enforcing this policy in an era where digital assets are increasingly embedded in commerce, finance, and even politics. Swiss Regulators Crack Down on Phishing Surge Targeting Crypto Platform Yuh Meanwhile, Swiss regulators have ordered Swissquote, the parent company of the crypto-friendly Yuh app, to take urgent action to reduce the rising tide of phishing and impersonation scams plaguing its trading platforms. The directive follows revelations that more than 600 fraudulent websites mimicking Swissquote's services were uncovered in the first half of 2025 alone. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), which oversees the country's banking and financial services sector, issued the order after identifying a significant uptick in fake login portals and phishing attempts, particularly targeting users of the Yuh app—a platform known for its accessibility to digital asset trading alongside traditional financial services. Phishing and impersonation schemes have long been a thorn in the side of fintech and crypto firms. However, the sophistication and frequency of these attacks have sharply increased in 2025, driven in part by artificial intelligence tools that enable scammers to generate more convincing fraudulent content at scale. Swissquote CEO Marc Buerki confirmed that while none of the company’s internal systems had been breached, the rise in external impersonation and spoof websites poses a serious threat to user trust and platform integrity. Yuh App in the Crosshairs The Yuh platform has become one of the most targeted crypto-enabled applications in Switzerland, according to FINMA. Launched as a joint venture between Swissquote and PostFinance, Yuh allows users to invest in both cryptocurrencies and stocks, making it a popular gateway for newcomers to the crypto space. Its growing user base and digital footprint have also made it an attractive target for cybercriminals, who replicate the app’s branding and user interface to lure unsuspecting users into handing over their login credentials. Bloomberg reports that many of the fake sites detected so far used social media promotions and spam emails to redirect users to phishing pages designed to look like official Swissquote and Yuh login portals. Swissquote is far from alone in facing this digital onslaught. According to cybersecurity firm CertiK, phishing, social engineering, and other scam vectors have accounted for approximately $2.1 billion in crypto losses so far in 2025. The majority of these losses stem not from technical flaws in blockchain code but from users being tricked into giving up sensitive information. Crypto losses in Q3 2025 by scam vector (Source: CertiK ) CertiK's Q3 2025 report reveals that address poisoning, fake support messages, and deepfake videos are also becoming increasingly popular with scammers. A particularly alarming case occurred in April, when a $330 million theft—one of the largest in crypto history—was carried out against an elderly investor through a targeted social engineering campaign. Even experienced professionals are not immune. In June, Mehdi Farooq, a venture partner at crypto investment firm Hypersphere, admitted that he had lost most of his life savings to a highly convincing phishing scam. Farooq’s public disclosure sparked widespread discussion in the crypto community about improving security awareness and incident response. FINMA’s Expectations In its notice to Swissquote, FINMA emphasized that financial institutions operating in the digital asset space must go beyond securing internal systems—they must actively monitor and respond to external impersonation threats that could harm users and damage trust in the financial system. The regulator expects Swissquote to enhance its threat detection capabilities, improve user awareness programs, and cooperate with cybersecurity firms and international watchdogs to take down malicious websites more quickly. Failure to comply could result in penalties or further regulatory scrutiny.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-02 05:30:00

Trump had mentioned that he would not extend that deadline for nations to strike new trade deals. He again cast doubt on reaching a pact with Japan but expressed confidence that a trade agreement with India could be finalized in time. MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index of stocks outside Japan dipped 0.23% in early trade, pulling back from the record high reached last week. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 reduced 0.78%, weighed down by losses in technology stocks. In Taiwan, the tech-heavy Taiex index has retreated by 0.31%, and South Korea’s Kospi has also lost ground by 0.87% at press time, mirroring a pullback in U.S. technology firms that had enjoyed strong gains in June. On Tuesday, data showed U.S. job openings climbed in May, underscoring the resilience of the labor market. Investors are now focused on the closely watched payrolls report, which is due to be released on Thursday. This report could offer fresh clues about the timing of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The central bank wants to wait and see how tariffs will affect inflation Jerome Powell , facing pressure from President Trump to lower rates right away, mentioned that the central bank may “wait and learn more” about how tariffs might affect inflation before easing policy. Markets currently price in about 64 basis points of rate cuts in 2025, with just a 21% chance of a reduction in July. That outlook has kept downward pressure on the greenback. The euro was last trading at $1.1799, right under Tuesday’s three-and-a-half-year peak. The yen held steady at $143.52 a dollar. “Any disappointing economic data can prompt further dovish repricing of FOMC rate cuts and another round of USD selling,” Carol Kong from Commonwealth Bank of Australia stated. She added that the newly passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act, as well as ongoing trade developments, could further undermine confidence in the US economy and weaken the dollar. Attention has also turned to Trump’s hefty tax and spending package, which analysts estimate will incur $3.3 trillion in federal debt. The measure passed the Senate by the slimmest of margins and now moves to the House of Representatives to get an approval. Despite raising fiscal concerns, bond markets barely flinched. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.245%, after touching a 2 months low during the last session. Rising fiscal pressures, coupled with trade uncertainties along with questions about the US interest rate path, have driven investors to seek alternatives to American assets. Many fear that erratic trade policies may dent U.S. growth prospects. The dollar stays weak at multi-year lows while gold eased As a result, the dollar has slid more than 10% so far this year, marking its worst performance in the first half of a year since 70s. The dollar index that tracks the greenback against six other currencies stood around 96.649. It is the lowest level since March of 2022. In commodity markets, gold eased at $3,332.19 an ounce as it jumped 1 percent in the prior session. The metal has rallied 27% in 2025 amid safe-haven buying.

Santiment reported that crypto markets are showing a clear bullish bias following the Senate’s narrow approval of the bill. According to their update, Bitcoin miners could benefit from the bill’s inflationary implications, while Elon Musk has expressed frustration over the legislation. Despite its controversy, the bill is fueling optimism across the crypto sector. Bitcoin Could Shine Amid Soaring Debt The bill would significantly raise the U.S. national debt, triggering inflation concerns. Historically, investors have looked to Bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and a weakening dollar. If inflation picks up or trust in the dollar slips, Bitcoin could see strong demand as a digital safe haven. Ethereum and Altcoins in the Mix Market analyst Marius suggests that Ethereum and infrastructure-based altcoins may also benefit, as investors seek higher-risk, high-reward assets. However, speculative tokens and meme coins could underperform, especially in a cautious market environment. Additionally, the bill’s broader macroeconomic impact plays a significant role. With over $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $1.2 trillion in entitlement cuts, without any revenue offsets, the bill is expected to increase inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy. This strengthens the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies. [post_titles_links postid=”477412″] Crypto Reaction Crypto analyst Crypto Dad highlights that the newly passed “Big Beautiful Bill” offers a significant boost to the crypto sector. Notable crypto-friendly provisions include: A de minimis exemption for transactions under $300 simplifies everyday crypto usage. Tax deferrals and simplified rules for staking and mining rewards make participation more attractive. Combined with the inflationary pressure from massive tax cuts and spending hikes, Bitcoin’s narrative as an inflation hedge is gaining traction. As regulatory clarity improves and macroeconomic risks rise, crypto markets, especially Bitcoin, appear well-positioned for an upward move. Institutions May Stay Cautious While retail interest is likely to grow, institutions may remain cautious. Rising debt and the potential for Federal Reserve tightening could lead big investors to wait for more clarity on interest rates and inflation trends.If the bill passes the House with its crypto-friendly provisions intact, it could spark a broader rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select altcoins. However, the final impact will hinge on the Federal Reserve’s next move and whether inflation pressures lead to another rate hike.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” is President Donald Trump’s massive $3.3 trillion spending bill, recently passed by the U.S. Senate. It’s a comprehensive package encompassing tax cuts (making 2017 provisions permanent), entitlement cuts, and other provisions, and is now awaiting approval from the House. How could the “Big Beautiful Bill” benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? The bill is expected to significantly increase the U.S. national debt, leading to inflation concerns. Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar, so increased inflationary pressure could boost its demand as a digital safe haven. Select altcoins may also benefit as investors seek high-reward assets. What role does the Federal Reserve’s policy play in the final impact of this bill on crypto markets? The final impact of the “Big Beautiful Bill” on crypto markets will heavily depend on the Federal Reserve’s next moves. If inflation pressures intensify due to the bill’s spending and tax cuts, the Federal Reserve might consider another interest rate hike, which could influence crypto market dynamics and institutional investment.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-02 05:30:08

The announcement was made on July 1, after underwriters in Bit Digital’s recent public offering fully exercised their option to buy an additional 11.25 million shares. In total, the company issued 86.25 million shares, with net proceeds amounting to $162.9 million after deducting fees and estimated offering expenses. Bit Digital confirmed it will use the funds to acquire Ethereum ( ETH ). Bit Digital, which trades on Nasdaq under the ticker BTBT, has been building its Ethereum strategy since 2022. The company now runs one of the largest Ethereum staking platforms operated by a public company. Its platform includes validator infrastructure, custody services, and yield tools for ETH staking. The raise is one of the largest single-purpose ETH capital raises by a public company to date. It demonstrates that companies are starting to view Ethereum as more than just a technology platform and as a balance sheet asset.

Ethereum gives companies like Bit Digital a way to earn onchain yield while gaining exposure to one of the most widely used assets in crypto. Other companies have adopted similar strategies. SharpLink, a Nasdaq-listed company backed by ConsenSys and led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, raised $425 million in May to acquire more than 176,000 ETH. Reports now show its total ETH holdings have reached over 202,000 ETH after latest purchases . BioNexus Gene Lab also adopted Ethereum as its main treasury asset earlier this year and published a whitepaper outlining the benefits of ETH staking, These companies are among a group of about 40 participants listed under the Strategic ETH Reserve, a tracking initiative for corporate and organizational ETH holders. More than 1.2 million ETH, totaling about $3 billion, are now held in company reserves. The top five participants, Ethereum Foundation, SharpLink, PulseChain Sac, Coinbase, and Golem, hold more than 70% of all known ETH reserves under the SER list.

This surge, fueled by a 50% spike in on-chain activity, signals renewed investor enthusiasm. The price of Ethereum stands at $2,400 and above as its blockchain is busy giving a clue of a potential increase in price. Meantime, another crypto asset gaining popularity in the market is an Ethereum-based altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with a price of 0.03. With its presale in Phase 5, over $11,400,000 raised, and more than 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders, MUTM is positioned for significant growth. Could this altcoin ride Ethereum’s wave to hit $4 post-launch? Let’s explore. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction in its presale’s fifth phase, with tokens priced at $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the opening phase’s $0.01, reflecting strong investor demand. Phase 5 is over 50% filled, signaling limited time to secure tokens at this price. The next phase will raise the price by 16.7% to $0.035, and the official launch at $0.06 guarantees a 100% return on investment. Over $11,400,000 has been raised, with 575 million tokens sold to 12,600 holders. Furthermore, Mutuum Finance has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities, bolstering investor confidence. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping the decentralized finance category and introducing the dual lending system. Peer to Contract model would automate the lending through the implementation of smart contracts and provide dynamic interest rates to be stable. Meanwhile, the Peer to Peer model links borrowers and lenders through a direct connection, and it is perfect with volatile assets that require special terms. The flexibility makes Mutuum Finance different in the crypto market and focuses on user control and transparency. Also, the panel is working on a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum that minimizes the risks of depegging in comparison with algorithmic currencies. Consequently, this stablecoin will enhance liquidity and simplify transactions, making Mutuum Finance a robust DeFi solution. Security and rewards drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing security through a CertiK-verified audit, achieving a 95.00 score with zero vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The team has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering $50,000 in USDT rewards across four severity tiers. This ensures ongoing protocol safety. Moreover, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway , split among 10 winners, each receiving $10,000. Participation requires a $50 presale investment and completing specific quests, like submitting a wallet address. Additionally, a leaderboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, incentivizing long-term commitment. These initiatives highlight Mutuum Finance’s focus on community and trust. Ethereum’s surge fuels altcoin potential Ethereum’s daily transactions have climbed to 1.729 million, with active addresses jumping from 345,406 to 593,637 in days. This uptick reflects growing investor activity, potentially pushing Ethereum’s price higher. However, sell volume slightly outpaces buys, with $90 million in sales against $78.15 million in purchases. Despite this, the crypto market remains optimistic, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) poised to benefit. Analysts predict MUTM could reach $4 post-launch, a 13,233% increase from its current $0.03 price, driven by its innovative lending and stablecoin features. As Ethereum thrives, MUTM’s Ethereum-based infrastructure positions it as a top crypto investment. Looking ahead with confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a standout altcoin in a bustling crypto market. Its presale success, with over $11,400,000 raised and 575 million tokens sold, underscores its appeal. The guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, coupled with a projected $4 price target, makes it a compelling choice. The CertiK audit, Bug Bounty Program, and $100,000 giveaway further solidify its credibility. As Ethereum’s daily transactions hit an 18-month high, Mutuum Finance leverages this momentum, offering investors a chance to join a promising DeFi project. Don’t miss out—participate in the presale today to secure your stake in this rising altcoin.

The most significant drop occurred in February, when it lost 26.1% of its value. Despite this downturn, discussions around Shiba Inu’s long-term potential remain active within the crypto community, particularly regarding the possibility of reaching a price of $0.001. Community Outlook on SHIB’s Price Ambition Although SHIB’s recent performance has raised skepticism about its prospects, the idea of the token hitting $0.001 continues to gain traction among its supporters. Various analysts and influencers have presented differing viewpoints on whether this milestone is achievable. In late 2024, market analyst LuckSide Crypto pointed to increased whale accumulation and low resistance levels as factors that could drive upward momentum for SHIB. Shortly after, technical chartist Crypto Sheriff observed a breakout from a descending triangle formation and forecasted multiple price targets, with $0.001 as the final objective. As of the latest data, the token is trading at $0.00001120, representing a 3.67% decrease in the last 24 hours. For the token to rise to $0.001, it would need to appreciate by approximately 8,750% from its current level. This would involve removing two zeros from its price and setting a new all-time high. While such growth may appear extreme, some projections suggest it is theoretically possible if SHIB appreciates by 30% annually. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Estimating the Timeline Based on 30% Yearly Growth If Shiba Inu’s price increases by 30% annually starting in 2025, projections indicate it could reach approximately $0.00001469 by July 2026, $0.00002482 by 2028, and $0.000042 by 2030. Continued growth at this rate would see the token rise to around $0.0001199 by 2034, surpassing the $0.0001 threshold, followed by $0.000579 by 2040. By July 2042, SHIB is expected to reach approximately $0.000978, bringing it within close range of the $0.001 target. Based on this projection, SHIB would reach the $0.001 mark around August 2042, roughly 17 years from now. Alternate Projections from Analysts While the 2042 estimate follows a conservative and consistent growth model, some sources predict a shorter timeline . Analysts from Changelly believe the $0.001 target could be achieved between 2035 and 2039, depending on market conditions. Additionally, Telegaon estimates that SHIB could potentially hit this price level by 2035. Although SHIB’s current valuation and circulating supply present considerable challenges, the projected price target is not entirely out of reach over the long term, especially under favorable market conditions and consistent yearly growth.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/macro-analyst-says-buying-xrp-at-2-is-like-buying-bitcoin-at-50-heres-why/,"While the broader cryptocurrency market continues to fluctuate, some analysts argue that investors are overlooking the long-term significance of specific digital assets. Despite price stagnation, a growing number of XRP advocates believe the asset is significantly undervalued at current levels. For those following its development closely, this period may represent a strategic opportunity rather than a moment of retreat. Institutional Positioning and Market Design Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist and a well-known advocate for XRP, recently highlighted the token’s potential in a post on X that challenges mainstream sentiment. He likened buying XRP at $2 to acquiring Bitcoin when it was just $50, but with a major distinction. He believes that XRP already benefits from the utility, regulatory frameworks, and institutional infrastructure that Bitcoin lacked during its early stages, suggesting it could experience more significant growth. Aljarrah pointed to the nature of current market volatility, suggesting that the asset is currently undervalued for a reason. According to him, this volatility is “engineered to exhaust retail participants” and remove short-term holders from the market. Aljarrah believes institutional players should reposition quietly ahead of major developments in tokenized finance. In his view, the instability that discourages individual investors is being used by larger entities to secure control over key digital assets before widespread infrastructure activation. $2 $XRP is like buying Bitcoin at $50 but with utility, regulation, and infrastructure already in place. Volatility is engineered to exhaust retail participants, shake out weak hands, and allow institutions to reposition before the tokenized infrastructure is fully activated. pic.twitter.com/WnhUX75LJw — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) June 30, 2025 Some believe institutions like BlackRock are looking to accumulate XRP at current low prices , and investors who sell their tokens to these institutions will miss out on potentially life-changing profits when the price starts to grow. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Strategic Advantage Unlike many speculative cryptocurrencies, XRP has made notable progress in building partnerships and securing use cases , especially in cross-border payments. Its integration into enterprise and banking systems has given it a level of credibility that few digital assets have achieved. For this reason, analysts such as Aljarrah view XRP’s current price of $2.22 not as a reflection of its actual value but as a byproduct of larger strategic forces at play. With the tokenization of traditional financial assets becoming an increasingly prominent trend, Aljarrah sees XRP as a foundational layer for what is to come. XRP is already dominating the tokenization market , and Aljarrah suggests that the groundwork has already been laid. The volatility, in this context, serves as a strategic delay, giving institutions time to accumulate before the system shifts to widespread adoption.

Bitcoin had hit $109,000 and a $2.1 trillion market cap, driven by ETF inflows and favorable macro trends. However, H1 2025 saw a sharp slowdown. The total market cap fell to $2.4 trillion mid-cycle before recovering to $3.31 trillion by July 1. Bitcoin experienced a major drawdown but rebounded to a new ATH of $112K, supported by steady institutional buying from Strategy and Metaplanet. Macroeconomic pressures added to volatility. The Fed held rates steady at 4.25%-4.5%, with inflation at 2.4%. Geopolitical tensions, including U.S.-China tariffs and Middle East unrest , kept investors on edge. Despite this, crypto showed resilience, backed by regulatory clarity and rising demand from emerging markets. Investor sentiment was highly volatile. The Fear & Greed Index plunged from 94 in December to 10 in March but recovered to 64 by July. Still, sentiment remains range-bound between 40 and 65, signaling lingering caution in the market.

Ethereum continued to lead as the primary stablecoin settlement layer, though TRON and Solana gained traction as emerging launchpads. Crypto ETF Performance US Bitcoin Spot ETF recorded a cumulative net inflow of $48.97 billion. Total net assets for Bitcoin ETFs reached $134.11 billion as of June 30.

DeFi Sector Overview Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi rose from $86 billion to $112 billion by June 2025, signaling increased adoption and capital inflow. AAVE dominated the lending market with over 60% share and $16 billion+ in borrows. The AAVE V3 protocol continued to attract collateral, and anticipation around the V4 launch further boosted confidence. DEXs like Uniswap, Jupiter, and PancakeSwap saw increased network activity, resulting in higher fees and supporting DeFi’s rebound. HYPE’s fee-free DEX enhanced user activity across multiple chains. Lending protocols from HYPE also gained traction during H1 2025. AAVE lending yields ranged between 5% to 8% APY, down from 2024 due to higher TVL and reduced risk premiums. Important News & Events In H1 2025, nearly 334 – 344 hacks caused $2.2 – $2.5B losses, including Bybit’s $1.5B breach . ProCap and Grant Cardone’s firms entered the Bitcoin treasury race, intensifying corporate crypto adoption.

Norway is exploring a crypto-mining ban, while a different country, Kazakhstan , is exploring a national crypto reserve. Metaplanet and Strategy aggressively expanded their BTC holdings, marking a corporate treasury shift toward Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. Ripple dropped its cross-appeal in the SEC case, paving the way for a near-end to the multi-year legal battle. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), backed by Trump family ties, expanded USD1 stablecoin on BNB Chain , boosting RWA and DeFi interest. Final Outlook For H2 2025 Despite all the ups and downs, H1 2025 proved just how resilient the crypto market has become. Bitcoin surged to a new high of $112K, and the overall market rebounded to $3.31 trillion. Now, if bullishness increases, then Bitcoin may hit $180,000 – $200,000, Ethereum $5,000 – $6,000, by year-end 2025. This growth could be fueled by future Fed rate cuts, ETF inflows, and the Stablecoin Payment Act. Moreover, DeFi is also regaining momentum with $112B in TVL, and institutional interest keeps rising. With altcoin ETFs on the horizon and big players entering the space, H2 2025 could be the setup for a major breakout, which could possibly take the total crypto market cap toward the $4 – $5 trillion mark.

Among the top altcoins to buy now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming investor favourite alongside heavyweights like Bitcoin, Solana, and Stellar. As Stellar’s DeFi market continues to face uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE Chapter 1 gains attention from Solana and Bitcoin traders. As capital rotates from older large-cap plays into newer, narrative-driven projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing investors with its capped supply, grassroots political story, and clear roadmap — qualities that are becoming harder to find in today’s meme-heavy market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Chapter 1 is Drawing Attention MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. It sits at the top of many analysts’ watchlists because it uniquely blends meme coin energy with political branding and actual governance. Every stage of its presale sold out faster than forecasted, reflecting growing trust in its third-party audited contracts and fixed supply. Unlike typical meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE plans to offer real tools for holders and a decentralized political community, giving it staying power beyond speculative hype. Early investors compare it to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu but with a critical difference: MAGACOIN FINANCE has a clear path for utility and governance, not just viral appeal. That makes it an attractive option for traders seeking explosive narratives with a foundation for long-term growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Stellar: Big Partnerships but Unclear DeFi Path Stellar (XLM) has had a strong quarter with Mastercard integrating Stellar into its Crypto Credential framework and PayPal preparing to launch PYUSD stablecoin on Stellar. XLM’s price may surge to $1 if it continues to gain strong buying demand in Q3 and Q4. However, XLM’s reversal might Source: Coingecko However, despite new smart contract upgrades under Protocol 23, Stellar’s role in DeFi remains uncertain, leading some liquidity to chase higher-potential narratives like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Traders seeking clearer governance and capped tokenomics find MAGACOIN’s model appealing by comparison. MAGACOIN FINANCE vs Solana & Bitcoin: Major Momentum vs Early-Stage Potential Solana and Bitcoin dominate the market this quarter. Solana’s new U.S. ETF, booming DeFi volumes over $275 billion last week, and a 156% YTD stablecoin surge cement its leadership, though SOL now struggles around resistance channels. Bitcoin, meanwhile, hovers with record ETF inflows and U.S. reserve plans pushing dominance past 65%. But while these giants attract institutional money, traders chasing bigger multiples are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early-stage launch, strict capped supply, and political meme narrative make it a prime candidate for outsized returns — offering the kind of fresh upside Bitcoin and Solana may no longer match this cycle. Final Thoughts Bitcoin continues to dominate with ETF-driven demand and a robust macro story. Solana is still the leader in DeFi and stablecoins, while Stellar’s big partnerships show promise but also raise questions on long-term DeFi traction. For investors chasing the next big meme-political narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. It’s a top choice among investors as it combines viral energy with fixed supply, external audits, and real community governance, giving early backers a rare shot at serious upside. As traders search for the top altcoins to buy now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists and its chapter 1 is drawing major attention.

In a fascinating development that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate treasuries, design software powerhouse Figma has reportedly made a significant foray into the digital asset space. According to disclosures stemming from Figma’s SEC filings for its initial public offering (IPO), the company holds a substantial $70 million worth of spot Bitcoin ETF shares. This revelation, initially brought to light by Bitcoin Magazine on X, is far more than just a financial footnote; it’s a powerful indicator of burgeoning institutional Bitcoin adoption and a potential blueprint for future corporate crypto investment . What Does Figma’s Bitcoin ETF Holding Signify for Corporate Finance? For many, Figma is synonymous with innovative design and collaborative creativity. Yet, this news positions the company as a forward-thinking entity in the financial realm as well. The decision to allocate a considerable portion of its assets to Bitcoin ETF shares is not a casual one. It suggests a calculated move to diversify and potentially enhance its treasury holdings. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, which can introduce complexities related to custody and security, investing in a regulated ETF offers a more familiar and accessible pathway for traditional corporations to gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic choice by Figma highlights several key aspects: Accessibility and Ease: Spot Bitcoin ETFs simplify the process for corporations to invest in Bitcoin, bypassing the operational hurdles of direct cryptocurrency management. Validation and Legitimacy: A company of Figma’s standing making such an investment lends significant credibility to the digital asset market, signaling that Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a legitimate asset class. Diversification Strategy: It implies a conscious effort to move beyond traditional treasury assets, seeking new avenues for growth and inflation hedging in an unpredictable economic environment. Unpacking the Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Through ETFs The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. These funds, which directly hold Bitcoin, provide a regulated and straightforward investment vehicle for a wide range of investors, including institutions. For entities like Figma, this means they can participate in Bitcoin’s potential upside without the need to navigate the intricacies of crypto exchanges, private keys, or cold storage solutions. This convenience is a critical driver behind the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption . The trend extends beyond just tech companies. We’ve observed a growing interest from various sectors in incorporating digital assets into their portfolios. Figma’s significant holding through an ETF underscores a maturing market where regulated products are bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. Is Corporate Crypto Investment Becoming the New Norm? Figma’s bold move prompts a crucial discussion: are we on the cusp of a new era where corporate crypto investment becomes a standard component of treasury management? Historically, corporate treasuries prioritized stability and liquidity, focusing on cash, bonds, and money market funds. However, with persistent inflation concerns, low interest rates on traditional assets, and the search for enhanced returns, some pioneering companies are re-evaluating their strategies. The perceived benefits of integrating digital assets like Bitcoin into a corporate treasury include: Inflation Hedge Potential: Bitcoin’s finite supply is often cited as a strong argument for its role as a hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Growth and Innovation Alignment: For tech companies, investing in cutting-edge assets like Bitcoin can align with their brand identity as innovators and appeal to a tech-savvy investor base. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can offer diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. However, it’s essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a significant factor, and the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful navigation. Companies embarking on corporate crypto investment must conduct thorough due diligence and establish robust risk management frameworks. Insights from Figma’s SEC Filings: Transparency and Strategy The fact that this disclosure came via Figma’s SEC filings is particularly noteworthy. As a company pursuing an IPO, Figma is obligated to provide comprehensive transparency regarding its financial positions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and potential investors. The inclusion of $70 million in Bitcoin ETF shares in these public documents signifies a deliberate and well-considered financial strategy, rather than a speculative, off-the-books venture. It implies that Figma’s board and financial leadership have assessed the risks and rewards, deeming this investment a legitimate and integrated part of their overall financial planning. This level of transparency, mandated by SEC filings , sets a precedent. As more corporations explore or increase their exposure to digital assets, similar disclosures will likely become more common, offering invaluable insights into the evolving corporate approach to the crypto ecosystem. The Future Trajectory of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Figma’s substantial Bitcoin ETF holding is more than just a piece of news; it’s a significant marker for the increasing maturity and mainstream acceptance of the crypto market. It vividly illustrates how regulated investment products are paving the way for broader institutional Bitcoin adoption . As more companies observe the strategic moves of their peers, and as the regulatory environment continues to provide clarity, we could witness an accelerated pace of this trend. What should investors, market analysts, and industry watchers anticipate next? Increased Corporate Disclosures: Look for more companies, both in tech and other sectors, to reveal similar crypto asset holdings in their financial reports. Further Regulatory Clarity: Ongoing guidance and frameworks from regulatory bodies like the SEC could further de-risk and encourage mainstream corporate participation. Diversification of Crypto Products: The development of new, regulated crypto financial products beyond spot ETFs could open even more diverse avenues for corporate investment. Conclusion: A Pivotal Shift in Corporate Treasury Management Figma’s reported $70 million investment in Bitcoin ETF shares is a compelling testament to the growing confidence in digital assets within the corporate world. It powerfully underscores the strategic importance of regulated crypto products in facilitating broader institutional Bitcoin adoption and is actively reshaping traditional treasury management practices. This development is not merely about a design company venturing into crypto; it’s about a significant industry player making a calculated, transparent move that reflects a profound paradigm shift in corporate crypto investment . As SEC filings continue to unveil such insights, the narrative around digital assets in mainstream finance will undoubtedly strengthen, charting a new course for corporate financial strategies globally.

Around 131,000 BTC was accumulated by public companies in the second quarter, growing their Bitcoin balance by 18%. Meanwhile, ETFs accumulated 111,000 BTC with an 8% increase over the same period, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. More companies are “trying to benefit from the Strategy playbook in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment,” reported CNBC, citing figures from the treasury data provider. Increasing Value For Shareholders “The institutional buyer who is getting exposure to Bitcoin through the ETFs is not buying for the same reason as those public companies who are basically trying to accumulate Bitcoin to increase shareholder value at the end of the day,” Nick Marie, head of research at Ecoinometrics, told the outlet. Some recently updated entities: – Effex Solutions Kft. — 0.254 BTC – @KVcegcsoport — 1.079 BTC – @MARAHoldings $MARA — 49,940 BTC – Vanadi Coffee, SA $VANA.MC — 64 BTC CC @ferenckovacs , @HotelAuroraHU , @HotelAtlantisHu , @fgthiel pic.twitter.com/g6KYLODwKF — BitcoinTreasuries.NET (@BTCtreasuries) July 1, 2025 The researcher added that corporations don’t really care if the price is high or low, “they care about growing their Bitcoin treasury so they look more attractive to the proxy buyers.” He added that it isn’t much to do with macro trends or sentiment, but has become a different kind of mechanism that can push Bitcoin forward . According to Bitcoin Treasuries, there is currently 849,245 BTC, worth around $90 billion at current market prices, held by public companies. However, Saylor’s Strategy holds the lion’s share, or 70% of this total. Private companies hold 290,878 BTC, worth around $31 billion. 141 public and 42 private companies now hold 5.7% of the total circulating Bitcoin supply combined, while ETFs and other institutional funds hold around 7%, according to BT. Analysts suggested this corporate treasury trend may be a temporary ten-year arbitrage opportunity that could normalize as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and regulatory constraints on direct crypto investments ease. “You can think about this wave as a bunch of companies that are trying to benefit from this arbitrage.” Ethereum Next? Meanwhile, Ethereum could be the next asset that corporations target for their treasuries due to its ability to provide additional yields through staking. Just this week, Bitcoin network firm BitMine announced that it has taken on Fundstrat’s Tom Lee as Chairman, revealing plans for a $250 million private placement to accumulate Ethereum as part of the company’s treasury strategy. Publicly-listed gaming tech firm SharpLink also has a $460 million Ethereum treasury that it has staked for additional yields.

The company filed its Form S-1 filing with the SEC today. According to the data in the filing, Figma has approximately $69.5 million in spot Bitcoin ETF assets as of March 31, 2025. While this move was considered an indicator of the company's strategic interest in digital assets, Figma's board of directors also approved a new $30 million BTC investment plan with the decision taken on May 8, 2025. Within this scope, an equivalent amount of USDC was purchased and it was planned to convert these assets into Bitcoin.

The Company currently has no public market history. In the statements made, Figma's shares were organized into three different classes: Class A: One vote per share, Class B: 15 voting rights per share (Convertible), Class C: Non-voting shares (with limited conversion rights).

While digital assets often march to their own beat, major global economic shifts and political decisions, such as those related to Trump tariffs , can create a palpable sense of economic uncertainty that influences investor sentiment everywhere. Recently, a critical statement from former U.S. President Donald Trump has reignited concerns over international trade relations, specifically regarding Japan, casting a shadow that could affect everything from global supply chains to market stability. What are the Latest Developments in Trump Tariffs ? The news from JinSe Finance has brought a fresh wave of concern for global markets. U.S. President Donald Trump explicitly stated that he would not extend the looming July 9 deadline for trade talks. This firm stance immediately signaled a hardening position, particularly concerning ongoing negotiations. More strikingly, he hinted at the possibility of significantly higher tariffs on Japanese imports. The proposed rates could climb to an alarming 30–35%, a substantial increase from the 24% rate that was previously announced in April. This potential escalation underscores a willingness to use economic leverage aggressively, a hallmark of his previous administration’s trade policy. Such an increase would place immense pressure on Japanese industries, particularly the automotive sector, which heavily relies on access to the U.S. market. For businesses and consumers alike, the prospect of these higher Trump tariffs means a potential rise in costs for imported goods, which could translate into higher prices for everything from cars to electronics. This direct impact on consumer spending power and corporate profitability is a key area of concern for economists and market analysts. How Do Japan Trade Talks Fit into the Larger Picture? The current tensions surrounding Japan trade talks are not isolated incidents but rather a continuation of a broader strategy. Historically, the U.S. has often pointed to its trade deficit with Japan, particularly in the automotive sector, as a key area of contention. Japan, a major exporter of vehicles and auto parts to the U.S., finds itself in a precarious position. The U.S. has long sought greater market access for its agricultural products in Japan and has pushed for what it perceives as a more balanced trade relationship. The skepticism expressed by President Trump about reaching a deal with Japan suggests deep-seated disagreements remain. These negotiations are complex, involving intricate details about quotas, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers. For Japan, a failure to secure a favorable agreement, or worse, facing punitive tariffs, could significantly impact its economy, potentially leading to reduced exports, lower corporate profits for its major industries, and even job losses. This situation highlights the delicate balance of international economic diplomacy, where domestic political considerations often intertwine with global trade dynamics. Understanding the Broader Landscape of Global Trade Tensions The aggressive stance on Japan trade talks must be viewed within the wider context of global trade tensions that have defined much of recent geopolitical discourse. The U.S. has engaged in significant trade disputes with several key economic partners, most notably China, but also with allies in Europe and North America. The underlying philosophy often cited is to protect domestic industries, reduce trade deficits, and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. This approach, often termed ‘America First,’ prioritizes national interests above multilateral trade agreements and established global supply chains. The potential escalation of tariffs on Japan serves as a reminder that no major trading partner is immune from such pressures. This creates an environment where businesses struggle with long-term planning, as the stability of international trade rules becomes increasingly unpredictable. The ripple effect of these tensions extends beyond direct bilateral trade, impacting investor confidence, global growth forecasts, and the stability of international economic relations. Countries worldwide are closely watching these developments, as they could set precedents for future trade negotiations and disputes, potentially leading to a more fragmented global economy. What Does This Mean for Economic Uncertainty ? The immediate consequence of such trade announcements is often heightened economic uncertainty . Markets react swiftly to news that suggests disruptions to global trade, supply chains, or corporate profitability. Investors tend to become risk-averse, leading to increased volatility in stock markets, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and shifts in commodity prices. For businesses, this uncertainty translates into difficulties in forecasting demand, managing inventory, and planning investments. Companies that rely on international supply chains or export markets face the daunting task of adapting to potentially rapidly changing tariff landscapes. Moreover, sustained trade tensions can erode consumer confidence. If imported goods become more expensive due to tariffs, or if economic growth slows down, consumers may reduce their spending, further dampening economic activity. While cryptocurrencies are often seen as uncorrelated assets, they are not entirely immune to broader market sentiment. Periods of significant global economic uncertainty can lead to a ‘flight to quality,’ where investors might move towards traditional safe-haven assets, or alternatively, some might explore crypto as a hedge against traditional financial instability, albeit with higher risk. The overall sentiment of caution and unpredictability permeates the entire financial ecosystem, including digital assets. Assessing the Trade War Impact on Markets and Beyond The cumulative trade war impact can be profound and far-reaching. Beyond the immediate financial market reactions, sustained trade conflicts can lead to: Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies may be forced to reconfigure their supply chains, seeking alternative suppliers or manufacturing locations, which can be costly and time-consuming. Increased Consumer Prices: Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, which are often passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, reducing purchasing power. Reduced Corporate Profits: Businesses facing higher input costs or reduced export opportunities will see their profit margins shrink, potentially leading to job cuts or delayed investments. Slower Global Economic Growth: Trade is a key engine of global growth. Restrictions and uncertainties can stifle investment, innovation, and cross-border commerce, leading to a deceleration of the global economy. Geopolitical Strain: Beyond economics, trade disputes can strain diplomatic relations, making cooperation on other critical global issues more challenging. For investors and businesses navigating this landscape, diversification remains a crucial strategy. Staying informed about geopolitical developments, understanding their potential economic ramifications, and adopting flexible business models can help mitigate some of the risks associated with these ongoing global trade tensions . The ability to adapt quickly to changing policy environments will be key to resilience in an increasingly unpredictable global economy. Conclusion: Navigating the Turbulent Waters of Global Trade President Trump’s latest pronouncements regarding the July 9 deadline and the potential for significantly higher tariffs on Japanese imports underscore a persistent and aggressive approach to trade policy. This development adds another layer of economic uncertainty to an already complex global landscape. The implications for Japan trade , broader global trade tensions , and the overall trade war impact on markets are significant. As businesses and investors grapple with these challenges, the need for vigilance, strategic planning, and adaptability becomes paramount. The ongoing saga of international trade relations will undoubtedly continue to shape economic forecasts and market behaviors for the foreseeable future.

In a veto letter to House Speaker Steve Montenegro, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has blocked House Bill 2324, which aimed to establish a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund funded by cryptocurrencies seized through criminal forfeiture. Initially rejected by the House on May 7, the bill was revived after a narrow 16-14 Senate vote on June 19 when Republican Senator Janae Shamp, who had previously opposed it, filed a motion to reconsider. The measure returned to the House and passed on June 24 with a 34-22 vote, proposing that seized digital assets be overseen by the State Treasurer and allocated partly to the Attorney General’s office, the state’s general fund, and the reserve fund itself. In the veto letter, Hobbs argued that diverting these assets into a state-managed reserve fund could undermine local agencies’ willingness to participate in investigations and seizures, ultimately weakening enforcement efforts against crimes involving digital assets. “Today, I vetoed House Bill 2324. This bill disincentives local law enforcement from working with the state on digital asset forfeiture by removing seized assets from local jurisdictions,” she wrote.

However, Hobbs signed HB 2749 into law on May 7, establishing a reserve for unclaimed digital assets such as abandoned cryptocurrencies, airdrops, and staking rewards, managed by the Department of Revenue, thereby integrating digital assets into state finance without direct investment or reliance on criminal forfeiture funds.

According to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the designation targets Aeza Group’s entire cyber infrastructure, including affiliated entities and four individuals in leadership roles. The group allegedly offered bulletproof hosting services that allowed ransomware operators, malware distributors, and darknet vendors to operate with impunity by evading detection and law enforcement. The sanctions extend to Aeza International Ltd., a UK-based front company used to lease IP addresses to cybercriminals, as well as two Russia-based subsidiaries, Aeza Logistic LLC and Cloud Solutions LLC. OFAC also designated four senior executives, including CEO Arsenii Penzev and general director Yurii Bozoyan, both of whom were arrested by Russian law enforcement for their involvement in the darknet drug marketplace Blacksprut. Aeza’s infrastructure reportedly supported groups like Meduza and Lumma infostealer operators, BianLian ransomware, RedLine infostealer panels, and the now-defunct Blacksprut marketplace. These services allowed threat actors to steal sensitive data and siphon funds from global victims, including crypto users. You might also like: Russian-British dual national charged for sending crypto to fund pro-Russian militias in Ukraine The designated crypto address, hosted on the Tron blockchain, was identified as an administrative wallet used to receive payments for Aeza’s services. According to Chainalysis, the wallet processed over $350,000 in crypto and funneled payments through a third-party processor to obscure the financial trail and make tracing difficult. Investigators reportedly found that the wallet received direct payments from customers, including infostealer vendors, and routed illicit funds to various cryptocurrency exchanges. A separate report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs corroborated these findings, noting that the designated address showed “regular cash-out points to global cryptocurrency exchanges” and payment service providers. Analysts observed that the payment patterns aligned with known pricing for Aeza’s hosting services, suggesting that infostealer vendors and other threat actors were likely among the group’s customers. TRM also identified links between the wallet and other cybercrime platforms through intermediary addresses, including connections to the sanctioned Russian crypto exchange Garantex. TRM said that websites linked to Aeza and its affiliates had gone offline shortly after the designation was announced. “Today’s designations underscore a continuing trend of growing focus by authorities on disrupting not just individual threat actors, but also the infrastructure that enables their operations,” TRM said. “Aeza Group’s role in facilitating global cybercrime illustrates how infrastructure providers can serve as critical enablers—and potential pressure points—for law enforcement and regulators alike.” Earlier this year, OFAC led a coordinated effort with the United Kingdom and Australia to sanction another Russia-based bulletproof hosting provider, Zservers, for offering infrastructure to the LockBit ransomware gang. OFAC targets crypto wallets Beyond infrastructure, OFAC has also been focused on dismantling crypto-based cybercrime financing. In April, the agency sanctioned eight crypto addresses used by Yemen’s Houthi movement to fund arms procurement and terrorist activities. On-chain data showed over $45 million moved through Garantex in connection with these operations. Similarly, in March, OFAC blacklisted 49 crypto wallets tied to Nemesis, a darknet marketplace operated by Iranian national Behrouz Parsarad. The site was involved in trafficking fentanyl and other synthetic drugs, processing nearly $30 million in sales using Bitcoin and Monero before its seizure in 2024.

While Cardano (ADA) remains market staple due to its network stability and continued development updates, it’s Mutuum Finance that’s commanding headlines across alpha channels and analyst shortlists. If you’re still deciding what crypto to buy before June ends, Mutuum Finance may be the one you regret skipping. Cardano Mid‑Year 2025 Check-in Cardano (ADA) currently trades at about $0.56 with a slight down movement with the asset on an overall stable position as the rest of the market consolidates. The recent announcement of the Leios upgrade to the network carried out by the team, which includes a significant consensus overhaul to be completed in 2026, has brought newfound developer and investor attention, although ADA fell 3.8% early in the month with higher trading volume. Analysts are forecasting a potentially bullish July and basing it on historic mid-year seasonality and poor infrastructure milestones. ADA does not have the explosive growth of some newer DeFi tokens, but the solid underpinning provides insight into the new alternatives emerging so far, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Success More than $11.4 million and over 12,600 investors were drawn as part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. This kind of winds is the sign of the increased confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project and its long-term perspective. Mutuum Finance Development and $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched a USDT Bug Bounty in the amount of $50,000 with CertiK. It is a bounty that is all-inclusive in the sense that, it is partitioned based on the four variable levels of severity which include, critical, major, minor and low. It is also the way of presenting the fact that the project is attentive regarding security and transparency. Proven Dual-Lending Formula Transformation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to a mixed lending platform that will service the requirement of passive and active DeFi users. The need of any investor to want to earn passive income by depositing his USDT into smart contracts pools which guarantee stable passive income determined by its interest rate which goes up or down depending upon the changes in the market conditions is satisfied by its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. Moreover, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model lets the lenders and borrowers be as engaged as possible in resolving terms of a trade and do not require a third party. The model is more prevalent among the users of less stable assets. Leaderboard and 100,000 Giveaway Mutuum Finance is grateful to its early investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway where 10 lucky participants will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM. This celebrates the investors’ early belief in the project.

This isn’t just a name change; it’s a profound shift that solidifies their commitment to a robust Bitcoin treasury strategy , setting a new precedent for corporate digital asset allocation. This move highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. What’s Behind the Tao Alpha Rebrand to Satsuma Technology? The transition from Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology signifies more than just a fresh corporate identity. It reflects a strategic realignment with their core vision and an emphatic embrace of the evolving digital economy. Announced via a statement on Vox Markets, this rebrand positions the company at the intersection of cutting-edge AI development and astute financial management. The original name, “Tao Alpha,” hinted at a philosophical approach to achieving superior returns (“alpha”). The new name, “Satsuma Technology,” evokes a sense of precision, innovation, and perhaps even a subtle nod to the digital “satoshi” unit of Bitcoin, reinforcing their commitment to digital assets. This rebranding is a clear signal to investors and the market that the company is doubling down on its strategic direction, with a focus on both technological advancement and astute financial stewardship. This evolution is key to understanding their broader digital asset allocation framework. Unpacking Satsuma Technology’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The most compelling aspect of Satsuma Technology’s announcement is their reinforced Bitcoin treasury strategy . The company had previously signaled its intent to allocate a substantial portion—up to two-thirds—of its cash reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins. This latest statement confirms a deepening of that commitment, moving beyond mere exploration to active implementation. Why Bitcoin? For many corporations, holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering a potential appreciation for corporate reserves. Balance Sheet Optimization: For companies with excess cash, Bitcoin can offer a yield-generating or appreciation-focused alternative to traditional low-interest bank accounts, improving overall financial health. Innovation Alignment: Embracing Bitcoin strategically aligns a technology company with the broader trends of decentralization and digital innovation, enhancing its market position. Satsuma Technology’s decision to allocate a significant portion of its reserves, including stablecoins, indicates a balanced approach – leveraging Bitcoin for potential upside while using stablecoins for liquidity and stability within the digital asset ecosystem. This prudent approach to digital asset allocation aims to mitigate risks while maximizing opportunities. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Satsuma Technology is not an isolated case; their move is part of a larger, accelerating trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have famously integrated Bitcoin into their balance sheets, paving the way for others to follow suit. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Persistent inflation fears, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to seek alternative store-of-value assets beyond traditional fiat currencies. Institutional Infrastructure Maturation: The development of robust crypto custodians, regulated exchanges, and sophisticated financial products makes it safer and more feasible for corporations to acquire and hold digital assets. Competitive Advantage: Early adopters gain invaluable experience and potentially a first-mover advantage in navigating the rapidly evolving digital economy, setting them apart from competitors. For an AI software company , this adoption also sends a strong message: they are not just building the future of technology, but also actively participating in the future of finance. It positions them as forward-thinking, adaptable, and innovative. Implications for an AI Company Rebrand and Future Growth The combination of an AI company rebrand and a strong Bitcoin treasury strategy creates a powerful narrative for Satsuma Technology. It suggests a company that is not afraid to innovate on all fronts – from its core technology offerings to its financial management practices. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Brand Image: Positions Satsuma Technology as a leader in both cutting-edge AI development and forward-thinking digital asset integration, appealing to a broader market. Increased Investor Appeal: May attract a new class of investors specifically interested in companies with strategic exposure to the burgeoning crypto market and its growth potential. Strategic Flexibility: A robust digital asset treasury provides potential for future crypto-native initiatives, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, Web3 projects, or even blockchain-based AI applications. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s inherent price fluctuations can introduce volatility to the company’s financial statements, requiring careful risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often fragmented regulatory landscape for digital assets requires careful navigation and adherence to compliance standards. Public Perception: Some traditional investors and stakeholders may view significant Bitcoin holdings as overly risky or speculative, necessitating clear communication of the strategy. Despite these challenges, Satsuma Technology’s decision underscores a profound belief in the long-term value and utility of digital assets. Their strategic move could inspire other tech companies, especially those in the AI sector, to re-evaluate their treasury strategies and consider the strategic advantages of holding Bitcoin as part of a comprehensive digital asset allocation plan. The rebranding of Tao Alpha to Satsuma Technology and its deepened commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy marks a pivotal moment for the company and a notable development in the corporate world. By strategically allocating a significant portion of its reserves to Bitcoin and stablecoins, Satsuma Technology is not only securing its financial future against traditional economic headwinds but also boldly aligning itself with the burgeoning digital economy. This pioneering step by an AI software company reinforces the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , setting a compelling example for how businesses can innovate beyond their core products to embrace the future of finance. As Satsuma Technology embarks on this new chapter, its strategic vision could very well serve as a blueprint for other forward-thinking enterprises looking to optimize their digital asset allocation and embrace the opportunities presented by the decentralized future.

As artificial intelligence models rapidly consume vast amounts of data, a critical question arises: how can creators of valuable digital content ensure fair compensation for their work? Cloudflare, a major player in web infrastructure, is stepping into this breach with a bold new initiative that could redefine the relationship between websites and AI—a move that resonates deeply with the core principles of valuing digital assets. Understanding the AI Bot Scraping Challenge For decades, web publishers have operated on a relatively clear model: provide content, get indexed by search engines like Google, receive traffic, and monetize through advertising. This symbiotic relationship, while imperfect, formed the backbone of the online content economy. However, the meteoric rise of AI has introduced a seismic shift. Large language models (LLMs) and AI agents require immense datasets for training, leading to an explosion of AI bot scraping . These bots tirelessly crawl the web, hoovering up information, often without explicit permission or compensation to the original creators. Publishers are now grappling with a stark reality: Declining Referrals: While AI models benefit from their content, the direct traffic back to publisher sites—the lifeblood of their ad revenue—is diminishing. Cloudflare’s own data highlights this imbalance: for every referral Google’s crawler provided, it scraped websites 14 times. In stark contrast, OpenAI’s crawler scraped 17,000 times per referral, and Anthropic’s a staggering 73,000 times per referral. This data paints a clear picture of a system heavily skewed against content creators. Existential Questions: With Google Search traffic fading and AI chatbots rising, traditional business models for news and other online publishers are under severe threat. If users get answers directly from an AI agent, why visit the source website? Legal Battles vs. Licensing Deals: Some major publishers, like The New York Times, have resorted to lawsuits, accusing tech giants of unauthorized use of their copyrighted material. Others have pursued multi-year licensing deals, but these are often limited to large entities and their revenue impact remains uncertain. This uncontrolled, uncompensated scraping poses an existential threat to the very ecosystem that feeds AI. Cloudflare’s Vision for Content Monetization Cloudflare , which serves a significant portion of the internet’s traffic, has been actively working on solutions to empower publishers. Their CEO, Matthew Prince, hinted at a future where content distribution to AI companies would involve compensation. Now, that vision is materializing with the launch of “Pay per Crawl,” an experimental marketplace designed to bring control and fair content monetization back to the publishers. This initiative is built on a foundational shift: a move towards a “permission-based approach to crawling.” Cloudflare announced that new websites set up with their services will now, by default, block all AI crawlers. This means site owners must explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content. This seemingly small change represents a monumental shift, giving publishers “the default of control” rather than forcing them to opt-out. Several prominent publishers, including Conde Nast, TIME, The Associated Press, and Fortune, have already endorsed this default-block stance, signaling strong industry support for this new paradigm. Empowering Web Publishers: A New Era of Control The “Pay per Crawl” marketplace offers web publishers unprecedented granularity in managing how AI entities interact with their sites. Instead of a blanket block or open access, publishers can now choose from several options: Micropayment for Every Crawl: Publishers can set a specific rate—a micropayment—for every single “crawl” by an AI bot. This allows them to directly charge for the value their content provides to AI training and response generation. Free Access: Publishers can still choose to allow certain AI crawlers to access their content for free, perhaps for promotional purposes or to support specific AI initiatives they deem beneficial. Complete Blocking: The option to block all AI crawlers remains available, offering total control over their content’s accessibility. Cloudflare’s tools are designed to provide transparency, allowing website owners to discern the purpose of a crawler’s visit—whether for AI training data, AI search responses, or other uses. This level of insight is crucial for publishers to make informed decisions about their content’s value and distribution. The potential here is immense: a scalable business model for the AI era, where publishers can set their own terms and be compensated directly, rather than relying on indirect traffic or opaque licensing deals. The Mechanics of Pay per Crawl: Valuing Digital Content So, how does this revolutionary marketplace work? Cloudflare acts as the central intermediary, facilitating transactions between content creators and AI companies. Participant Requirements: Both AI companies and publishers must have Cloudflare accounts to participate in the “Pay per Crawl” experiment. Setting Rates: Within their Cloudflare accounts, both parties can define their preferences: publishers set the rates at which they are willing to sell a “crawl” of their content, and AI companies can set the rates they are willing to pay. Transaction Facilitation: Cloudflare handles the financial aspect, charging the AI company for the crawl and then distributing the earnings to the publisher. This streamlines the process, removing the need for individual negotiations or complex billing systems. It’s important to note that, at this time, Cloudflare spokesperson Ripley Park confirmed to Bitcoin World that there are no stablecoins or cryptocurrency involved in Pay per Crawl. While many in the digital asset space might see this as a perfect application for micropayments via blockchain, Cloudflare is currently opting for traditional payment rails. This might be a strategic choice for broader adoption in the initial phase, potentially opening the door for crypto integration in the future as the market matures. The core principle, however, of assigning value and enabling direct compensation for digital content , aligns perfectly with the ethos of decentralized finance and ownership. Navigating the Future: Cloudflare’s Role and Challenges Ahead Cloudflare’s position at the heart of the internet’s infrastructure makes it uniquely poised to implement such a marketplace. Their existing network and relationships with a vast number of websites give them the leverage to drive this change. The concept of an “agentic” future, where AI agents act on behalf of users with a budget to acquire the best and most relevant content, truly highlights the “true potential” of Pay per Crawl. Imagine an AI assistant paying a small fee to access a premium research paper or a legal brief, delivering highly tailored information directly to the user, with the original publisher compensated. However, the path to widespread adoption is not without its hurdles: Publisher Adoption: While many publishers are desperate for new revenue streams, getting a critical mass to sign up and actively manage their pricing will be key. AI Company Buy-in: This is perhaps the biggest challenge. AI firms are currently accustomed to scraping content for free. Convincing them to pay, especially for vast amounts of data, will require a strong value proposition and potentially regulatory pressure. Pricing Mechanisms: Determining fair and sustainable micropayment rates for diverse content types and usage patterns will be complex. Competition: Other solutions or direct licensing deals might emerge, though Cloudflare’s network effect provides a significant advantage. Despite these challenges, Cloudflare’s initiative represents a bold and necessary step towards a more equitable internet. It acknowledges the inherent value of human-created content in an AI-driven world and provides a tangible mechanism for creators to reclaim control and generate revenue. Conclusion: Reclaiming Value in the AI Era Cloudflare’s “Pay per Crawl” marketplace is more than just a new feature; it’s a significant statement about the future of online content and its monetization. By empowering publishers to charge for AI bot scraping , Cloudflare is championing a future where digital content is not just consumed, but properly valued and compensated. While the experiment is in its early stages and the absence of cryptocurrency is notable given the topic, the underlying principle of direct payment for digital assets aligns with broader trends in the decentralized web. This initiative could pave the way for a more sustainable and equitable ecosystem for content creators, ensuring that as AI advances, human creativity continues to thrive and be rewarded.

According to blockchain monitoring platform Whale Alert, the transactions have sparked intense speculation across the crypto community. Routine Escrow Unlock and Re-Lock As part of its long-established monthly escrow schedule, Ripple unlocked 500 million XRP from escrow contracts on July 1, valued at approximately $1.08 billion. Since 2017, Ripple has unlocked 1 billion XRP at the beginning of each month to maintain liquidity and support ecosystem growth, later re-locking any unused portion to ensure price stability. Shortly after the release, Ripple locked 400 million XRP , worth nearly $869.5 million, back into escrow. While re-locking is standard practice, the speed and size of this particular re-lock stood out. In recent months, Ripple has sometimes re-locked bigger amounts or allowed more XRP to remain in circulation. This aggressive re-lock suggests a conscious effort to limit immediate market supply, possibly to maintain price levels or in anticipation of strategic shifts. Source: Whale Alert 500 Million XRP Sent to Ripple from Unknown Wallets The most puzzling development occurred moments after the escrow adjustments. Within the same hour, 500 million XRP was sent to Ripple from unidentified external wallets in two separate transactions: one involving 300 million XRP, the other 200 million XRP. Whale Alert flagged both transactions, but the origin of the wallets remains undisclosed, and Ripple has yet to issue any official explanation. This inflow of XRP to Ripple’s addresses is unusual and has sparked a flurry of theories. Some analysts suggest this could be internal asset consolidation or part of a broader liquidity strategy. Others speculate the funds might be tied to partnerships, OTC deals, or preparations for expanding use cases tied to the XRP Ledger, RippleNet, or the RLUSD stablecoin, recently launched on the XRP Ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Implications and Market Reaction Ripple’s structured escrow system was originally implemented to provide transparency and predictability for the XRP market. By locking the bulk of XRP in time-based smart contracts, Ripple seeks to reduce the risk of oversupply and sudden market shocks. However, the sudden appearance of an additional 500 million XRP, separate from the regular unlocks and relocks, breaks the familiar pattern. It has left both institutional investors and retail holders questioning whether Ripple is preparing for a major announcement, expansion, or resolution of legal issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Though XRP’s price remained relatively stable in the immediate aftermath of the transactions, many traders are closely watching for ripple effects, especially if the funds are soon mobilized in significant ways. Ripple’s involvement in a 1.4 billion XRP transaction in a single hour, comprising scheduled escrow activity and unanticipated wallet transfers, has reignited speculation about the company’s strategic direction. While parts of the activity were expected , the unexplained 500 million XRP influx from unknown sources has created a mystery that remains unresolved. Until Ripple clarifies its intent, the crypto world is left to watch and wait. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it fell back to April’s lows. Despite previous attempts to rise, the price action remained muted due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and market conditions. But, at the current level, odds are higher that if BSV bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in the first half of 2025, erasing over 60% of its gains. Despite seen attempts to rise in Q2 2025, BSV struggled to gain bullish strength. It ended up forming another declining wedge. Investors had hoped BSV would reach $50 but it fell short, dampening morale. The last significant momentum was in Q4 2024, which is now missed by BSV holders. In April, BSV peaked at $47 but faced rejection at resistance and began forming lower lows. A recent bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA indicates increasing short-term bearish pressure. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. As July began, BSV fell back to April’s lows. However, if BSV bulls regain strength, a rally could occur. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline within the downward wedge, its price may drop toward $24. Nevertheless, a breakout from this pattern and a move above the 200-day EMA or the $40 level could shift the trend to bullish.

Crypto ownership in the US has nearly doubled since 2021, rising from 15% to 28%. 14% of non-owners plan to buy crypto in 2025, and 67% of current owners plan to buy more this year. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin are the top three cryptocurrencies Americans plan to purchase in 2025. Crypto mining in the USA In 2025, the US leads the world in Bitcoin mining , accounting for over one-third of global mining power. On March 20, 2025, the SEC clarified that proof-of-work crypto mining is not subject to federal securities laws, removing registration requirements for miners. There is no federal ban on crypto mining; regulation is handled at the state level, with some states offering incentives and others imposing environmental restrictions. The Trump administration’s deregulatory approach in 2025 has encouraged domestic mining growth, but all miners must still comply with federal AML and CFT rules. Environmental concerns and energy usage debates continue, especially in states considering stricter oversight or moratoriums on mining operations. US Government’s Crypto Holdings As of April 2025, the US government holds approximately 198,012 Bitcoins, valued at about $18.3 billion. The US is the world’s largest state holder of Bitcoin, with these assets primarily acquired through law enforcement seizures and forfeitures. In March 2025, President Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader Digital Asset Stockpile, consolidating all federally held Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP) as permanent reserve assets. Conclusion US crypto regulation in 2025 marks a major turning point. The old approach of punishing innovation is being replaced with clear rules, legal support, and a national strategy for digital assets. While financial crimes are still a concern, the overall direction is bold, business-friendly, and built for long-term crypto adoption.

The descending triangle comes amid Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell having a long-term hold on his “wait and see” approach to Fed interest rate cuts. Similar to the stock market, Bitcoin’s price have become increasingly tied to interest rates and other macroeconomic indicators recently. As a result, escalating tensions between Powell and President Trump have caused BTC and other tokens to slump. The world’s largest crypto dropped below $106,000 on Wednesday, extending its decline by 2.47% over the last two days. Last week, Bitcoin rose sharply by 7.32%, closing above $108,000. However, since Monday, Bitcoin has continued its decline after facing a correction, closing below $106,000. At the time of writing, the token hovered around $106,998. “Rate cut expectations, political tensions, and a declining apparent demand signal some short-term caution,” James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet, told Cryptonews. However, he is optimistic that despite the scenario, markets would experience momentum into Q3. Crypto Markets Dip Following Powell Comments Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday commented on the President’s aggressive lobbying to cut interest rates. Trump has been putting pressure to follow central banks worldwide that have acted faster. During the European Central Bank’s annual conference in Portugal, Powell said that the decision depends on “how the data evolves.” However, he did not hint at the timing of rate cuts. Trump and Powell have been playing a blame game recently over the Fed rate cuts. The President had sent a handwritten note to Powell on Monday, accusing the Fed Chair “for allowing this to happen to the United States.” “If they were doing their job properly, our Country would be saving Trillions of Dollars in Interest Cost,” Trump’s note read. Besides, the President has encouraged Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May. “No inflation, our country’s strong, our interest rates should be 3 points lower…you’ve got a moron at the head of the Fed. He’s a moron!” – @POTUS blasts Jerome Powell as he speaks to the press on Air Force One! pic.twitter.com/wPURpZBdNj — Real America's Voice (RAV) (@RealAmVoice) July 1, 2025 When asked about President Trump’s pressure on Tuesday, Powell said that he is very focused on just doing his job. Further, interest rates would have lowered by now if not for the president’s tariff agenda, Powell added. Following Powell’s comment, Bitcoin saw a 1.3% slump, trading at $105,859 on Tuesday. “President Trump is yet again voicing his intent to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and this, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano told Cryptonews. However, he added that these provoke short‑term moves, while long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals. “Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned.” The post Bitcoin Slips to $106K Amid Market Caution, Powell Offers No Timeline on Rate Cut appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Donald Trump|fed rate cut,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-02 07:47:49

For those accustomed to the rapid evolution and high-stakes investments in the cryptocurrency space, the latest news from the robotics sector offers a compelling parallel. A new player, Genesis AI , has emerged from stealth mode, making waves with a staggering $105 million seed funding round. This significant capital injection, co-led by venture capital giants Eclipse Ventures and Khosla Ventures, signals a profound belief in Genesis AI’s ambitious mission: to construct the foundational AI models that will power the next generation of robots. What Makes Genesis AI a Game-Changer in Robotics? At its core, Genesis AI is not just another robotics company; it’s an endeavor to solve one of the most persistent challenges in AI development for physical systems. Founded in December last year by Dr. Zhou Xian, a robotics Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, and Théophile Gervet, a former research scientist at the renowned French AI lab Mistral, the startup is charting a course to build a general-purpose model. Imagine a single AI brain capable of enabling robots to automate a vast array of repetitive tasks, from intricate lab experiments to routine household chores. This vision moves beyond single-task robots towards truly versatile and adaptable robotic systems. The ambition of Genesis AI lies in its pursuit of a universal “language” for robots, a foundational model that understands and interacts with the physical world in a highly generalized manner. This contrasts sharply with traditional robotic programming, which often requires bespoke code for each specific task or environment. By developing a comprehensive understanding of physics and interaction, Genesis AI aims to unlock unprecedented levels of autonomy and flexibility in robotic applications, potentially transforming manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and even daily life. The Quest for Universal AI Models : Bridging the Physical and Digital Divide The development of sophisticated AI models for robotics presents unique hurdles compared to, say, large language models (LLMs). While LLMs thrive on vast datasets of text and code, AI for robots demands data rooted in the complexities of the physical world. This includes everything from how objects behave under different forces to the nuances of human-robot interaction and environmental variables. Acquiring such real-world data is notoriously expensive, time-consuming, and often impractical due to safety concerns or the sheer scale required for robust training. This is where Genesis AI’s innovative approach shines. Recognizing the prohibitive nature of real-world data collection, the company is turning to synthetic data . This isn’t just any simulated data; it’s generated using a proprietary physics engine. This engine, the result of an academic project led by Zhou Xian in collaboration with researchers from 18 universities, is touted for its ability to accurately model the physical world. This sophisticated simulation capability allows Genesis AI to create an endless supply of diverse and high-quality training data, sidestepping many of the limitations faced by competitors relying solely on real-world datasets. The team behind this breakthrough comprises over 20 researchers specializing in robotics, machine learning, and graphics – many of whom were integral to the original academic project. Their combined expertise is critical in refining this synthetic data engine, ensuring that the simulated environments and interactions are realistic enough to train highly effective AI models that can then translate seamlessly to real-world robotic applications. Why Synthetic Data is the Key to Scalable Robotics AI The strategic reliance on synthetic data provides Genesis AI with a distinct competitive advantage. Here’s why it’s a game-changer for scalable robotics AI : Speed of Development: By generating data internally, Genesis AI can iterate and train its models much faster than companies dependent on collecting data from physical robots, which is a slow and resource-intensive process. Cost Efficiency: Eliminating the need for extensive physical testing and data collection significantly reduces operational costs, allowing for more resources to be allocated to research and development. Data Diversity and Control: Synthetic environments allow for the generation of edge cases, rare scenarios, and a wider variety of conditions that might be difficult or dangerous to reproduce in the real world. This leads to more robust and generalized AI models. Safety: Training in a simulated environment means no risk to physical hardware or human operators during the early stages of development and testing. This approach directly challenges the traditional paradigm, where companies often rely on external software or hardware, such as NVIDIA’s tools, for simulation. Genesis AI’s proprietary engine offers them greater control and customization, potentially enabling them to develop and refine their models at an unmatched pace. This agility is crucial in the fast-evolving landscape of AI and robotics, where speed to market and continuous improvement are paramount. Pioneering Foundational Models : Genesis AI’s Unique Edge The concept of foundational models , popularized by large language models, is now being extended to the physical realm by companies like Genesis AI. The goal is to create a single, massive model that can serve as a base for a multitude of robotic tasks, rather than developing individual AI solutions for each specific function. This represents a paradigm shift, moving from narrow AI to a more general, adaptable intelligence for machines. The investment from Khosla Ventures, a firm known for its bold bets on transformative technologies, underscores the potential impact of Genesis AI’s work. Kanu Gulati, a partner at Khosla Ventures, articulated this vision clearly: “It’s a big unknown: Will anybody have a large robotics foundation model that will generalize across tasks? That’s a bet we want to go after.” She added, “Of all the teams we have seen, we like [Genesis’s] approach for going after robotics foundation models.” This endorsement highlights the uniqueness and perceived effectiveness of Genesis AI’s strategy. While Genesis AI is forging ahead, it operates within a competitive landscape. Other notable players also striving to develop general-purpose AI models for robots include Physical Intelligence, which recently secured a hefty $400 million funding round, and Skild AI, valued at an impressive $4 billion earlier this year. These valuations underscore the immense market potential and the intense race to achieve a breakthrough in universal robotics AI. Genesis AI’s $105 million seed round, while smaller than some of these later-stage investments, is exceptionally large for a seed round, indicating strong investor confidence in its early progress and unique methodology. What Does This Funding Mean for the Future of Automation? The $105 million seed funding will undoubtedly accelerate Genesis AI’s development efforts. With offices strategically located in Silicon Valley and Paris, the company is leveraging global talent pools to refine its synthetic data engine and build out its foundational model. The dual-location strategy allows for diverse perspectives and access to leading researchers in both robotics and AI. A key milestone on their roadmap is the planned release of their model to the broader robotics community by the end of the year. This move is significant, as it could foster collaboration, encourage adoption, and potentially establish Genesis AI’s model as a standard in the burgeoning field of general-purpose robotics AI. Such a release would not only validate their approach but also catalyze further innovation across the industry, enabling countless new applications for automation. The implications of a truly general-purpose robotics AI are vast. From automating hazardous industrial tasks to providing personalized assistance in homes, the potential for efficiency gains, cost reductions, and improved quality of life is immense. This funding isn’t just about building better robots; it’s about laying the groundwork for a future where intelligent machines can seamlessly integrate into and enhance various facets of human society. For investors and enthusiasts alike, Genesis AI represents a powerful indicator of where the cutting edge of AI development is heading, promising a future where robots are not just tools, but intelligent, adaptable partners.

Analyst Predicts 37% Crash In Bitcoin Dominance,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin/,"The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance. Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here. Related Reading: Pundit Warns Bitcoin Is Setting Up Liquidity Traps As It Campaigns For New ATHs Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance. Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $145,000 In September? Bullish Dojis Suggest Upward Move In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021. “If BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,” the crypto analyst explained. “A breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins — just like in previous cycles.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Altcoin|altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin season news|bitcoin|bitcoin dominance|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc dominance|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-02 08:00:48

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined $342.25 million in net outflows on July 1. This marked the end of a robust 15-day inflow streak that had brought in a cumulative $4.73 billion into the funds since mid-June. Fidelity’s FBTC led the withdrawals with $172.73 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw $119.51 million redeemed. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB also contributed to the net redemptions, recording outflows of $27.03 million and $22.98 million, respectively. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT, the top-performing ETF during the recent inflow streak, saw zero net movement on the day, while the remaining ETFs also recorded no activity. In contrast, spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a third consecutive day of net inflows. On Tuesday, ETH-focused funds collectively attracted $40.68 million. The majority of these inflows came from BlackRock’s ETHA, which posted $54.84 million in net additions, and Grayscale’s ETHE, which added $9.96 million. These gains were partially offset by $24.11 million in outflows from Fidelity’s FETH. You might also like: Dow Jones up 300 points as Senate passes Trump’s budget, Tesla drops 8% The sharp reversal in Bitcoin ETF flows coincided with the U.S. Senate’s passage of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 1, a sweeping $3.3 trillion spending package passed with a narrow 51–50 vote, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie. Despite lobbying from pro-crypto lawmakers, the 1,000-page legislation did not include any specific provisions related to Bitcoin, crypto mining, or staking, disappointing portions of the digital asset industry. The bill will now return to the House for final reconciliation ahead of the July 4 deadline set by the president for signature. The absence of crypto-related language in the legislation, despite initial optimism, may have contributed to the profit-taking seen across Bitcoin-related funds. The broader cryptocurrency market reacted by dropping nearly 2.3% to an intraday low of $3.36 trillion as of press time. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped close to 2% to a session low near $105,000 on Wednesday morning. According to CoinGlass data , total crypto market liquidations reached $242.6 million on July 1, with the majority stemming from long position liquidations. This indicates that bullish traders either closed or were forced out of their positions, likely securing profits or limiting downside exposure, while bearish positioning remained intact. Historically, the third quarter has underperformed relative to other periods, as noted by analysts. Since 2013, Bitcoin has averaged just a 5.47% gain in Q3, making it the weakest of the four quarters in terms of historical returns, according to CoinGlass data. This trend may be contributing to the cautious repositioning among investors. When writing, Bitcoin had shed some of its intraday losses and was back above $107k, up nearly 40% from its year-to-date low of $76,300 seen in early April.

The legislation bumps tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing from 25% to 35%, giving companies like Intel, Micron, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company a bigger reason to set up new plants across American soil. The goal, according to CNBC , is to pull more of the world’s advanced chip production away from Asia and get it done at home before a 2026 deadline kicks in. This is Trump’s attempt to pile more weight behind domestic chipmaking after earlier efforts like the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which had offered $39 billion in grants and $75 billion in loans. His latest bill offers a more aggressive incentive: bigger long-term tax breaks instead of temporary handouts. A draft version of the bill had included a 30% credit, but the final version passed Tuesday pushes it to 35%, giving semiconductor companies even more breathing room for costly US projects. House Republicans threaten to block Senate bill Despite getting through the Senate, the fight isn’t over. Trump’s bill now faces a new round in the House of Representatives, which passed its own version of the bill last month. Trump wants final approval by July 4, but that deadline might not hold up. Speaker Mike Johnson is facing resistance from his own party, and with the vote margins razor-thin, he can’t afford to lose more than three Republicans if every member shows up. Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, said Tuesday on X, “I don’t work for the Senate parliamentarian. I work for the PEOPLE.” He called the Senate bill a “dud” and has already submitted an amendment to swap it with the House’s version. Ralph Norman, another Republican from South Carolina, is also opposing the Senate’s text. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, who both voted against the earlier House version in May, are expected to vote no again. Andy Harris, a Republican from Maryland who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, didn’t vote for or against the bill last time. He just voted “present,” which gives no clear signal where he stands now. But if Johnson loses more than three Republican votes, the bill doesn’t pass, and the 35% credit never becomes law. Trump rejects Biden’s chip policy and pushes tariffs instead While Trump is trying to boost US fabs with tax incentives, he’s also gunning for Biden’s CHIPS Act, which focused more on giving out grants. Earlier this year, Trump called for that entire law to be repealed. Republican lawmakers haven’t moved on that demand, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed last month that the administration is in the middle of renegotiating some of the grant terms from Biden’s version. Trump’s approach skips the handouts and leans hard on tariffs. His administration has launched an investigation into semiconductor imports, which could lead to new duties on foreign chip technology. That adds more pressure on companies that don’t want to deal with unpredictable trade costs. Instead, they’re now speeding up construction in the US to avoid that whole mess. Major names like TSMC , Nvidia, Micron, and GlobalFoundries have already ramped up US projects in recent months. They want to make sure they’re in position to claim the credits before the 2026 deadline passes. Companies that miss that window don’t get the deal. The Senate passed the bill with Vice President JD Vance breaking a 50-50 tie. But Johnson’s real challenge now is keeping his party together in the House. No Democrats are expected to support the bill, and with Republican objections growing, the odds are getting tighter by the hour. Trump is demanding the House push the bill through before Independence Day, but the numbers don’t lie—if even four Republicans vote no, the bill dies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Indonesian crypto market is experiencing significant growth in transaction volume and user numbers, driven by a tech-savvy population and increasing interest in digital assets. Indonesia has legalized the trading of crypto but has reasonably regulated it with strict regulations. Table of contents Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Tax in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Adoption in Indonesia Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 March 2025- OJK issued licenses for Digital Financial Assets (DFA) Traders OJK issued 19 DFA traders’ licenses , and they were processing 11 other licenses at the time. This initiative was part of a broader framework that includes a license for DFA exchanges, clearing, guarantee, settlement institutions, and custodians for digital assets under OJK supervision. January 10, 2025- Government Regulation No. 49 of 2024 and OJK Regulation No. 27 of 2024 The supervision of crypto assets officially transitioned from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) to the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The new OJK regulation outlines minimum paid-up capital and equity requirements and includes detailed guidelines for onboarding customers. It also implemented a new tax regime for crypto as it became subject to both income tax and value-added tax. The OJK also implemented Digital Financial Asset Trading, Including Crypto Assets, which outlines licensing, transition of applications, updates the crypto asset whitelist, and the adjustment period. January 1-6, 2025- Crypto Tax (PMK No. 131/2024 and PMK No. 81/2024) The value-added tax (VAT) was increased to 0.11% of transaction value, and for unregistered exchange platforms, the VAT rate doubles to 0.22% . While crypto tax is very low in the country, it is not totally free as it subjects mining to tax up to 0.1%. What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Indonesian government is actively working on enhancing consumer protection facilities to foster a more secure and stable environment for crypto trading. The implementation of OJK supervision aims to help the public better understand the opportunities and risks involved in crypto investments. The initiative also indicates a move towards treating them as financial instruments alongside traditional assets. This integration aims to bring greater clarity and stability to the crypto market. With stricter regulation under OJK, indonesia is aiming to boost transparency and fraud prevention, which could help mitigate risks in the crypto space. The OJK also introduced a regulatory sandbox, a testing environment for new financial technologies, including crypto. With this measure, the Indonesian government is aiming to embrace innovation. Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 OJK reclassified crypto assets as digital financial assets under new terms to regulate licensing. It also changed Bappebti’s authority to issue the list of crypto assets that could be traded on crypto platforms and gave the authority to the DFA. DFA issued its first list in April 2025, which contained 1,444 crypto assets, marking an increase from Bappebti’s listing of 851. Licensing: Companies previously licensed under Bappebti will automatically be recognized as licensed Digital Financial Asset Trading Providers. However, a reapplication is necessary after which the DFA traders can provide the whitelist of crypto assets. A grace period till July 2025 is given to fully comply with new requirements. Requirement for DFA Traders: The minimum paid-up capital of 100 billion rupiah (US$6 million) and minimum equity of 50 billion rupiah (US$3 million) requirement is retained from Bappebti’s authority, while four new key changes are introduced under OJK: Fit and Proper Test for board members, shareholders, and controlling shareholders is introduced. DFA traders are to store transaction data and financial records for at least ten consecutive years. Requirements for data protection measures are to be followed. Stricter restrictions for DFA members– cannot hold positions as members of the BOC or BOD. If the regulations are abused, OJK has the authority to revoke the licenses. Crypto Tax in Indonesia 2025 Beginning from January 2025, Indonesia has implemented a set of crypto taxes along with guidance on penalties. Delay in filing can result in a fixed penalty (IDR 100,000 to IDR 1,000,000) and interest charges of 2% per month, up to 24 months. Transaction Type VAT Rate Final Income Tax (PPh) Registered exchange 0.12% 0.1% Unregistered exchange Higher (prev. 0.22%) 0.2% Mining (VAT) 1.1% 0.1% (income) Crypto Adoption in Indonesia Crypto adoption rate: Crypto investors reached 14.6 million in the country , ranking third in global adoption in Q1 2025. This is an increase of up to 3.28% from the previous year’s adoption rate. The user penetration rate is predicted to be 16.56% in 2025 and is projected to increase to 16.98% by 2026. Government’s crypto holdings: Not publicly disclosed, while the country has seen significant growth in crypto transactions and usage. In Q1 2025, the crypto transaction reached IDR 109.29 trillion. Conclusion With stricter crypto regulations in the nation, investors are feeling safe to trade cryptocurrency, marking a significant growth in trading volume and user base. Popular coins like USDT, BTC, DOGE, PEPE, and XRP are driving much of the transaction volume in Indonesia. If these regulations and security measures are preserved, Indonesia may position itself as a crypto leader in Southeast Asia in the near future.

On June 30, Governor Ned Lamont signed House Bill 7082 into law, following unanimous approval by both chambers of the state legislature. The legislation, now enacted as Public Act 25-66, is scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2025. The bill, introduced in February by Representative Jason Doucette, advanced swiftly through the legislative process. It passed the House and Senate without a single opposing vote, which confirms a strong bipartisan consensus on limiting state involvement with digital assets such as Bitcoin. The new law prohibits Connecticut and its political subdivisions from accepting virtual currencies for payments or from purchasing, holding, or establishing any form of digital asset reserve. The statute adopts a broad definition of “virtual currency” under section 36a-596 of the state’s general statutes, encompassing most cryptocurrencies in circulation today. Further, it implements extensive regulatory updates to the state’s money transmission framework and mandates that crypto businesses operating under the state’s jurisdiction maintain a 1:1 reserve backing for all customer-held digital assets. The law also introduces mandatory risk disclosures, fraud protection measures, and strict transaction limits for virtual currency kiosks commonly known as crypto ATMs. You might also like: Arizona governor vetoes bill to create Bitcoin Reserve from seized assets The legislation effectively removes Connecticut from ongoing state-level efforts to integrate Bitcoin into public treasury strategies. While some states have moved to adopt strategic reserves as part of broader digital asset initiatives, Connecticut’s blanket prohibition makes it one of the most restrictive jurisdictions in the country regarding cryptocurrency adoption by state institutions. By contrast, at least 17 U.S. states are currently reviewing legislation focused on creating state-managed Bitcoin or digital asset reserves, according to data from crypto legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws. Among them, New Hampshire and Arizona have fully enacted such frameworks, while Texas has cleared similar legislation through both chambers. However, not all efforts have succeeded. On July 1, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed House Bill 2324, which sought to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund using cryptocurrencies seized by the government. Hobbs argued that the proposal could discourage local law enforcement from engaging in digital asset investigations by redirecting forfeited assets away from local agencies.

NEAR Protocol is a layer1 blockchain that is designed to make AI and other technological advancements accessible and useful for on-chain users. Established in 2020, NEAR addresses common challenges in blockchain by using sharding technology that enables the network to process many transactions at once. The deployment of this technology is able to solve the problems of slow transaction processing and high costs. In addition, developers can benefit from NEAR’s customizable smart contracts support multichain financial applications using secure cryptographic tools without the need for bridges or wrapped tokens.

A recent pivotal development from the US Senate has profound implications for AI regulation , signaling a significant shift in how this transformative technology might be governed. What Just Happened with US Senate AI and Why It Matters? In a move that has sent waves through the tech and policy communities, the US Senate recently voted to remove a highly debated provision from a budget bill. This provision, often referred to as the ‘AI moratorium,’ aimed to impose a long-term ban on states’ abilities to enact their own AI regulation . The overwhelming bipartisan vote of 99-1 to strip this clause is a clear indicator of a legislative pivot towards allowing more localized oversight of artificial intelligence. For the cryptocurrency community, where regulatory clarity is paramount, this development underscores the complex dance between innovation and governance, suggesting a future where AI, much like digital assets, could face a diverse regulatory landscape across different states. Unpacking the Controversial AI Moratorium The now-removed AI moratorium , initially proposed by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) as part of the Trump administration’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ sought to prevent states from creating a ‘patchwork’ of regulations that proponents argued could stifle AI innovation . Prominent figures from Silicon Valley, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, and a16z’s Marc Andreessen, publicly supported this federal preemption. Their argument centered on the idea that a unified federal approach would provide more clarity and foster a conducive environment for AI development without the burden of navigating disparate state laws. However, critics from both sides of the aisle voiced strong opposition, warning that such a ban would leave consumers vulnerable and allow powerful AI companies to operate with minimal accountability. The Bipartisan Push for Balanced Tech Policy The opposition to the AI moratorium transcended traditional party lines, highlighting a shared concern over the potential for unchecked corporate power and consumer harm. Democrats and many Republicans alike raised alarms that a blanket federal ban on state AI regulation would grant immense leeway to AI developers without adequate safeguards. Critics also pointed out the contentious element of Cruz’s proposal, which linked compliance with the moratorium to federal broadband funding, effectively coercing states into adherence. This bipartisan push culminated in an amendment offered by Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) to completely strip the provision. Senator Blackburn, who had initially sought a compromise to shorten the ban from ten years to five, ultimately withdrew her support for any form of moratorium, leading to the decisive Senate vote. What Does This Mean for AI Innovation and the Future of Regulation? The removal of the AI moratorium marks a pivotal moment for AI innovation in the United States. Instead of a centralized, potentially restrictive federal ban, the path is now open for states to develop their own regulatory frameworks. This could lead to a more nuanced approach to governance, allowing states to tailor regulations to their specific economic, social, and technological contexts. While some in the tech industry might still prefer a unified federal standard to avoid complexity, others argue that state-level experimentation could lead to more effective and adaptable regulations. This decentralized approach might even foster different models of AI development and deployment, potentially leading to diverse forms of innovation as companies adapt to varying regulatory environments. It underscores the ongoing challenge of balancing rapid technological advancement with the need for robust oversight to protect consumers and ensure ethical development. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of AI and Tech Policy The Senate’s decisive action reflects a growing understanding that tech policy needs to be agile and responsive, especially concerning rapidly evolving fields like AI. This vote emphasizes the legislative body’s commitment to ensuring that technological progress is accompanied by appropriate safeguards and accountability. For stakeholders across industries, including those in the crypto space, this development highlights the importance of engaging with policymakers at all levels to shape future regulations. As AI continues to integrate into various aspects of daily life and economic activity, the ability of states to experiment with different regulatory approaches could prove invaluable in identifying best practices and fostering responsible growth. The dialogue around AI governance is far from over; in fact, it has just entered a new, more dynamic phase. The US Senate’s overwhelming vote to remove the controversial AI moratorium from the budget bill is a landmark decision that redefines the future of AI regulation in the United States. By rejecting a blanket federal ban, Congress has paved the way for states to establish their own rules, fostering a potentially diverse and adaptive regulatory landscape for AI innovation . This crucial development underscores the complex interplay between government oversight and technological advancement, setting a precedent for how future tech policy will address emerging technologies. The shift signals a more nuanced approach, balancing the need for innovation with consumer protection and accountability.

The Paris-based watchdog called on countries to ensure the global implementation of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter terrorist financing (CFT) in virtual assets. FATF Report for Stricter Crypto Regulation FATF stated that while some progress has been made since 2024 in regulating virtual assets, many jurisdictions still have to combat risks as crypto scams surge. As part of its sixth targeted update, the agency highlights the need for licensing and registration since many jurisdictions have reported challenges in mitigating the risks of offshore virtual asset service providers (VASPs). As 99 jurisdictions have either passed or are in the process of implementing travel rules, FATF released a report on Travel Rule Supervision to ensure transparency around cross-border payments. “To assist global implementation of the Travel Rule, the FATF has also published Best Practices on Travel Rule Supervision today. This report provides examples of good practices that jurisdictions may consider when developing their supervisory frameworks,” FATF said . [post_titles_links postid=”477206″] What triggered it? As of 2025, only 40 out of 138 jurisdictions assessed were largely compliant with FATF crypto standards, as countries continue to find difficulty in identifying the entity behind crypto transactions. FATF states, “With virtual assets inherently borderless, regulatory failures in one jurisdiction can have global consequences.” This FATF report is a response to the rising concerns about illicit risk in the financial domain related to crypto. As the crypto hacks have surged in 2025, reaching over $2.47 billion, FATF appears to be laying the groundwork for safety and transparency measures in crypto transactions. Crypto Thefts in 2025 As the crypto thefts have skyrocketed from 2024— A North Korean criminal gang stole $1.46 billion from VASP Bybit (in 2025), without much recovery. Another $51 billion was stolen in illicit on-chain activity in 2024 These thefts prompted the regulator to urge stricter regulations and action for crypto transactions and norms for VASPs.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-vs-sec-will-xrp-case-officially-ends-on-july-3-heres-what-is-coming/,"A recent tweet by crypto analyst and investor Xaif has drawn considerable attention within the cryptocurrency community. Xaif highlighted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has scheduled a closed meeting for 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, July 3, 2025. According to the official Sunshine Act Notice issued by the SEC, this meeting will be held remotely and at the Commission’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The notice confirms that the meeting will be closed to the public. The official matters to be considered include institution and settlement of injunctive actions, institution and settlement of administrative proceedings, resolution of litigation claims, and other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings. The notice emphasizes that changes in the Commission’s priorities may require alterations in the meeting agenda, which could involve adjudicatory, examination, litigation, or regulatory matters. XRP vs SEC: Is July 3 the Date the Lawsuit Officially Ends? The SEC will hold a closed meeting on July 3 at 2:00 PM ET to discuss litigation resolutions, sparking rumors it may vote to withdraw its Ripple appeal. #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/9RW03w9hc3 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 30, 2025 Connection to the Ongoing XRP Lawsuit Xaif’s tweet focuses on the potential implications of this closed meeting for the ongoing litigation between the SEC and Ripple , the company associated with XRP. The analyst questioned whether July 3 could be the date when the lawsuit officially concludes. This speculation is based on the inclusion of “resolution of litigation claims” in the list of topics to be discussed at the meeting. Xaif suggested that one possible outcome could be the SEC voting to withdraw its appeal in the Ripple case. This speculation is particularly relevant given the protracted nature of the SEC’s legal action against Ripple, which has extended over several years. Although the official notice does not specify which litigation matters will be addressed, the coincidence of the meeting’s agenda with critical stages in the Ripple case has heightened anticipation among XRP holders and market participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reactions From the XRP Community Several users on the social media platform X responded to Xaif’s post. One user, Michael, expressed cautious optimism, stating that in previous instances when the XRP community expected significant outcomes from Sunshine Act meetings, those expectations were often unmet. He suggested that managing expectations might be prudent, noting, “Maybe expect nothing and get a surprise.” Marc Fagel, a retired securities lawyer, offered a humorous yet insightful commentary on the situation. Reflecting on his own experience attending SEC closed meetings, he remarked on how surprising it is to see such meetings become the subject of widespread speculation online. Fagel’s comment highlighted the fact that while closed meetings are routine for regulatory bodies like the SEC, they are now increasingly monitored by the cryptocurrency community due to the high-profile nature of certain cases, such as the one involving Ripple. Analysis of Possible Outcomes While the meeting agenda includes general litigation matters, there is no official confirmation that the Ripple case will be specifically addressed. The Sunshine Act Notice cites legal exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552b and related regulations that permit the meeting to remain confidential. As a result, the public will not have access to the details or outcomes of the discussions until any formal announcements are made by the SEC.

Nearly 100,000 ETH, or about $250 million, were deposited into Binance in two sizable waves, as per a July 1 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. These deposits, which usually indicate larger exchange reserves, may result in selling pressure if market sentiment shifts. Taha also observed that the gap between Ethereum spot price and the open interest on Binance was growing. Since June 26, ETH has shown steady buying in the spot market, reaching three consecutive local highs above $2,500. However, Binance Open Interest has lagged, hitting a series of lower highs below $5.6 billion. This suggests that fewer traders are opening new positions, which could be a sign of caution or uncertainty about the strength of the move. You might also like: Ethereum sees growing institutional interest as Bit Digital raises $162.9M to buy more ETH The continuous reduction in U.S. Federal Reserve net liquidity is another factor that might add to the uncertainty. Liquidity has decreased from about $6.2 trillion to $5.84 trillion in recent weeks. Lower liquidity tends to limit risk-taking by reducing access to capital in both traditional and crypto markets. Unless Ethereum sees high demand from buyers ready to absorb this environment, its upside might be limited in the short-term. Ethereum is trading at $2,451 at press time, down 0.5% over the last day. The price is approaching $2,455, which has acted as resistance over the previous week and marks the 20-day simple moving average. Technical indicators, such as the tightening Bollinger Bands and the relative strength index at 48.9, indicate that the market is in a consolidation phase with little volatility and no clear directional bias. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although oscillators like the Stochastic RSI are approaching overbought territory, which limits the potential for short-term upside, momentum and MACD indicators display mild bullish signals. Longer-term averages are still above the current price, suggesting broader weakness. Short-term moving averages, such as the 10-day and 50-day exponential averages, are offering little support. The next upward target might be the upper Bollinger Band around $2,622 if buying pressure returns and Ethereum breaks above $2,500 with increased volume and rising open interest. If current support gives way and exchange inflows keep outpacing demand, the price might retest the lower band around $2,287, increasing the risk of a deeper pullback.

Geopolitical stability often underpins market confidence, and a breakthrough here could signal broader shifts. Understanding the Trump Gaza Ceasefire Proposal: What’s on the Table? The core of this latest initiative revolves around a 60-day cessation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip. While specific details of the proposed terms have not been fully disclosed to the public, such agreements typically involve a multi-faceted approach aimed at de-escalation and humanitarian aid. Historically, ceasefire proposals encompass prisoner exchanges, the entry of humanitarian assistance, and guarantees for the safety of civilians. Trump’s involvement, even out of office, highlights the enduring influence of U.S. diplomacy in the region. Duration and Scope: A 60-day period offers a substantial window for de-escalation and potentially for more comprehensive negotiations, unlike shorter, temporary truces. Key Mediators: Qatar and Egypt are slated to present the final proposal to Hamas, underscoring their critical roles as long-standing intermediaries in the region. Their diplomatic channels are vital for communication with Hamas. Humanitarian Imperative: Any effective ceasefire must address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, including the delivery of aid, medical supplies, and ensuring civilian safety. Israel’s Stance: Why This Israel Peace Deal Matters Now? Israel’s reported agreement to the terms signals a potential shift in its strategic approach, or at least a willingness to explore diplomatic avenues amidst ongoing military operations. For Israel, a ceasefire could offer several strategic advantages, including the potential return of hostages and a temporary reduction in security threats from Gaza. However, reaching an Israel peace deal with Hamas has always been fraught with complex security concerns and internal political pressures. The decision to agree to terms for this 60-day proposal reflects a careful balancing act between military objectives and the imperative to secure the release of captives and alleviate international pressure. The Israeli government faces immense pressure from its public regarding the hostages held in Gaza. A ceasefire agreement, even a temporary one, could pave the way for their release, which is a primary objective. Furthermore, international pressure for de-escalation and humanitarian access has been mounting, making diplomatic solutions increasingly attractive. This particular proposal, facilitated by Trump’s team, adds a unique dimension given his past diplomatic efforts in the region, including the Abraham Accords. Hamas’s Crucial Decision: Will a Gaza Conflict Resolution Emerge? The ball is now firmly in Hamas’s court. Trump explicitly warned that conditions for the group would not improve if the deal is rejected, emphasizing the urgency and the potential finality of this offer. Hamas’s decision will determine whether this initiative leads to a much-needed Gaza conflict resolution or if the conflict escalates further. The group’s demands typically include a complete cessation of hostilities, the lifting of the blockade on Gaza, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. Reconciling these demands with Israel’s security imperatives remains the central challenge. Hamas operates under its own set of internal and external pressures. Its leadership must weigh the benefits of a humanitarian pause and potential prisoner exchanges against its stated objectives and the expectations of its supporters. The decision will likely be influenced by a complex calculus involving its strategic goals, the well-being of the Gazan population, and its standing among other Palestinian factions. The coming days will be critical as the world watches for their response. Navigating the Broader Middle East Stability: Regional Implications Beyond the immediate parties, the potential 60-day ceasefire carries significant implications for broader Middle East stability. Regional actors like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have vested interests in de-escalation and a pathway to peace. A successful ceasefire could foster greater regional cooperation and reduce the risk of wider conflict. Conversely, a rejection or failure of the deal could exacerbate tensions, potentially drawing in other regional players and further destabilizing an already volatile area. The roles of Qatar and Egypt as primary mediators are vital. Qatar, known for its channels with Hamas, and Egypt, sharing a border with Gaza and historically a key mediator, are uniquely positioned to facilitate these delicate negotiations. Their success in presenting and advocating for the proposal will be crucial in achieving a positive outcome. The stability of the region is interconnected, and progress in Gaza can have a ripple effect across the Levant and beyond. Anticipating the Hamas Response: What’s Next for the Region? All eyes are now on Hamas as they deliberate on the proposed Hamas ceasefire terms. Their decision will dictate the immediate future of the Gaza Strip and potentially the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Several scenarios could unfold: Acceptance: If Hamas accepts, a 60-day ceasefire would commence, allowing for humanitarian aid, prisoner exchanges, and a window for further negotiations on a more permanent resolution. This would be a significant step towards de-escalation. Conditional Acceptance: Hamas might accept with conditions, leading to further rounds of negotiations and potential delays. This is a common tactic in complex peace processes. Rejection: A full rejection would likely lead to continued military operations and a worsening humanitarian crisis, as warned by Trump. This would signal a continuation of the current devastating conflict. The coming days will be critical. The world awaits Hamas’s response, which will undoubtedly shape the immediate trajectory of the conflict and the lives of millions. The stakes could not be higher. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Hopes While the prospect of a 60-day ceasefire offers a glimmer of hope, the path to a lasting peace in the region is fraught with challenges. Deep-seated mistrust, conflicting narratives, and complex political realities make comprehensive resolution incredibly difficult. However, every step towards de-escalation, no matter how small, is a move in the right direction. Key Challenges: Trust Deficit: Years of conflict have built immense mistrust between all parties, making genuine negotiation difficult. Internal Divisions: Both Israeli and Palestinian political landscapes are complex, with internal factions that may oppose any compromise. Enforcement Mechanisms: Ensuring compliance with ceasefire terms requires robust monitoring and enforcement, which can be challenging in a conflict zone. Root Causes: A 60-day ceasefire is a temporary measure; it does not address the underlying political and territorial disputes that fuel the conflict. Potential Benefits of a Successful Ceasefire: Humanitarian Relief: Immediate and critical aid can reach those in desperate need in Gaza. Hostage Release: A primary goal for Israel and a significant humanitarian outcome. De-escalation: Reduces immediate violence and the risk of regional spillover. Diplomatic Window: Provides an opportunity for further, more comprehensive peace talks. In conclusion, Donald Trump’s announcement of Israel’s agreement to a 60-day Gaza ceasefire proposal marks a crucial moment in the ongoing Middle East conflict. The ball is now in Hamas’s court, and their decision will significantly impact the humanitarian situation and the prospects for regional stability. While the path to lasting peace remains challenging, this initiative offers a vital opportunity for de-escalation and a potential step towards a more hopeful future for all involved.

Its cloud division, Alibaba Cloud, has launched a third data center in Malaysia and plans to open a second in the Philippines this October. The new Malaysian facility went live earlier this week. It will offer increased computing power and storage for regional businesses and governments undergoing digital transformation. Intended for launch later in October, the Philippine center is anticipated to beef up local competencies in AI workloads, data analytics, and cloud-native services. Alibaba says these centers will be conveniently located to support Asia’s rising demand for artificial intelligence-based cloud offerings. By making its AI tools more readily available, the company aims to appeal to startups, enterprises, and public institutions searching for scalable digital infrastructure. A company spokesman said Alibaba Cloud’s investment in the region was due to its optimism about Southeast Asia’s growth prospects and digital future, and that it hoped to foster local innovation with secure, intelligent, and sustainable cloud solutions . Singapore hosts the world’s AI competency center Alibaba Cloud has also announced the opening of a Global AI Competency in Singapore. The facility is intended to develop the next generation of AI developers and speed up the application of cutting-edge AI technologies in sectors ranging from finance to automotive. The center will strive to help more than 5,000 businesses and provide skills and access to Alibaba’s Qwen AI models and tools for more than 100,000 developers. There will also be training on topics including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and the responsible use of AI. Alibaba said the hub will be a place for collaborative workshops, labs, and technical call centers to support businesses integrating AI into their operations. Manufacturing, retail, logistics, health, and finance are some of the prime targets. “Globalization is Alibaba Cloud’s long-term strategy,” Eddie Wu, chief executive officer of Alibaba Cloud, said in a video message at a company event in Singapore on Wednesday. The centre also ties in with the Smart Nation drive in Singapore as the city-state seeks to become a regional hub for AI innovation and digital transformation. Alibaba commits $53 billion to global AI network Alibaba’s recent steps are all part of a much larger goal: to lead the way in the next generation of AI-based business infrastructure. The company will funnel over $53 billion into building artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure worldwide in the next three years. It is also building infrastructure in other countries, including Thailand, Mexico, and South Korea, a sign that it is looking to expand to other global markets and reduce customer latency. After making a splash in Chinese e-commerce, the company is expanding to AI tools and services built on its own Qwen AI models, including everything from an AI platform to large language models pre-trained for enterprise usage. In February 2025, CEO Eddie Wu declared that Alibaba’s new mission is to pursue Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—AI capable of reasoning and problem-solving like a human. The bold announcement sets the company on a direct collision course with US tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as an increasingly competitive field of AI labs across Asia.

According to Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, the XRP spot ETF currently has a 95% chance of being approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an X post on July 1, the analysts highlighted that XRP now ranks among the top digital assets most likely to secure spot ETF approval this year, joining Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ).

The final SEC decision deadline for XRP’s spot ETF is set for October 10, 2025. The Commission currently classifies XRP as a commodity, a crucial regulatory status that significantly boosts its approval odds. Impact of SEC case However, some observers suggest the SEC may be waiting for the conclusion of its long-standing legal battle with Ripple before moving forward with an approval. Both parties have shown interest in settling the case through a settlement. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also expressed a strong desire to bring the matter to a close. For now, investors seeking exposure to a spot XRP ETF can look to Brazil and Canada, the only countries that have approved trading of such products . However, these ETFs have had little impact on XRP’s price so far, mainly due to the relatively small size of their financial markets. Meanwhile, other top crypto assets, such as Litecoin ( LTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), also have strong approval odds, each at 95%.

The M2 money supply , which includes hard currency and bank and money market mutual fund deposits that are relatively liquid, rose to a record $21.94 trillion at the end of May, topping the previous peak of $21.72 trillion in March 2022, according to data source barchart.com. Year-on-year growth rate matched April's 4.5%, which is also the highest in nearly three years, according to data source Yahoo Finance . For cryptocurrencies, the message is muddled. Typically, a growing money supply is taken as a signal of looser financial conditions and a growing economy that promotes greater investor exposure to riskier assets. On the other hand, money supply growth can lead to inflation if it outpaces the economy, according to Cyprus-based TIOmarkets . Inflation concerns could reduce investor risk-taking and pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In recent years, a rising M2 has had a lagged impact on the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. The PCE began rising in February 2021, a year after M2 growth began soaring in February 2020 and followed the M2 growth lower in 2023, St. Louis Federal Reserve noted in a blog post . If history is a guide, the ongoing uptick in the M2 growth rate could contribute to inflation in the coming months, making it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to cut rates to as low as 1%, as recently called for by President Donald Trump.",Markets|Money supply|United States|Bitcoin|Markets|News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-02 09:22:51

With Q3 around the corner, traders are already circling two altcoins that are about to launch, one of them has name recognition and another has all the uncapped appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a presale DeFi token that is rapidly gaining momentum and may be considered one of the most discussed projects with its price standing at about $0.03. Phase 5 Presale of Mutuum Finance is over 50% sold out with MUTM priced at $0.03. The presale has raised over $11.4 million and attracted more than 12,600 unique holders. Shiba Inu Holds Steady Ahead of Q3 Shift Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been stagnating at the $0.00001154 point, in no man land as it anticipates a wider market movement. SHIB has experienced a significant growth of its burn rate this month, which lowers the circulating supply. SHIB does not indicate any significant breakout trends at the moment but holds at support with an active community and recognizable brand. This keeps this project in the context of long-term altcoin positioning. With the focus moving to new players in the market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has begun to emerge as an up-and-coming new option that has the potential to explode in terms of growth in Q3. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Mutuum Finance is gaining significant momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from others by offering a scalable system of finance with a real-world use case. Investor interest is gaining momentum with the project having raised well over $11.4 million already and having over 12,600 token holders. DeFi Lending Model with the Assurance of Total Ownership of Assets Mutuum Finance introduces a non-custodial liquidity protocol in which users retain their total ownership of assets. The project features a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to foster increased flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to deliver automated lending without any human intervention and instead, the smart contracts respond to the market by offering dynamic interest rates. Through the assistance of this auto mechanism, the world of borrowers and lenders becomes stable and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model takes no middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. The process is highly favored by users in dealing with volatile assets where flexibility and tailor-made terms are required. CertiK-Certified, Fully Collateralized Stablecoin, and $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is also developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project’s smart contracts are audited in-depth by CertiK, a renowned blockchain security company. Beyond bringing confidence in the integrity and transparency of the code base, this audit also shows that the team is dedicated to building a secure DeFi protocol. To further strengthen this commitment, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK, with $50,000 USDT allocated for rewards. The program spans four tiers, critical, major, minor, and low, ensuring all levels of vulnerabilities are identified and incentivized. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $11.4 million from 12,600+ investors, with Phase 5 selling fast at $0.03. As SHIB stays flat, momentum is clearly building behind MUTM’s real utility, CertiK audit, and unique DeFi model. A $50K bug bounty and fully backed stablecoin add trust and value.

Despite the bill passing the House in a 34-22 vote, Hobbs argued that it would disincentivize local law enforcement by reallocating funds away from their jurisdictions. This continues her trend of opposing digital asset legislation after she previously blocked bills proposing state-level Bitcoin investment strategies and reserves. However, she did approve House Bill 2749, which incorporates crypto into Arizona’s financial statutes and unclaimed property laws. Meanwhile, in New York, Attorney General Letitia James criticized two federal stablecoin bills, and warned that they lack sufficient investor protections and may enable fraud. She called for stricter regulation of stablecoin issuers, FDIC protection, and digital identity requirements. In Virginia, crypto-friendly political action committees are making waves, especially after the Protect Progress PAC spent over $1 million to help elect Democrat James Walkinshaw in a special election. The PAC is part of a larger pro-crypto lobbying movement that plans to influence upcoming elections and legislation nationwide. Another Crypto Bill Vetoed by Arizona Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have created a state-managed fund for holding seized cryptocurrencies, continuing her track record of opposing digital asset legislation. House Bill 2324 proposed the establishment of a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund,” and was passed by the state House in a 34-22 vote on June 24 after being revived by the Senate. Letter from Katie Hobbs The bill outlined how seized crypto would be allocated: the first $300,000 would go to the attorney general’s office, with any remaining funds split between the AG’s office, the state’s general fund, and the proposed reserve. Hobbs, however, rejected the bill on the grounds that it would discourage local law enforcement from cooperating with state authorities by diverting seized assets away from local jurisdictions. Although the veto could technically be overridden with a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers, this outcome is very unlikely without changes in legislative support. This is not the first time Hobbs blocked cryptocurrency-related proposals. In May, she vetoed Senate Bill 1025, which would have created an Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve allowing up to 10% of state funds to be invested in Bitcoin. She called cryptocurrencies “untested investments.” She also vetoed Senate Bill 1373, which aimed to form a Strategic Digital Assets Reserve using seized crypto assets. Despite these rejections, one crypto-related measure has made it into law. House Bill 2749, which was enacted in May, modifies Arizona’s statutes to incorporate crypto assets into the state’s financial systems and unclaimed property laws, while also establishing a separate Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund managed by the state treasurer. Arizona’s efforts are part of the trend among US states exploring the integration of cryptocurrencies into public finance. In June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill to create the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and in May, New Hampshire passed legislation allowing the state to invest in both cryptocurrencies and precious metals. According to data from Bitcoin Laws, at least six other state legislatures are currently considering similar initiatives. NY Attorney General Slams Stablecoin Bills In New York, Attorney General Letitia James called on Congress to revise two pending stablecoin bills. She argued that they fail to provide sufficient protections for investors and the broader financial system. In a letter sent Tuesday, James criticized the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, stating they lack the necessary regulatory guardrails. Although both bills have advanced in Congress, James urged lawmakers to take more time to craft legislation that encourages innovation while also safeguarding the integrity of the US banking system. The first page of James’ letter She warned that the bills do not adequately address the dangers of anonymous transactions, which can facilitate fraud and criminal activity. James recommended that stablecoin issuers be regulated in the same manner as banks, given their similar functions, and called for mandatory Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protection for stablecoin deposits. She also pushed for digital identity requirements for all transactions to eliminate anonymity that could be exploited by bad actors. Additionally, she raised concerns that stablecoins could unfairly disadvantage local community banks already facing economic pressures. Supporters of the proposed legislation, like Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Bill Hagerty, defended the bills as efforts to protect consumers and uphold the global role of the US dollar However, James maintained her skepticism, and even extended her criticism to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in a separate letter last month. She argued that the bill’s provisions risk enabling fraud by shielding anonymous actors and undermining decades of investor protection laws. Letitia James has a track record of opposing aspects of the cryptocurrency industry. In April, she urged Congress to ban crypto and crypto ETFs from retirement funds after claiming they lack intrinsic value. Her office also took legal action against several digital asset firms and exchanges during her tenure. Pro-Crypto PAC Spends Big in Virginia Race Crypto met politics yet again with James Walkinshaw. He is a Democratic candidate aiming to fill the congressional seat left vacant by the late Representative Gerry Connolly in Virginia’s 11th District, and secured the party nomination after a firehouse primary that was held on Saturday. His victory came after impressive support from a cryptocurrency-backed political action committee, Protect Progress, which reportedly spent more than $1 million in June to back his campaign. The group is affiliated with the larger Fairshake PAC, which is primarily funded by industry players like Coinbase and Ripple Labs. This support is part of a plan by Fairshake to influence elections by backing candidates who are favorable to crypto innovation and regulation. (Source: Federal Election Commission ) In a statement after Walkinshaw’s win, a Fairshake spokesperson talked about the candidate’s resilience against political attacks and praised his commitment to innovation and economic opportunity. They pointed out that voters recognized the value of pro-crypto stances, and suggested that such support is resonating across party lines. The PAC’s activity in Virginia follows similar efforts in April during special elections for two Florida House seats, where its affiliate, Defend American Jobs, spent more than $1.5 million. While crypto-backed PACs were less visible in New Jersey’s June gubernatorial primaries, Fairshake has suggested that it has broader ambitions. As of January, the group reported holding more than $116 million in cash reserves to support crypto-friendly candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. Their aim is to strengthen the representation of crypto advocates in Congress, where 270 “pro-crypto” lawmakers already hold seats after the 2024 elections . Legislative efforts on crypto are also advancing in the current session, with the Senate passing stablecoin regulations and drafting a comprehensive digital asset market structure bill.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-02 09:30:00

In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst DanteX outlined the factors contributing to this price resistance and what it could mean for the remainder of 2025. What’s Holding Bitcoin Back? Despite the substantial influx of nearly $5 billion in Bitcoin acquired through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in just a few weeks, the price of Bitcoin has failed to surpass the $120,000 target identified by analysts. Public companies, Strategy and GameStop, have joined the ranks of institutional buyers, marking a significant shift in corporate interest toward Bitcoin. This growing demand indicates that there are substantial buyers ready to purchase at prices above $100,000. Related Reading: BitMine Stock Soars 700% After $250 Million Raise For Ethereum Treasury However, DanteX asserts that the market has been characterized by an unusual phenomenon: the analyst alleges that someone appears to be “strategically offloading” Bitcoin in the $100,000 to $110,000 range, effectively absorbing the demand and preventing upward movement. This selling pressure seems to come from a major player—reportedly hedge funds or early investors—actively liquidating positions to offset the inflow of institutional capital. Market Exhaustion Or Distribution? As the market enters the latter half of summer, a historically weak period for cryptocurrencies, concerns arise about liquidity and retail interest. DanteX noted that if the Bitcoin price cannot rally now, amid significant buying and market enthusiasm, the outlook may dim as trading volumes decline. The analyst further shared that the current price stagnation at near-record highs often indicates either market exhaustion or a distribution phase, suggesting that while demand exists, it is being countered by strategic selling. Despite the overall positive macroeconomic environment—where stock markets are soaring, real yields are declining, and liquidity is increasing—DanteX highlights that the Bitcoin price remains unresponsive. The analyst stated that it could imply that current holders may not be ready for a breakout or are intentionally limiting potential gains. Interestingly, when Bitcoin price movements stall, capital tends to flow into altcoins, which are often viewed as higher-risk, higher-reward investments. DanteX believes that the current skepticism surrounding the likelihood of an altcoin season amid the current market condition, could actually set the stage for one, as many investors remain “under-positioned.” Record ETF Inflows Fail To Translate Into Price Gains The role of ETFs cannot be overlooked, DanteX further said. He said that while record inflows into ETFs signal strong institutional interest, they do not always correlate with immediate price increases, especially when met with significant selling pressure. DanteX notes that much of the exchange-traded fund exposure may be hedged or arbitraged, resulting in a complex market dynamic where asset growth does not immediately reflect in Bitcoin’s spot price.

Analyst Explains!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-broke-record-after-record-but-why-there-is-still-no-movement-in-ethereum-and-altcoins-analyst-explains/,"According to the latest updated data, CEX spot trading volume reached a 9-month low in June. Why Is CEX Volume Declining? Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) recorded $1.07 trillion in spot trading volume in June, the lowest in nine months, according to data. While CEX monthly spot trading volume fell to its lowest level since September 2024, decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volumes continued to increase. One analyst suggested that the reason for this decline is that the current crypto cycle is driven by institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investors rather than retail investments, which is affecting CEX volume. Speaking to The Block, Presto_Research analyst Min Jung said that unlike previous cycles, the last cycle was focused on institutional investors and retail investors, who still generally prefer altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), were not in the market. At this point, Jung stated that previous bull cycles were mostly retail-focused, and that retail investors still did not come to the market and did not trade due to the weak performance of altcoins, and that this situation negatively affected the CEX volume. “Bitcoin, which has shaped the last cycle, remains stable and not far from all-time highs. Despite BTC’s success, the altcoin market is struggling to rally, with most altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), still around 40% off their highs. This points to a market largely driven by institutional Bitcoin purchases, while retail participation—which generally favors altcoins—remains relatively subdued.” “There has been an increase in DEX activity due to the success of platforms like Hyperliquid and the emergence of more DEXs that offer better user experiences,” Jung said regarding the recent increase in DEX volume. *This is not investment advice.

This represents a 3% increase in raised capital and a 9% increase in the number of deals compared to May, according to crypto market intelligence firm, Messari. The upward trend highlights growing confidence among angel investors in the potential of decentralized technologies. Big winners this round include Kalshi, a predictions market, which secured an $185M round , and Digital Asset , which raised $135M to develop its Canton blockchain. Private token sales also saw a resurgence, with World Liberty Finance bringing in $100M and Eigen Labs securing $70M . These figures paint a vibrant and expanding picture of growth and innovation within the crypto industry. Key Innovations Driving Investor Confidence Diving beyond the figures, the nature of the startups points to a focus on innovative and foundational technologies. Crypto startup, Zama FHE, for example, successfully closed a $57M Series B round , achieving a $1B valuation for its fully homomorphic encryption ( FHE ) technology. Investments in privacy solutions show a growing recognition of the importance of secure and scalable infrastructure for the future of Web3. Increasing deal counts and interest in core technological advancements are strong signals of the health and growth of blockchain and Web3 applications. Investors seek opportunities that align with market trends and demonstrate innovation and institutional confidence. Enter BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) , a crypto ICO that offers direct pathways to capitalize on the market’s upward trajectory, making it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Harnessing Bitcoin’s Momentum with BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) As the crypto landscape evolves, new low-cap projects emerge that leverage the strength of established assets. Among these, BTCBULL Token ($BTCBULL) provides a new and low-cost way for retail investors to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ascent.

It’s built on the Ethereum blockchain, giving investors broad compatibility and accessibility, and leans into a bullish character, taking charge, helping $BTC reach $1M. Diverse Pathways to $BTC-Backed Returns Investing in $BTCBULL offers benefits beyond token appreciation. The biggest is the Bitcoin airdrops. As Bitcoin reaches significant price milestones ($150K and £200K), $BTCBULL holders who use Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets ) can receive actual $BTC directly into their wallets. If that wasn’t enough, $BTCBULL has a deflationary model implemented through milestone token burns. At specific $BTC price thresholds, a portion of the $BTCBULL supply is permanently removed from circulation, aiming to increase scarcity and potentially the value of the remaining tokens. If you’re looking for a passive-income vehicle, the $BTCBULL presale offers attractive staking rewards with competitive APYs available (currently 52%). However, you need to get in fast, as the presale ends on July 7. Looking ahead, the multi-faceted rewards system should incentivize long-term holding and engagement. If you buy $BTCBULL today for $0.002585, you could see a return of 2401% if it reaches our end-of-2025 price prediction of $0.06467.

Key Takeaways: A US judge ruled that Celsius’s lawsuit against Tether over a $4 billion Bitcoin liquidation can move forward. Celsius accuses Tether of breaching their agreement by selling BTC early and violating good faith. The judge found Celsius’s claims sufficiently tied to US activities. According to court documents filed Monday in New York, the judge denied Tether’s effort to dismiss allegations that it improperly liquidated Celsius’s Bitcoin collateral during the lender’s collapse. In the lawsuit, Celsius alleged that Tether sold over 39,500 Bitcoin in June 2022, using the proceeds to cover Celsius’s $812 million debt without following agreed-upon procedures. Celsius Alleges Tether Breached Deal, Committed Fraudulent Transfers Celsius argued that Tether’s actions breached their lending agreement, violated principles of good faith under British Virgin Islands law, and amounted to fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under US bankruptcy rules. The dispute centers on a margin call Tether issued as Bitcoin prices fell sharply. Celsius claimed that Tether sold its collateral before a required 10-hour waiting period, offloading the BTC at an average price of $20,656, before transferring the assets to its own Bitfinex accounts. Celsius said the rushed liquidation deprived it of BTC now worth more than $4 billion. The lender also argued Tether’s actions involved US-based communications, personnel, and bank accounts, giving American courts jurisdiction despite Tether being incorporated offshore. The judge sided with Celsius, finding the alleged misconduct sufficiently “domestic” in nature to keep key claims alive, including breach of contract, fraudulent transfer, and preference allegations. Tether loses bid to dismiss Celsius suit seeking to reclaim what is now over $4B of BTC that Tether took from Celsius as it fell into bankruptcy Being offshore doesn’t allow you to evade US courts – especially when virtually all Tether’s assets are sitting in the US #Tether pic.twitter.com/rdshox2n0c — Novacula Occami (@OccamiCrypto) July 1, 2025 Last year, Tether sought to dismiss the case outright, arguing the US court had no jurisdiction and that Celsius’s claims were invalid. While the judge dismissed some counts, the core allegations were allowed to proceed. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 , leaving around $4.7 billion in user assets locked on the platform. In April, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) sought a 20-year prison sentence for Alex Mashinsky , the former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, for orchestrating a “years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing” that defrauded thousands of investors. Federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a two-decade sentence, citing Mashinsky’s central role in a scheme that left customers unable to access nearly $4.7 billion in cryptocurrency when Celsius froze withdrawals in June 2022. Judge Bars Mashinsky From Celsius Payouts Last month, a US bankruptcy judge blocked Mashinsky from claiming any share of the failed crypto lender’s bankruptcy proceeds. The ruling, entered June 16, 2025, disallows claims from Mashinsky and his entities, freeing up funds for creditor payouts under Celsius’s Chapter 11 plan. Celsius creditors, who have already received over $2.5 billion in distributions, will benefit as reserved cash, crypto, and MiningCo shares are released. The decision follows a May 2025 agreement between Mashinsky and the Celsius litigation team.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” faced criticism across party lines, with concerns centered around potential healthcare cuts, artificial intelligence regulation gaps, and redistribution of wealth through tax adjustments favoring large corporations. All Senate Democrats and three Republicans opposed the bill, pushing for amendments to address rural hospital funding and clearer guidelines for regulating artificial intelligence systems. Despite the debate, the bill moved forward without substantial changes, setting the stage for further discussions in the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Crypto Taxation Left Out During the debate, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis suggested adding provisions to correct what she described as the “unfair tax treatment” of cryptocurrency miners and stakers in the United States. However, these proposed changes did not make it to the floor in the final amendments, leaving the crypto community waiting for clarity on taxation issues. “I would have liked to have seen that [provision] in the final product,” Alaska Representative Nicholas Begich said, expressing disappointment but optimism that crypto tax provisions could be included in future critical legislation. Lummis, reflecting on the outcome, stated the bill “isn’t perfect” but is still “a major step in the right direction.” Meanwhile, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the bill for prioritizing corporate tax cuts over healthcare, accusing Trump and congressional Republicans of writing a “$15 billion check to Meta” while cutting healthcare for millions of Americans. Senate Banking Committee’s Steps Ahead The budget bill’s passage will delay other significant crypto and digital asset legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the BITCOIN Act of 2025. Although the Senate approved the GENIUS Act on June 17, which will now move to the House, Begich noted that these bills will take a backseat until budget reconciliation processes are completed. Begich indicated that discussions around creating a national Bitcoin reserve could resume later this year or early next year, while the House has already moved the CLARITY Act, focused on digital asset market structure, out of committee. However, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to draft its own version of the bill before October, hinting at further debates in Congress around the future of digital asset regulations in the United States.

In Q1, the number of millionaire addresses actually declined by 13,942, dropping from 155,569 on January 1 to 141,627 on March 31. That decline included 12,687 fewer addresses holding $1 million and 1,255 fewer addresses holding over $10 million. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); However, Q2 delivered a sharp rebound. By June 30, the number of wallets holding at least $1 million had jumped to 161,839, an increase of 21,589 addresses in just three months. The number of $10 million+ addresses also saw a significant rise, up 5,169 over the same period, resulting in a net gain of 26,758 new millionaire wallets over H1. Bitcoin accumulation trend returns The resurgence in high-value wallet addresses reflects strong buying activity during market dips earlier in the year, as well as renewed institutional demand following the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . The April 2025 halving event, which cut block rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, also created bullish sentiment by reinforcing Bitcoin’s long-term scarcity narrative and saw the digital asset hit $111,970 on May 22, 2025. While each wallet does not represent a unique individual since some entities may control multiple addresses, the metric is widely used as a proxy for accumulation by wealthy investors, funds, and crypto-native firms. The addition of more than 26,000 new Bitcoin millionaires in just six months marks one of the strongest accumulation cycles since the 2021 bull run, potentially signaling broader market strength heading into the second half of the year.

The donation supports Buterin’s biotech research efforts through his Kanro fund, which focuses on advancing biotechnology research and philanthropic causes. CZ also mentioned additional private donations to other charities, which have yielded “good results,” that he plans to share soon. Both leaders have consistently demonstrated a commitment to utilizing their crypto wealth for humanitarian causes, ranging from disaster relief to legal defense funds and wildlife conservation.

The YZi Labs collaboration emerged from conversations about patients falling through cracks, families waiting for answers, and innovators whose voices get drowned out by established players. CZ’s genuine curiosity and resolve impressed many, with the crypto community praising his generous act. Vitalik Buterin’s biotech initiatives through Kanro fund have received substantial support from meme coin liquidations, with the Ethereum co-founder regularly converting unsolicited tokens into research funding . Recent transactions show Buterin swapping 28 different meme coins for $984,000 in USDC, which was transferred to Kanro on January 6. Source: SpotOnChain on X The approach both leaders are using extends beyond traditional crypto philanthropy; it targets fundamental system changes rather than temporary relief efforts. They prioritize backing scientists who aren’t boxed in by bureaucracy and small teams with transformative ideas. Particularly with YZi Labs, the collaboration aims to create a lasting impact through innovative biotech solutions that democratize global access to healthcare. Cryptocurrency Philanthropy Reaches New Heights CZ and Vitalik have established themselves as leading crypto philanthropists, consistently channeling digital wealth toward humanitarian causes with remarkable frequency and scale. CZ’s recent charitable activities include $605,000 in BNB donations for earthquake relief in Thailand and Myanmar , distributed through Binance platforms to affected communities. Binance co-founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao donates 1,000 BNB to help earthquake-hit communities in Myanmar and Thailand. Binance's charity initiative adds $1.5M in relief support. #CryptoPhilanthropy #CryptoRelief https://t.co/PCrg7Fmpdo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 His philanthropy extends to supporting victims of cryptocurrency scams, including a donation of 150 BNB ($100,000) to LIBRA meme coin victims and additional contributions for the TST and BROCCOLI token crashes. CZ’s donation strategy often involves sharing wallet addresses publicly. By that, he enables broader participation in the crypto community’s charitable efforts. Vitalik’s philanthropic pattern focuses on converting meme coins sent to his public wallet into charitable contributions, with over $60 million in proceeds supporting pandemic research, longevity initiatives, and AI development since 2021. His diverse giving includes $292,000 for the Moo Deng hippo conservation at Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand . Legal defense funding represents another shared philanthropic priority, with Vitalik contributing $170,000 toward the legal battles of Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev. The @ethereumfndn is set to donate $1.25 million to support @alex_pertsev 's legal defense. #TornadoCash #Ethereum https://t.co/BsNWpACiza — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 26, 2025 The Ethereum Foundation also pledged $500,000, with matching funds of up to $750,000, for Storm’s defense against federal charges. Notably, not only is money being committed, but also technical efforts. CZ’s earthquake relief distributions were facilitated through Binance’s KYC systems, demonstrating the practical applications of blockchain infrastructure for beneficial use beyond finance. The scale of crypto philanthropy continues to expand, with total donations exceeding $1 billion in 2024 , according to The Giving Block’s research. Over 70% of major US charities now accept cryptocurrency donations, with projections reaching $2.5 billion by 2025 as mainstream adoption continues to accelerate.

A U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York has ruled that Celsius Network’s lawsuit against Tether ( USDT ) can proceed, granting in part and denying in part Tether’s motion to dismiss, according to a memorandum opinion and order filed in the Celsius bankruptcy case on June 30. Celsius Network accused Tether of improperly liquidating over 39,500 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in June 2022 as crypto prices crashed. The 39,500 BTC was put up as collateral for loans Celsius took from Tether, but the crypto lender claims Tether executed a rushed “fire sale” at an average price of $20,656 per BTC — well below market value — and failed to honor a contractual 10-hour waiting period before selling collateral. Celsius claims the liquidation cost it over $4 billion at current Bitcoin prices and constituted breach of contract, bad faith dealing, and fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under U.S. bankruptcy law. You might also like: What happened to Celsius Network: a year in review In a blog post , Tether described the lawsuit as “baseless,” stating: “Under the agreement, Celsius posted bitcoin (BTC) to Tether as collateral. As the price of BTC began to fall in June 2022, the agreement required Celsius to post additional collateral to avoid the liquidation of its BTC. When Celsius chose not to post additional BTC it directed Tether to liquidate the BTC collateral Tether held in order to close out its roughly 815 million USD₮ position with Tether.” Celsius, however, contends that Tether sold the BTC at a price that nearly matched the outstanding debt — without giving Celsius a chance to post more collateral, as the agreement allegedly required. In August last year, Tether sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that its operations in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong placed the case outside U.S. jurisdiction, calling the claims an impermissible extraterritorial application of U.S. law. However, the judge found Celsius presented a plausible case that the alleged misconduct involved U.S.-based communications, personnel, and financial accounts, making the claims sufficiently domestic. While some counts were dismissed, Celsius’s core claims — including breach of contract and fraudulent transfer —will move forward in court.

Binance’s upcoming removal of several trading pairs triggered fresh price drops for the affected cryptocurrencies, highlighting how reduced liquidity and visibility can quickly lead to negative market sentiment. Embracing New Tokens The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange regularly adjusts its trading program to respond to ongoing trends and provide an enhanced user experience. Most recently, it added Newton Protocol (NEWT) and Sahara AI (SAHARA) as new loanable assets on Binance VIP Loan. This service enables high-tier users to borrow substantial amounts of crypto using their existing tokens as collateral. It offers flexible terms and low interest rates and is tailored for institutional or high-net-worth traders who require additional capital for trading or liquidity. Usually, support from Binance has a positive effect on the involved cryptocurrencies. However, this wasn’t the case with NEWT and SAHARA, which remain deep in the red zone on a daily scale. The price of the former is down by 7% within the timeframe, while the latter has recorded an 11% plunge. SAHARA Price, Source: CoinGecko Not the Only Losers Besides adding the aforementioned tokens to its VIP Loan section, Binance announced it will remove the spot trading pairs ACT/EUR, FIO/BTC, TNSR/FDUSD, and TST/FDUSD on July 4. “Users are strongly advised to update and/or cancel their Spot Trading Bots prior to the cessation of Spot Trading Bots services to avoid any potential losses,” the company warned. Withdrawn support from the company leads to reduced liquidity, diminished availability and visibility, and reputational damage. As such, it is no wonder why the prices of some of the affected assets headed south after the disclosure. FIO is the most severely affected, registering an 8% decrease over the past 24 hours. When Binance terminates all services for particular cryptocurrencies, the losses are typically even greater. Such was the case in April this year when the company’s delisting effort triggered double-digit declines for Alpaca Finance (ALPACA), PlayDapp (PDA), Viberate (VIB), and Wing Finance (WING). Something similar happened during the same month when Binance removed 14 altcoins from its platform. Some of the impacted tokens, like CREAM, saw their prices crash by nearly 60% following the news.

Firms from Europe to Asia and Africa are now testing or deploying large language models from Chinese players, among them newcomer DeepSeek and e‑commerce heavyweight Alibaba, as cost‑effective alternatives to US incumbents like ChatGPT. Big firms trial Chinese models like DeepSeek Global lenders such as HSBC and Standard Chartered have quietly begun internal trials of DeepSeek’s models , according to insiders. These tests indicate finance giants are seeking flexible, wallet‑friendly AI solutions beyond the usual American suspects. The move suggests a growing appetite for diverse AI providers, especially when budgets and data‑security policies come into play. Big US firms have acknowledged that Chinese AI firms are fast closing in on their US peers. Even the energy sector is jumping on board. Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, has integrated DeepSeek into its primary data center, reflecting confidence in Chinese AI capabilities. In a twist, major American cloud services, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, now offer DeepSeek models to their customers. That’s despite the White House restricting the app on certain government devices over security worries. Such availability marks a striking reversal: U.S. platforms distributing a Chinese AI product alongside their own homegrown solutions. The appeal of Chinese AI isn’t just about price. A June study by Harvard researchers found that China holds strategic advantages in the raw data and skilled talent that underpin AI development. Fast adoption will determine who sins the race between US and China Meanwhile, Western chipmakers are already feeling the pinch: when US authorities blocked Nvidia’s export‑friendly H20 AI chip to China, analysts estimated a $10 billion revenue hit for Nvidia. “The No. 1 factor that will define whether the US or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a recent Senate hearing. “Whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant.” American champions like OpenAI have responded with an overseas push, opening new offices in Europe and Asia. On June 25, OpenAI warned that China’s Zhipu AI is targeting emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa, aiming to cement Chinese standards before US or European rivals can gain traction. CEO Sam Altman has framed this as a battle between “democratic AI” and “authoritarian AI,” though critics note both sides court government clients. Unlike their US counterparts, many Chinese firms prioritize immediate, tangible applications over the grand quest for artificial general intelligence. They often release their models under open‑source licenses, Alibaba’s Qwen has already spawned over 100,000 derivative versions, allowing users worldwide to tweak and deploy them freely. Such openness pressures privately held companies like OpenAI and Anthropic to explain why their proprietary models carry hefty price tags. On platforms like Latenode, roughly one in five customers now choose DeepSeek for custom AI tools, drawn by a price tag up to 17 times lower than competing options. That’s especially true in regions where both funding and compute resources are scarce. Yet the splintering of global AI also raises concerns. A bifurcated ecosystem could hinder the US’ ability to shape international norms, and some observers fear Chinese models might serve as vectors for state‑approved narratives. The US also risks losing insight into China’s ambitions and AI innovations, according to Ritwik Gupta, Al policy fellow at the University of California, Berkeley. “If they are dependent on the global ecosystem, then we can govern it,” said Gupta. “If not, China is going to do what it is going to do, and we won’t have visibility.” Moreover, with fewer US investments and tighter immigration rules, the traditional flow of talent and insight between Silicon Valley and Beijing is drying up. As long as China’s AI sector remains partly insulated from Western oversight, analysts warn, global transparency and shared standards may be the real casualties.

The rebound has put majority of investors in the green, but recent data suggests little appetite for selling According to a July 1 Glassnode report , Bitcoin ( BTC ) investors are sitting on $1.2 trillion in unrealized profits. This figure comes from the gap between Bitcoin’s $2.1 trillion market cap and its $955 billion realized cap, a metric that values each coin at the last time it moved. The trend is largely driven by long-term holders, who now control a record 14.7 million BTC, reinforcing the idea that most investors are simply not interested in selling at current prices. Daily profit-taking among investors has also cooled to under $900 million, significantly below the $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion levels seen during previous peaks. Bitcoin’s unrealized profit/loss chart |Source: Glassnode Despite last weekend’s drop from $106K to $99K during the Israel-Iran tensions, positive sentiment did not shake. Bitcoin bounced off the short-term holder cost basis of $98.3K, a key support level that often signals broader market direction. The quick recovery held up the positive momentum, keeping most investors in profit. You might also like: Bitcoin breaks through $107,000, is the stagnant period over? On-chain records also support the HODLing narrative. The Liveliness metric, which compares spending to holding activity, has continued to decline, a sign that more assets are being held than moved. Similarly, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has dropped off, showing that realized profit and loss-taking is minimal despite the high prices. Meanwhile, stablecoin data paints a picture of a balanced market. Buying power looks steady, with no major inflows or signs of panic. Glassnode’s analysis shows that traders view the current price range as fair value, with little urgency to chase higher or dump holdings. Institutional interest also remains strong. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to attract consistent inflows , with a recent seven-day average of $298 million. The increasing demand adds buying pressure and acts as a tailwind for BTC’s growing $2 trillion market cap.

The Berlin-based fintech’s platform allows crypto firms, payment service providers (PSPs) and e-commerce merchants to instantly make bank payments, settle funds to local collection accounts across Europe in multiple currencies, and seamlessly convert them into stablecoins, according to a Wednesday press release. The deal makes Ivy one of the first platforms offering instant bank payments to enable seamless settlement in USDC, the second-largest dollar stablecoin, and EURC, the largest euro stablecoin, the release said. Stablecoins, which became a convenient cornerstone of crypto trading partly thanks to the blockchain industry’s tricky relationship with the banking world, are becoming a prominent payment mechanism across the internet. Circle, which this year completed an IPO in the U.S., has turned some of its focus to global payments and remittances with the introduction of the Circle Payments Network (CPN) in April. “Real-time payment rails and stablecoins belong together,” said Ferdinand Dabitz, CEO and do-founder of Ivy. “Hundreds of merchants are already building on Ivy’s global API for instant bank payments.

47253530,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73126,1751450401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Top Low Cap to Buy Now, Outpaces Solana (SOL) in Q3 Forecast, Still Under $0.04",https://timestabloid.com/top-low-cap-to-buy-now-outpaces-solana-sol-in-q3-forecast/,"Solana (SOL) is staging a strong comeback heading into Q3, but a different asset is drawing attention from both whales and retail investors alike. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in Phase 5 of its presale and priced at just $0.03, has already raised $11.4 million and attracted over 12,700 holders. Backed by a robust yield strategy and Layer-2 scaling, this emerging DeFi token is offering not only real financial upside but also the infrastructure that sets it apart from Layer-1 tokens like SOL. While SOL’s gains are largely based on network activity and general ecosystem optimism, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being adopted by those who are seeking more than just momentum—they’re seeking actual income generation. The current presale round still gives investors entry at an undervalued stage, with a price expected to rise in the next phase. It’s why some are saying this might be the most strategic low-cap buy before Q3 accelerates. Capital Shift: From SOL Dominance to Yield-Driven Preference One of the most significant moves recently came from a seasoned Solana (SOL) holder who chose to reallocate $50,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during the early presale rounds. This investor had already captured strong returns during SOL’s prior rally but wanted to diversify into a platform engineered for consistent, yield-driven growth rather than pure market speculation. By entering at $0.02, the allocation secured 2,500,000 tokens, establishing a sizable position at an early valuation. As the presale advanced to $0.04, that same stake doubled to $100,000—all before a single centralized exchange listing. Mutuum’s unique design appeals to both categories. Depositors who supply $10,000 worth of ETH into the P2C vault will receive mtETH tokens in 1:1—liquid representations of their stake, growing automatically with interest based on pool utilization. As vault demand rises, APYs climb accordingly, often reaching 13–15%. What sets Mutuum apart from standard staking chains like Solana (SOL) is that mtTokens will not be just placeholders. Once issued, they will be eligible for secondary dividends. Staking them in designated contracts allows users to receive MUTM token distributions purchased by the protocol using revenue from loan activity. The combined return will push total annual yield to nearly 20%—significantly outperforming Solana (SOL)’s fixed staking yield. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a much deeper income mechanism. While SOL holders are locked into a single reward stream, MUTM depositors earn in layers: first from lending, then from staking, and finally through the protocol’s upcoming token buyback model that supports long-term holders with periodic distribution cycles. Infrastructure and Roadmap: L2 Speed and Beta Utility Beyond its passive income structure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also being built for practical usage. With its beta platform scheduled to launch alongside the public listing of the MUTM token, the protocol is aligning product with token utility from the beginning. This tight correlation between roadmap and capital unlock is another reason analysts see a sharper upside in the short term. Layer-2 integration is already part of the development pipeline, ensuring that all lending, borrowing, and stablecoin transactions will be executed with lower costs and faster speeds. This upgrade will reduce friction for borrowers and enhance usability, especially when collateral-based stablecoin minting begins. The protocol’s decentralized stablecoin is another key innovation. This dollar-pegged asset will only be minted when users borrow against assets like ETH or BTC, and it will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. It will use interest-rate adjustments and arbitrage mechanisms to stay close to its $1 peg—making it a trustworthy liquidity tool within the Mutuum ecosystem. Security is also being emphasized. A full CertiK audit has been completed, with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77. To further strengthen confidence, a $50,000 bug bounty program is now live, rewarding anyone who helps improve the platform’s safety across critical, major, minor, and low-risk categories. The platform is also running a $100K giveaway to further strengthen its community growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is combining decentralized finance with transparency, automation, and user rewards—at a stage where entry is still priced at just $0.03. Analysts tracking presale metrics are forecasting a potential move to $0.09 by the end of Q3, suggesting a 3X return from current levels. Unlike Solana (SOL), where value depends heavily on external developer activity, Mutuum’s growth will be directly tied to protocol usage and yield delivery. As Solana (SOL) climbs off the back of ecosystem momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is charting a different path—one grounded in stablecoin innovation, passive income, and smart capital flows. And with Phase 5 still open at under $0.04, this entry point offers one of the strongest asymmetric bets heading into the next quarter.

Echo’s TGE follows a period of record-breaking growth and community engagement, underpinned by participation in Aptos Foundation’s LFM program—a premier initiative that provides hands-on guidance to Aptos-native projects preparing for major product and token launches. Driving the BTCfi Momentum on Aptos With over $285 million in aBTC minted and Echo securing 65% of all bridged BTC assets on Aptos, the protocol has emerged as a key player in the growth of BTCfi (Bitcoin DeFi) on Aptos. Echo enables users to unlock yield opportunities on their Bitcoin holdings via aBTC—a cross-chain liquid Bitcoin token, backed 1:1 by BTC—while powering liquidity and collateral mobility across Aptos-native DeFi protocols. Echo recently surpassed an all-time high of $878 million in TVL, fueled by incentive campaigns, integrations with leading DeFi projects in the Aptos ecosystem and high user engagement. To date, the protocol is responsible for more than 1 million user transactions and 60,000 daily active users. “The launch of the ECHO token marks a major milestone in our mission to bring BTCfi to life. With this TGE, we are unlocking a new phase of growth for our ecosystem and creating real opportunities for users, builders and the broader Aptos community,” said Jonathan Phay, Co-Founder of Echo Protocol. Accelerating Growth with Aptos LFM Program Echo’s rapid evolution has been supported through participation in Aptos Foundation’s LFM program, which offers strategic mentorship, marketing resources and ecosystem-wide support for Aptos-native projects preparing for TGEs and beyond. “Echo Protocol has been instrumental in making BTC a productive, on-chain asset within the Aptos ecosystem,” said Ash Pampati, Head of Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation. “This a major milestone—not just for Echo, but for BTCfi adoption on Aptos as a whole.

The conversation was framed around a new article published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on June 24, which warns about the systemic risks posed by stablecoins. According to the BIS report cited in the discussion, stablecoins threaten monetary sovereignty and can undermine capital markets. Farina and Aljarrah specifically highlighted the long-standing concerns over Tether’s operational model, its lack of transparency, and historical regulatory issues. The BIS article aligns with tightening regulations in Europe that have effectively excluded Tether from operating within the region. Both speakers pointed out that the increasing scrutiny of Tether signals the beginning of a significant market shift. BTC Demand CRASHES as XRP Adoption Surges https://t.co/9x2yl91jvK — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 30, 2025 Stablecoin Risks and Regulatory Crackdown Farina and Aljarrah stated that although XRP and other utility-based assets might experience short-term market turbulence, they are likely to benefit from the reallocation of liquidity away from speculative assets. They cited XRP, XLM, HBAR, and Algorand as examples of blockchains that are technically efficient, fully auditable, and better prepared to comply with evolving regulatory standards. This preparedness makes these networks attractive for future institutional use cases as the tokenization of real-world assets becomes mainstream. A major part of their conversation focused on Tether’s position in the market. Aljarrah described Tether as functioning like an unregulated shadow bank, suggesting that it produces synthetic dollars without proper oversight. He warned that Tether’s eventual collapse is probable and could become a justification for governments to introduce sweeping regulations alongside government-backed stablecoins. According to them, this scenario would fundamentally change the structure of the crypto market. Bitcoin’s Demand Collapse Raises Concerns Farina also raised concerns about Bitcoin’s recent price movement. Despite being near its all-time highs, Bitcoin’s demand metrics suggest weakening interest. He pointed out that Google search trends and trading volumes for Bitcoin are at historically low levels relative to its price, indicating that the rally may not be sustainable. Farina believes the current surge is driven largely by retail speculation rather than institutional demand, making it vulnerable to an abrupt correction. They further referenced Tether’s past regulatory issues, including a $42.5 million fine imposed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2021 for misleading statements regarding its reserves. Farina and Aljarrah described Tether as the linchpin of a speculative market structure that is at significant risk of collapsing once governments finalize and deploy tokenized financial infrastructures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned for the Utility-Driven Future A core emphasis of their discussion was the shift towards real-world utility. They suggested that the forthcoming regulatory overhaul will result in the elimination of non-compliant crypto projects. This process, in their view, will favor networks like the XRP Ledger, which offers consistent transaction costs, real-time auditability, and scalability for institutional use . The conversation included a video clip featuring Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who explained how XRP’s design aligns with institutional requirements, particularly highlighting features like predictable fees and auditability. Additionally, Schwartz’s remarks, shared during the discussion, projected that hundreds of billions of dollars in tokenized real-world assets are likely to move onto the XRP Ledger . Schwartz argued that XRP offers capabilities that many other blockchains cannot provide, specifically the ability for institutions to verify transactions in real time without relying on external intermediaries. This function reduces operational costs and minimizes counterparty risks. Farina and Aljarrah stressed that the cryptocurrency market is entering a transitional phase. They argued that XRP and similar utility-driven blockchains are well-positioned to thrive in a regulated environment focused on compliance, interoperability, and tangible utility. Meanwhile, assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether face increasing pressure from both regulatory bodies and the inherent limitations of their technical frameworks. Farina’s assessment ultimately pointed to a significant decline in Bitcoin demand, coinciding with rising adoption of XRP as institutional participants begin prioritizing compliance and real-world use cases over speculative trading models.

Oops! Let’s dive into the whole story. $10M Bitcoin Bar Comes to Life Originally purchased for just $500 in 2012, the Casascius bar held 100 BTC, now worth over $10 million. After 13 years of dormancy, the owner finally unsealed the bar’s mini-key hologram and moved the coins into new wallets. He didn’t cash out. Instead, recognizing the sheer value now attached to a single physical wallet, he opted to split the BTC across multiple addresses, a move aimed more at security than liquidation. What Are Casascius Bars? Casascius bars, minted during Bitcoin’s early years, are now collector’s treasures. Only 35 unopened 100-BTC bars are believed to exist, according to Casascius records. These gold-plated pieces carry embedded private keys and were once traded freely, even fetching 125 BTC during their heyday. But the market has since dried up. Today, they’re mostly auctioned as high-value novelty items, with physical security a rising concern. Crypto Community Reacts News of the redemption quickly lit up crypto Twitter. Crypto analyst @TheBTCTherapist, reacted: “Holy shit. $10 million dollar profit”. Holy shit. $10 million dollar profit pic.twitter.com/cLkvhq7EPs — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) July 2, 2025 Another user tweeted: “We have to all agree this is the best ROI”. It certainly seemed like it. Until… Mini-Key Mistake Costs $50K+ in Forked Coins The redemption might have gone down as a masterstroke of patience, if not for a critical slip. The owner posted the mini-seed on Bitcointalk forum, outlining his process to access the bar’s funds. That move cost him dearly. Since the wallet predated major forks like Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and BSV, it also held rights to those coins. Within moments of the seed going public, someone swept 100 BCH, worth over $50,000, and additional forked coins. THIS IS WHY YOU DON’T POST YOUR PRIVATE KEYS… EVER “Okay, so remember how I mentioned I had one of those Casascius Bitcoin bars? Yeah, it’s a 100 BTC one, and I got it back in 2012 for like $500. Now that it’s worth over $10 million, I knew I couldn’t keep just sitting on it.… pic.twitter.com/BMWVkr7ogp — parachutes₿ (@parachutesBTC) July 1, 2025 A user named Nexusrushrush later admitted to the grab but returned the BCH to the original address, by then already compromised and open to further theft.

Yet, beneath the charts and headlines, lies a powerful, often overlooked force: human emotion. This is where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index steps in, offering a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of crypto investors. As of July 2, this crucial barometer, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 63. While this marks a slight dip of one point from the previous day, it importantly keeps the index firmly planted in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your investments, and how can you leverage this insight for more informed decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 63 Mean for You? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is designed to distill the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a spectrum where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. Think of it as a market thermometer for sentiment, gauging whether participants are feeling overly cautious or excessively exuberant. A reading of 63, as we see currently, places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory. This suggests that investors are generally optimistic, confident, and perhaps even a little overzealous. While greed can fuel price rallies, pushing assets higher as more people pile in, it also carries inherent risks. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections, as the market becomes overbought and vulnerable to profit-taking or unexpected negative news. Conversely, extreme fear (readings closer to 0) often signals market bottoms, presenting potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the prevailing sentiment. The index serves as a valuable counter-indicator for many experienced traders. When the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, they might consider taking profits or reducing exposure, anticipating a potential downturn. When it’s in ‘Extreme Fear’, they might see it as a chance to accumulate assets at a discount, knowing that fear often leads to irrational selling. It’s a reminder that emotions, while powerful, can often lead to suboptimal investment decisions if not properly understood and managed. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: How is it Measured? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s a weighted average of several key factors, each contributing to the overall crypto market sentiment . By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state. Here’s a breakdown of the six factors considered: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, can indicate fear, while stable or upward volatility might suggest confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin and compares it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong upward momentum often correlate with greed, whereas low volume and downward momentum can signal fear. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for specific keywords related to cryptocurrency. It assesses the number of posts, their engagement, and the sentiment behind them. A surge in positive, hyped discussions can indicate greed, while negative, panic-driven conversations suggest fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, this component involved weekly polls to gather direct sentiment from investors. However, it’s important to note that the index currently states that surveys are paused. When active, these surveys offered a direct insight into investor expectations and confidence levels. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization share relative to the entire cryptocurrency market. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear, as investors tend to flee riskier altcoins and consolidate into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven. Conversely, a falling dominance might suggest greed, as investors move into higher-risk, higher-reward altcoins. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes search query data for Bitcoin-related terms on Google. A sudden increase in search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash’ indicates fear, while a rise in general interest searches might suggest growing optimism or curiosity. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond just price action to capture the underlying mood. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics While the index considers the broader crypto market, Bitcoin dominance plays a uniquely significant role, accounting for 10% of the overall score. But what exactly is Bitcoin dominance, and why does it matter so much to the Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin dominance refers to the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. For example, if Bitcoin’s market cap is $500 billion and the total crypto market cap is $1 trillion, then Bitcoin dominance is 50%. This metric is often seen as a bellwether for market sentiment and the overall health of the altcoin market. Historically, a rising Bitcoin dominance often occurs during periods of market uncertainty or downturns. When investors become fearful, they tend to sell off their more volatile altcoins and consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, which is perceived as the less risky, more established digital asset. This flight to ‘safety’ within the crypto ecosystem drives Bitcoin’s market share higher, signaling fear or caution. Conversely, during bull markets, especially in the later stages, Bitcoin dominance often falls as investors become more confident and speculate on higher returns from altcoins, leading to an ‘altcoin season’. A falling dominance, therefore, can sometimes be associated with increasing greed and risk appetite. The index incorporates Bitcoin dominance because it offers a unique perspective on investor risk appetite. If Bitcoin’s share is growing, it suggests a defensive posture, a sign of fear. If it’s shrinking, it indicates a willingness to take on more risk, a sign of greed. This dynamic interplay highlights how even within the crypto market, different assets serve different psychological roles for investors, influencing the collective sentiment that the index captures. Navigating Investor Psychology: Are We Too Greedy? The core of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is rooted in investor psychology . Human emotions are powerful drivers, and in financial markets, they often lead to irrational decisions. When fear takes hold, people panic sell, often at the worst possible time. When greed reigns supreme, they buy impulsively, often at market tops, chasing quick profits. Consider the classic market cycle: accumulation, uptrend, distribution, downtrend. Each phase is heavily influenced by the prevailing emotions of market participants. During accumulation, fear is high, and few dare to buy. As the uptrend begins, optimism grows, eventually leading to euphoria and extreme greed at the peak. This is when everyone wants in, often fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). However, it’s precisely at this point of maximum enthusiasm that smart money often begins to distribute, or sell, their holdings. Conversely, as prices fall, optimism turns to denial, then fear, and eventually capitulation, or extreme fear. This is when many retail investors give up, selling their assets at a loss, often at the very bottom, just before a new accumulation phase begins. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index attempts to quantify these emotional extremes, providing a tool to help investors recognize where the market might be in its emotional cycle. Being in the ‘Greed’ zone at 63 means that while the market isn’t at ‘Extreme Greed’ (which would be 75-100), there’s a strong underlying positive sentiment. This could mean continued upward momentum, but it also warrants caution. It’s a psychological trigger for investors to ask themselves: Am I making decisions based on sound analysis, or am I being swayed by the prevailing optimism? Understanding this psychological dynamic is crucial for long-term success in volatile markets like crypto. Actionable Insights for Your Market Analysis So, how can you effectively use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for your own market analysis and investment strategy? It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s a powerful tool when used correctly: 1. The Contrarian Approach: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful This timeless investing adage, often attributed to Warren Buffett, is perhaps the most direct application of the Fear & Greed Index. When the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), it might be a good time to consider taking some profits or reducing your exposure. The market could be overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, when the index plummets into ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-25), it could signal a generational buying opportunity, as assets are likely oversold due to panic. This requires courage and a strong conviction in your long-term investment thesis, as it means going against the crowd. 2. Complement, Don’t Rely Solely The index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It should always be used in conjunction with other forms of market analysis. Combine it with technical analysis (chart patterns, support/resistance levels, moving averages), fundamental analysis (project developments, adoption rates, regulatory news), and macroeconomic factors (inflation, interest rates, global events). If the index shows ‘Greed’ but your technical indicators are signaling overbought conditions and there’s negative news on the horizon, your caution should intensify. 3. Risk Management and Portfolio Adjustments Use the index to guide your risk management. During periods of ‘Greed’, consider reducing your position sizes or setting tighter stop-losses. During ‘Fear’, you might allocate a larger portion of your capital to new entries, assuming your research supports the underlying assets. It can help you determine whether to be more aggressive or more conservative with your portfolio allocation. 4. Understanding Market Cycles The index provides a visual representation of market cycles driven by emotion. By observing its fluctuations over time, you can gain a better understanding of how sentiment shifts and how these shifts often precede price movements. This long-term perspective can help you avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market noise. Challenges and Limitations: Not a Predictor: The index indicates current sentiment, not future price action with certainty. A market can remain ‘Greedy’ for extended periods, or ‘Fearful’ for longer than anticipated. Bitcoin-Centric: While it uses various factors, its heavy reliance on Bitcoin data means it might not perfectly reflect the sentiment of the entire altcoin market, especially smaller cap coins. Lagging vs. Leading: Some components of the index can be lagging indicators, meaning they reflect what has already happened rather than what will happen next. Surveys Paused: The absence of the survey component means one direct measure of investor opinion is currently missing, which could slightly alter its overall accuracy. Despite these limitations, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an invaluable tool for any serious crypto investor looking to gain an edge by understanding the powerful role of human emotion in the markets. What’s Next for Crypto Market Sentiment? With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding steady in the ‘Greed’ zone at 63, the immediate outlook suggests continued optimism, albeit with a slight cooling off. The one-point dip could be a minor correction, profit-taking, or a brief moment of hesitation before the market decides its next major move. It’s a healthy sign that the market isn’t yet in ‘Extreme Greed’, which often precedes significant pullbacks. This slight moderation indicates that while confidence is high, it’s not yet at a frothy, unsustainable level. Going forward, keep an eye on the factors that influence the index. A sustained increase in volatility, particularly to the downside, or a sharp rise in Bitcoin dominance could push the index back towards ‘Fear’. Conversely, strong buying volume, positive social media sentiment, and sustained upward price momentum could propel it further into ‘Extreme Greed’. Macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and major project updates will also play a significant role in swaying collective sentiment. As always, staying informed and adapting your strategy to changing market conditions will be key. Concluding Thoughts: Mastering Emotional Investing The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a mirror reflecting the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Its current reading of 63, comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, reminds us that optimism prevails, yet a slight pullback indicates a healthy dose of caution. By understanding the components of this index – from volatility and market momentum to Bitcoin dominance and investor psychology – you gain a powerful lens through which to view the market. It empowers you to move beyond impulsive decisions driven by emotion and instead, adopt a more strategic approach to your market analysis . While it should never be your sole guide, integrating this index into your broader investment framework can significantly enhance your ability to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of cryptocurrencies, helping you to ‘be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.’ To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

Chainlink ( LINK ), the largest oracle in the cryptocurrency industry, trades at $13.12, down 26% from its highest point in May and 57% lower than its November high. LINK has crashed despite having some notable news in the past few weeks. For example, Chainlink launched a major partnership with Mastercard, the second-biggest payment processor globally. This partnership will enable people to buy crypto directly using their cards, with Chainlink providing verification and synchronization solutions. The partnership also included companies like Shift4 Payments and Uniswap ( UNI ).

Other companies in the alliance are Kraken, Solana, Alchemy Pay, Jupiter, and Raydium. Its Oracle solutions will enable tokenized stocks to be available to investors globally. On-chain data is also bullish on Chainlink. For example, Santiment data shows that there are now 208 million LINK tokens on exchanges, down from 212 million last month. This decline is notable because it comes after the volume surged in June. Also, the Mean Dollar Invested Age or MDIA has continue soaring this year, reaching a high of 129.50, up from a low of 110 in April. The rising MDIA indicator is a sign that investors continue to hold their tokens. LINK on-chain data | Source: Santiment Chainlink price technical analysis LINK chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the LINK price is sending mixed signals on what to expect. On the positive side, the token has formed a double-bottom pattern at $10.9 and a neckline at $17.90. A double bottom is a highly accurate bullish sign in technical analysis. If this happens, the initial target to watch will be at $17.90, followed by the psychological point at $20. On the other side, the token remains below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that the bearish trend is intact. It has also formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, with the current phase being the handle section. If this pattern is an inverse C&H instead of a double-bottom, it means that the price will continue falling, potentially to $10. Therefore, the key level to watch will be $10.91, the double-bottom or the lower side of the inverse C&H. A break below that level will confirm the bearish breakdown and point to further downside.

In a Tuesday announcement, Coinbase confirmed it would list Wormhole ( W ) on July 2 as an SPL token on the Solana network. Listings on major exchanges such as Coinbase often generate short-term bullish sentiment; however, in this case, the token has failed to attract meaningful investor interest ahead of the event. This listing comes shortly after Wormhole entered into a strategic partnership with Ripple Labs to integrate multi-chain interoperability with the XRP Ledger and its EVM-compatible sidechain. By enabling cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and multi-chain token issuance, the partnership aims to strengthen the XRP Ledger’s capabilities. Yet these developments have failed to improve investor sentiment, as evident by Wormhole’s price action, which remains subdued. The token is currently down 77.6% year-to-date. After falling to an all-time low of $0.051 on June 22, it has only managed a modest recovery to $0.071 at the time of writing.

According to data from IntoTheBlock, 92% of Wormhole addresses are currently in losses, with 88% of the circulating supply concentrated in the hands of whales. This distribution raises the risk of large-scale sell-offs as these holders may seek to mitigate further losses, which could exacerbate price volatility. Source: IntoTheBlock Additional data from Nansen highlights further weakness in investor confidence. Influencers and publicly known accounts have reportedly been offloading their Wormhole holdings over the past week. Such actions by high-visibility figures often trigger negative sentiment among retail investors, adding to the selling pressure and undermining broader market support. W price analysis Wormhole’s market structure is also showing signs of stress, with a bearish pattern forming. On the 4-hour W/USDT chart, the token has broken below the lower boundary of an ascending broadening wedge, a volatile and typically bearish structure that had been forming since the token’s recent local bottom. W 4-hour price chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news An ascending broadening wedge is characterized by expanding price swings and rising trendlines, which often means markets are becoming unstable and losing directional conviction. A breakdown below the lower trendline generally signals that bearish pressure is mounting and that a further drop may follow. Momentum indicators support this bearish outlook. The MACD lines have crossed to the downside, while the Relative Strength Index has retreated to neutral levels at 50. This suggests that bullish momentum has dissipated, and sellers are taking over. A negative Chaikin Money Flow reading further confirms this trend. W MACD and RSI chart — July 1 | Source: crypto.news Given these conditions, W may be poised to retest the $0.066 level, which corresponds with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement zone. A decisive break below this support could expose the token to further losses, potentially leading to a retest of its all-time low at $0.051. This level may serve as a temporary support zone, provided selling pressure eases. However, failure to hold above it could result in a deeper price correction.

According to a July 1 press release , USD Coin ( USDC ) stablecoin issuer Circle is preparing to roll out Gateway, a new infrastructure layer that enables instant cross-chain USDC liquidity without the need for traditional bridging. The system aims to address the fragmentation of liquidity and user experience issues caused by isolated blockchain networks.

You might also like: Circle’s ‘compliant’ USDC is the go-to for DPRK hackers: ZachXBT To tackle this, Gateway introduces a non-custodial smart contract that allows users to deposit USDC into a unified balance. That balance can then be accessed in real time across supported networks, without manual asset transfers or network switching. “Today’s multichain landscape poses fundamental challenges to mainstream adoption, the statement read. “Gateway makes it possible to build experiences where access to USDC is truly instant, universal, and chain-agnostic, while users retain full ownership and control of their assets.” For businesses, Gateway reduces the need to maintain USDC balances across multiple chains by enabling on-demand liquidity on supported chains, which may improve capital efficiency and reduce operational costs. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described the system as “totally seamless crosschain UX for USDC,” adding that the launch comes “just in time for mainstream scale adoption of stablecoin money.” Testnet support for Gateway is expected to go live in July on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Base, with additional chains to follow. Meanwhile, Circle recently applied for a national trust bank charter from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, seeking authorization to manage the reserves backing USDC and offer digital asset custody services to institutional clients.

This monumental funding is earmarked specifically for Ethereum purchases , signaling a strategic pivot for the company and prompting a closer look at its implications for the evolving crypto landscape. Bit Digital’s Bold Shift: Why Ethereum Purchases? For a company primarily known for its Bitcoin mining operations, the decision to allocate such a significant sum towards Ethereum is noteworthy. Bit Digital’s move suggests a calculated strategy to diversify its digital asset holdings and potentially capitalize on the growth trajectory of the Ethereum ecosystem. While Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum’s utility as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols presents a compelling case for investment. This strategic shift could be interpreted as Bit Digital preparing for the future of blockchain. With Ethereum’s highly anticipated transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, traditional GPU-based mining for ETH will cease. By acquiring Ethereum directly, Bit Digital positions itself to potentially engage in ETH staking, which offers a different revenue model compared to mining. This proactive approach could secure future income streams and reduce reliance on energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) operations, aligning with broader industry trends towards sustainability. Understanding the Public Offering: A Strategic Move The $162.9 million was raised through an underwritten public offering , a common method for publicly traded companies to raise capital. In this type of offering, an investment bank (the underwriter) agrees to purchase and resell a company’s shares to the public. This mechanism provides a guaranteed amount of capital to the company, albeit often at a discount to the market price, and helps ensure the success of the offering. For Bit Digital, this offering provides a significant cash reserve without incurring debt. This fresh capital infusion empowers the company to execute its strategic vision for Ethereum without immediate financial constraints. While public offerings can lead to a dilution of existing shares, the substantial capital raised for a clear strategic purpose often outweighs this concern for investors who believe in the company’s long-term growth prospects. It underscores Bit Digital’s commitment to transparency and compliance as a Nasdaq-listed entity, adhering to stringent regulatory requirements. The Evolving Landscape of Crypto Mining The crypto mining industry is in a constant state of flux, driven by technological advancements, market dynamics, and regulatory scrutiny. High energy costs, increasing network difficulty, and environmental concerns have pushed many miners to innovate and diversify. Bit Digital’s move to invest heavily in Ethereum rather than solely expanding its Bitcoin mining fleet reflects a broader trend of adaptation within the sector. This decision highlights a potential shift in focus for some miners from purely computational power (PoW) to asset management and staking (PoS). It suggests that successful crypto companies in the future might need a more versatile business model that can adapt to different blockchain technologies and revenue generation opportunities beyond just mining new coins. Bit Digital’s proactive stance could serve as a case study for other mining operations considering their long-term viability in an increasingly competitive and evolving environment. What Does This Mean for BTBT Stock and Investors? The announcement of such a significant capital raise, coupled with a clear strategic direction towards Ethereum purchases , can have a multifaceted impact on BTBT stock . On one hand, the substantial cash injection provides financial stability and the means to pursue growth initiatives, which can be viewed positively by investors. The strategic diversification into Ethereum, a major asset with a robust ecosystem, could also reduce the company’s singular reliance on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. However, investors should also consider potential risks. The success of this strategy hinges on the performance of Ethereum and Bit Digital’s ability to effectively manage and potentially stake its ETH holdings. Market volatility remains a key factor in the cryptocurrency space. For investors considering BTBT stock, it will be crucial to monitor the execution of this strategy, Ethereum’s price performance, and any future announcements regarding Bit Digital’s staking operations or further diversification efforts. This move positions Bit Digital for potential future growth but also introduces new layers of market exposure. A Forward-Looking Strategy Bit Digital’s decision to raise $162.9 million for Ethereum purchases through a public offering is a powerful statement about its vision for the future. It signifies a strategic evolution from a pure-play Bitcoin miner to a more diversified digital asset company, positioning itself to capitalize on opportunities within the broader cryptocurrency landscape, particularly in the thriving Ethereum ecosystem. This move could pave the way for increased profitability and resilience, showcasing how established players are adapting to the dynamic and ever-evolving world of blockchain technology.

End of an Era for Grayscale Trust Arbitrage For years, Grayscale’s crypto trusts provided investors with a unique arbitrage opportunity, allowing them to profit from premiums or discounts relative to the net asset value (NAV) due to the trust’s lock-up periods and lack of in-kind redemptions. However, these opportunities have narrowed as Grayscale transitions its private trusts into ETFs, aligning the share value more closely with the underlying assets. In a letter accompanying the SEC’s approval, Grayscale stated , “The investment objective of the Fund is for the value of the shares to reflect the value of the digital assets held by the Fund, ‘Fund Components’ as determined by reference to their respective Index Prices and weightings within the Fund, less the Fund’s expenses and other liabilities.” The move underscores the maturation of the crypto investment landscape, as products once viewed as niche and risky are now transitioning to structures that align with traditional financial markets, increasing accessibility for a broader range of investors. Legal Battle Paved the Way Grayscale’s approval comes after a hard-fought legal battle with the SEC. In June 2022, the company filed a petition to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF following a denial from the regulator. The dispute lasted over a year until a U.S. judge ruled in August 2023 that the SEC’s denial was “arbitrary and capricious,” granting Grayscale the right to proceed with the conversion. Today, Grayscale’s Bitcoin trust trades as an ETF with a 1.5% expense ratio, making it the most expensive Bitcoin ETF on the market while also standing as the highest-grossing Bitcoin investment product.

According to data from 10x Research, the rolling three-month basis on CME Bitcoin futures has fallen to just 4.3%, a level not seen since October 2023. The figure recorded is a downturn from levels above 10% seen earlier in 2025, and could mean institutional interest in the largest crypto by market cap is dwindling, heading into the third quarter of 2025. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $107,700, an uptick of about 1% over the last 24 hours. Over the past two weeks, the coin has been consolidating in a tight range between $105,000 and $107,700. The decline in futures premiums spells a loss of forward-looking enthusiasm among professional investors. The drop in what is known as the “basis,” the difference between futures and spot prices, translates to a reduction in arbitrage opportunities and an undefined near-term price direction. Institutional retreat from arbitrage market positions According to CME data from Q2, public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 131,000 BTC, a surge of 18%, while ETF inflows rose by approximately 8%, an additional 111,000 BTC. These figures indicate that institutional interest in Bitcoin was initially present, at least in aggregate. However, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said the drop in yield spreads shows how institutions are less confident about a Bitcoin price move on the upper side. “When yield spreads fall below a 10% hurdle rate, Bitcoin ETF inflows are typically driven by directional investors rather than arbitrage-focused hedge funds,” he explained. CME basis rates now lie around 4.3% and perpetual funding rates around 1.0%, which means the environment is becoming less favorable for cash-and-carry strategists. In most cash-and-carry trades, hedge funds exploit price discrepancies between spot and futures markets by simultaneously buying Bitcoin via ETFs and selling futures to lock in a yield. That opportunity is drying up. Not many funds are now willing to deploy capital for the slim return, owing to the sentiment of a “risky environment.” Funding rates negative, retail momentum stalls The softening in CME premiums comes against the backdrop of negative funding rates in perpetual futures in offshore exchanges. These rates recently flipped below zero, implying that traders are paying for short positions, another indication of bearish bias in derivatives markets. Weekly distributions of annualized CEX Funding Rates and CME Basis for BTC and ETH. Source: Padalan Capital Padalan Capital, in a weekly market update , coined the funding slide “a symptom of broader speculative fatigue.” “A more acute signal of risk-off positioning comes from regulated venues, where the CME-to-spot basis for both Bitcoin and Ethereum has inverted into deeply negative territory,” the firm remarked. Institutions are more than likely seeking safety ahead of the second half of the year, as most CME gaps were filled before Bitcoin’s breakout to new all-time highs late May. Bitcoin whales’ sentiment is mixed Per Blockchain intelligence firm CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi, on-chain behavior during the final week of June showed Bitcoin whales realized over $641 million in profits and more than $1.24 billion in losses within the same week. Some investors who entered late in the rally appeared to capitulate, while earlier Q2 buyers likely used the moment to lock in gains. Long-term whales also took profits of approximately $91 million and recorded relatively few losses. These simultaneous signals of profit-taking and capitulation could represent a local exhaustion point. However, activity levels have since dropped heading into July, the start of a balance period, or a purported change in market behavior in support of bears.

The popular image: some clean-cut founders, laptops aglow, moving numbers and shaking hands. But sit with someone who’s actually done it, and the reality unfolds—money runs everything from the first legal form to the final hired hand. And behind every great leap in finance lurks the question nobody wants to ask at coffee meetings: how much capital does it really take to get off the ground? There’s no magic number, but there are patterns. Licensing and Legal Obligations No way around it, regulation sets the tone. Before anyone opens a shop, there’s paperwork—endless permits, registrations, and ongoing fees. Compare an investment advisor outfit to a full-scale securities brokerage; suddenly those bills multiply overnight. The costs of starting a brokerage ? They start with government filings and quickly expand into compliance departments. In places like New York or California, licenses get expensive fast. Skimp here and expect trouble later; regulators have little pity for undercapitalized ventures running afoul of compliance rules. Technology Infrastructure The notion that founding a modern financial firm only requires some software is charming—and wildly inaccurate. Fintech expects serious muscle behind every transaction. Trading platforms need bulletproof security and real-time data handling; clients won’t forgive outages or glitches with their money on the line. A single hour of downtime can burn through a year’s worth of marketing goodwill. Trust in this sector is now digital, and it shatters with the speed of a failed server request. Throw in cybersecurity protocols, servers (cloud isn’t always cheap), and market data subscriptions—the bill balloons before revenue even appears on the radar screen. Staffing Expenses A shoestring crew might work if selling lemonade at a summer stand. With finance? Not so much. Every regulatory body loves to see deep benches: compliance officers, analysts, and IT engineers who know how markets tick and where leaks hide. Each role demands expertise that doesn’t come cheap or part-time. Even small operations struggle without at least a handful of skilled staff on salary from the outset; otherwise, things break down quickly when questions start flying from clients or regulators. Working Capital Cushion Here lurks one of those hidden dragons everyone ignores until it’s too late: a cash flow cushion is everything during year one (sometimes two). Revenues move slowly while expenses hit fast—rent, insurance policies measured by risk scores only actuaries can explain, and marketing just to keep up with competitors shouting louder every quarter. Underestimating this buffer spells disaster; plenty of companies vanish because they simply run dry before ever facing real competition or scaling up their services. Conclusion All considered together—and that’s really the only honest way—starting a financial company means writing bigger checks than most first-timers imagine. Ignore the temptation for shortcuts; it’s better to overprepare than drown in surprise costs two months after launch day arrives. Money buys time as well as credibility in this business—no shortcut wins against that fact for long. Success rarely comes easy or cheap in finance; just watch who survives the first twelve months and try not to blink at what they spent getting there.

Lele Ewah, a small business owner in Houston, Texas, says the scam all started with a call from a woman impersonating an official at Prosperity Bank, where she has her account, reports the NBC-affiliated KPRC2. She says the caller ID matched the bank’s number and the woman, who identified herself as “Erica,” referenced her travel habits. “She asked, ‘Are you and your husband out of town? You always set travel notifications.’ It sounded so real.” Ewah says the woman asked her to verify certain information to “secure” her account and reset her online banking access. However, in doing so, Ewah unwittingly gave the scammer access to her account. She says later in the day, she noticed two large transfers totaling $20,000 were made to internal accounts at the same bank. That was the total amount of funds Ewah received from a small business loan to make repairs and do marketing for her health and wellness shop called Power of Sea Moss. “I was absolutely devastated. From a small business perspective, every dollar is needed. I felt like I couldn’t breathe.” While the bank told her it could recover the funds since they were sent to another internal account, she says the bank has only restored $12,000 so far. “We borrowed a certain amount of money for a specific reason, and now we don’t have it. That doesn’t fix the situation.” Prosperity Bank is a $38.765 billion regional financial holding company based in Houston, Texas, with 284 branches across the state and in Oklahoma.

The recent weakening of Asia FX and the precarious position of the US Dollar offer a compelling case study, highlighting how traditional financial market dynamics can profoundly influence investor sentiment and capital flows, even for digital assets. As global economies grapple with complex geopolitical landscapes and shifting monetary policies, understanding these foundational movements becomes paramount for any investor looking to navigate the broader financial ecosystem. What’s truly driving these shifts, and how might they impact your portfolio? Why is Asia FX Feeling the Heat? The currencies of several Asian nations have experienced a noticeable depreciation recently, a trend that analysts are closely monitoring. This weakening is not uniform across the board but rather a confluence of factors unique to the region, amplified by external pressures. One primary driver is the lingering specter of trade tensions, particularly between major global economic powers. When trade flows are disrupted or threatened, economies heavily reliant on exports, as many Asian nations are, face significant headwinds. This directly impacts their economic outlook, subsequently putting downward pressure on their respective currencies. Beyond trade, domestic economic conditions also play a crucial role. Slower growth projections in key Asian economies, coupled with varying levels of inflation and interest rate differentials compared to the United States, contribute to capital outflows. Investors seeking higher yields or safer havens may reallocate funds away from these markets, further exacerbating the depreciation of Asia FX . Consider the ripple effect: a slowdown in a major economy like China, for instance, inevitably impacts its trading partners across Asia, creating a domino effect on regional currencies. Key factors contributing to the pressure on Asia FX include: Export Dependence: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on international trade. Any disruption to global supply chains or demand directly impacts their export revenues, weakening their economic fundamentals. Capital Outflows: When interest rate differentials widen in favor of the US or other developed markets, or when perceived risk in Asian markets increases, capital tends to flow out, reducing demand for local currencies. Domestic Economic Challenges: Internal issues such as high debt levels, inflationary pressures, or political instability within individual Asian nations can also deter foreign investment and weaken their currencies. Commodity Price Fluctuations: For commodity-exporting Asian nations, volatile global commodity prices can significantly affect their terms of trade and currency strength. Understanding these multifaceted pressures is essential for anyone tracking the pulse of the global currency market . The US Dollar ‘s Delicate Dance: Fragility Amidst Speculation While Asia FX faces headwinds, the US Dollar , traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, is exhibiting its own unique vulnerabilities. Despite global uncertainties often bolstering the dollar, recent movements suggest a more nuanced picture. The primary factor influencing the dollar’s current fragility is the pervasive speculation surrounding potential Fed Rate Cuts . Markets are increasingly pricing in the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will begin lowering interest rates in the near future, a move that typically diminishes the attractiveness of a currency by reducing its yield advantage. A weaker dollar has mixed implications. For US exporters, it makes their goods cheaper and more competitive abroad, potentially boosting corporate earnings. For countries holding significant dollar-denominated debt, a weaker dollar eases their repayment burden. However, for investors seeking high returns from dollar-denominated assets, a lower interest rate environment makes these investments less appealing compared to alternatives, potentially leading to capital reallocation. This delicate balance means the dollar’s trajectory is under intense scrutiny, with every Federal Reserve statement and economic data release scrutinized for clues. The dollar’s recent performance reflects this internal conflict: Safe-Haven Demand: In times of extreme global stress, the dollar often benefits from its status as a reserve currency and safe haven, attracting inflows. Yield Differential: The expectation of lower US interest rates reduces the yield advantage of dollar-denominated assets, making other currencies or asset classes more attractive. Economic Data: Weaker-than-expected US economic data can reinforce rate cut expectations, putting downward pressure on the dollar. Conversely, strong data might provide temporary support. The interplay between these forces means the US Dollar ‘s strength is far from guaranteed, making it a critical component of the broader currency market narrative. Navigating the Storm of Trade Uncertainty The persistent shadow of trade uncertainty looms large over global financial markets, directly impacting currency valuations and investor confidence. While tariffs are a direct manifestation of this uncertainty, the broader implications extend to supply chain disruptions, shifts in manufacturing bases, and a general reluctance by businesses to commit to long-term investments. This environment of unpredictability makes it challenging for businesses to plan, leading to reduced international trade volumes and, consequently, less demand for currencies involved in these transactions. Consider the impact on specific sectors: industries heavily reliant on international trade, such as technology, automotive, and agriculture, are particularly vulnerable. A sudden imposition of tariffs or a breakdown in trade negotiations can send shockwaves through these sectors, affecting their profitability and employment figures. This, in turn, can dampen overall economic growth prospects for nations deeply integrated into global supply chains. For emerging markets, especially those in Asia, their economic fortunes are often closely tied to global trade dynamics, making them acutely sensitive to any shifts in policy or sentiment related to trade. The current climate of trade uncertainty is a significant headwind, pushing investors towards more defensive positions and away from riskier assets, including certain currencies. Key impacts of trade uncertainty include: Reduced Global Trade Volumes: Businesses become hesitant to engage in cross-border trade due to unpredictable costs and market access. Supply Chain Restructuring: Companies may re-evaluate and re-shore or near-shore production, leading to long-term shifts in global manufacturing. Investment Deterrence: Businesses delay or cancel foreign direct investments due to the unclear regulatory and economic landscape. Currency Volatility: Currencies of trade-dependent nations become more susceptible to rapid fluctuations based on trade headlines. This ongoing saga of trade tensions continues to be a major determinant of movements in the currency market , influencing everything from the strength of the US Dollar to the stability of Asia FX . The Anticipated Ripple of Fed Rate Cuts : What Does it Mean? The prospect of Fed Rate Cuts is arguably the most dominant theme currently shaping global financial markets, with profound implications for the US Dollar and currencies worldwide, including Asia FX . Central banks use interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and economic growth. When a central bank cuts rates, it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. However, for a currency, lower interest rates make holding that currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns, potentially leading to depreciation. The market’s anticipation of these cuts is often as impactful as the cuts themselves. Traders and investors adjust their positions well in advance, moving capital in anticipation of future yield differentials. If the Federal Reserve signals a more aggressive rate-cutting cycle than expected, it could lead to a more significant weakening of the dollar. Conversely, if economic data remains strong and the Fed delays cuts, the dollar could find renewed support. This delicate dance of expectations versus reality keeps the currency market on edge. Consider the potential scenarios and their impacts: Scenario Impact on US Dollar Impact on Asia FX Aggressive Fed Rate Cuts Significant weakening (less attractive yield) Potential strengthening (capital flows back to Asia, less competitive dollar) Delayed/Fewer Fed Rate Cuts Potential strengthening (retains yield advantage) Continued pressure/weakening (dollar remains strong, capital outflows) Unexpected Global Crisis Initial strengthening (safe-haven demand) Significant weakening (flight to safety) These scenarios highlight the complex interplay between monetary policy and currency valuations. For investors, monitoring the Federal Reserve’s communications and incoming economic data is crucial for anticipating shifts in the currency market landscape. Understanding the Broader Currency Market Dynamics: What’s Next? The movements of Asia FX and the US Dollar are not isolated events but rather integral components of the vast and interconnected currency market . This market, the largest financial market in the world, is influenced by a myriad of factors, including interest rate differentials, economic growth prospects, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. Understanding these broader dynamics is key to making informed decisions, whether you’re trading traditional currencies or assessing the impact on other asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The current environment is characterized by a delicate balance of opposing forces. On one hand, global trade tensions and the threat of a slowdown in major economies exert downward pressure on risk-sensitive currencies, particularly those in emerging markets. On the other hand, the anticipated easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve could reduce the dollar’s allure, potentially offering some relief to other currencies. The key challenge for investors and policymakers alike is to discern which of these forces will dominate in the short to medium term. Actionable insights for navigating this complex environment: Diversify Portfolios: Consider diversifying across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate risks associated with specific currency movements. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and major Asian central banks for clues on future monetary policy. Track Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on key economic data points such as inflation, GDP growth, employment figures, and trade balances, as these directly influence currency valuations. Assess Geopolitical Risks: Be aware of geopolitical developments and trade negotiations, as these can trigger sudden shifts in market sentiment and currency strength. Understand Carry Trade Implications: With potential shifts in interest rate differentials, the profitability of carry trades (borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies and investing in high-interest-rate ones) will change, impacting capital flows. The currency market is a dynamic beast, constantly reacting to new information. Staying informed and agile is paramount for navigating its complexities and leveraging opportunities. Conclusion: Charting a Course Through Volatility The current landscape of global finance, marked by the weakening of Asia FX , the fragility of the US Dollar , and the overarching shadows of trade uncertainty and anticipated Fed Rate Cuts , presents a complex yet fascinating picture. These interconnected dynamics underscore the reality that no financial market operates in isolation. From traditional equities and bonds to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, the ripple effects of these macro-economic shifts are undeniable. While volatility may persist, a deep understanding of these fundamental drivers empowers investors to make more resilient decisions. By staying attuned to central bank signals, geopolitical developments, and key economic indicators, market participants can better anticipate trends and position themselves to navigate the evolving global currency market with greater confidence. The path ahead is undoubtedly filled with challenges, but also with opportunities for those who are prepared.

As Congress advances the GENIUS and STABLE Acts, New York Attorney General Letitia James has called for tighter oversight of stablecoin issuers, highlighting concerns that current proposals may fall short in safeguarding the public and the broader financial system. Paxos Launches USDG Stablecoin in the European Union, Reinforcing Global Dollar Network Expansion Paxos has officially launched its USDG stablecoin in the European Union, marking a major milestone for the Global Dollar Network (GDN). The announcement was made on Tuesday, highlighting that the USDG stablecoin is now live on a broad range of EU-based platforms, including prominent cryptocurrency exchanges such as Kraken and Gate.io. The rollout of USDG aligns with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework, one of the most comprehensive digital asset regulations to date. Paxos stated that it has designed USDG to fully comply with MiCA’s reserve, transparency, and audit requirements. The issuance of USDG in Europe is conducted through Paxos Issuance Europe OY, a regulated entity based in Finland under the oversight of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA). In addition to regulatory compliance within the EU, Paxos also operates under the supervision of Singapore’s central bank, signaling a growing trend of multinational regulatory harmonization in the digital asset sector. The stablecoin has already secured partnerships with a host of crypto and fintech platforms, including Coinmetro, SwissBorg, Zodia Custody, Orbital, Hercle, CoinsPaid, Bitwyrem, Bitnet, and HiFi, alongside launch partners Kraken and Gate.io. Mark Greenberg, global head of consumer at Kraken, emphasized the importance of stablecoins as foundational components of modern financial infrastructure. “As stablecoins become core infrastructure for global finance, USDG stands out for its usability and growing ecosystem,” he said. USDG’s backing structure includes one-to-one redemption guarantees and a portion of its reserves held in European banks, which ensures stability and regulatory alignment with MiCA’s mandates. Paxos maintains a long-standing reputation for regulatory rigor, having previously issued stablecoins like USDP and worked with global giants such as PayPal and Mastercard. Global Dollar Network: Bridging TradFi and Crypto The European launch coincides with Paxos’ broader ambitions for the Global Dollar Network (GDN), a cross-industry stablecoin infrastructure initiative that aims to bring digital dollars into mainstream use. The GDN launched in late 2024 in collaboration with Robinhood, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Paxos. Since then, the network has expanded to include over 20 major partners from both the traditional finance (TradFi) and fintech sectors. Mastercard’s recent entry into the GDN further signals the growing acceptance of digital assets within the established financial system. The payments giant confirmed it would support USDG in its stablecoin-related projects, paving the way for global merchants and financial institutions to integrate stablecoin transactions into existing workflows. The launch of USDG arrives amid a broader market boom for stablecoins. According to DefiLlama , the total market capitalization of stablecoins reached $253.9 billion by early July 2025, up from $239 billion in late June. This expansion reflects increasing institutional and retail demand for blockchain-based dollar alternatives, especially as yield-bearing variants of stablecoins also gain traction. Yield-bearing stablecoins, which offer passive returns through DeFi protocols or interest-earning reserves, have surged in popularity—growing from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion today, capturing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market. A report by Coinbase revealed that interest in stablecoin usage has tripled year-over-year since 2024. The study attributes this spike to corporations, small businesses, and consumers seeking faster, cheaper, and more transparent alternatives to traditional payment methods. Stablecoin payment types (Source: Artemis ) Artemis and other data providers have documented $94.2 billion in settled stablecoin transactions from January 2023 through February 2025. Regulatory Path Forward The MiCA framework, which came into force in 2024, has created a unified approach to digital asset regulation across the EU. Unlike fragmented regimes in other jurisdictions, MiCA offers clarity around stablecoin reserve requirements, audit standards, and consumer protection—conditions Paxos says it welcomes. With USDG meeting MiCA’s strict requirements and Paxos receiving approvals from both Finnish and Singaporean regulators, the company is positioning itself as a global leader in compliant digital finance solutions. As the Global Dollar Network scales and USDG adoption spreads across Europe and beyond, Paxos may pave the way for a new era of interoperable, regulatory-compliant digital dollars—bridging traditional banking and decentralized finance across continents. New York Attorney General Warns Congress on Stablecoin Legislation, Urges Stronger Protections Meanwhile, as momentum builds in Washington to pass federal legislation regulating stablecoins, New York Attorney General Letitia James is urging lawmakers to strengthen existing proposals, warning that current drafts leave the American financial system—and its citizens—exposed to unnecessary risk. In a letter sent to congressional leaders on Monday, James raised concerns about two prominent stablecoin bills making their way through Congress: the Senate’s Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act and the House’s Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. While she acknowledged the need for swift regulatory action, James emphasized that both proposals fall short of essential safeguards. James, who has been one of the most aggressive US state officials in cracking down on cryptocurrency fraud and misconduct, argued that stablecoin issuers should be regulated more like banks. This includes requirements for deposit insurance—an added measure to safeguard users in the event of an issuer’s insolvency. She also proposed that the Federal Reserve Board, not other federal agencies or politically influenced entities, be designated as the primary overseer of non-bank stablecoin issuers. The Fed’s independence, James noted, would help insulate supervisory decisions from political pressure and ensure sound risk management in a rapidly evolving financial sector. The GENIUS Act, which passed the full Senate in June with bipartisan support and backing from the White House, requires stablecoins to be fully backed by US dollars or similarly liquid assets. Issuers with a market cap exceeding $50 billion would be subject to mandatory annual audits. It also establishes a federal framework for handling stablecoins issued by foreign entities. President Donald Trump has publicly endorsed the GENIUS Act , stating that he expects a version of the bill to land on his desk for signing by August. The bill’s White House support marks a significant shift in the federal government’s stance toward integrating stablecoins into the regulated financial ecosystem. Meanwhile, the House version—known as the STABLE Act—has cleared the House Financial Services Committee but has yet to be scheduled for a floor vote. The House bill diverges from the GENIUS Act in its handling of state-chartered stablecoin issuers and in its approach to foreign stablecoins, reflecting broader debates about federal versus state regulatory authority. Ongoing Concerns About Foreign Stablecoins This isn’t the first time Attorney General James has sounded the alarm on stablecoins. In April, she sent a letter to congressional leaders specifically warning about the systemic risks posed by foreign-based stablecoin issuers like Tether (USDT)—currently the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. At the time, James cautioned that relying on foreign-controlled issuers could weaken US monetary sovereignty and distort Treasury markets, recommending a legislative push toward ”onshoring” stablecoins to reinforce the US dollar’s global dominance. Her latest letter reiterates these concerns, warning that legislation should not inadvertently provide loopholes that allow foreign entities to dominate US stablecoin infrastructure without sufficient oversight. Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have grown into a multi-hundred-billion-dollar market and are increasingly used in payments, decentralized finance, and remittances. According to DefiLlama, stablecoins represent over $250 billion in value as of mid-2025. The explosive growth of these assets has spurred calls for regulation, especially after episodes of market instability—including the 2022 collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and numerous enforcement actions against unlicensed issuers. As traditional financial institutions like PayPal, Circle, and Mastercard enter the stablecoin arena, federal policymakers are under pressure to define clear rules that promote innovation without jeopardizing financial stability.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-02 12:00:00

As per the announcement, the regulation ensures that securities and commodities contracts, including those issued using distributed ledger technology (such as security tokens and commodity contract tokens), are accommodated within the existing virtual asset regulatory framework. UAE SCA offers clarifications on tokens types and obligations The UAE SCA defined security tokens and commodity contract tokens as digital representations of assets, such as companies, shares, and bonds, with the same investor protections and regulatory oversight as traditional securities. Examples offered by the UAE SCA during the consultation process included gold tokens and oil tokens. The regulation will offer consistent treatment for securities and commodities contracts irrespective of the technology used in their issuance and transmission. The approach aims to address and mitigate any risks that may arise from the use of distributed ledger technology, while maintaining the integrity and objectives of the regulatory regime. The regulation is technology agnostic as per the UAE SCA. So as explained, whether the security or commodity derivative contract is issued on traditional paper form, electronic record or as a code on a DLT (distributed ledger technology), permissioned or permissionless, it will be subject to the same fundamental legal and regulatory requirements. However, the distributed ledger must meet requirements such as the ability for it to be used to give the obligee, not the obligor, the power to dispose of its rights. Secondly, its integrity is ensured by adequate technical and organizational measures to protect it from unauthorized modification. Finally, the content of the rights, the operation of the ledger and the registration agreement are recorded in the distributed ledger or in linked accompanying data, while obligees can view relevant information and ledger entries, and verify the integrity and accuracy of contents relating to them without third-party interference. Security and commodity tokens can only be traded OTC through crypto wallets The new securities and commodity token regulation also allows for the trading of such tokens, over the counter only, through digital wallets provided by a digital wallet service provider or through self custodial wallets which must be pre-authorized and included in the whitelist by the obligor or the market or the digital wallet service provider or the compliance middleware service provider. As per UAE SCA, a digital wallet is a software application or other tool that is used to control, safeguard or manage public and private cryptographic keys (or their equivalent). On the other hand, a digital wallet service provider is a market or entity licensed to operate the alternative trading system that provides custody services for the security tokens or commodity contract tokens by controlling the public and private cryptographic keys. Emirates Coin Investment could become the first to issue security and commodity tokens In June, Emirates Coin Investment LLC (EmCoin), based out of Abu Dhabi UAE, announced that it had become the first UAE SCA-regulated integrated investment platform to offer crypto investments and traditional assets such as equities, commodities, and even ICOs. EmCoin had noted that it would be launching a cutting-edge investment platform that would bring together digital assets and traditional finance. Users would be able to trade virtual assets, invest in UAE and global equities, buy commodities, and access expert-managed portfolios with full transparency and trust. The UAE has already embarked on the tokenization of real estate assets for investment purposes. PRYPCO Mint, the joint initiative between the Dubai Land Department (DLD) and PRYPCO licensed by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), has already listed and funded two tokenized properties in the UAE so far.

Unpacking the Fireblocks Transfer: What Just Happened? In the intricate web of blockchain transactions, every large movement is scrutinized, and for good reason. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X highlighted that crypto custody firm Fireblocks executed a transfer of 33.1 million W tokens, amounting to approximately $2.34 million, to a wallet believed to be associated with Jump Crypto. This occurred roughly eight hours prior to the analyst’s report, sparking immediate interest. For those unfamiliar, Fireblocks is a cornerstone in the institutional crypto landscape. They provide a secure platform for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets, serving hundreds of financial institutions globally. Their reputation for top-tier security and compliance makes any transaction originating from them noteworthy. When a firm like Fireblocks moves such a significant sum of a specific token, it often signals strategic maneuvers or operational shifts within the broader crypto ecosystem. Key aspects of this specific transfer include: Sender: Fireblocks, a leading crypto custody and settlement platform. Recipient: A wallet linked to Jump Crypto, a prominent venture capital firm and market maker. Asset: W tokens, the native governance token of the Wormhole protocol. Value: 33.1 million W tokens, approximately $2.34 million USD at the time of transfer. Significance: A large, institutional-level transfer suggesting a strategic purpose rather than a simple user transaction. The Role of Jump Crypto : A Strategic Connection The recipient of this substantial Fireblocks transfer, Jump Crypto, isn’t just another name in the crypto world; it’s a powerhouse. As the crypto arm of the quantitative trading firm Jump Trading, Jump Crypto has a deep footprint across various facets of the digital asset industry, from venture capital investments to market making and infrastructure development. Their involvement with Wormhole is particularly strong, given that they were both an early investor and the parent company of the cross-chain protocol. This close relationship between Jump Crypto and Wormhole adds a layer of intrigue to the transaction. While Wormhole announced its transition to independent operations in late 2023, Jump Crypto’s continued influence and strategic interest in the protocol remain evident. A transfer of W tokens to Jump Crypto could signify several things: Strategic Allocation: It might be part of a pre-agreed distribution, a treasury management decision, or a move to bolster liquidity for the W token. Market Making Activities: Jump Crypto is a major market maker, and receiving a large tranche of W tokens could indicate an intent to provide deeper liquidity on various exchanges, facilitating smoother trading for the token. Operational Funding: Even after independence, there might be ongoing operational or development funding agreements between Jump Crypto and Wormhole, for which W tokens could be used. Vesting or Unlock Schedules: The transfer could align with a vesting schedule for early investors or team members associated with Jump Crypto, who supported Wormhole’s development. Understanding Jump Crypto’s multifaceted role helps us interpret the potential motivations behind such a significant on-chain movement. Understanding Wormhole : Bridging the Blockchain Divide At the heart of this transaction are the W tokens , which are inextricably linked to the Wormhole protocol. But what exactly is Wormhole, and why is its native token so valuable? Wormhole is a leading cross-chain interoperability protocol. In simpler terms, it’s a bridge that allows different blockchains to communicate and transfer assets and information between each other. Imagine a world where Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche are all isolated islands. Wormhole builds bridges between these islands, enabling seamless travel and trade. This capability is crucial for the growth of the multi-chain ecosystem, as it allows for greater liquidity, composability, and user experience across various decentralized applications (dApps). Key features and importance of Wormhole include: Interoperability: Connects over 30 blockchains, including major EVM and non-EVM chains. Asset Transfer: Enables the secure transfer of tokens (wrapped assets) between chains. Message Passing: Allows dApps to send arbitrary data and execute cross-chain commands. Decentralization: Governed by a decentralized network of validators (Guardians). Independence: Recently transitioned to an independent entity, signaling a new phase of growth and community governance. The success and utility of Wormhole are vital for a truly interconnected blockchain future, making its governance token, W, a significant asset in the broader crypto landscape. The Significance of W Tokens : Governance and Beyond The 33.1 million W tokens transferred by Fireblocks are not just arbitrary digital units; they are the native governance token of the Wormhole protocol. The introduction of W tokens marked a significant step in Wormhole’s journey towards decentralization and community governance. What does holding W tokens entail? Governance Rights: W token holders have the power to propose and vote on key decisions regarding the Wormhole protocol’s future. This includes upgrades, parameter changes, fee structures, and the addition of new supported chains. Ecosystem Participation: Holding W tokens allows for active participation in the Wormhole DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), shaping the direction and development of a critical piece of blockchain infrastructure. Potential Utility: While primarily a governance token, W tokens could also accrue additional utility in the future, such as staking rewards, access to premium features, or integration into various dApps built on or leveraging Wormhole. A large transfer of W tokens to a major entity like Jump Crypto could be interpreted as a consolidation of governance power, a strategic distribution for liquidity provision, or a preparation for future ecosystem initiatives. It highlights the growing importance of governance tokens in the decentralized world and how major players manage their stakes in crucial protocols. Why This Crypto Transfer Matters: Insights and Implications This particular crypto transfer from Fireblocks to Jump Crypto is more than just a large transaction; it offers several key insights into the current dynamics of the crypto market and the strategic moves of its major players. Transparency and On-Chain Analysis The fact that this transfer was quickly identified and reported by on-chain analysts like @ai_9684xtpa underscores the unparalleled transparency of public blockchains. Every transaction, regardless of its size, is recorded and verifiable. This allows for real-time monitoring of institutional movements, providing valuable insights into market sentiment, potential strategic partnerships, and the operational activities of major entities. This transparency is a double-edged sword: while it offers unparalleled insights, it also means that every move is under public scrutiny. Strategic Alliances and Ecosystem Development The relationship between Jump Crypto and Wormhole is a prime example of how venture capital firms actively participate in and shape the ecosystems they invest in. This transfer could be a reinforcement of their commitment to Wormhole’s success, perhaps by providing liquidity for the W token or preparing for new initiatives that require significant token holdings. Such large movements often precede or accompany significant developments within a protocol’s roadmap. Market Impact and Liquidity While a $2.34 million transfer might not drastically move the entire crypto market, it is significant for the W token itself. If these tokens are intended for market-making activities, it could lead to increased liquidity and tighter spreads, benefiting traders and investors. Conversely, if they are intended for a large, private allocation, the market impact might be minimal but the underlying strategic signal remains strong. Challenges and Opportunities in Cross-Chain Interoperability The continued development and strategic support for protocols like Wormhole highlight the ongoing need for robust cross-chain solutions. While interoperability offers immense opportunities for growth and innovation in DeFi, it also presents challenges, particularly around security. Large transfers like this one, managed by secure custody solutions like Fireblocks, emphasize the importance of secure infrastructure in navigating the complexities of multi-chain environments. Actionable Insights for Readers: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on significant institutional transfers using tools like blockchain explorers or following reputable on-chain analysts. These movements can often signal upcoming developments or strategic shifts. Understand Token Utility: For any token you’re interested in, delve into its utility and governance model. Knowing what the token represents (like W tokens for Wormhole governance) helps interpret large transfers. Research Institutional Involvement: Understand which major firms (like Fireblocks and Jump Crypto) are involved in a project. Their actions can provide clues about a project’s health and future trajectory. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Crypto Operations The recent transfer of $2.34 million in W tokens from Fireblocks to a wallet linked with Jump Crypto is more than just a transaction; it’s a window into the strategic operations that underpin the institutional crypto landscape. It underscores the vital roles played by secure custody providers like Fireblocks, influential investors and developers like Jump Crypto, and critical infrastructure protocols like Wormhole. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, such on-chain movements will remain crucial indicators of health, development, and strategic intent. Keeping a close watch on these flows provides invaluable context for understanding the complex and ever-evolving world of digital assets.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/early-crypto-adopter-expects-xrp-parabolic-price-ascent-heres-the-timeline/,"XRP’s current market trajectory may be on the verge of a historic shift, according to early crypto adopter and outspoken analyst Crypto Bitlord. With XRP trading at $2.18, Bitlord took to X to declare that the token is “way overdue” for a parabolic explosion. He likened the anticipated price move to a “skateboard ramp”, suggesting a nearly vertical ascent, a style of price action that historically follows periods of extended consolidation. This bold prediction has captured the attention of XRP enthusiasts and crypto traders alike, as many wonder whether Bitlord’s timing finally aligns with market conditions. Known for his early advocacy of XRP, Bitlord has in the past called out pivotal buying moments that preceded sharp rallies, lending weight to his recent statement. Technical Patterns Support Explosive Move Chart analysts are observing the emergence of a bullish cup-and-handle formation on XRP’s short-term timeframes. This classical pattern often precedes a strong breakout, and in XRP’s case, points toward an immediate target around $3.35, a level that sits about 54% above its current price. I’m expecting $XRP to begin its parabolic ascent shortly. The chart will look like a skateboard ramp. Poppin vertical. -Way overdue now. — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 2, 2025 In addition, indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are flashing early bullish signals, suggesting that XRP may be preparing for significant momentum. Several analysts, including Ali Martinez and JD, have cited these signals in recent weeks as evidence that the groundwork for a parabolic move is being laid. One key resistance level to watch is in the $2.47 to $2.80 range; clearing this zone with volume could open the gates to rapid price acceleration. Legal Clarity and Institutional Expansion Beyond technicals, fundamental developments are playing an equally crucial role in shaping sentiment. Ripple’s protracted legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has seen major resolutions in recent months. While Judge Torres recently rejected the proposed settlement motion, Ripple’s decision to drop its counter-appeal, followed by indications that the SEC may abandon its appeal, has significantly reduced regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This legal clarity comes just as Ripple continues expanding its global payment infrastructure. XRP is increasingly being used in Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network, supporting real-time cross-border payments. These developments lend long-term confidence to XRP’s utility, and they serve as a foundation for institutional adoption, even as the retail market awaits a breakout. Speculation and Sentiment in the Current Market Despite Bitlord’s high-confidence post, it’s worth noting that some traders remain cautious. On-chain data shows mixed signals, with modest declines in active wallet activity and some profit-taking from larger holders. However, these patterns are not unusual before large upward moves, especially when traders reallocate capital in anticipation of volatility. Historically, XRP’s strongest rallies have followed long periods of stagnation, which may be precisely what’s unfolding now. Crypto Bitlord believes the timing is right, stating that the window for this ramp-like breakout could open “within 24 hours.” While that timeline is speculative, it’s grounded in a context of building pressure across multiple market layers. At $2.18, XRP sits on the edge of a possible parabolic ascent. Crypto Bitlord, a seasoned market participant, anticipates a near-vertical rally, driven by bullish technicals and strengthened fundamentals. The resistance levels are clear, the sentiment is cautiously optimistic, and the legal clouds are beginning to clear. Whether this moment produces the long-awaited breakout or simply sets the stage for one, XRP’s trajectory is poised to shift dramatically, and soon.

From Shrimp to Humpback, this new system has sparked excitement among Pioneers—and it might just change how you see your Pi Network holdings. What’s This Pi Coin Ranking All About? In a lighthearted post on X (formerly Twitter), Pi Network’s co-founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis shared a unique classification system for Pi holders. Inspired by sea creatures, the ranking assigns each user a category based on their Pi Coin balance. The aim? To boost community engagement as Pi Network gears up for major developments in its decentralized ecosystem. Here’s the Full Classification System Shrimp: Less than 1 Pi Coin Crab: 1 to 9 Pi Octopus: 10 to 49 Pi Fish: 50 to 99 Pi Dolphin: 100 to 499 Pi Shark: 500 to 999 Pi Whale: 1,000 to 4,999 Pi Humpback: 5,000+ Pi This whimsical ranking has quickly become a talking point within the Pi Network community and is even being adopted as a badge of pride among users. Most Pioneers Are Shrimps – Here’s Why Analysts estimate that around 70% of Pi Network users hold less than 1 Pi Coin, placing them in the Shrimp category. This high concentration of smaller holders highlights how early many users still are in their Pi mining journey. Meanwhile, the top 100 wallets control over 96% of the Pi Coin supply, although that includes burn addresses and liquidity pools. So while Whales and Humpbacks hold most of the Pi Network’s circulating supply, they make up only a tiny fraction of the user base. [post_titles_links postid=”477537″] What Does This Mean for the Pi Network Price? As Pi Network prepares for mainnet migration and potential exchange listings , understanding holder distribution becomes crucial. If most users are still Shrimp, this suggests mass adoption is still in progress—and that larger holders could impact Pi Network price significantly during initial trading. This fun classification might not be official, but it’s clearly uniting Pioneers and adding a viral spark to the Pi community. Final Thoughts Whether you’re a proud Shrimp or an elusive Humpback, this ranking system is more than just a joke—it’s a community-driven effort to build excitement and identity within the Pi ecosystem. With Pi Coin possibly approaching its next big milestone, every sea creature in the ocean of Pioneers is watching closely. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs How can I check my Pi Coin balance to know my sea creature rank? You can check your Pi Coin balance within the Pi Network app. Once you have passed KYC and your Pi Transferable Balance is migrated to the Mainnet blockchain, your balance will be visible in your Pi Wallet. This balance determines your sea creature rank based on the shared classification system. What are the benefits of being in a higher rank like Whale or Humpback in Pi Network? While the sea creature ranking is primarily for community engagement and pride, being a “Whale” or “Humpback” signifies a large Pi holding. This could potentially translate to more significant influence within the Pi ecosystem, increased visibility, and a greater share if/when Pi gains substantial market value or undergoes exchange listings. How can I move up from Shrimp to a higher rank like Dolphin or Shark in Pi Network? To move up from “Shrimp” to a higher rank in Pi Network, you need to accumulate more Pi Coins. This is primarily done through active mobile mining (checking in daily), inviting new users to your referral team, building a strong security circle, engaging with Pi apps, and running a Pi Node, all of which boost your mining rate. What happens to my rank if I transfer or lose some of my Pi Coins? If you transfer or lose some of your Pi Coins, your total balance will decrease. Consequently, your sea creature rank will adjust downwards to reflect your new, lower Pi Coin holding. The ranking system is directly based on your current Pi Coin balance, so any change in your balance will affect your assigned category.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,MINING|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-02 12:03:00

In a tweet that comes amid mounting scrutiny and a potential bankruptcy filing at Linqto, Garlinghouse wrote: “To be clear, on Ripple’s end: What we know from our records is Linqto owns 4.7M shares of Ripple, solely purchased on the secondary market from other Ripple shareholders (never directly from Ripple).” That line says a lot about the controversy that is flaring up. Read on for all the clarity you need. Linqto in Crisis Mode Linqto, once touted as a gateway for retail investors to access high-profile private companies like Ripple and Circle, is now facing federal investigations and a looming financial collapse. The platform abruptly halted operations, froze user accounts, and sparked outrage with a proposed refund model that only returns original investments, cutting investors off from any profits made. Garlinghouse: “No Business Relationship” With Linqto Garlinghouse didn’t stop at clarifying share ownership. He added: “Apart from Linqto being a shareholder, Ripple has never had a business relationship with Linqto, nor have they participated in our financing rounds. We stopped approving more Linqto purchases on secondary markets in late 2024 amid growing skepticism.” Understandably, there have been many questions from those who believed they were buying Ripple shares from Linqto, and what happens next. To be clear, on Ripple’s end: What we know from our records is Linqto owns 4.7M shares of Ripple, solely purchased on the secondary market… https://t.co/XHstpwwmIL — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 This distancing move sends a clear message: Ripple wants no part in the fallout. And for good reason. The blowback from Linqto’s meltdown is already threatening investor trust across the broader crypto equity market. Pre-IPO platforms, once hailed as democratizing access, are now under fire for lacking transparency and investor protection. John Deaton Calls for Calm Should you be panicking? Probably not. Attorney John Deaton, who is also a Linqto investor, recently addressed the growing anxiety within the XRP community. In a detailed post, he acknowledged how deeply personal the situation is for many – calling out that some investors have their entire savings or retirement funds tied up in the platform. Deaton struck a reassuring tone, explaining that Linqto has no debt, that shares are accounted for, and that a bankruptcy process could actually offer protection and transparency. “There is good reason to believe you’re getting your money back – and it’s very possible to realize the upside of those investments,” he wrote. His message was clear: stay calm, stay informed, and don’t lose hope. For Linqto customers, I’m one of you, as you can see. I’m well aware that people have less than me (some have much more than me also) on the platform, but it represents their entire investment portfolio or retirement. I get how unnerving that is. I’ve become familiar with… https://t.co/tJy1OXAQxM — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 1, 2025 For now, while Ripple may not be legally tied to Linqto, the scandal’s proximity is enough to raise red flags.

Then prepare for a sobering truth from the crypto world. Despite the hype and significant funding pouring into the space, a recent analysis reveals a concerning trend for VC-backed crypto projects . As of mid-2025, a mere handful of these highly anticipated ventures have managed to break through the coveted $1 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV) mark, leaving many investors grappling with significant losses. What’s the Current State of VC-backed Crypto Projects? The crypto market is known for its volatility, but recent data from analyst @ahboyash on X paints a particularly stark picture. Out of 56 VC-backed crypto projects that launched their tokens this year, only three—Kaito, Story Protocol, and Walrus—have achieved a fully diluted valuation (FDV) exceeding $1 billion. This isn’t just a minor blip; it signifies a widespread challenge for a sector that has attracted billions in institutional capital. Typically, venture capitalists inject substantial funds, often ranging from $20 million to $100 million, into these projects at their seed stages. These investments usually come with a three-year lockup period post-Token Generation Event (TGE), meaning investors cannot sell their tokens immediately. The current reality, however, is that many of these tokens are now trading well below their last fundraising valuations, leaving early investors ‘underwater’ and facing considerable paper losses. This stark contrast between initial investment hype and current market performance raises critical questions about the sustainability and valuation practices within the crypto venture capital landscape. Why Are Crypto FDV Targets So Elusive? The concept of Crypto FDV , or Fully Diluted Valuation, is crucial here. It represents the total market capitalization if all tokens intended to be released into circulation were available. While a high FDV can indicate potential future growth and market confidence, achieving and sustaining a $1 billion FDV is a monumental task. Several factors contribute to this elusiveness: Overvaluation at Seed Stage: Many projects might have been overvalued during their initial fundraising rounds, setting unrealistic expectations for their future market performance. This often happens in bull markets where FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drives aggressive valuations. Market Saturation and Competition: The sheer volume of new projects entering the market makes it difficult for any single one to capture significant mindshare and user adoption. Standing out requires more than just capital; it demands true innovation and effective execution. Lack of Product-Market Fit: Despite innovative ideas, many projects struggle to develop a tangible product or service that truly resonates with a broad user base or solves a real-world problem. Capital alone cannot compensate for a lack of genuine utility. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader economic climate, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, along with regulatory uncertainties, can significantly impact investor sentiment and liquidity in the crypto space, making it harder for projects to grow their FDV. Tokenomics Challenges: Poorly designed tokenomics, including excessive supply, high inflation rates, or insufficient utility for the token within its ecosystem, can inherently depress its value, making a high FDV unattainable. What Does This Mean for Token Valuations? The current scenario has profound implications for token valuations across the board, especially for projects that received significant venture capital backing. When tokens trade below their last fundraising valuations, it sends a strong signal to the market about the project’s perceived value and future prospects. This can lead to a vicious cycle: Investor Confidence Erosion: Early investors seeing their portfolios underwater may lose faith, potentially leading to sell-offs once lockups expire, further depressing prices and creating more selling pressure. Difficulty in Future Fundraising: Projects struggling with low valuations will find it much harder to raise subsequent rounds of funding. This stifles their development and growth, as capital is essential for hiring talent, marketing, and product development. Talent Retention Issues: A struggling project with poor token performance might find it challenging to attract and retain top talent. Token incentives, a common perk in crypto startups, become less attractive when their value is declining. The situation highlights a significant disconnect between the initial optimistic projections during fundraising and the harsh realities of market adoption and utility. It underscores that a high initial valuation does not guarantee sustained success or positive token valuations in the long run. Actionable Insights from Crypto Market Analysis This deep dive into crypto market analysis offers crucial lessons for both investors and project founders navigating the volatile waters of the digital asset space: For Investors: Conduct rigorous due diligence beyond just the VC names backing a project. Focus on fundamental metrics like product adoption, revenue models (if applicable), active user base, community engagement, and realistic tokenomics. Don’t solely rely on seed-stage valuations as an indicator of future success. Understand lockup schedules and potential sell pressure that might come when early investors are able to unload their tokens. For Project Founders: Prioritize building a sustainable product with genuine utility over chasing inflated valuations. Focus on user acquisition, retention, and community building from day one. Be transparent about development milestones and challenges. Realistic tokenomics that incentivize long-term holding and utility are paramount for sustainable growth. For VCs: While early investment is key, perhaps a more cautious approach to valuation and a stronger emphasis on post-investment support for product development and market fit is needed. The current trend suggests a need for re-evaluation of investment strategies in a maturing market, moving towards more selective and value-driven investments. Navigating Venture Capital Crypto’s Future The challenges facing venture capital crypto investments in 2025 are a clear indicator that the ‘spray and pray’ approach prevalent in earlier bull markets is no longer viable. The market is maturing, and with maturity comes a demand for substance over speculation. While VC funding remains a vital lifeline for innovation in the blockchain space, the focus is shifting. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing whitepapers, roadmaps, and, most importantly, working products and active user bases. The success stories of Kaito, Story Protocol, and Walrus, though few, likely share common threads of strong fundamentals, clear utility, and perhaps more realistic initial valuations or exceptional execution in bringing their visions to fruition. This trend signals a shift towards a more professionalized and accountable ecosystem for venture capital crypto . Conclusion The stark reality of only three out of 56 VC-backed crypto projects surpassing a $1 billion FDV in 2025 serves as a potent wake-up call for the entire crypto ecosystem. It underscores the critical importance of fundamental value, sustainable growth, and genuine utility over speculative hype. While venture capital continues to play a pivotal role in fostering innovation, both investors and project teams must adapt to a more discerning market. The path to long-term success in crypto is paved not just with capital, but with robust technology, dedicated communities, and real-world impact. This period of recalibration, though painful for some, ultimately strengthens the foundation for a more resilient and mature decentralized future.

While wondering in which direction the volatility in Bitcoin will intensify and how the price will move, 10x Research stated that the CME Bitcoin futures premium fell to 4.3%, the lowest level since October 2023. Speaking to Coindesk, 10X Research founder Markus Thielen said that the decline in the CME Bitcoin futures premium indicates weakening institutional demand. “The annualized premium for 3-month CME Bitcoin futures has fallen from 10% earlier this year to 4.3% currently. This is the lowest level since 2023.” The CME Bitcoin futures premium represents the difference between the spot price and the futures price. Stating that this decline in the CME Bitcoin futures premium came despite the BTC price holding above $ 100,000, Thielen said, “this indicates that institutional interest is decreasing, expectations for further price increases are weakening, and price uncertainty is increasing.” *This is not investment advice.

OFAC further named four Aeza Group officials, Penzev, Bozoyan, Gast, and Knyazev, for their roles in the organization. Notably, Aeza Group, a known bulletproof hosting (BPH) provider, was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for offering secure and anonymous infrastructure to cybercriminals. The St. Petersburg-based hosting provider has been supporting ransomware groups like BianLian and the info-stealer operators behind RedLine, Lumma, and Meduza. Two affiliated companies and Aeza International Ltd., a UK-based front company, were sanctioned in coordination with the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency. US Treasury Freezes Aeza Crypto Wallet Used to Obfuscate and Move Funds Bulletproof hosting refers to internet hosting services that provide infrastructure to cybercriminals, offering servers designed to evade detection and resist takedown efforts. These services are commonly used by ransomware groups, data thieves, and online drug vendors to carry out and hide illegal operations from law enforcement. According to Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith, “Cybercriminals continue to rely heavily on BPH service providers like Aeza Group to facilitate disruptive ransomware attacks, steal U.S. technology, and sell black-market drugs.” The Treasury Department further alleges that the platform enabled attacks on U.S. defense and tech firms and aided the Russian darknet drug market BlackSprut. Today, OFAC sanctioned Aeza Group for providing bulletproof hosting to cybercriminals conducting ransomware attacks. The designation included 1 crypto address, which Aeza Group used for payments. Read our blog to learn more: https://t.co/fyUHVNZAEp — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) July 1, 2025 As part of the sanction, OFAC froze a TRON-based cryptocurrency wallet used by Aeza Group in which Chainalysis revealed to have functioned as a hub for collecting payments, cashing out funds through various exchanges, and occasionally receiving direct customer payments. The on-chain analysis linked the wallet to over $350,000 in cryptocurrency, with some transactions traced to darknet vendors and malware distributors. OFAC Efforts to Disrupt Cybercrime Infrastructure The Treasury’s latest action indicates its continued effort toward dismantling the infrastructure that supports cybercrime, rather than solely pursuing individual hackers after the fact. “Treasury remains committed to dismantling this ecosystem in close coordination with international partners,” said Bradley T. Smith. Notably, the OFAC carried out a similar move in February 2025, when it sanctioned ZServers, a known bulletproof hosting provider used by cybercriminals to evade law enforcement. Also, OFAC sanctions on Aeza Group are not the first time the department has clamped down on Russia-linked crime. On June 12, 2024, OFAC imposed sanctions targeting Russia’s war economy , including restrictions on access to U.S. software and IT services. The sanction also includes secondary sanctions on foreign firms, particularly Chinese semiconductor suppliers supporting Moscow. OFAC also sanctioned Russian national Andrey Dmitriyevich Sudakov for allegedly laundering cryptocurrency from gold sales via front companies in the UAE and Hong Kong.

With the move, the large financial services company is taking the lead among Belgian banks, which have been shunning the decentralized digital assets until now. KBC to allow cryptocurrency trading through Bolero Belgian bank KBC will let retail customers trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) via its investment platform Bolero in the coming months, Belga news agency reported on Wednesday. The initiative is a first in Belgium, where traditional banks have been reluctant to enter the crypto market, with Belgian investors turning to global trading venues such as Coinbase and Binance or using the services of neobanks like Revolut and Bunq. Other major banks in Belgium, like Belfius, ING, and BNP Paribas Fortis, remain cautious, the report notes, pointing out that only the state-owned Belfius has so far signaled interest in exploring crypto through its Rebel platform. KBC is currently in the process of obtaining regulatory approval to operate as a crypto asset service provider, according to an article published by the Flemish daily De Tijd. The bank has indicated its offering will focus on investor education, security, and regulatory compliance. Financial authorities are expected to greenlight it by the fall, the Dutch-language newspaper added. The group is delving into crypto amid the enforcement of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) law, which aims to establish uniform rules for the industry across the bloc while improving oversight, including compliance with anti-money laundering requirements. KBC’s decision to facilitate crypto trading for its retail clients is meant to address growing investor interest in cryptocurrencies in the Benelux country, particularly among young Belgians, the media reports noted. A survey conducted by Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority ( FSMA ) showed that 43% of Belgian investors under 29 have already bought crypto. The share of such investors grows to 45% in the age segment under 30. European banks flock into the crypto market By taking the path toward entering the cryptocurrency market, KBC is joining other European banking institutions that are preparing similar moves. Deutsche Bank is finalizing its project to launch a crypto custody service in 2026, according to Bloomberg. In another report this week, the news agency revealed that Germany’s giant Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe will allow users of its banking app to trade cryptocurrencies within a year. Meanwhile, one of Italy’s top banks, UniCredit , is launching a five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The product is targeting professional clients and offers capital protection at maturity. The KBC Group , which is the second-largest Belgian bank-insurer, is focused on providing services to private clients and small to medium-sized enterprises in Belgium, but also in several developing markets in Central and Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Finance industry players in the CEE region have also witnessed a rapidly growing interest in crypto investment opportunities. In response, Poland’s largest insurance firm, PZU , announced in May a Bitcoin fund offering that will give Polish investors exposure to the leading cryptocurrency under EU rules. PZU’s move comes despite challenges stemming from the delayed implementation of Europe’s latest regulations in the country. A renewed push in Warsaw to transpose the EU legislation into national law has stirred the local crypto community. Members of the industry fear the standards their government is drafting are actually stricter than MiCA, going beyond what Brussels is prescribing. Representatives of the crypto sector are warning that the upcoming Polish regulations favor large foreign companies while forcing smaller domestic crypto firms to look for more favorable conditions abroad.

According to the announcement , B. Riley Securities led the underwritten public offering, which closed on July 1, with underwriters exercising their full option to purchase additional shares, bringing the total proceeds to approximately $162.9 million after fees. The company’s revenue from Bitcoin mining decreased by 64% in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, with earnings of just 83.3 Bitcoin during the quarter, representing an 80% decline from the prior year’s levels. Bitcoin mining now accounts for only 31% of their total revenue, down from 72% in the same quarter last year, according to company financial reports . Strategic Shift from Mining to Staking Infrastructure Bit Digital began accumulating ETH and building staking infrastructure in 2022, positioning itself ahead of what would become a broader institutional trend toward Ethereum treasury strategies.

Bit Digital now operates approximately 21,568 ETH in native staking protocols, earning 211 ETH in staking rewards during Q1 2025 alone, a 72% increase from the previous year. Their cloud services revenue also surged 84% year-over-year to $14.8 million, demonstrating the company’s successful diversification beyond traditional crypto mining operations. Company executives announced they have initiated a strategic alternatives process for their Bitcoin mining assets, with proceeds from all sales to be redeployed into additional ETH purchases. Growing Institutional Momentum Behind Ethereum Treasury Strategies Bit Digital’s move is part of a broader accelerating institutional adoption of Ethereum as a corporate treasury asset, following similar strategies deployed by other public companies throughout 2025. SharpLink Gaming became the world’s largest publicly traded Ethereum holder in June, accumulating 188,478 ETH worth approximately $457 million through aggressive buying campaigns.

Healthcare technology firm BioNexus Gene Lab also adopted Ethereum as its primary treasury asset , becoming the first Nasdaq-listed healthcare company to implement such a strategy. Institutional investors appear to be gravitating toward Ethereum’s staking capabilities due to its promising yield on treasury holdings. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors, who recently joined BitMine’s board, described Ethereum as a “ higher beta ” asset than Bitcoin due to its foundational role in stablecoin transactions and decentralized finance applications.

This move comes as global institutional adoption accelerates. Deutsche Bank Joins Forces With Bitpanda For Crypto Custody Service According to a Tuesday Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter, Deutsche Bank plans to roll out a digital assets custody service in partnership with the technology unit of Austria-based Bitpanda crypto exchange in 2026. Deutsche Bank-backed cryptocurrency infrastructure provider Taurus will also assist in the deployment of the crypto custody service. It remains unclear which specific cryptocurrencies will feature in the Bank’s crypto custody service. Bitcoin, the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency, is expected to be included in this service. In a research paper published in March, Deutsche Bank hailed the US for its decision to launch a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, noting that it could help solve the national debt crisis. The German financial giant has been brewing plans to offer crypto custody and trading services to its customers since 2020, and applied for a digital asset custody license from Germany’s financial regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, in 2023. Deutsche Bank’s upcoming custody initiative comes amid increasing institutional interest in digital assets, spurred by clearer EU rules under MiCA and a more lenient U.S. posture under the Trump administration. The bank is also assessing whether to foray into the stablecoin sector, including issuing its own token or joining an industry initiative, as more traditional financial players are increasingly moving into the fast-growing industry. “We can certainly see the momentum of stablecoins along with a regulatory supportive environment, especially in the US,” Deutsche Bank’s head of digital assets, Sabih Behzad, said earlier this month. “Banks have a wide variety of options available to engage in the stablecoin industry — everything from acting as a reserve manager, through to issuing their own stablecoin, either alone or in a consortium.” Moreover, Deutsche Bank has teamed up with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore an interoperable blockchain platform that provides services to tokenized and digital funds.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-02 12:17:40

However, recent data has unveiled a significant shift that demands our attention, signaling a potential turning point for market participants. Centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs), long the bustling hubs of digital asset trading, witnessed a dramatic dip in activity last month. Is this a temporary lull, or a sign of deeper, more enduring changes in the CEX spot trading volume landscape? What’s Behind the Drop in CEX Spot Trading Volume? According to insights from The Block, centralized crypto exchanges recorded a mere $1.07 trillion in CEX spot trading volume during June. This figure marks the lowest monthly total in the past nine months, a clear indicator of subdued activity across the board. For many, this sharp decline raises questions about the overall health and direction of the digital asset space. Min Jung, a perceptive analyst at Presto Research, points out that while Bitcoin has managed to maintain its strong position, hovering near its all-time highs, many other digital assets tell a different story. This divergence suggests a nuanced market where not all cryptocurrencies are experiencing the same trajectory. Bitcoin’s Resilience Amidst a Shifting Crypto Market One of the most striking observations in the current environment is Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience. Despite the overall downturn in trading volume, Bitcoin has held steady, maintaining its value close to record highs. This stability is a testament to its evolving role within the broader crypto market , often seen as a digital safe haven or a foundational asset for institutional players. Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s robust performance: Institutional Adoption: The continued influx of institutional capital, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs, provides a strong demand floor. Halving Anticipation: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event continues to fuel long-term bullish sentiment, as it historically reduces the supply of new Bitcoin. Macroeconomic Hedging: Some investors view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, drawing parallels to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. This steadfastness of Bitcoin creates a unique dynamic, highlighting a growing maturity in the crypto market where the largest asset behaves differently from the rest. The Tale of Two Markets: Bitcoin vs. Altcoins While Bitcoin shines, the story for altcoins , including major players like Ethereum (ETH), is considerably less optimistic. Min Jung noted that many altcoins remain approximately 40% below their peak levels. This stark contrast paints a picture of a bifurcated market: Asset Category Current Performance Key Drivers Bitcoin (BTC) Steady near record highs Institutional demand, ETF inflows, halving narrative Altcoins (e.g., ETH) ~40% below peak levels Subdued retail activity, lack of fresh narratives, liquidity concerns The struggle of altcoins can be attributed to several factors. Without new, compelling narratives or significant retail excitement, liquidity tends to consolidate into larger, more established assets like Bitcoin. Many altcoin projects rely heavily on retail enthusiasm and speculative trading, which are currently in short supply. Understanding the Power of Institutional Demand The primary engine driving the current market, especially Bitcoin’s stability, is undoubtedly institutional demand . Unlike previous bull runs often fueled by fervent retail speculation, today’s market is characterized by sophisticated players making large-scale investments. This shift is profound, impacting market volatility, liquidity, and overall sentiment. What does this institutional demand look like? Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent inflows into spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds have opened the floodgates for traditional finance to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Corporate Treasuries: More corporations are considering or already holding Bitcoin as part of their balance sheets, viewing it as a long-term store of value. Hedge Funds and Asset Managers: These entities are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, driven by its performance and diversification potential. This robust institutional interest provides a significant underpinning for Bitcoin, but it also means that the broader market is less susceptible to the rapid, sentiment-driven swings that retail activity often generates. Navigating the Current Crypto Landscape: Actionable Insights Given the current market dynamics, what does this mean for you, the investor? Understanding this shift from retail-driven speculation to institutionally-led growth is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Focus on Fundamentals: In a market driven by institutions, strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and robust technology become even more critical for altcoin projects. Risk Management: For altcoin investors, prudent risk management is paramount. Diversification and careful position sizing can help mitigate potential losses in a less liquid environment. Long-Term Perspective: The subdued retail activity and institutional accumulation suggest a market that may be consolidating for a longer-term upswing rather than immediate explosive gains. Patience is key. Monitor Institutional Flow: Keeping an eye on reports regarding institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and other products can offer clues about market direction. The current phase of the crypto market is less about quick pumps and more about strategic positioning and long-term value accumulation, particularly for Bitcoin. A Market in Transformation: What Lies Ahead? The significant dip in CEX spot trading volume in June, coupled with Bitcoin’s steadfastness and altcoins’ struggles, clearly indicates a market undergoing a profound transformation. The dominance of institutional demand for Bitcoin is undeniable, shaping a more mature, albeit less volatile, environment. While altcoins await a resurgence in retail interest or fresh catalysts, the broader crypto market continues to evolve, demanding a more informed and strategic approach from all participants. This period of consolidation may be laying the groundwork for future growth, but it will likely be driven by different forces than those seen in previous cycles.

From a trade location standpoint, this is classic high-risk territory. There are a few clear scenarios in play. First is the bearish reversal from resistance. Candlestick Pattern Analysis Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) been grinding sideways near the top of its recent move, and the price action is starting to look a little tired. The last few daily candles? Small bodies, upper wicks — classic spinning tops and borderline dojis. That’s the market flashing indecision, maybe even burnout after the June rally. That surge, by the way, came with a bullish engulfing pattern that looked strong at first, but the follow-through didn’t have much gas behind it. Volume started fading right after the breakout, which often means traders are either cashing out into strength or just not that convinced. Trend Health And Momentum From a momentum standpoint, things feel like they’re losing steam. The MACD histogram has gone flat around the zero line - a signal that neither bulls nor bears have the upper hand. The MACD lines are trying to cross upward, but the move lacks urgency. RSI is hanging around 51, which is as neutral as it gets. We were in overbought territory not too long ago, but that’s cooled off. And volume? Lower on the most recent push. That doesn’t scream FOMO - it feels more like cautious interest, the kind of slow accumulation you’d expect from funds, not Reddit traders. Box Analysis Looking at it through a Box lens, Bitcoin broke out of its $75K–$88K range in April with solid conviction. Since then, it’s been carving out a new box between about $100.5K and $110.5K. Right now, it’s hovering near the top of that range but hasn’t made a clean break. No spike in volume either, which makes the breakout case a bit shaky. A strong move above $110.5K, backed by volume and a firm close, could change that fast - but we’re not there yet. The Fibonacci levels - based on the swing low near $59K and the recent peak around $110.5K - give us a clearer roadmap if we pull back. First key supports show up around $98.9K (23.6%), $91.5K (38.2%), and deeper at $84.7K (50%). On the flip side, if we get a breakout and hold above $110.5K, the next targets fall around $125K, $144K, and even up near $166K. The current market setup is sitting right at the upper edge of a box, with price hovering between $100.5K and $110.5K. It’s a spot where things tend to get tricky - candles are showing signs of indecision, and we’re seeing weak follow-through on moves higher. Volume is thinning out as price nudges resistance, and momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are offering little help, both drifting in neutral-to-weak territory. So far, there’s been no confirmed breakout to the upside, but also no convincing breakdown - just a lot of waiting and watching. Momentum Interpretation and Scenarios Ahead From a trade location standpoint, this is classic high-risk territory. There’s no edge in jumping in aggressively on either side just yet. We’re sitting at a decision point, where the next big move will likely come from a trap or a clean breakout - and right now, neither has confirmed. Patience is the best position. There are a few clear scenarios in play. First is the bearish reversal from resistance. This would show up through a bearish engulfing candle, a dark cloud cover, or an evening star formation - ideally paired with a breakdown below ~$105K on heavy volume. If that happens, the play would be to short the rejection near $110.5K, placing a stop just above the wick highs (around $111.5K), and targeting moves back down to $100.5K, then $98.9K (the 23.6% Fib), and potentially $91.5K (38.2% Fib). The thesis here: price fakes a breakout, buyers get trapped, and bears take control as volume dries up at the highs. Scenario two is the real breakout - the kind that smart money usually drives. You’d want to see a strong bullish candle close above $110.5K, ideally on a volume spike. A bullish Marubozu or solid follow-through after a smaller range candle would also fit the bill. If that’s the case, buying the breakout makes sense, with stops just below the breakout candle or around $107.5K (a former resistance level turned support). Targets would then stretch toward $125.1K (127.2% Fib extension) and potentially $144K (161.8%). This setup says: the box has broken with conviction — time to ride the next wave up. Then there’s the trap — the false breakout scenario. Here, price briefly pushes above $110.5K but quickly reverses, closing back inside the box. You’d likely see a long upper wick and a small candle body — a classic bull trap with no real volume behind it. If price drops back below $110.5K (ideally under $109K), that’s your signal. The trade would be to short the failure, with a stop above the wick high (~$112K), and targets back to $100.5K and potentially $91.5K. The idea: smart money sold into the breakout, and now late buyers are left holding the bag. As for the current best read? This still feels like a “wait for confirmation” environment. The most likely near-term outcome is a range trap unless we see a breakout backed by real volume and structure. If you’re on the sidelines, stay patient - either a clean reversal or a true breakout will offer a better entry. Disclaimer: LONG BTC.

The interaction, noticed by crypto enthusiasts, has triggered fresh rumors about Musk's ongoing interest in Bitcoin and potential market moves. This isn’t Musk’s first brush with Bitcoin. Back in early 2021, Tesla made headlines by purchasing $1.5 billion worth of BTC and briefly accepting it as payment. Although Tesla later paused Bitcoin payments due to environmental concerns, the company still holds a significant portion of that Bitcoin on its balance sheet. According to its most recent filings, Tesla owns around 10,500 BTC , making it one of the largest public corporate holders. In addition to Tesla, SpaceX has also reportedly bought Bitcoin , though the exact amount remains undisclosed. Musk confirmed this during a panel in 2021, noting that both Tesla and SpaceX held BTC alongside his personal investment. His past tweets and online actions have shown an ability to move markets , and even a simple ""like"" from Musk often draws intense attention. With his net worth and influence, any perceived hint of Bitcoin support from Musk can fuel speculation, price movement, and renewed public interest in the cryptocurrency. While there's no confirmation that he's currently accumulating Bitcoin, this subtle social signal has once again put the spotlight on Musk's complex and influential relationship with the crypto space.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-02 12:24:18

In a landmark partnership, Nexo , one of the leading digital assets wealth platforms, will be sponsoring the DP World Tour , the main men’s professional golf tour of the European Tour group, for the next three years. The partnership sees Nexo becoming the Tour’s official digital asset and wealth partner through 2027. This strategic collaboration marks the first time a digital assets wealth firm is entering the sport, placing the partners at the forefront of global sport and finance innovation. Antoni Trenchev, Co-founder and Managing Partner at Nexo, believes the partnership will elevate Nexo’s brand and build global recognition. Speaking on the partnership with DP World Tour, Trenchev added: “This partnership reflects our belief that wealth and golf are built the same way: with preparation, control, and vision. Both the DP World Tour and Nexo share a commitment to precision, discipline, and performance – whether on the course or in finance. Golf is a natural fit for our brand: elevated, global, and principled.” The DP World Tour Schedule 2025 will feature 42 different tournaments in 26 countries and comprises three distinct phases: five ‘Global Swings’, the ‘Back 9’ and the ‘DP World Tour Play-Offs’. It features five Rolex Series events – the premium category of events on the DP World Tour - and four Major Championships.

Right now, those holders show an average profit of 220% on coins they bought and held for the long run. That figure is surprisingly low given Bitcoin’s recent surge back above $107,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Network Awakens—Massive On-Chain Moves Signal What’s Coming Lower Profit Levels Than Previous Peaks Darkfost used the MVRV ratio — market value relative to the average cost paid by long‑term holders — to track these shifts. In March 2024, when Bitcoin pushed up to $74,500, MVRV hit 300%. Then in December 2024, at the $108,000 peak, it climbed to 350%. By contrast, today’s 220% gain reflects the fact that many long‑term holders bought in at much higher levels than earlier in the cycle. Price Needs To Rise To Match Past Gains Based on an average cost basis of $33,800, Bitcoin would need to climb back to $135,200 just to restore that 300% profit level. If the market aimed to hit the 357% mark again, prices would have to reach roughly $154,400. Both figures track with what history tells us about investor behavior — people tend to sell when profits hit big round numbers. 📉 Unrealized profits of LTH continue to decline and are now approaching levels last seen during the October 2024 correction. The average unrealized profit, based on the MVRV ratio, currently stands at around 220%. That may seem high for BTC, but when compared to previous… pic.twitter.com/NeTCmXZVTY — Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) July 1, 2025 Historical Cycle Comparisons Looking farther back shows how much room remains. In December 2017, at the $19,500 top, long‑term holders saw unrealized profits of 4,000%. Then during the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin spiked to $63,000 in April 2021 and MVRV topped out at 1,230%. By November 2021, prices hit about $68,400 but unrealized gains for long‑term holders had already fallen to 340%. An analyst’s recent outlook lines up with this math, first pegging a cycle top at $135,000 in October 2024. After reviewing new data in May 2025, they revised the target range to $120,000–$150,000 and suggested a likely peak between August and September 2025. That range overlaps with the price levels needed to bring MVRV back to earlier highs. Room For More Upside, But Watch The Risks Based on latest figures, Bitcoin is trading at $106,750, roughly flat over the last 24 hours. Lower profit margins mean fewer long‑term holders are itching to sell right now, which could leave more fuel for higher prices. Still, on‑chain numbers don’t capture the whole picture. Spot-market flows, ETF moves and wider economic shifts can all trigger sharp reversals. Related Reading: Insane Or Insightful? VC Firm Says XRP Could Reach Nearly $9,000 In Just 5 Years For now, the evidence points to a market that isn’t overheated. If Bitcoin follows past cycles, it may have farther to climb before long‑term holders lock in gains at levels seen in March or December 2024. But investors should balance these on‑chain metrics with real‑world signals — and be ready for whatever comes next.

Deutsche Bank’s DWS Unit Launches German-Regulated Euro Stablecoin in Partnership with Galaxy and Flow Traders The newly launched digital asset EURAU will be 100% collateralized and will provide institutional-level transparency. According to AllUnity, this transparency will be achieved through regular proof of reserves and regulatory reporting. EURAU aims to deliver seamless integration for regulated financial institutions, fintechs, corporate treasury management (ERP) systems and corporations, enabling 24/7 seamless cross-border payments across Europe and beyond. The initiative joins the ranks of euro-pegged stablecoin projects following the entry into force of the European Union’s Crypto Asset Markets Regulation (MiCA) framework.

Gemini considered multiple factors, including recent momentum, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions, and provided a bullish prediction that could see XRP reach its highest level since 2018. XRP is currently trading at $2.19, up 0.29% from the previous day, and has been showing signs of strength amid a broader market recovery. Catalysts Behind the Forecast Gemini based its response on current trends, XRP’s historical behavior, and known catalysts. The AI highlighted Ripple’s continued expansion into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, institutional partnerships, and U.S. political shifts favorable to crypto. These factors have created a more favorable environment for XRP, especially as use cases, such as tokenization , become more prominent. One of the key elements shaping Gemini’s assessment is XRP’s regulatory status. Ripple recently dropped its appeal against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expects the SEC to do the same. With the end of the long-running legal battle on the horizon, XRP could be on the verge of a massive surge, as market participants anticipate an influx of institutional investors and adoption in the U.S. once the legal battle officially ends. Gemini also considered the broader crypto market environment, particularly the role of Bitcoin. According to the AI model, XRP’s price performance is partially dependent on BTC remaining above $90,000 by late July. Historically, altcoins like XRP tend to benefit from strong Bitcoin-led market momentum, especially when accompanied by increased liquidity and capital inflows across the sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Forecast for July 31 Based on this analysis, Gemini predicted that XRP will trade between $2.7 and $3.5 by July 31. The AI described this as a “realistic near-term range assuming no black swan events or abrupt crashes.” While some in the XRP community anticipate larger moves, Gemini was clear that without additional factors, such as a spot ETF approval , a major rally above current levels is unlikely in the short term. Gemini’s forecast reflects optimism for XRP, grounded in present-day trends rather than speculation. With Ripple continuing to expand its utility offerings and political sentiment in the U.S. shifting in favor of crypto, XRP is positioned for stable growth.

This move follows an already aggressive acquisition streak by the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, which includes crypto ad firm Spindl, privacy protocol Iron Fish, and a record-breaking $2.9 billion deal for Deribit in May. Terms of the Liquifi deal were not disclosed. Meanwhile, following the news, COIN stock has risen nearly 2% in pre-market trading today, bouncing back after a 4.33% drop yesterday. JUST IN: Coinbase acquires Liquifi amid a surge in cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions. pic.twitter.com/SOVl6rcR8X — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 2, 2025 Strengthening the foundation Liquifi helps crypto companies manage token ownership, track vesting schedules, and handle tax obligations. Big players like Uniswap Foundation, OP Labs, and Zora already rely on its tools. With this acquisition, Coinbase is adding key infrastructure that supports the full life cycle of a cryptocurrency project. According to Aklil Ibssa, head of corporate development at Coinbase, the goal is to make token creation and management simple enough for mass adoption. Echoing a similar sentiment, Max Branzburg, Head of Consumer Products at Coinbase, shared his excitement about partnering with Liquifi to help more businesses move on-chain. He highlighted the need for simpler tools to manage coin tables, legal and tax hurdles, vesting, and asset distribution as the on-chain ecosystem grows. End-to-End Platform in Progress This acquisition moves Coinbase closer to becoming a complete crypto platform. While exchanges like Binance and OKX offer token launchpads, Coinbase has focused more on listings and trading. With Liquifi, Coinbase is stepping earlier into the token process, covering everything from creation to compliance. Liquifi is not a launchpad but gives Coinbase the tools to support projects long before tokens hit the market. This positions the company to earn value throughout the token’s entire journey, not just after launch. [post_titles_links postid=”477768″] Backed Despite Legal Noise Liquifi is currently facing a lawsuit from a competitor over alleged document theft. Despite the ongoing legal case, Coinbase remains confident in its decision and has promised to support Liquifi through the process. The company says it conducted a thorough review before finalizing the deal. Crypto M&A Heats Up Coinbase is not the only one making moves. Earlier this year, it bought Deribit for 2.9 billion dollars , the largest crypto acquisition to date. Meanwhile, Stripe acquired stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet firm Privy, showing a growing appetite for consolidation across the industry. With Liquifi now in its corner, Coinbase is building not just for today’s crypto needs but laying the groundwork for the future.

The cryptocurrency's price typically falls about 18 months after the halving , a quadrennial event that slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply. This time, structural support from institutional investors is expected to counter any such weakness, said Geoff Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. ""The bitcoin halving cycle is dead,"" Kendrick wrote. The analyst reiterated his year-end bitcoin price forecast of $200,000, and said he expects the largest cryptocurrency to rise to around $135,000 by the end of the third quarter. Strong inflows from spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and renewed corporate treasury demand, which combined totaled 245,000 BTC in the second quarter, are seen as key drivers, and are expected to accelerate in the coming months, the report said. Macro tailwinds include a possible early departure by Fed Chair Jerome Powell and progress on U.S. stablecoin legislation, both of which could fuel further upside, the report added.

On July 1, the blockchain company unlocked 500 million XRP from escrow, well below its usual monthly release of one billion tokens. The release began with the Ripple (27) wallet receiving the full 500 million XRP, valued at around $1.1 billion. This triggered a series of rapid transfers as Ripple carried out its routine token rebalancing. https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1940181423396155545 Within minutes, 200 million XRP (worth approximately $440 million) was transferred to the address “rN8pqR,” followed by another 300 million XRP (valued at about $660 million) sent to “rKwJaG.” Despite these outflows, the Ripple (27) wallet still held 500 million XRP after the transactions. Continuing its monthly token management strategy, Ripple then locked 400 million XRP back into escrow. This re-locking was handled by the Ripple (15) wallet, which received two separate transfers of 200 million XRP from the addresses “rGKHDy” and “rHGfmg,” executed within minutes of each other. Ripple 1 billion XRP unlocks Since late 2017, Ripple has typically released one billion XRP from escrow each month. However, beginning earlier this year, the company began conducting internal transfers before formal unlocks. In March, Ripple created new escrows using existing XRP holdings, a pattern that has continued in recent months. Attention now turns to how XRP will react to the latest unlock. Notably, past releases have had little impact on the token’s price, which has generally moved in line with the broader cryptocurrency market . Regulatory developments, especially the ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission case nearing its conclusion, have had a greater influence. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.17, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and 0.8% lower over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold From a technical perspective, XRP is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.27, signaling potential short-term weakness. However, it remains well above the 200-day average at $1.81, suggesting a positive long-term trend. The relative strength index ( RSI ) at 50.04 indicates neutral momentum, with no clear buying or selling pressure.

His recent declaration on X, stating, “Everyone gets Bitcoin at the price they deserve,” struck a chord with many, sparking contemplation on the nature of value, timing, and personal conviction in the realm of digital assets. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a profound statement that encapsulates a significant aspect of the Bitcoin Investment journey. But what does it truly mean to “deserve” a price in a market as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin’s? Let’s delve into the layers of this intriguing philosophy and explore its implications for every investor. What Does ‘Everyone Gets Bitcoin at the Price They Deserve’ Truly Mean for Bitcoin Investment? Michael Saylor’s statement isn’t about fate or predestination in a mystical sense. Instead, it speaks to the interplay of an individual’s conviction, time horizon, and understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. It suggests that the price an investor acquires Bitcoin at is a reflection of their preparedness, patience, and perspective on this revolutionary asset. Consider these facets: Conviction and Understanding: Those who deeply research and understand Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized, scarce, and immutable store of value—a form of digital gold—are more likely to accumulate it steadily, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Their conviction allows them to see beyond daily noise. Time Preference: An investor with a low time preference prioritizes long-term gains over immediate gratification. They are willing to hold Bitcoin for years, even decades, believing in its eventual global adoption and appreciation. This patience often allows them to weather market downturns and benefit from long-term growth. Risk Tolerance and Preparedness: The “deserved” price can also reflect an individual’s readiness to take on the inherent volatility of a nascent asset class. Those who are prepared for significant swings and have allocated a responsible portion of their portfolio are less likely to panic sell at a low point. Serendipity and Opportunity: While conviction is key, sometimes opportunities arise unexpectedly. However, even these opportunities are often seized by those who have done their homework and are ready to act. Ultimately, Saylor’s quote nudges us to reflect on our own investment philosophy. Are we chasing quick gains, or are we building a long-term position in what many believe is the future of money? Decoding Michael Saylor Bitcoin Wisdom: Beyond the Price Tag When we talk about Michael Saylor Bitcoin insights, we’re not just discussing market predictions; we’re exploring a comprehensive worldview. Saylor, through MicroStrategy, has become one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, accumulating billions of dollars worth of the digital asset. His strategy isn’t about trading; it’s about converting corporate treasury assets from depreciating fiat currency into appreciating digital scarcity. His wisdom stems from a deep understanding of: Monetary Debasement: Saylor frequently articulates concerns about inflation and the ongoing debasement of fiat currencies. He views Bitcoin as a necessary hedge against this trend, a superior form of money that cannot be inflated away by central banks. Technological Superiority: He sees Bitcoin as a network, a protocol, and an engineering marvel that offers unprecedented security, decentralization, and global reach. It’s not just a coin; it’s a foundational technology. Long-Term Accumulation: Saylor advocates for a “stacking sats” mentality, encouraging continuous accumulation of Bitcoin over time, irrespective of price. This dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach smooths out volatility and builds a substantial position over the long run. For Saylor, the “deserved price” isn’t about timing the market perfectly; it’s about understanding the inevitable trajectory of a superior monetary network. Those who grasp this fundamental truth will, by their actions and conviction, naturally acquire Bitcoin at prices that reflect their long-term vision, even if those prices seem high in the short term. Navigating Bitcoin Price Action: The Role of Conviction and Patience The history of Bitcoin Price Action is a rollercoaster of exhilarating highs and gut-wrenching lows. From its humble beginnings to its multi-thousand-dollar peaks, Bitcoin has demonstrated extreme volatility. This volatility is precisely why Saylor’s philosophy is so pertinent. Many investors are swayed by short-term price movements, leading to emotional buying at peaks and panic selling during dips. Consider the following comparison of investor mindsets: Aspect Short-Term Trader Long-Term Investor (Saylor’s Philosophy) Focus Daily/weekly price swings Fundamental value, adoption curve Emotional Impact High (fear of missing out, fear of losing) Low (sees dips as opportunities) Strategy Timing entries/exits, technical analysis Dollar-cost averaging, HODLing “Deserved” Price The lowest possible entry, highest exit The price reflecting one’s conviction and time horizon Outcome Often misses major moves, higher stress Potentially significant long-term wealth, lower stress The role of conviction here is paramount. When the market experiences a significant downturn, those with strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential view it as a buying opportunity, or at least a reason to hold firm. Conversely, those lacking conviction might succumb to fear, selling their assets at a loss. In this context, the price you “deserve” is the price you are willing to hold through, demonstrating your belief in the asset’s future. Unpacking Crypto Market Philosophy: Time Preference and Personal Responsibility Saylor’s quote delves deep into Crypto Market Philosophy , particularly the concept of time preference. High time preference individuals prioritize immediate gratification and consumption, often leading to impulsive decisions and a focus on short-term gains. Low time preference individuals, on the other hand, defer gratification, save, and invest for the future, understanding that patience can yield greater rewards. In the context of Bitcoin: High Time Preference: Might buy Bitcoin on a whim, hoping for a quick pump, and sell at the first sign of trouble. They often end up buying high and selling low, thus “deserving” a less favorable price due to their impatience. Low Time Preference: Views Bitcoin as a long-term savings technology. They accumulate it consistently, understanding that its true value will unfold over decades, not days. Their patience and foresight allow them to “deserve” a better average price over time, as they benefit from compounding gains and weather market cycles. This philosophy also ties into personal responsibility. In a decentralized market like crypto, there’s no central authority to bail you out or guarantee returns. Your success is largely dependent on your own research, discipline, and emotional control. The price you get is a direct reflection of these attributes. Building Your Digital Gold Strategy: Actionable Insights for the Long Haul If Saylor’s philosophy resonates with you, how can you apply it to build a robust Digital Gold Strategy ? It’s not about wishing for a lower price; it’s about cultivating the mindset and habits that lead to favorable long-term outcomes. Here are some actionable insights: Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, commit to investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy averages out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of volatility and removing emotional decision-making. Focus on Conviction, Not Speculation: Understand why you’re investing in Bitcoin. Is it for its scarcity, decentralization, censorship resistance, or its potential as a global reserve asset? A strong conviction will help you hold through bear markets and avoid chasing fleeting trends. Practice Self-Custody: Once you’ve accumulated a significant amount of Bitcoin, consider moving it off exchanges into a hardware wallet. This gives you true ownership and control, reducing counterparty risk. Continuous Learning: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Stay informed about Bitcoin’s technological advancements, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends. The more you learn, the stronger your conviction will become. Manage Your Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. While Saylor is bullish, it’s crucial for individual investors to maintain a diversified portfolio and not overexpose themselves to any single asset, no matter how promising. The “deserved price” is not just a point on a chart; it’s the culmination of your journey, your learning, your discipline, and your conviction. It’s the price you acquire when you align your actions with a long-term, sound money philosophy. Challenges and Considerations on the Path to Deserved Prices While Saylor’s philosophy offers a powerful framework, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges inherent in the Bitcoin Investment landscape: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be extreme, testing even the most seasoned investor’s resolve. Maintaining conviction during significant drawdowns requires immense mental fortitude. Information Overload and FUD: The crypto space is rife with misinformation, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Distinguishing credible information from noise is crucial. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, which can introduce unpredictable market shifts. Technological Risk: While Bitcoin’s protocol is robust, the broader crypto ecosystem is still evolving, and new technologies or vulnerabilities could emerge. Overcoming these challenges requires not just financial planning but also psychological resilience. The “deserved price” often comes after navigating these hurdles with patience and an unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. The Grand Vision: Bitcoin’s Role as a Global Digital Gold Michael Saylor’s vision for Bitcoin extends beyond personal investment; he sees it as the ultimate form of Digital Gold Strategy for institutions, corporations, and even nation-states. He posits that in a world grappling with unprecedented levels of debt and monetary expansion, Bitcoin offers a mathematically sound, globally accessible, and permissionless alternative to traditional assets. This grand vision underscores why he believes every price is a “deserved” one. For those who understand Bitcoin’s role as an escape hatch from a depreciating fiat system, any price paid today is potentially a bargain compared to its future purchasing power. It’s about accumulating a piece of the hardest money ever invented, rather than trying to perfectly time a speculative asset. The journey of accumulating Bitcoin is unique for everyone. Some enter early, benefiting from exponential growth; others discover it later, facing higher price points but perhaps with greater clarity on its long-term potential. Each path, each entry point, contributes to a personal narrative shaped by individual conviction, research, and patience. The “deserved” price is not a judgment, but a reflection of this individual journey and the commitment one makes to the future of sound money. Ultimately, Michael Saylor’s statement is an invitation to introspection. It encourages us to look beyond the daily fluctuations and ask ourselves: What is our conviction? What is our time horizon? And how much do we truly understand the profound shift that Bitcoin represents? The answers to these questions will inevitably shape the price at which we acquire, hold, and ultimately benefit from the world’s premier digital asset.

Recent data reveals a surge in corporate adoption. From June 23 to 27 alone, 64 separate announcements referenced corporate Bitcoin activity. This involved over 10,000 BTC in total moving into treasury accounts. This comes in when Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is on track for a casual $14 billion unrealized gain in Q2. All credit goes to BTC’s fresh rally. Despite generating just $112.8 million in revenue from its legacy software business, Strategy has outperformed even the largest S&P 500 corporations. Macro fears drive Bitcoin treasury surge With mounting macroeconomic uncertainty, inflation fears, and rising institutional acceptance of crypto, companies from Norway to London to Wall Street are steadily adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. As per the data provided by NLNico, nine new corporate treasuries purchased nearly 5,900 BTC, while 21 existing holders added another 4,126 BTC last week.

BTC is trading at an average price of $107,381, below by just 4% from its all-time high of $112K. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 10% to hit $47 billion. As reported , K33 AB, a digital asset brokerage and research firm, confirmed the purchase of 10 BTC for SEK 10 million (worth $1.49 million). This follows K33’s recent launch of a formal Bitcoin treasury strategy and a successful share issue aimed at funding the acquisition of up to 1,000 BTC. The firm now holds 35 Bitcoins. Vaultz Capital PLC isn’t far behind. They’re looking to raise £1 million to fuel their Bitcoin ambitions. They’ve already raised £4 million, swapped it for 50 BTC, and now want to become a leading corporate HODLer. MSTR up by 3,300%, who’s next? The movement isn’t limited to startups, as Norwegian Block Exchange ($NBX.OL) raised NOK 5.4 million ($532,000) through a put option, partially allocated for Bitcoin purchases. However, Green Minerals inked a NOK 250 million ($25 million) structured financing agreement to expand its position. It already holds 4 BTC. DDC Enterprise recently closed a massive $528 million financing package to fund its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This includes a $26 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), $25 million in convertible notes, and a $200 million equity line of credit. Similarly, Sequans ($SQNS) announced a $384 million strategic investment. This included $195 million in PIPE and $189 million in convertible notes, with execution support from Swan Bitcoin. Smaller firms are also making bold moves in the Bitcoin race. UK-listed Anemoi ($AMOI.L) increased its BTC+Gold ETF exposure to 40% of its cash reserves. It cited concerns about the ballooning US fiscal deficit. On the other side, Coffee company Vanadi added another 10 BTC to bring its holdings to 64. The Smarter Web Company also acquired 230.05 BTC. It is now holding 773.58 BTC in total, with £38 million (worth $52 million) in reserve to potentially buy more. Perhaps the most headline-grabbing development is from American Bitcoin Corp, a private company backed by Hut 8 and Eric Trump. The firm recently raised $215 million for its treasury strategy and currently holds 215 BTC. This all started when Michael Saylor’s Strategy started the BTC accumulation race. Its shares are now up over 3,300% since the CEO first bet on Bitcoin in mid-2020. MSTR shares closed trading at $373 in the last session. However, it’s up by 2% in the pre-market session, hinting at hitting $381 when the market opens.

Elon Musk and Bitcoin – it’s a relationship that never really goes quiet. For years now, there’s been constant chatter around whether the Tesla CEO is quietly buying more BTC, especially during uncertain times. Some even believe he’s stacking to protect against what they see as a weakening U.S. dollar. That buzz just got louder again. Here’s why. The Tweet That Sparked It All A crypto analyst and reporter from Bitcoin Magazine shared a bold update on X: “$400 BILLION WORLD’S RICHEST MAN JUST LIKED A X POST SAYING HE’S SECRETLY BUYING #BITCOIN ELON MUSK IS BUYING BTC!!! ” $400 BILLION WORLD’S RICHEST MAN JUST LIKED A X POST SAYING HE'S SECRETLY BUYING #BITCOIN ELON MUSK IS BUYING BTC!!! pic.twitter.com/yLa6k7x2I2 — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) July 2, 2025 It all started with a tweet pointing out how Musk has been vocal about government overspending and economic mismanagement – but hasn’t mentioned Bitcoin in a while. A reply suggested he might be quietly buying. That’s the post Musk liked and yes, it looks like the like came from his verified profile. Some users were quick to call it fake, but @coinjoined , the original poster, shared a screen recording showing the like came from Musk’s official account. There’s been no official comment, but it hasn’t stopped Crypto Twitter from going all-in on speculation. Timing Matters – Musk vs Trump Over the “Big Beautiful Bill” The timing is definitely interesting. It comes at a time when Musk is clashing with Donald Trump over the controversial “Big Beautiful Bill” – a massive spending plan that includes tax breaks for the wealthy, plans for mass deportations, and a $5 trillion debt ceiling raise. Musk, who was once head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slammed the bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.” Trump hit back on Truth Social, suggesting Musk wouldn’t survive without government subsidies and he would have to “pack up and move back to South Africa”. All of this adds to the tension and gives more weight to the idea that Musk could be quietly moving money into Bitcoin as a hedge. Tesla’s Bitcoin Holdings: No Sales, More Rumors Tesla already holds 11,509 BTC, worth around $1.24 billion at current prices. And they haven’t sold a single coin recently, even as Bitcoin hit new highs. That alone is enough to raise eyebrows. In fact, rumors have been floating for a while now that Tesla might be planning to buy another $3 billion worth of Bitcoin. Nothing confirmed, but the company already has Coinbase Prime Custody in place, so it’s well-positioned to scale up. So, Is Musk Buying Bitcoin Again? There’s no official confirmation – just a liked tweet and a very active rumor mill. But with Musk, subtle moves often lead to big headlines. And given the political drama, economic uncertainty, and his history with crypto, it wouldn’t be surprising if he’s once again betting on Bitcoin.

Grab the Next 1000x Meme Coin — Get Ready for $AGNT Listing Now Pepe Targets 16% Jump as Traders Watch Key Resistance and RSI Stays Neutral Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.0000092276 and $0.0000110336. This range indicates some stability after recent fluctuations. Traders are watching closely to see if the coin will break through key levels. Over the past week, Pepe's price increased by 8.92%. This suggests a short-term upward trend. However, over the past month, the price fell by 16.58%. In the last six months, it's down by 51.45%. This shows a long-term downward trend with some recent recovery. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0000116623. If the price climbs to this point, it would mean an increase of about 16.62% from the current price. The closest support is at $0.0000080503, which is approximately 19.5% below the current price. Breaking through these levels could indicate the next direction for Pepe. The RSI is at 41.96, which suggests the coin isn't overbought or oversold. This neutral position could mean the price may continue to move within the current range. Given the recent weekly gain and the RSI, there might be potential for the price to rise towards the resistance level. Conclusion While coins like PEPE have made impressive gains, their short-term potential appears limited in the current market surge. Investors are seeking fresh opportunities that can offer significant returns beyond what these coins can provide. Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by unleashing true intelligence for maximum profits.

One of the most significant developments in this space is the emergence of stablecoins – digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US Dollar or the Korean Won. Recently, the spotlight has turned to Asia, where South Korea stablecoins are becoming a focal point of regulatory discussions. This proactive approach by one of the world’s leading tech and financial hubs signals a crucial shift in how digital assets will be governed and utilized. Why is South Korea Prioritizing Won-Denominated Stablecoins Now? South Korea has long been a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. However, with this rapid growth comes the inherent need for robust regulatory frameworks to protect investors and maintain financial stability. The recent move by South Korea’s Presidential Policy Planning Committee, in collaboration with financial regulators, to scrutinize the issuance requirements and regulatory framework for won-denominated stablecoins is a testament to this commitment. This isn’t just about controlling a nascent market; it’s about laying down foundational rules for a future where digital currencies play a more integral role in daily transactions and broader economic activities. The urgency stems from several factors: Investor Protection: Unregulated stablecoins can pose significant risks, including volatility and the potential for scams, which can harm retail and institutional investors alike. Financial Stability: Large-scale stablecoin adoption without proper oversight could impact the traditional banking system and the national currency. Combating Illicit Activities: Clear regulations help prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal endeavors. Fostering Innovation: A well-defined regulatory environment can actually encourage legitimate innovation by providing clarity and reducing uncertainty for businesses. What Key Issues are the Regulators Addressing in Crypto Regulation South Korea? The core of the discussions between the Presidential Policy Planning Committee and financial regulators revolves around creating a comprehensive framework for crypto regulation South Korea . A critical area of focus, as reported by Maeil Business Newspaper, is the capital requirements for stablecoin issuers. This particular emphasis highlights a significant concern: ensuring that entities issuing won-denominated stablecoins possess sufficient financial backing to honor their obligations and absorb potential shocks. The virtual asset task force, which received an additional briefing from regulators, delved deep into these critical issues. The authorities’ insistence on clearer issuance standards aims to prevent smaller crypto firms that lack robust financial resources from entering the market. This proactive measure is designed to: Key Regulatory Focus Why It Matters Capital Requirements Ensures issuers have enough reserves to maintain the stablecoin’s peg and withstand market volatility, protecting users from potential collapses. Clear Issuance Standards Establishes a baseline for quality and trustworthiness, preventing unqualified entities from launching stablecoins that could destabilize the market. Consumer Protection Guarantees that users’ funds are secure and that mechanisms are in place for dispute resolution and redressal. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) Integrates stablecoins into existing financial crime prevention frameworks, enhancing national security. How Will Stablecoin Issuance Be Affected? The emphasis on stricter capital requirements will undoubtedly shape the landscape of stablecoin issuance in South Korea. While it might initially limit the number of entities able to issue won-denominated stablecoins, this approach is designed to foster a more secure and reliable ecosystem. Larger, more financially stable institutions, potentially including traditional banks or established fintech companies, might be better positioned to meet these stringent requirements. This could lead to a consolidation of the stablecoin market around a few robust players, rather than a proliferation of smaller, potentially riskier projects. For aspiring stablecoin issuers, this means a significant hurdle in terms of financial backing and operational transparency. They will likely need to demonstrate not only substantial capital reserves but also robust compliance frameworks, clear auditing processes, and strong governance structures. This shift is in line with global trends where regulators are increasingly demanding that stablecoins be treated akin to traditional financial instruments, requiring similar levels of oversight and prudential standards. Moreover, the discussions are likely to touch upon the type of assets that can back these stablecoins. Will they be fully backed by fiat currency in segregated accounts? Or will a mix of highly liquid assets be permitted? The answers to these questions will profoundly impact the operational models for future stablecoin projects in South Korea. What Role Does the Virtual Asset Task Force Play in Shaping the Future? The involvement of the virtual asset task force underscores the systematic and detailed approach South Korea is taking towards digital asset regulation. These task forces typically comprise experts from various fields, including finance, technology, law, and economics, working collaboratively to understand complex issues and formulate effective policy recommendations. Their role is crucial in bridging the gap between rapidly evolving blockchain technology and traditional regulatory frameworks. The briefing received by the task force on capital requirements and issuance standards suggests that their findings and recommendations will heavily influence the final regulatory guidelines. This body acts as a crucial interface, translating technical intricacies into policy actionable insights for the government. Their work ensures that regulations are not only comprehensive but also practical and forward-looking, capable of adapting to future innovations in the digital asset space. The task force is likely evaluating various models for stablecoin regulation observed globally, such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, including stablecoins. By learning from international best practices and adapting them to South Korea’s unique market conditions, the task force aims to create a regulatory environment that is both secure and conducive to innovation. Benefits and Challenges of a Regulated Stablecoin Market The move towards a regulated stablecoin market in South Korea presents both significant benefits and notable challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Trust and Adoption: Regulatory clarity and strong oversight will build greater trust among institutional investors and the general public, potentially leading to wider adoption of won-denominated stablecoins for payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Financial Innovation: A clear regulatory sandbox can encourage fintech companies to innovate responsibly, developing new services and products built on stablecoins. Market Stability: By ensuring stablecoins are adequately backed and managed, the risk of ‘runs’ or de-pegging events that could ripple through the broader financial system is significantly reduced. Global Competitiveness: South Korea can position itself as a leader in responsible digital asset innovation, attracting international businesses and investment. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Overreach: Overly stringent regulations could stifle innovation and drive businesses to less regulated jurisdictions. Implementation Complexity: Developing and enforcing a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets is a complex undertaking, requiring significant resources and expertise. Technological Pace: Regulations must be flexible enough to keep pace with rapid technological advancements in the blockchain space. International Coordination: Stablecoins are global by nature; lack of international regulatory harmonization could lead to arbitrage opportunities or fragmented markets. What Does This Mean for the Future of South Korea’s Digital Economy? South Korea’s proactive stance on regulating won-denominated stablecoins signals a clear intent to integrate digital assets into its financial ecosystem in a controlled and secure manner. This isn’t just about stablecoins; it’s a broader statement about the nation’s vision for its digital economy. By establishing clear rules, South Korea aims to harness the transformative potential of blockchain technology while mitigating its inherent risks. For businesses operating in the crypto space, this means a shift towards greater compliance and institutionalization. For consumers, it promises a safer environment for engaging with digital currencies. As these regulations take shape, we can expect to see a more mature and resilient digital asset market emerge in South Korea, potentially setting a precedent for other nations grappling with similar challenges. The journey towards fully regulated stablecoins is complex, but South Korea’s commitment through its Presidential Policy Planning Committee and virtual asset task force demonstrates a determined effort to build a robust and trustworthy digital financial future. Conclusion: A New Era for South Korea Stablecoins South Korea’s diligent assessment of issuance conditions for won-denominated stablecoins marks a pivotal moment in the nation’s digital finance journey. The focus on robust capital requirements and clear issuance standards, spearheaded by the Presidential Policy Planning Committee and the dedicated virtual asset task force, underscores a commitment to fostering a secure, stable, and innovative crypto ecosystem. This strategic move aims to protect investors, ensure financial stability, and pave the way for legitimate businesses to thrive in the burgeoning digital asset space. As South Korea continues to refine its crypto regulation South Korea , it is poised to become a global leader in responsible digital asset integration, setting a benchmark for the future of finance.

Matt Hougan, chief investment officer, cited three main drivers: post-halving supply tightening, institutional adoption and growing regulatory clarity. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already transformed the market and attracted mainstream capital. Institutions are allocating BTC as a reserve asset, and regulated access has given confidence. Bitwise says this institutional demand is structural, not speculative, and will continue to support price. JUST IN: Bitwise doubles down on $200K $BTC target for 2025 but casts doubt on new highs for $ETH and $SOL . pic.twitter.com/45ojQaLN6h — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) July 1, 2025 Bitcoin’s 21 million hard cap and its perceived role as an inflation hedge make it a standout in a volatile macro environment. Key Drivers: Institutional Entry: ETF inflows are sustaining interest. Supply Constraints: Halving reduces new issuance. Regulatory Progress: Clarity brings cautious capital off the sidelines. Bitcoin Outperforms ETH and SOL While Bitcoin is looking up, Ethereum and Solana are facing headwinds. Ethereum’s high gas fees, congestion and uncertainty over its status as a security are weighing on it. Despite its role in DeFi and NFTs, ETH has yet to show post-Merge resilience that matches investor expectations. Solana, once touted as an “Ethereum killer” is dealing with reliability issues and validator centralization questions. Network outages have eroded confidence, even as its fast transactions and low fees are appealing. Bitwise is cautious on both altcoins for 2025. While stablecoin growth and ETF approvals could eventually turn sentiment around, Bitwise doesn’t think ETH or SOL will make new all-time highs in the near term. Bitcoin Chart Structure Points to Near-Term Upside On the chart, Bitcoin’s bounce from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $103,270 is a continuation of the bullish trend. The price is now testing resistance at $107,832 with a breakout to $108,957 and $110,448. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview EMA Support: 50-period EMA ($106,993) is acting as support. MACD Signal: Histogram is positive. Candlestick: Bullish engulfing near support. BTC Trade: Long: Above $107,832 Stop: Below $105,400 Target: $108,957 to $110,448 Summary: Bitwise’s $200K Bitcoin price prediction is shaping up to be a compelling narrative for the next leg higher. While Ethereum and Solana continue to face network and regulatory challenges, Bitcoin stands out as the strongest institutional-grade digital asset heading into 2025. Volatility will persist, but with tightening supply, rising institutional demand, and growing ETF inflows, the fundamentals and momentum remain firmly on Bitcoin’s side. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.8M Hard Cap as Presale Enters Final Hours With Bitcoin trading near $107,000, investor focus is shifting toward BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a rising altcoin that is nearly fully allocated during its presale. As of today, the project has raised $7,900,293 of its $8,873,431 target, leaving under $1 million to be raised before the token price moves to the next tier.

After being in bear territory in the past month, based on a 25.3% drop, Cardano seeks to dust itself off after finding a robust support base. Market analyst Lingrid pointed out, “ ADA is rebounding strongly from the base of a descending channel after reclaiming the 0.5585 support zone. The price structure shows a shift in momentum, forming higher lows as it targets a move toward the 0.70 region. A successful breakout from the descending pattern adds confidence to this short-term bullish setup.” Source: Lingrid Therefore, Cardano is eyeing a bullish reversal within a falling structure, with the target being the psychological price of $0.70. Having traded within a falling wedge pattern for close to two months with lower highs and lower lows being the order of the day, crypto analyst Femifire speculates that selling pressure is decreasing, which may set the stage for a reversal.

John Galt, a long-time Bitcoin holder, made a fortune by cashing in on a rare Casascius ingot purchased for $500. The Most Valuable Bitcoin! The Casascius bar collection, which was first printed by Mike Caldwell in 2011 after Bitcoin was first introduced, has still managed to make a name for itself today. While Casascius physical Bitcoins are among the most iconic collectibles in crypto history, John Galt purchased one of these metal bars containing Bitcoin for just $500 in 2012. Galt had one physical bar worth 100 BTC in his hand. Galt, who had been holding these rare Bitcoins since 2012, finally could not stand it anymore and sold his BTCs in May. Announcing that he sold BTCs on the Bitcoin Talk forum, Galt said, “I decided to sell when Bitcoin reached $100,000.” “I had one of the Casascius Bitcoin bars. I had one worth 100 BTC and I bought it for like $500 in 2012. When Bitcoin hit $10,000 a few years ago, I started getting really nervous. I mean, the thought of holding onto something worth over a million dollars was putting a lot of pressure on me. But I didn't want to cash it in. To me, a physical Bitcoin that hasn't been cashed in feels like it's worth more than just cash. I tried to sell it a few times but it was hard to sell something that valuable. I even looked at auctions but I would get less than the value of the Bitcoin itself. “I got to the present day and it's worth over $10 million. I'm still a little bit unsure, but I finally cashed it out today.” John Galt earned $10 million from the 100 BTC he bought for just $500 in 2012. The production of these physical BTCs was halted in 2013 after the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) classified Caldwell’s business as a money transfer service. *This is not investment advice.

However, will Bitcoin bulls have enough in the tank to exit from the top of the bull flag and power higher into price discovery? Last tussle between bulls and bears The market awaits, while the bulls and the bears wrestle for dominance. On the side of the bulls is the strong Bitcoin treasuries/ETFs buying pressure, and a very positive chart setup. In favour of the bears is the constant profit-taking of the long-term holders and the OGs who are selling into such strength in order to take some lifestyle chips off of the table. With low volume being traded on exchanges , given that most $BTC is being sourced over the counter (OTC), this kind of environment is ideal for the major exchanges and market makers to manipulate price. Therefore, it just might be that a potential breakout could be when these big players are good and ready for it. $BTC bounces from strong support Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $BTC shows how the price bounced pretty much as expected from one of the strong support levels. This happened to be at $105,400. So far on Wednesday, the price has reached $107,500, which is a notable level of resistance. It might be expected that the bulls eventually push on through this level and come up against the upper trendline of the bull flag. A breakout and consolidation above could then ensue. If the bears are to spoil the party, they would possibly look to hold the price at the bull flag trendline, or the resistance at $109,000, before forcing the price back down. That said, once a potential breakout has been achieved, coming back to test the trendline before moving higher would be the more likely outcome. Bullish engulfing candle on daily Source: TradingView On the daily time frame things are looking positive. The price is back above the 50-day SMA (blue line), and the current candle is already engulfing Tuesday’s red candle. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index shows that the indicator line has bounced off of the yellow moving average at the 50.00 level. $105,600 support has become important level Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals how the support at $105,600 is becoming an important level, with at least 5 good touches of this line. If the $BTC price can break out on Wednesday, or perhaps later in the week, the Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart are likely to angle up and a bullish cross-up would lend fuel to the breakout.

On July 1, 2025, the SEC approved the conversion of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), opening the door for broad retail access to XRP, alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. The news, highlighted by Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store was hailed as a “full circle moment.” After nearly five years of SEC litigation against Ripple, XRP’s inclusion in a regulated ETF signals a turning point in its journey toward institutional legitimacy. From Courtroom to Trading Floor Since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs in December 2020, XRP has faced legal and regulatory hurdles that limited its availability on major U.S. platforms. The litigation cast a long shadow over the token’s reputation and accessibility. But with this ETF approval, XRP is entering a new era, reclaiming its seat at the table of mainstream finance. Biggest news from today IMO… xrp will now be accessible to everyday investors via Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF. After nearly 5yrs of SEC vs Ripple litigation. And now anyone will be able to easily access xrp in SEC-regulated investment vehicle. Full circle moment. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 2, 2025 Now, investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges or self-custody wallets to gain exposure to XRP. Instead, they can simply buy shares of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF on NYSE Arca, just like they would any traditional stock or fund. What the ETF Includes Grayscale’s ETF will track a diversified portfolio of top cryptocurrencies. According to the latest composition, approximately 80% of the fund is allocated to Bitcoin, 11% to Ethereum, and about 4.8% to XRP alongside smaller portions of Solana and Cardano. For XRP, even a modest share in a regulated ETF marks a huge leap forward, given its previously restricted status during the SEC case. The approval also affirms the SEC’s growing willingness to allow exposure to cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially through multi-asset structures. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Strategic Win for XRP and the Market Nate Geraci underscored the importance of this development, noting that for the first time, U.S. investors can now access XRP through a fully regulated, SEC-approved product. This provides exposure without the complexities of navigating crypto-specific infrastructure, while also offering tax advantages and simplified portfolio integration. The ETF structure also adds an important layer of legitimacy to XRP. Its presence in a vetted investment product sends a strong message to the broader financial market: XRP has passed a major regulatory test, and institutional doors are opening. Looking Ahead This approval may pave the way for more focused XRP-based investment products in the future. As market demand grows, standalone XRP ETFs could emerge , much like what happened with Bitcoin. Additionally, this move may accelerate similar approvals for other altcoins, especially under a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. For long-time XRP holders, this milestone represents more than convenience, it’s vindication. After enduring years of uncertainty, the token now stands proudly alongside the industry’s biggest assets in a fund built for traditional investors. As Geraci aptly put it: “After nearly five years of SEC vs Ripple litigation… full circle moment.” XRP has arrived.

This marks its first annual delivery gain this year after China approved its upgraded driver-assistance technology. The China Passenger Car Association released the data on Wednesday without separating domestic sales from exports. Until June, deliveries from Shanghai had mostly drifted downward. Bloomberg reports this modest gain follows new guidelines unveiled in June by Beijing to pave the way for broader deployment of Tesla’s most advanced driver-assistance programs. The rules are seen as a key step in a market where buyers now pay close attention to smart vehicle technology. The EV maker’s Shanghai facility remains central to its global output, serving both domestic shoppers and overseas customers. It is especially critical for exports to Europe , where the company has struggled to keep pace amid rising competition and growing political headwinds. According to the same trade group, sales of new-energy vehicles in China, including pure electric models and plug-in hybrids, rose 29% in June to reach 1.26 million units sold to dealers, compared with a year earlier. Tesla sees sales rise in Norway and Spain Tesla’s registrations climbed in Norway and Spain, hinting that buyers are embracing its refreshed Model Y. Portugal also saw sales edge up, although local figures did not clarify if the Model Y drove that increase. Recent protests over CEO Elon Musk’s links to former President Donald Trump and support for far-right politics in Europe have taken a toll, with shows of vandalism against Tesla’s showrooms and charging points. Schmidt Automotive data show Tesla has recorded six straight year-on-year quarterly losses in new registrations across Western Europe. It looks like Musk’s EV firm will record its seventh straight drop in deliveries in the second quarter of 2025. Tesla began taking orders for its updated Model Y several months ago, but deliveries to many European customers did not start until June. In Norway, the first new Model Ys reached buyers in May, sparking a jump in registrations of 54% year-on-year in June and a 115.3% rise for the Model Y to 5,004 units. “This is a demonstration of power by Tesla. After so much turmoil surrounding owner and frontman Elon Musk, they manage to achieve this result. It’s impressive,” said Erik Lorentzen, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association. In Spain, Tesla’s sales jumped 60.7% in June to 2,632 vehicles, with Model Y deliveries up 127.2% to 1,179. In Portugal, overall Tesla sales rose 7.3%. “Significant percentage changes often hide small numbers, and some European markets only have hundreds or low thousands of sales each month, which can be impacted by logistics, stock levels, and new product launches,” said Andy Leyland, co-founder of supply-chain specialist SC Insights. Sweden and Denmark sales sink over 60% Tesla’s registrations fell sharply in Sweden, down 64.4% in June. In Denmark, overall deliveries slid 61.6%, with Model Y sales dropping 31.2% to 1,155 cars. Tesla’s sales were also down 10% in France and plunged 66% in Italy, even as all-electric car registrations in Italy rose 117% in June. Tesla has not introduced a new mainstream model since 2020, while legacy automakers are rolling out more affordable electric cars and Chinese rivals like BYD gain market share rapidly. “A new model update is the classic extension strategy for a product that is used to inflate a product’s lifecycle, giving a short-term bounce,” said Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive. The publication of Tesla’s monthly registration figures came as Musk renewed his public dispute with Donald Trump over a sweeping tax cut and spending bill. TSLA shares closed down 5.3% in Wednesday afternoon trade. Tesla is due to announce another drop in quarterly figures on Wednesday. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading above $107,400, reflecting a 0.8% daily gain. Despite the short pullback, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index posted a “Greed” score of 63 out of 100, only slightly lower than Tuesday’s reading, indicating that market participants continue to display optimism, even as Bitcoin navigates a period that has historically seen muted performance. Heading Into a Historically Weak Quarter Analysts are closely watching to see when Bitcoin might retest its all-time high of $111,970 , achieved on May 22. Optimism was high earlier this week as BTC traded near $109,000, but the momentum slowed as the third quarter began on July 1. Crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades noted on Tuesday that the third quarter is typically the weakest for BTC and ETH due to slower summer months characterized by reduced trading volumes and liquidity. Historical data from CoinGlass shows that BTC has averaged a 5.47% gain in the third quarter since 2013. If this trend holds, Bitcoin could approach $111,000 by the end of September, just below its all-time high. Indicators Signal Continued Bitcoin Dominance BTC’s second-quarter performance closely aligned with historical trends, delivering a 31% gain to end June at $108,383, outperforming its 27% average Q2 return since 2014. June also closed with Bitcoin’s highest monthly candle, reinforcing bullish sentiment in the market. Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market remains strong, sitting at around 65.5% and marking an increase of nearly 13% this year, according to TradingView data. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index by CoinMarketCap currently sits at a “Bitcoin Season” score of 20 out of 100, indicating that altcoins continue to underperform relative to BTC over the past 90 days. However, caution lingers. CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, noted that their Bitcoin Bull Score Metric has dropped into neutral territory, currently reading 50 out of 100. “Bitcoin Bull Score is in NEUTRAL territory now—50. Needs to be 60 or above for prices to sustain a rally,” Moreno stated , suggesting that while the market remains optimistic, further momentum is needed to break higher in the coming weeks.

The world of cryptocurrency is constantly presenting new opportunities, and a significant development just hit the European financial scene. Leading crypto asset manager Bitwise has officially launched its NEAR Staking ETP on Germany’s Deutsche Börse Xetra. This move isn’t just another product launch; it’s a revolutionary step, offering both institutional and retail investors unprecedented access to the world of NEAR Protocol staking yields through a regulated, familiar investment vehicle. Get ready to explore what this means for your portfolio and the broader European Crypto Market . What is the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP and Why Does It Matter? The Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP (ticker: NEAR) represents a significant stride in bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto economy. An Exchange Traded Product (ETP) is a type of security that tracks an underlying asset, index, or financial instrument, and is traded on exchanges much like stocks. In this case, the ETP is designed to track the performance of NEAR Protocol, but with an added advantage: it aims to provide exposure to the staking yields generated by the underlying NEAR tokens. For many investors, directly participating in crypto staking can be complex, involving technical setups, understanding network mechanics, and managing private keys. The NEAR Staking ETP simplifies this process dramatically. It acts as a wrapper, allowing investors to gain exposure to NEAR’s staking rewards without the operational hurdles. This is Bitwise’s fourth crypto ETP to be listed in the European market, underscoring their commitment to providing accessible and regulated crypto investment solutions. It’s about bringing the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) into a regulated, easily tradable format that traditional investors can understand and trust. How Does This Bitwise Crypto ETP Offer Revolutionary Access? The launch of the Bitwise Crypto ETP for NEAR staking on Xetra is a game-changer for several reasons. Historically, institutional investors have faced significant challenges when trying to allocate capital to cryptocurrencies, particularly for activities like staking. These challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Navigating disparate regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions. Custody Solutions: Ensuring the secure storage of digital assets, which often requires specialized infrastructure. Operational Complexity: Setting up and managing staking nodes, dealing with network upgrades, and understanding slashing risks. Liquidity Concerns: Ensuring easy entry and exit points for large capital allocations. An ETP like this addresses these concerns head-on. By listing on a reputable exchange like Deutsche Börse Xetra, the ETP provides a regulated and liquid investment vehicle. This means institutions can allocate capital through their existing brokerage accounts, benefiting from the transparency and oversight of traditional financial markets. Retail investors also benefit from this simplified access, removing the technical barriers to entry for Crypto Staking . Think of it this way: instead of buying NEAR tokens, setting up a wallet, choosing a validator, and then staking your tokens yourself, you can now simply buy shares of the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP. The ETP handles all the underlying complexities, including the actual staking process and the distribution of yields, making it an incredibly convenient option for a broad range of investors seeking exposure to the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. Unpacking NEAR Protocol and the Power of Crypto Staking To fully appreciate the significance of the NEAR Staking ETP , it’s essential to understand the foundation it builds upon: the NEAR Protocol . NEAR is a layer-one blockchain designed to be user-friendly and scalable. It aims to provide a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) that is both fast and secure, leveraging a unique sharding technology called ‘Nightshade’ to achieve high transaction throughput. Crypto Staking is a fundamental mechanism in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains like NEAR. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining (as in Proof-of-Work), PoS networks secure their blockchain by having participants ‘stake’ or lock up their cryptocurrency holdings. In return for staking their NEAR tokens, participants (validators and delegators) help secure the network, validate transactions, and participate in governance. As a reward for their participation and contribution to network security, they earn newly minted tokens or transaction fees, known as staking yields. The appeal of staking lies in its potential for passive income, similar to earning interest on a savings account, but often with higher yields. However, it also comes with risks, such as ‘slashing’ (penalties for validator misbehavior) and illiquidity during the staking period. The Bitwise ETP aims to mitigate some of these risks by managing the underlying staking operations professionally, offering a more hands-off approach for investors. Navigating the European Crypto Market: A Hub for Innovation The decision by Bitwise to launch its NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra highlights the growing maturity and investor appetite within the European Crypto Market . Europe has emerged as a leader in offering regulated crypto investment products, with Germany, Switzerland, and the Nordics being particularly progressive. This is due to a combination of forward-thinking regulatory frameworks and a strong demand from both institutional and retail investors seeking compliant ways to access digital assets. ETPs and Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) tracking cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction in Europe, often preceding similar offerings in other major markets like the United States. This regulatory clarity and established infrastructure make Europe an attractive launchpad for innovative crypto products. Bitwise’s consistent expansion in this market, with the NEAR ETP being its fourth such product, demonstrates confidence in the European regulatory environment and investor base. It also signals a broader trend: the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream financial ecosystems, driven by regulated products that meet the stringent requirements of traditional finance. The availability of such products on platforms like Xetra means that a wide array of investors, from pension funds to individual traders, can now diversify their portfolios with exposure to digital assets like NEAR Protocol, within a familiar and regulated framework. This contributes significantly to the legitimization and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Benefits and Potential Considerations of the NEAR Staking ETP Investing in the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP offers several compelling advantages, but like any investment, it’s crucial to be aware of potential considerations: Benefits: Simplified Access: No need for complex crypto wallets, private key management, or understanding staking mechanics. Regulated Framework: Traded on a regulated exchange (Xetra), offering investor protection and transparency. Liquidity: Easily bought and sold through traditional brokerage accounts, providing greater liquidity than direct staking. Staking Yield Exposure: Provides a pathway to earn potential staking rewards from NEAR Protocol without direct participation. Diversification: Offers a new avenue for portfolio diversification into the growing digital asset space. Professional Management: Bitwise manages the underlying staking operations, aiming to optimize yields and manage risks. Potential Considerations: Fees: ETPs typically charge management fees, which can eat into the staking yields. Tracking Error: The ETP’s performance may not perfectly mirror the underlying NEAR price or staking yield due to fees, operational costs, and market dynamics. Market Risk: The value of the ETP is still subject to the volatility of the underlying NEAR token price. Counterparty Risk: While regulated, there’s always a degree of counterparty risk associated with the ETP issuer. No Direct Ownership: Investors own shares in the ETP, not the underlying NEAR tokens directly, meaning no direct governance rights on the NEAR Protocol. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto ETPs and Staking The launch of the NEAR Staking ETP by Bitwise is more than just a single product; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of crypto investments. As the digital asset space matures, we can expect to see more innovative products that blend the best of traditional finance with the opportunities of decentralized networks. Staking ETPs are likely to become increasingly popular as investors seek passive income opportunities from their digital asset holdings without the associated technical complexities. This trend signifies a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, capable of being integrated into mainstream investment portfolios. For the European Crypto Market , it solidifies its position as a global leader in offering regulated and accessible crypto investment vehicles. Bitwise’s proactive approach in this space suggests a future where accessing crypto yields is as straightforward as investing in any other traditional asset. Conclusion: A New Era for NEAR Protocol Investment The launch of the Bitwise NEAR Staking ETP on Xetra marks a pivotal moment for investors looking to tap into the potential of NEAR Protocol. By offering a regulated, accessible, and yield-bearing investment product, Bitwise has lowered the barrier to entry for both institutional and retail participants. This revolutionary step not only simplifies exposure to NEAR Protocol and its staking rewards but also further legitimizes digital assets within the traditional financial system. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, such innovations are crucial for fostering wider adoption and providing robust pathways for capital allocation into this exciting new frontier. It’s an exciting time to be an investor in the digital asset space, with more sophisticated and user-friendly options becoming available every day.

The profit gap signals stronger conviction among XRP holders. Their higher profitability reflects a more bullish investor sentiment than Ethereum’s, which might potentially fuel increased interest and investment in XRP. Positive derivatives open interest (OI) in the XRP ecosystem can also indicate heightened investor confidence. According to Coinglass data , XRP derivatives OI currently stands at $4.20 billion after witnessing a 4.95% increase. Open interest in derivatives is a key metric for understanding market sentiment and activity because it refers to the total number of outstanding futures or options contracts that haven’t been settled. Therefore, positive XRP open interest signals rising market interest and increased capital inflow from institutional investors. XRP Eyes the $2.35 Zone According to market analyst Lingrid, XRP might be witnessing a stealthy accumulation phase that might ignite a sharp upward move to the zone between $2.30 and $2.35. She added, “XRP dropped into the IMB zone and quickly bounced, defending the key support level between 2.00 and 2.05. The chart shows a potential accumulation structure forming after a falling wedge breakout, with the price beginning to coil toward a higher low.” Source: Lingrid A series of higher lows play an instrumental role in confirming an uptrend because each pullback ends at a price higher than the previous one. XRP was up 0.9% in the past 24 hours to trade at $2.18. Meanwhile, the path to a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is clearing as Ripple moves to end its nearly five-year legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) Identified as 2025’s Best Crypto Meme Coin Opportunities,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/investing-for-growth-neo-pepe-coin-neop-identified-as-2025/,"The post Investing for Growth? Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) Identified as 2025’s Best Crypto Meme Coin Opportunities appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Market Shift Sees New Presale Stars Rising As the crypto landscape stabilizes heading into mid-2025, investors are turning eyes to structured presale opportunities and niche altcoins positioned for outsized gains. A recent survey by Indiatimes identified several under-the-radar tokens—like PropBase, Reef, Chainlink, Avalanche, Polkadot, Polygon, Aptos, NEAR, and Synthetix—that embody diverse use cases from asset tokenization to Layer-2 scaling. These are being touted as smart bets heading into July. Increasingly, platforms featuring tiered-pricing models and staged distributions—such as Remittix (RTX) and BitcoinHyper (HYPER)—are drawing investor attention. These presales reward early participants while aiming to protect against early price squeezes—a structure crypto influencers like Lark Davis and Benjamin Cowen have recently praised for their portfolio-diversification strategies on channels like YouTube and Twitter. Infrastructure & DeFi Catch Some Spotlight Experts highlight the value in infrastructure plays: Chainlink’s ongoing upgrade to Chainlink 2.0, Avalanche’s tri-chain performance model, and Polkadot’s parachains are drawing developer and investor interest. Meanwhile, major centralized exchanges—most notably Binance—and DEX hubs like Uniswap are reportedly readying to list new presale tokens, providing deeper liquidity and greater accessibility for investors. Influencer Insights & Exchange Developments Crypto influencer Lark Davis recently underscored the importance of presales, suggesting that strategic involvement in these offerings can yield significant portfolio diversification benefits. Davis pointed specifically to decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme-inspired projects as key areas of investor interest for 2025. Zooming in on Meme-Driven Disruption In the meme-coin category, one token is currently stealing the spotlight: Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP). According to recent GlobeNewswire releases, Neo Pepe has now raised over $2 million in its presale—which spans 16 carefully structured stages—signaling substantial investor demand. Structured Presale & Price Stages Neo Pepe’s presale begins at $0.05 per token and is set to escalate to as much as $0.16 by the final stage. The next milestone—Stage 4—is almost within reach, where the token price is projected to move from its current ~ $0.07 to approximately $0.08. Liquidity Built Into Every Transaction A notable feature is the auto-liquidity mechanism: 2.5% of every transaction feeds directly into liquidity pools, with LP tokens burned to cement long-term stability. This mechanic is reinforced by Certik auditing (at 71.96), adding to investor confidence. Decentralized Governance & Community Power Neo Pepe is structured as a fully DAO-governed project. Token holders vote on fund allocation, exchange listings (including targets like Binance and Uniswap), and strategic roadmap steps.

It remains one of the most established crypto assets that is consistent, liquid, and widely adopted. But while XRP remains steady, it’s not moving fast. Its ecosystem has slowed, and community participation is mostly passive. In contrast, Meerkat (MERK) is moving at full speed, rolling out staking, missions, and a live mini-app inside Telegram, all before even listing on exchanges. It’s not just building hype. It’s building utility and rewarding users from day one. Essentially, one token represents stability while the other represents momentum. And right now, the market favors the movers. XRP Current Status XRP continues to trade within a stable range around $2, characterized by strong liquidity on major exchanges. Many view it as a reliable long-term asset, particularly for investors who prioritize fundamentals and regulatory stability. It’s no longer a high-volatility token, which appeals to institutional players but offers little excitement for retail investors. XRP’s price action remains underwhelming, as it has traded around $2 for seven months, even while Bitcoin has broken multiple peaks. MERK Early Utility and Gamified Approach Meanwhile, MERK is delivering the speed, interaction, and price actions that many are seeking. Currently in presale, MERK is already shipping core functionality, including staking, directly inside Telegram. Notably, this is not a roadmap promise. It’s a live product. Live Before Launch Inside Telegram, users can already: Stake MERK and earn rewards Complete daily missions Accumulate XP and rank up Engage instantly, no wallet or external app required MERK is onboarding users in seconds, not weeks. It’s crypto made frictionless. Telegram-Powered Gamification MERK turns Telegram, the heart of crypto communities, into a live, interactive ecosystem. Every action, from staking to mission completion, feeds into a gamified feedback loop that keeps users coming back. While other tokens chase exchange listings for visibility, MERK creates relevance through experience. This isn’t passive holding. It’s active growth, and it’s already underway. Visit: meerkat.wtf to learn more. The Burrow: AI-Powered Meme Creation Goes Onchain With the rollout of its zk-rollup Layer 2, MERK introduces The Burrow, a live environment for creators to mint tokenized memes using generative AI and modular SDK tools. What’s Live Now: ERC-20 and SPL-format meme collections Automated image + narrative generation Onchain minting and publishing tools The Burrow is already operational, transforming meme culture into on-chain digital assets. While others tokenize finance, MERK tokenizes culture. XRP vs MERK Adoption Drivers: Institutions vs Communities XRP is designed for high-efficiency financial rails, particularly for institutional use cases such as cross-border payments. Its foundation lies in regulatory clarity, structured partnerships, and integration with traditional finance. In contrast, MERK is built for interaction and culture. It thrives on community engagement, gamification, and creator tools that live natively inside Telegram. Rather than chasing regulatory pathways or enterprise deals, MERK prioritizes virality, instant usability, and meme-powered network effects. Accessibility When it comes to accessibility, XRP typically requires centralized exchanges, KYC, and wallets, slowing down retail onboarding. MERK removes that friction entirely. It operates within Telegram, requiring no downloads or wallets, allowing users to engage instantly through taps and missions. Engagement: Passive Holding vs Active Missions XRP is a long-term hold with infrequent updates and minimal interaction. MERK flips that model, encouraging daily participation through missions, staking, ranking, and content creation. Market Outlook Analysts view XRP as a stable, low-volatility asset with long-term potential and with limited explosive upside. MERK, by contrast, is an early-stage opportunity that blends meme culture with functional mechanics. Several analysts have projected 25x to 50x potential post-launch. High Risk, High Interaction, High Potential MERK isn’t for the conservative investor. It’s for those who want to play early, interact daily, and bet on the growth of Telegram-native crypto. With staking live, missions rolling, and exchange listings confirmed, MERK is a working ecosystem. Confirmed Listings: P2B, AscendEx Supply: 50% locked, 0% team tokens, audited smart contracts No VCs. No insiders. Just community. Telegram: Crypto’s Next Onboarding Frontier With over 800 million users, built-in bots, and a seamless user experience, Telegram is quickly becoming crypto’s primary interface, especially for meme coins and interactive apps. MERK is one of the first tokens to fully embrace this paradigm, embedding value and interaction where users already spend their time.

The company recently secured a structured financing agreement worth 250 million NOK, equivalent to an impressive $24.75 million, from the global investment powerhouse LDA Capital. This substantial capital injection isn’t just for general operations; it’s specifically earmarked to fuel and expand Green Minerals’ pioneering Bitcoin Treasury Strategy . This development signals a fascinating convergence of resource extraction and digital asset management, prompting questions about the future of corporate finance. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Why Are Companies Embracing Digital Gold? The concept of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as a significant portion of its corporate reserves, rather than solely relying on traditional fiat currencies or conventional investments. This approach has gained traction among forward-thinking businesses looking to hedge against inflation, seek growth opportunities, and diversify their balance sheets in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. For a company like Green Minerals, known for its long-term, capital-intensive projects, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it attractive as a store of value, potentially preserving purchasing power better than depreciating fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial capital appreciation. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Adopting a Bitcoin strategy can signal a company’s embrace of innovation and readiness for the digital future, attracting a new generation of investors and talent. Green Minerals’ decision to deepen its commitment to this strategy suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role in modern corporate finance. It’s a bold step that places them among a growing number of public and private companies exploring the benefits of digital assets. Green Minerals: Deep-Sea Mining Meets Digital Innovation – What’s the Connection? At its core, Green Minerals is a Norwegian firm focused on deep-sea mining, an emerging industry dedicated to extracting valuable minerals from the ocean floor. These minerals, such as manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel, are crucial for the green energy transition, used in everything from electric vehicle batteries to renewable energy infrastructure. The company aims to provide a sustainable and ethical source for these critical raw materials. So, how does a deep-sea mining operation connect with a Cryptocurrency Investment strategy? The link lies in strategic long-term planning and capital management. Deep-sea mining projects require substantial upfront capital and have long development cycles. By allocating a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin, Green Minerals aims to: Optimize Capital Allocation: Potentially grow its reserves faster than traditional low-yield investments, providing more capital for future operations and expansion. Attract Modern Investors: Appeal to a broader range of investors, including those interested in both sustainable resource development and the digital economy. Future-Proofing: Position the company to benefit from the ongoing global shift towards digital finance and decentralized assets. This dual focus on critical minerals for a green future and cutting-edge financial strategy showcases Green Minerals’ unique vision in the market. LDA Capital’s Vote of Confidence: Why This Investment Matters for Cryptocurrency Investment? The $24.75 million financing from LDA Capital is not just a routine capital injection; it’s a significant endorsement of Green Minerals’ overall business model, including its innovative approach to corporate treasury management. LDA Capital is a global alternative investment group with expertise in cross-border transactions and providing growth capital to publicly listed and private companies worldwide. Their investment typically signifies a thorough due diligence process and a belief in the long-term potential of the recipient company. For the broader cryptocurrency space, LDA Capital’s backing of a company with an explicit Cryptocurrency Investment strategy sends a powerful message. It indicates that: Institutional Acceptance is Growing: Major investment groups are increasingly comfortable with and even actively supporting companies that integrate digital assets into their core financial strategies. Validation of Treasury Strategies: It validates the idea that holding Bitcoin can be a legitimate and beneficial part of a corporate treasury, moving beyond speculative trading. Bridge Between Traditional and Digital Finance: This deal exemplifies how traditional financial institutions are finding pathways to engage with and support the burgeoning digital asset economy, even through indirect means. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for other companies considering similar treasury strategies, demonstrating that significant institutional backing is attainable. The Global Trend: More Than Just Green Minerals and Deep-Sea Mining? While Green Minerals is making headlines with its unique blend of Deep-Sea Mining and digital asset strategy, they are part of a larger, evolving trend. Companies across various sectors are increasingly exploring or implementing Bitcoin treasury strategies. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, accumulating billions of dollars worth of BTC. Tesla also made a significant, albeit fluctuating, foray into holding Bitcoin. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Climate: Persistent inflation concerns and low-yield traditional investments make alternative assets more appealing. Technological Advancement: Easier access to secure custody solutions and financial infrastructure for managing digital assets. Growing Legitimacy: Increasing regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. However, it’s not without its challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin remains a primary concern, as does the evolving regulatory landscape. Companies must carefully weigh the potential benefits against the inherent risks, conducting thorough risk assessments and developing robust internal policies. Navigating the Depths: Challenges and Strategic Considerations Despite the optimism surrounding Green Minerals’ financing and its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , both deep-sea mining and cryptocurrency investment present unique challenges that the company will need to navigate. For deep-sea mining, environmental concerns and complex international regulations are paramount. Critics raise valid questions about the ecological impact on fragile marine ecosystems, demanding rigorous environmental impact assessments and sustainable practices. Regarding its Bitcoin holdings, Green Minerals must contend with: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the reported value of the company’s treasury. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing, which could affect how digital assets are treated for accounting, taxation, and legal purposes. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure storage of significant Bitcoin holdings requires sophisticated cybersecurity measures and robust internal controls. Green Minerals’ ability to successfully manage these dual complexities – the environmental and regulatory challenges of deep-sea mining alongside the financial and security risks of cryptocurrency – will be crucial to its long-term success. Their strategic partnership with LDA Capital suggests they have a well-thought-out plan to tackle these hurdles. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Finance and Sustainable Industries? The financing secured by Green Minerals marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company itself, but for the broader intersection of traditional industries and digital finance. It underscores a growing confidence among institutional investors in companies that are not afraid to innovate beyond conventional boundaries. For Green Minerals, this capital infusion will undoubtedly accelerate its deep-sea mining operations, potentially bringing vital minerals to market faster and supporting the global green transition. More broadly, this deal could inspire other companies, especially those in capital-intensive sectors, to reconsider their treasury strategies. It highlights the potential for Bitcoin to serve as a strategic asset, not merely a speculative one. As the world moves towards a more digital and sustainable future, the ability to creatively leverage diverse financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies, will become increasingly important for corporate resilience and growth. The journey of Green Minerals will be a fascinating case study to watch, demonstrating how an enterprise at the forefront of resource extraction is simultaneously embracing the cutting edge of financial innovation. Their success could pave the way for a new era of corporate treasury management, where digital assets play a central role in long-term strategic planning.

CoinShares registered $429 million of fresh inflows to Ether funds in the last seven days, lifting 2025’s tally to $2.9 billion and amplifying the squeeze. Meanwhile, presale newcomer Remittix (RTX) has vaulted to $0.0811 after moving 537 million tokens and pulling in $15.9 million, offering a percentage-gain runway that could outpace even an optimistic move in ETH. ETH: Staking Heat Turns Illiquid Supply Into a $600 Spark Over 35 million ETH about 28% of the circulating supply now sits in proof-of-stake contracts, locking away nearly $84 billion in 24 months. Fewer coins on exchanges mean thinner order books; one good catalyst and price sprint. That catalyst might be the $429 million that flowed into ether ETFs last week alone, pushing year-to-date inflows to $2.9 billion, while Robinhood’s new Arbitrum-based L2 shouts “Main-Street adoption”. Each time ETH orbits that resistance, buyers remember the post-Merge burn rate, the Pectra validator consolidation and those staking yields hovering near 3%. Put plainly, ETH price prediction chatter has a real on-chain backbone this cycle. Remittix: PayFi Upstart Poised to Outrun the ETH Price Prediction Crowd ETH is big-league, yet big games don’t always pay the wildest multiples. That’s where Remittix (RTX) enters. Still in presale at $0.0811, with 536 million tokens sold and $15.9 million already raised, Remittix tackles the very fees my cousin in Lagos complains about whenever he invoices U.K. clients. This PayFi lane matters because the remittance market north of $190 trillion yearly demands speed, not DeFi jargon. Unlike Stellar’s broader B2B pitch or Hedera’s enterprise focus, Remittix picks one pain point and slices it clean. As more freelancers and migrant workers feel that difference, token velocity shifts from hype to revenue participation. A 10-fold move from presale to parity with smaller payment tokens puts RTX around $0.75 already trumping a conservative ETH price prediction of $6k in percentage terms. Long-shot? Yes, but asymmetric upside is the lifeblood of crypto portfolios. Grab a seat in the presale or explore the white paper on Remittix and watch how quickly practical utility wins hearts, especially when gas fees spike on bigger chains. Why RTX Tops the 2025 Playbook Staking is tilting supply-and-demand math in ETH’s favor and every fresh analyst note shouts the same refrain: ETH price prediction at or near $6 k looks plausible once illiquidity and ETF demand collide. Yet the road from $2,500 to $6000 is a 140 % hop. Remittix, still a penny-sized PayFi rookie, needs far less absolute movement to hand investors a 10×. If one more latte-length transaction saves a few dollars for a freelancer, the word-of-mouth loop alone could let RTX sprint far beyond what any ETH price prediction can offer.

For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding broader macroeconomic trends, especially in the forex market analysis , is crucial. This is where the recent USD CHF forecast from UBS comes into play, offering a compelling long-term perspective that could signal significant shifts in global currency dynamics. UBS, a leading global wealth manager, has issued a noteworthy prediction: they expect the USD/CHF pair to trade firmly below 0.80 in the long term. This isn’t just a fleeting daily fluctuation; it’s a strategic long-term call that suggests a profound strengthening of the Swiss Franc against the US Dollar. For investors and traders, this UBS currency prediction offers a glimpse into potential future economic landscapes and challenges the conventional wisdom about currency stability. What drives such a confident outlook, and what implications does it hold for the broader financial ecosystem? Understanding the UBS Currency Prediction : What Does Below 0.80 Mean? When we talk about the USD/CHF pair, we’re referring to how many Swiss Francs (CHF) one US Dollar (USD) can buy. A move below 0.80 signifies that it would take less than 0.80 Swiss Francs to purchase one US Dollar. In simpler terms, the Swiss Franc would become significantly stronger relative to the US Dollar. Historically, the USD/CHF has seen periods of both appreciation and depreciation, but a sustained level below 0.80 would represent a remarkable shift, echoing levels not consistently seen in decades. This UBS currency prediction isn’t just a number; it reflects a deep dive into fundamental economic factors. UBS’s analysts are likely weighing several key elements: Interest Rate Differentials: The policies of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) versus the Federal Reserve (Fed) play a pivotal role. If the SNB maintains a tighter monetary policy or raises rates more aggressively than the Fed, it makes holding Swiss Francs more attractive. Economic Stability and Growth: Switzerland’s reputation for economic stability, low inflation, and a strong current account surplus often bolsters the Franc. Global Risk Appetite: In times of global uncertainty, the Swiss Franc traditionally acts as a safe haven currency , attracting capital inflows. Let’s consider a simplified comparison of potential scenarios: Factor Scenario A: Strong CHF (Below 0.80) Scenario B: Weaker CHF (Above 0.90) SNB Policy Hawkish, potentially higher rates than Fed Dovish, lower rates than Fed Global Economy High uncertainty, risk aversion Strong growth, risk-on sentiment Switzerland’s Economy Robust growth, low inflation, large surplus Stagnant, higher inflation, trade deficit Investor Sentiment Flight to safety, capital inflows to CHF Search for yield, capital outflows from CHF Driving Forces Behind the Strong Swiss Franc Outlook The Swiss Franc has long been revered for its stability, a reputation earned through a combination of prudent monetary policy, a robust economy, and its traditional role as a safe haven. The current Swiss Franc outlook , as seen by UBS, is bolstered by several ongoing trends: The SNB’s Inflation Fight: The Swiss National Bank has been proactive in combating inflation, often leading to higher interest rates compared to some other major economies. This makes CHF-denominated assets more appealing to international investors seeking yield. Persistent Current Account Surplus: Switzerland consistently runs a large current account surplus, meaning it exports more goods and services than it imports, and receives significant income from foreign investments. This constant inflow of foreign currency strengthens demand for the Franc. Geopolitical Uncertainties: In a world grappling with geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and economic slowdowns, the demand for reliable assets surges. The Swiss Franc, alongside gold and certain government bonds, often benefits from this “flight to quality.” Fiscal Discipline: Switzerland maintains a high degree of fiscal discipline, with low government debt relative to GDP, further enhancing its appeal as a stable investment destination. These factors collectively contribute to a powerful narrative for the Franc’s long-term appreciation, supporting the USD CHF forecast . The SNB’s willingness to intervene in currency markets, when necessary, also adds a layer of confidence for investors, signaling their commitment to price stability and managing the Franc’s value. The US Dollar’s Trajectory in the Context of Forex Market Analysis While the Swiss Franc’s strength is a significant part of the equation, the other side of the USD/CHF pair is the US Dollar. UBS’s long-term forecast implies a relative weakening of the Greenback against the Franc. This isn’t necessarily a blanket bearish view on the USD but rather a specific expectation within the context of this currency pair. In broader forex market analysis , the US Dollar’s trajectory is influenced by a multitude of factors: Federal Reserve Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates, quantitative easing, and inflation targeting profoundly impacts the Dollar. If the Fed pivots to a more dovish stance, or if inflation proves more stubborn than anticipated, it could erode the Dollar’s purchasing power. US Economic Performance: While the US economy is large and dynamic, concerns about slowing growth, potential recession, or high national debt could weigh on the Dollar. Global Reserve Currency Status: Despite challenges, the US Dollar remains the world’s primary reserve currency. However, discussions about de-dollarization or the rise of alternative currencies could, over the very long term, subtly shift demand. It’s important to remember that currency markets are relative. The UBS currency prediction for USD/CHF below 0.80 suggests that the factors supporting the Franc’s strength are expected to outweigh those supporting the Dollar, or that the Dollar’s challenges will be more pronounced relative to the Franc’s resilience. Is the Swiss Franc Still the Ultimate Safe Haven Currency ? The concept of a “safe haven” currency is fundamental to understanding the Swiss Franc’s appeal. In times of economic and political turmoil, investors typically flock to assets perceived as stable and secure. For decades, the Swiss Franc has epitomized this role. But is it still the ultimate safe haven currency in today’s complex global landscape? While some argue that its safe-haven status has been challenged by factors like the SNB’s past interventions to curb its appreciation, or by the rise of other perceived safe assets like gold or even certain digital assets, the core attributes remain: Political Neutrality: Switzerland’s long-standing political neutrality and stable democratic institutions provide a bedrock of confidence. Strong Legal Framework: A robust and transparent legal system protects property rights and fosters investor confidence. Sound Financial System: Switzerland’s banking sector is well-regulated and boasts a reputation for stability and confidentiality. Low Public Debt: Compared to many developed nations, Switzerland’s public debt levels are commendably low, reducing sovereign risk. These enduring qualities suggest that even if its safe-haven appeal is occasionally tested, the Franc’s fundamental role as a reliable store of value persists. This underlying strength is a key pillar supporting UBS’s confident USD CHF forecast . Navigating the USD CHF Forecast : Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, particularly those with exposure to global markets or even cryptocurrencies (which often react to broader macro trends), UBS’s long-term USD CHF forecast presents several actionable insights. While specific financial advice should always come from a qualified professional, here are some considerations: Diversification: A stronger Swiss Franc could impact portfolios with significant US Dollar exposure. Consider diversification strategies that account for potential currency shifts. Export/Import Implications: Businesses engaged in international trade between the US and Switzerland (or other Franc-pegged economies) should assess the impact of a stronger CHF on their cost structures and revenue. Swiss exports become more expensive, while US exports to Switzerland become cheaper. Interest Rate Arbitrage: While not for every investor, a sustained interest rate differential favoring the CHF could present opportunities for carry trades, though these come with their own risks. Macroeconomic Sensitivity: Understand that currency movements are often bellwethers for broader economic health. A strong CHF could signal ongoing global uncertainties or specific strengths within the Swiss economy. Risk Management: For forex traders, this forecast highlights the importance of robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders and position sizing, especially when trading against a strong long-term trend. It’s crucial to remember that long-term forecasts, while based on sound analysis, are not guarantees. Geopolitical events, unexpected central bank pivots, or unforeseen economic shocks could alter the trajectory. Therefore, continuous monitoring of global economic indicators and central bank communications is essential. Challenges and Counter-Arguments to the Bold Prediction While UBS’s UBS currency prediction is compelling, no forecast is without its potential challenges or counter-arguments. What could derail the USD/CHF from trading firmly below 0.80? SNB Intervention: Historically, the SNB has intervened in currency markets to prevent excessive appreciation of the Franc, which can harm Swiss exporters. While their focus has shifted to inflation, a rapid, significant appreciation might still trigger a response. Global Economic Rebound: A stronger-than-expected global economic recovery could reduce the demand for safe-haven assets, potentially weakening the Franc. US Dollar Resilience: The US Dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency and its deep, liquid markets give it inherent resilience. Unexpected US economic strength or aggressive Fed tightening could strengthen the USD. Geopolitical Shifts: While uncertainty generally helps the CHF, certain geopolitical events could paradoxically lead to a flight to the USD, especially if the US is perceived as the ultimate safe haven in extreme crises. These potential headwinds underscore the dynamic nature of forex market analysis and the need for investors to remain agile and informed. Concluding Thoughts: A Long-Term Vision for Currency Markets UBS’s long-term USD CHF forecast , predicting the pair firmly below 0.80, represents a significant and confident call on the future of two major global currencies. It highlights the enduring strength of the Swiss Franc, driven by its sound economic fundamentals, prudent monetary policy, and its role as a premier safe haven currency . Conversely, it implies a relative softening of the US Dollar’s position against the Franc, influenced by differing central bank trajectories and economic outlooks. This UBS currency prediction offers more than just a number; it provides a framework for understanding the intricate interplay of global macroeconomics, central bank actions, and investor sentiment. For anyone involved in global finance, from institutional investors to individual traders, comprehending such long-term outlooks is vital for strategic planning and risk management.

Our thesis is built on above-consensus revenue forecasts, driven by a 60 EH/s hash-rate ramp, low $0.04/kWh energy costs, and robust treasury BTC optionality. Valuation is compelling: MARA trades at a deep discount to historical and peer multiples, with 180% upside justified by macro tailwinds and post-halving expansion. Key risks include Bitcoin price volatility, regulatory headwinds, and potential dilution, but we see the risk/reward as highly favorable at current levels. Levered to the Next Crypto Cycle We initiate with a Strong Buy/$44 PT. MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA ) operates one of the world’s most advanced vertically integrated Bitcoin mining platforms, leveraging proprietary technology and low-cost energy infrastructure to deliver digital assets at scale via the US. Beneath the volatile exterior, MARA occupies a sweet spot of structural and cyclical drivers for a step-change in miner economics. More than 100k BTC cleared in the second quarter of 2025 began to reset base-case assumptions, yet consensus underwrites sub-80k BTC and underestimates the length and magnitude of post-halving multiple expansion. We see $1.36 billion in FY 2025E revenue (up 107% y/y, 43% above the Street) as energized Ohio/Texas wind assets, along with forthcoming flare-gas sites, deliver 60 EH/s of hash rate to keep network share elevated despite global difficulty hikes. Embedded in our base case is a self-inflicted above-consensus BTC price path of $105 k/$130 k FY 2025E/FY 2026E annual averages, already realized in spot markets and amplified by MARA’s ops edge: $0.04/kWh energy costs and superior fee per transaction capture, driving 12% outperformance in BTC-denominated revenue. Our valuation embeds a blended FY 2026E P/S of 10.5x, balancing against downside the visibility of its treasury assets and factoring in the concentrated potency of macro tailwinds: (i) a window to imminent Fed easing, (ii) record spot ETF inflows and (iii) the historic miner inflection 12–18 months post-halving. Regulatory overhang and bouts of network hash growth present headline risk to our thesis, but cost structures and balance sheet optionality leave more than enough margin for error. At 180% upside to our PT and trading up short of its historical median multiple, we see R/R as simply too skewed. Maximizing Miner Economics Marathon Digital Holdings exemplifies scale-driven cost leadership in BTC mining. Energized hash rate grew 95% y/y to 54.3 EH/s, capturing over 2x network share, driven by vertical integration and diversified energy inputs with 139 MW of self-generated wind, flare-gas, and data center power. Electric cost per BTC is now $35,728, and Marathon has delivered record 4 quarter-over-quarter hash-cost improvements. The blend of BtM wind and off-grid gas should lower all-in power costs to $10/MW for key ARPs, a breakpoint few peers can reach. This configuration supports an IRR of 30–40% under muted hash-price assumptions. As investors toggle between exahash headlines and transient efficiency gains, Marathon’s scale-plus-cost flywheel stands out as a sustainable platform—combining energized capacity, asset flexibility, power origination optionality, and proprietary ASIC integration—to preserve sector-leading share through mining-cycle volatility. Q1 Earnings Presentation Treasury Arbitrage Strategy embedded optionality. Fundamentally, we think the market has mispriced the strategic merit of MARA’s BTC on balance sheet, both in current balance sheet positioning and in embedded optionality. The 49,375 BTC on treasury ($5.42bn equivalent) offers investors direct participation in digital asset appreciation while buying an operating platform that can generate $852mn of annualized BTC back into the treasury at current network economics. Such a magnitude of treasury represents a uniquely powerful downside hedge versus global mining peers, allowing valuation capital preservation through deep crypto drawdowns and giving management optionality to monetize at cycle highs or deploy collateral opportunistically. Trading at $16.52, implied per-share BTC value stands at $15.41/share, providing the operating business just above $1/share after adjusting for net cash and PP&E. The disconnect continues to widen as MARA’s proven BTC accumulation cadence (950 BTC in a single month, or $104.5mn at $110,000 spot) captures robust upside and offers a meaningful premium to direct mining costs on the books. We believe consensus underappreciates the downside compounding and the asymmetry of MARA’s treasury, which ultimately provides shareholders a volatility buffer and an asymmetric payoff should direct adoption and institutional allocation run further. Case scenarios illustrate that the BTC is over-collateralizing the equity to such a degree that it meaningfully caps downside. We view MARA trading as a rare hybrid asset in which meaningful core value effectively underwrites investor participation in the next mining-led BTC upcycle. Q1 Earnings Presentation Materially Above-Consensus Revenue Outlook We model MARA’s FY 2025E and FY 2026E crypto revenues at $1.36bn (107% y/y) and $1.44bn, respectively, vs. the Street consensus of $948mn, placing us 43% and 32% above the Street based on structural tailwinds we believe the Street underappreciates: 1) Ambitious hash rate ramp to 60 EH/s as Ohio, TX wind and other flare-gas sites fully energize, positioning MARA for sustained 5% network share as difficulty resumes a persistent upward trend; 2) Explicit BTC pricing assumptions of $105k in FY 2025E and $130k in FY 2026E vs. consensus sub-$80k, already clearing $100k in the second quarter of 2025; 3) Proportional transaction-fee capture via MARA pool’s >10% outperformance vs. network average and 100% fee retention, translating to 12% higher BTC-denominated revenues. Source: FMP FY 2025 FY 2026 Estimate # Analysts Estimate # Analysts Revenue $948.02M 9 $1.09B 13 EBITDA $13.85M 9 $15.87M 13 Net Income $-656.60M 9 $-358.66M 13 EPS $-2.11 2 $-0.96 6 SG&A Expenses $535.42M 9 $613.52M 13 Most importantly, we annualize a first quarter 2025 run rate already partially baked in by the Street and layer on unfolding AI/2PIC monetization missing from the Street models. We acknowledge risk of sharp network hash rate acceleration beyond guidance or, less likely, regulatory change, but with visibility into energized capacity, a unique cost profile via $10/MWh ARP sites, and institutional BTC demand, we see the Street as significantly too conservative. Valuation Our $44 PT for MARA is based on a FY 2026E P/S multiple of 10.5x applied to our above-consensus revenue forecast of $1.44bn, yielding an implied 180% upside. The premium multiple is fully justified by outsized revenue growth acceleration powered by a ramped-up 60 EH/s hash-rate and a low $0.04/kWh power edge, plus Bitcoin treasury visibility that effectively limits downside. Company Data, FMP, Moretus Research Our 10.5x multiple aligns with the company’s historical median and stands to benefit from macro tailwinds of Federal Reserve easing and surging institutional ETF flows, which could prime post-halving multiple expansion. MARA trades at 7.7x P/S, below its historical norm (27th percentile) and below peer multiples (5.8x P/S; 17th percentile), despite margin resiliency and a market-leading +5.9% year-over-year revenue growth into FY 2026E. We believe Street assumptions on Bitcoin price and network share are overly conservative, and MARA warrants re-rating for its operational leverage. Risks to Our Strong Buy Thesis Our bullish thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is supported by favorable capacity growth, low-cost operations, and a structurally higher post-halving Bitcoin price deck. Key risks include MARA’s operational and valuation leverage to Bitcoin’s price: a sustained pullback below $90,000 or an acceleration in network-wide difficulty could compress margins and force operational retrenchment, given energy costs could rise to $70K per Bitcoin if difficulty increases or electricity prices exceed model assumptions. Regulatory uncertainty poses another risk: state and federal energy restrictions, new environmental mandates, or regional off-grid mining clampdowns could raise compliance costs or force site curtailments, threatening hash-rate growth and undermining our above-consensus FY 2025E–FY 2026E estimates. Finally, MARA’s strategic use of ATM equity issuance could result in dilution and dampen our anticipated multiple re-rating if the Bitcoin market softens or policy risks intensify. Investors should monitor Bitcoin network hash-rate, MARA’s realized electricity costs, and state and federal regulatory developments as potential downside triggers. Conclusion We reiterate our Strong Buy on Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. based on MARA's peer-best operational leverage to BTC's next cycle and differentiated cost structure leading to best-in-class risk-adjusted return in the public minter space. Consensus fundamentally underestimates the scale of MARA's hash-rate ramp and true macro tailwinds (institution ETF flows and post-halving multiple expansion) offering a clear path for outsized revenue / multiple re-rating, in our view.

Despite being much smaller in size, IBIT is outperforming thanks to high demand from both retail and institutional investors. Over the past 18 months, IBIT has consistently attracted new capital and now makes up over half of all Bitcoin ETF assets . The rising interest is partly due to clearer regulations in the U.S., which has encouraged major financial players to invest in Bitcoin instead of smaller cryptocurrencies.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Scaramucci said he expects the approach to lose momentum in the coming months. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea,” Scaramucci said. “So, you know, it will fade.” He implied that investors may start to wonder why they’re paying extra for a company to hold an asset they could simply buy themselves. The idea of using bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset gained traction in 2021, when Strategy (MSTR), a software developer led by Michael Saylor, became the first major public company to do so. Saylor’s aggressive bitcoin purchases turned Strategy into a de facto bitcoin investment vehicle, sending its stock price soaring nearly 3,000% since then. The massive gains drew attention across corporate America and elsewhere. A number of companies followed Strategy’s lead, including medical device maker Semler Scientific (SMLR), which announced its own bitcoin treasury strategy in May 2024, and Tokyo-based Metaplanet (3350), which started out as a hotel management company. The trend hasn’t been limited to high-profile firms. Smaller companies, often penny-stocks, also jumped in, trying to raise capital or attract investor interest by adding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets. What began as a focus on bitcoin soon expanded to other digital assets. Some companies opted to purchase ether (ETH) or XRP (XRP) as part of their treasury strategy, pushing the concept beyond its original scope. Scaramucci acknowledged that Saylor’s success is unique, pointing to the company’s other business lines beyond bitcoin holdings. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now,” Scaramucci said in the interview with Bloomberg. “I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies.”",Finance|Anthony Scaramucci|Digital Asset Treasury|News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-02 15:26:34

NEAR climbed from $2.09 to $2.13 between July 1-2, with a decisive breakout reaching $2.18 on high trading volume. This performance comes on the back of the announcement that could spur institutional interest in NEAR. Technical analysis NEAR-USD exhibited a remarkable bullish reversal during the 24-hour period from 1 July 15:00 to 2 July 14:00, climbing from $2.09 to $2.13. A significant breakout occurred between 04:00-06:00 on 2 July when price surged to a peak of $2.18 on exceptionally high volume (4.56M and 3.76M respectively, far exceeding the 24-hour average). The overall range of $0.16 (7.6%) demonstrates strong buying momentum, with key support established at $2.02 and resistance at $2.17. Price consolidation above $2.11 in the final hours suggests the formation of a new support level that could serve as a foundation for further upside movement. In the last 60 minutes from 2 July 13:06 to 14:05, NEAR-USD exhibited notable volatility with a significant price surge between 13:40-13:48, reaching a peak of $2.15 before experiencing a sharp correction to $2.13. The price action formed a clear resistance level at $2.15 and support at $2.13, with volume spikes (131,013 units at 13:48) confirming the strength of the upward movement. The final consolidation around $2.14 suggests a potential new support level forming, with the closing price of $2.14 representing a 0.5% gain over the hour despite the mid-period pullback.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,NEAR|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-02 15:27:43

According to a report , 199 entities now hold 3 million BTC, worth about $315 billion. That total has more than doubled since the start of 2024. It marks a clear shift in how big firms view crypto, not just as a trading asset but as a long‑term treasury play. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Surge Among those 199 entities, 147 public and private companies account for 1.1 million BTC (around $115 billion). Strategy, the pioneer in this space, holds 580,250 BTC—about $60 billion—and trades at a market cap of $104 billion. That gives it a Multiple on Net Asset Value (MNAV) of 1.7× today. Investors once paid up to 2× NAV for Strategy’s shares, reflecting confidence in its ability to grow BTC‑per‑share faster than anyone else. Valuing Pure Play Treasury Firms When a firm’s main business is holding Bitcoin , its shares need to outperform Bitcoin itself. That premium, known as MNAV, depends on faith in management and clear execution plans. Strategy has used three main tools since 2020: issuing convertible debt, running an At‑the‑Market stock program, and plowing free cash flow into spot Bitcoin. New rivals are copying and tweaking this playbook—letting holders swap coins for stock, buying underpriced firms to turn cash into BTC, and even adding private deals to raise funds. Debt Risks Loom Large An extended bear market could test these models. If Bitcoin falls and shares trade at or below NAV, debt‑heavy firms might struggle to refinance when notes come due. That could force them to sell Bitcoin into a downtrend, pushing prices lower. Smaller companies without Strategy’s scale will face higher borrowing costs and tougher terms. During a recession, margin calls and forced sales may cascade throughout the market, although most of these companies use equity financing mainly. Wider Industry Influence From September 2021, as soon as El Salvador legitimized BTC as legal tender, corporate demand grew. BlackRock’s launch of IBIT ETF in January 2024 further fueled it, and US President Donald Trump has talked about the economic function of Bitcoin. Now, new players from Japan’s Metaplanet to US‑based GameStop are rolling out treasury plans. Purpose‑built firms like Twenty One Capital and reverse‑merger entrants such as Strive and Nakamoto have staked their futures on Bitcoin. More Companies To Enter The Market? Experts expect more crypto treasury companies to emerge—covering assets like Solana and Ethereum as well. Early names include DeFi Development Corp with 420,000 SOL and SharpLink Gaming, which raised $425 million for ETH holdings. Many will fail, and the strongest will buy up weaker rivals. Thankfully, most rely on stock‑based financing, so a few collapses won’t topple the whole market. But those loaded with debt could still pose a wider threat.

This publicly listed Japanese firm, known for its bold pivot into BTC investments , reported a significant revenue increase, highlighting a growing trend of corporate embrace of digital assets. What does this remarkable performance mean for the future of institutional adoption and the broader crypto market? Metaplanet Bitcoin: A Strategic Pivot in Japan In an era where traditional finance grapples with inflation and economic uncertainties, companies are seeking innovative ways to preserve and grow capital. Metaplanet Bitcoin stands out as a prime example of this strategic evolution. Formerly a traditional financial services firm, Metaplanet made headlines when it announced a significant shift in its treasury strategy, opting to convert substantial portions of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. This move, echoing strategies employed by global pioneers like MicroStrategy, positioned Metaplanet as a leading Japanese Crypto Firm committed to leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset. The decision was rooted in a deep understanding of macroeconomic pressures, particularly the weakening Japanese Yen and the global inflationary environment. By embracing Institutional BTC Adoption , Metaplanet aimed to protect its balance sheet from currency devaluation while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation. Their initial significant acquisitions set the stage for what has now become a testament to their foresight. Decoding Metaplanet’s Impressive Bitcoin Revenue The latest official announcement from Metaplanet reveals a compelling success story. For the second quarter of the year, the company reported a staggering revenue of 1,097.25 million yen, equivalent to approximately $7.57 million in Bitcoin Revenue . This figure represents a robust 42.4% increase compared to their first-quarter performance, signaling accelerated growth and profitability stemming directly from their digital asset strategy. As of June 30, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings reached an impressive 13,350 BTC. This substantial accumulation underscores their unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The revenue reported is primarily attributed to the appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings during the second quarter, demonstrating the tangible financial benefits that can accrue from well-timed and strategic BTC investments . This growth trajectory highlights Bitcoin’s increasing viability as a corporate treasury solution, moving beyond speculative trading to become a recognized asset class for balance sheet management. The Growing Wave of Institutional BTC Adoption in Japan Metaplanet’s success is not an isolated incident but rather a significant indicator of a broader shift towards Institutional BTC Adoption within Japan and across Asia. For years, Japan has been a key player in the cryptocurrency space, with a progressive regulatory framework that has fostered innovation while ensuring consumer protection. Metaplanet’s public commitment and now demonstrated financial success could serve as a powerful catalyst for other Japanese Crypto Firm s and corporations to explore similar strategies. The benefits of such adoption are manifold: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin offers a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies, providing a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Asset Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering potential capital gains for corporate treasuries. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s asset portfolio, reducing reliance on traditional assets and market cycles. Technological Edge: Embracing digital assets positions companies at the forefront of financial innovation, appealing to a tech-savvy investor base. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the need for robust security infrastructure to manage significant BTC investments . What Do Metaplanet’s Q2 Earnings Mean for the Future? The strong Q2 Earnings Crypto report from Metaplanet provides valuable insights into the potential trajectory of corporate Bitcoin strategies. This success story is likely to embolden Metaplanet to continue its accumulation strategy, potentially increasing its Bitcoin holdings further in anticipation of future market appreciation. It also sends a clear message to other corporations contemplating similar moves: Bitcoin can indeed be a powerful tool for financial growth and stability when managed strategically. Looking ahead, Metaplanet’s performance could ignite a ripple effect across the Japanese corporate landscape. As more companies witness the tangible benefits of Bitcoin Revenue generated through strategic digital asset holdings, the pace of institutional adoption is expected to accelerate. This will not only strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class but also foster a more robust and mature crypto ecosystem globally. Global Implications of Strong Crypto Earnings Japan The impressive Q2 Earnings Crypto from a prominent Japanese Crypto Firm like Metaplanet resonates far beyond Japan’s borders. It reinforces the global narrative that Bitcoin is maturing into a viable, long-term asset for corporate treasuries. While MicroStrategy has long been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption in the West, Metaplanet’s emergence as a significant player in Asia adds a crucial dimension to this trend. This success could inspire more publicly traded companies worldwide to consider Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet strategy. It validates the premise that holding Bitcoin can be a significant driver of shareholder value, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. The consistent reporting of positive Bitcoin Revenue by such firms strengthens the case for Bitcoin as a mainstream financial asset, paving the way for broader acceptance and integration into traditional financial systems. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Vision Pays Off Metaplanet’s second-quarter financial results are more than just numbers; they represent a significant milestone in the journey of institutional Bitcoin adoption. With a remarkable 42.4% increase in revenue, primarily driven by their BTC investments , Metaplanet has showcased the immense potential of integrating digital assets into corporate treasury strategies. Their commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and growth asset positions them as a vanguard among Japanese Crypto Firm s and a model for global corporations considering a similar strategic pivot. This success story reinforces Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its pivotal role in shaping the future of finance, signaling a robust outlook for continued Institutional BTC Adoption worldwide.

While many tokens experience short-lived spikes, FUNToken’s momentum is different: it is the product of a coordinated expansion across gaming, DeFi integrations, and AI-powered engagement tools. Together, these pillars have created a foundation of organic demand that reinforces the project’s deflationary model and underpins its recent performance. Gaming: A Utility Engine Scaling Fast At the heart of FUNToken’s utility is its rapidly growing gaming ecosystem. According to the official roadmap and multiple ecosystem updates, the project plans to launch 30 gaming titles by Q4 2025, with another 10 to follow in Q1 2026. This utility has real implications for demand. As new games launch, each player becomes a recurring participant in the token economy, boosting transaction volumes and driving platform revenue. That revenue, in turn, funds quarterly token burns, therefore, creating a self-reinforcing cycle between gameplay and deflation. DeFi Integrations and Cross-Chain Swaps Beyond gaming, FUNToken is expanding into DeFi with its multi-chain wallet and XFUN bridge, which will allow users to seamlessly convert FUN between Ethereum and Polygon, reducing gas costs and improving liquidity. This combination positions FUNToken at the intersection of DeFi utility and gaming engagement. Every swap and staking action generates fees, and those fees contribute to quarterly buybacks and burns. This model directly ties DeFi adoption to scarcity, which is something many similar projects lack. Telegram AI Bot: Real Engagement, Real Rewards One of the most significant catalysts in FUNToken’s recent surge has been the launch of the AI-powered $FUN Telegram bot . Designed to gamify community engagement, the bot rewards users who participate in chats, quizzes, and competitions with free spins and instant $FUN payouts. According to Binance Square and multiple community updates, the bot has already surpassed 100,000 users, making it one of the largest active reward bots in crypto. Top contributors can win up to $500 in FUN per spin, translating to both utility and daily organic demand. This innovative approach serves several strategic purposes: ● It builds a loyal user base that consistently interacts with the brand.● It increases wallet count as users redeem and stake rewards.● It channels a portion of revenue into burn mechanics, further tightening supply. CertiK Audit: Reinforcing Trust While utility and user growth drive demand, security remains critical to sustaining confidence. FUNToken’s smart contract has undergone a full CertiK audit, which confirmed: ● The code is immutable, meaning it cannot be modified to introduce new tokens.● No minting functions or privileged backdoors exist.● All supply changes are transparent and verifiable on-chain. In addition to this static analysis, FUNToken is monitored by CertiK Skynet, a real-time surveillance system that flags any anomalies in contract behavior. This guarantees that the deflationary model is protected from manipulation, reinforcing trust among long-term holders and institutional participants. Price Action: From Utility to Market Momentum The coordinated growth across gaming, DeFi, and Telegram engagement has had a measurable impact on price. In the days after the 25 million FUN burn, the token rallied more than 41%, reaching as high as $0.0129 before consolidating near the $0.010 range. As of June 27, 2025, the token is trading at $0.0101. Market capitalization remains around $109 million, supported by expanding wallet adoption and anticipated roadmap deliveries in Q3 and Q4. What’s Next: Sustaining the Momentum Looking ahead, FUNToken has positioned itself for a critical period of execution that could define its trajectory well into 2026. The convergence of gaming launches, DeFi integrations, deflationary burns, and AI-powered community engagement sets up multiple catalysts that, if delivered, may drive continued demand and reinforce the token’s deflationary narrative. Here’s a closer look at the roadmap -driven milestones and why they matter: Mobile Wallet Launch: The Hub of Ecosystem Activity By the end of Q4 2025, FUNToken plans to release its mobile wallet for iOS and Android. This isn’t merely a storage solution, rather it’s designed to become the primary gateway to the FUNToken ecosystem. Key features will include: ● Different game features and staking features.● In-app staking, enabling holders to lock tokens and earn yield while supporting network liquidity. This launch is significant because it consolidates multiple functions: DeFi, gaming payments, and NFTs, all brought into a single application, making adoption easier for casual users and gamers alike. Gaming Expansion: From 30 to 40+ Titles The FUNToken roadmap details an aggressive rollout of gaming content: ● Q4 2025: Deploy 10 new games, while aiming to hit over 5 million game users and 500,000 plus wallet users. There are even plans to partner up with mid-size game developers as well.● Q1 2026: Launch 10 more games to scale up to 40 total titles, broadening the appeal to more than 10 million game users. These games are designed not only to drive user engagement but also to create consistent transactional demand for $FUN, which feeds into quarterly revenue and fuels future burns. Ongoing Quarterly Burns: Deflation on Autopilot Unlike many tokens that rely on sporadic buybacks, FUNToken’s model is tied to predictable, revenue-backed burns. Every quarter, 50% of platform revenue will be allocated to purchase and permanently remove tokens from circulation. With the mobile wallet and games coming online, revenue potential is expected to grow, meaning each subsequent burn could surpass the last. This predictable reduction in circulating supply is central to FUNToken’s long-term value proposition: as more users transact, scarcity naturally increases. AI Telegram Bot Evolution: Incentivized Community Growth Already live with more than 100,000 participants, the AI-powered Telegram bot will continue to expand its capabilities: ● Advanced engagement rewards, where users earn more based on streaks, content contributions, or gaming milestones.● Staking incentives, potentially rewarding users who lock $FUN for longer durations.● Integration with mobile wallet identities, linking Telegram activity to in-app rewards and NFT unlocks. Each milestone is not isolated. Instead, they form a reinforcing ecosystem: ● Games drive daily transactions and token utility.● The wallet makes participation accessible and efficient.● DeFi features incentivize holding and staking.● Revenue growth funds ongoing burns, tightening supply.● CertiK-audited contracts and real-time Skynet monitoring protect the system’s integrity. This coordinated expansion makes FUNToken’s next chapters fundamentally different from short-term hype cycles. It is a long-term strategy to tie adoption to scarcity and create structural drivers of price appreciation. Conclusion: A Multi-Layered Growth Strategy FUNToken’s recent price rise isn’t the product of hype alone. It is the culmination of a structured roadmap that integrates gaming, DeFi, and AI engagement into a single ecosystem, while anchoring all of it with verifiable deflation. With transparent revenue-backed burns, audited immutability, and rapidly growing user participation, FUNToken offers a case study in how utility-driven tokenomics can translate into market performance.

New initiatives like tokenized stocks in Europe, expanded crypto products, and its own L2 blockchain could supercharge revenue growth. Significant growth opportunities exist in underserved European markets, prediction markets, and the evolving stablecoin ecosystem via the Kraken partnership. Despite a high valuation, I believe HOOD stock is a compelling long-term hold due to its innovation, strong management, and disruptive potential. Thesis Summary Robinhood Markets, Inc. ( HOOD ) is one of the hottest stocks in the market right now, and for good reason. The company is making all the right moves in a very exciting market. Robinhood is set to potentially be a major player in tokenization, stablecoins, and the future of banking. Although the stock isn't cheap, I think it’s worth holding on to HOOD long-term as all of these trends play out. Game-Changing Presentation Robinhood just shook markets with a set of new initiatives and projects that could help supercharge its revenues. Let’s break them down below, and then look at how this could potentially affect revenues. Tokenized U.S. Stocks & ETFs in Europe Robinhood will now be offering over 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs, which will be available in Europe and will trade 24/5. These tokenized shares will be hosted on the Arbitrum blockchain. Each token is representative of a real share, with all of the traditional benefits, but also more flexibility, ease of trade, and lower fees. Broader Crypto Products Crypto futures and trading will soon be available in Europe , and in the US, the company is re-launching Ethereum and Solana staking. More interestingly, Robinhood is also working on its own L2 blockchain, which it will use in the future to tokenize more real-world assets. New Fintech Tools We’re also getting Robinhood Cortex, Strategies , and more banking services. Another move that solidifies Robinhood’s position as a go-to financial service provider, beyond simple stock trading, and the company also launched its prediction market hub back in March. So Much Growth Potential There are a lot of interesting markets opening up to Robinhood thanks to these new developments. European Market The European retail market could be a strong growth area, since it is underserved, especially in terms of giving access to U.S. securities. Retail trade Volumes (BMLL) The U.S. retail market is, in fact, 20x bigger than the European one, which only sees around $12-$14 billion in trading on a monthly basis. Nonetheless, the opportunity here to disrupt is big, and it’s especially appealing as we’ve seen European markets begin to outperform and the USD continues to decline. Prediction Market The prediction hub opens up Robinhood to potentially also becoming a large player in the sports betting industry, which could be worth over $235 billion by 2025 . And it doesn’t stop there. As the blockchain-enabled Polymarket has shown, now worth over $1 billion , there’s plenty of appetite for all sorts of money to be made from prediction betting beyond sporting events. Banking and Stablecoins The move into banking has been underway for a while, with the Robinhood Gold card launched back in March 2024. Now, HOOD is expanding its portfolio of products, and it’s also dipping its toes into the exciting world of stablecoins. Partnering with Kraken , Robinhood has launched its own USD stablecoin, USDG. As I wrote about recently, some studies suggest that 10% of the circulation money supply could eventually take the form of stablecoins . The Kraken and Robinhood partnership could actually be a real contender to stablecoin dominance thanks to its combined presence in the crypto and investing space. The Future Is On Chain Robinhood is building its own L2 blockchain, and this is the foundation of everything that is supporting Robinhood's growth story right now. Blockchain technology is ultimately what will allow for the seamless tokenization of real-world assets, improved banking and payment infrastructure, and lay the foundation for stablecoins. The fact that Robinhood is already having the foresight to build its L2 rather than rely on existing infrastructure is very, very good news. Owning the infrastructure on which all these future developments will take place could turn out to be very profitable. For context, the Ethereum blockchain generated almost $7.3 billion in revenues in the last year. This is another very exciting area for Robinhood, and it has the momentum and appeal to young investors necessary to actually become a player in the space. Potential Risks While I think Robinhood is doing very well, there are plenty of potential risks. Tokenization, especially, will face regulatory headwinds. The financial sector is deeply entrenched, and big players won’t allow Robinhood to just take all their market. They will either lobby for regulatory hurdles or quickly try to catch up to what Robinhood is doing. On the other hand, the valuation for Robinhood is getting quite rich, even if we do take into account future earnings growth. HOOD valuation (SA) PE of 45, trading at over 70 times cash flow and nearly 6x forward PEG. Robinhood is expensive even by today’s standards, but it may be justified for a dominant player in such an exciting space. Final Thoughts All in all, I see Robinhood as a long-term play and would advise holding the stock as all of these disruptions and innovations unfold. Most of all, Robinhood’s leadership and management have shown they are very much on the ball when it comes to pursuing the next big thing, and that’s very encouraging.",HOOD,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-02 15:35:48

A massive 1,065% run up in the last quarter of 2024 really put this network on the map as a strong competitor to Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). However, after such a hot streak, a decent downside period was definitely needed. As can be seen in the chart above, the price has been falling inside of a descending channel for a period of a few weeks, and is now looking like it might break out, if of course it can also get above the $2.78 horizontal resistance level. $SUI heading back to $4.30? Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly time frame it looks as though $SUI is breaking out already, and that it is just coming back to confirm the breakout, plus $2.78 as potential new support. With a higher low checked off by the bulls, it now remains to be seen whether this next surge can take out the swing high at $4.30. If the Stochastic RSI indicator lines can tick back up, this could provide the upside price momentum that is required. $NEAR bottoming pattern playing out Source: TradingView The $NEAR price is sporting a bottoming pattern. A double-bottom has been made, and now it just remains for the price to break out beyond the descending trendline and the $2.28 resistance. That said, the size of the task awaiting the $NEAR bulls is akin to scaling Everest. Just getting back to the last big local swing high would be a 4x from here, while the all-time high is around an 8x away. Going into a potential final stage of the bull market this much in arrears does not bode well for any cryptocurrency. $NEAR will need to rise, and rise quickly, if it is to remain a going concern beyond this bull market cycle. $S breaks above descending trendline Source: TradingView Having rebranded to Sonic (S) from Fantom (FTM) relatively recently, there isn’t a great deal of previous price action to go on for $S. That said, what there is looks very promising. The breakout of the descending trendline is a good start, with the resistance at $0.33 the next target. At least for the shorter term time frames this could be an interesting play. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

By June, insiders say, he began to express doubts about the manufacturing process, nicknamed 18A, that his predecessor Pat Gelsinger had championed, warning it might not win over new customers. Now, the CEO wants to explore a huge shift in the contract manufacturing known as the “foundry” business. Intel implements swift cost‑cutting initiatives Tan’s first months saw him slice through what he viewed as bloated middle management and bring in new engineering talent, all in the name of putting Intel’s finances on a firmer footing. The urgency was clear: Intel hadn’t turned a profit since 1986, and its $18.8 billion net loss for 2024 was a stark reminder that bold action was needed. Sources familiar with the talks reveal that 18A, a cutting‑edge method including a novel transistor design and power‑delivery scheme, may be shelved for external sales. Developing 18A and its variant, 18A‑P, has already cost Intel billions . Halting its marketing would likely trigger a hefty write‑off, with analysts estimating hundreds of millions, if not billions, in losses. Yet the tech’s appeal seems to be waning just as rivals like TSMC press ahead with their N2 node. Intel declined to comment on what it called a rumor. “Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to strengthening our roadmap, building trust with our customers, and improving our financial position for the future,” the company said in a statement “We have identified clear areas of focus and will take actions needed to turn the business around.” – Intel. Last year, Intel reported its first unprofitable year since 1986. Recently, the company was reportedly considering selling its networking and edge-computing operations known as NEX as part of the company’s broader strategy to focus on its more profitable businesses. The company is looking at an urgent appeal to customers With TSMC’s N2 on track and Apple and Nvidia among the biggest fabless clients out there, Tan’s strategy calls for redirecting resources to Intel’s next‑gen 14A process. He believes 14A could give the company a competitive edge, but only if major partners buy in. To that end, Tan has instructed his team to map out options for the board’s upcoming meeting, possibly as soon as this month. A final verdict on whether to stop pitching 18A externally may not come until the autumn session, given the high stakes and complexities involved. Even if the marketing of 18A is curtailed, Intel plans to keep using the process for in‑house designs and existing commitments. That means Panther Lake laptop chips, lauded as the most advanced processors ever made in the US, will still roll off its 18A line in late 2025. And Intel must honor contracts to produce chips for Amazon and Microsoft on the same node, given their tight deadlines. The broader picture remains unsettled. Hopes hinge on delivering 14A swiftly and tailoring it to marquee clients’ needs. If successful, Intel could reclaim ground lost to TSMC over the past two decades, especially in the booming realms of mobile computing and AI. But slippage in 14A development or an unfavorable board decision might prompt the company to stick with 18A’s original roadmap. Tan’s deliberations underscore the huge risks and investments required to revive Intel’s foundry ambitions. As the board weighs his proposals, the chip world watches closely – a course correction now could shape the future of American semiconductor manufacturing for years to come, as well as the company’s profitability.

The token climbed 3.7% in the last 24 hours, rising to $0.00000967. The rally comes as U.S. President Donald Trump said he isn’t considering extending the looming July 9 deadline for his reciprocal tariffs to go into effect.

For those keeping an eye on global economic shifts, a significant projection from UBS regarding the AUD/USD forecast is making waves. The Swiss banking giant has set a target of 0.70 for the Australian Dollar against the US Dollar by mid-2026, a move that could have profound implications for traders, investors, and anyone with exposure to global currencies. This isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of anticipated economic shifts, policy decisions, and market dynamics that warrant a closer look. What factors are driving this optimistic outlook, and how might it reshape your understanding of the global financial landscape? Let’s dive deep into the nuances of this compelling projection. What Does UBS’s AUD/USD Forecast Truly Mean for Your Investments? When UBS, a major player in global finance, puts out an AUD/USD forecast targeting 0.70 by mid-2026, it signals a potential appreciation of the Australian Dollar against its US counterpart. Currently, the pair often hovers below this mark, so a move to 0.70 represents a notable upward trajectory. But what does this really signify for different market participants? For Traders: This forecast presents a potential long-term trading opportunity. Traders might look to establish long positions in AUD/USD, betting on its rise. However, it’s crucial to remember that a mid-2026 target means navigating short-term volatility and market noise. Patience and a robust risk management strategy will be paramount. For Investors: For those with investments denominated in Australian Dollars, a stronger AUD could mean increased purchasing power internationally. Conversely, for investors holding US Dollar-denominated assets, a rising AUD might impact the value of their holdings when converted back to AUD. It highlights the importance of currency hedging strategies for international portfolios. For Businesses: Australian exporters would find their goods more expensive for international buyers, potentially impacting competitiveness. Importers, however, would benefit from a stronger AUD, making foreign goods cheaper. Businesses with international revenue streams or costs need to consider these currency movements in their financial planning. For Individuals: Travelers planning trips to the US from Australia might find their money goes further. For Australians living abroad and earning in USD, converting back to AUD would yield less. Understanding these shifts can help individuals make informed decisions about remittances, savings, and international spending. The 0.70 target isn’t just a static point; it’s a reflection of a complex interplay of macroeconomic forces that UBS believes will align over the next few years to support the Australian Dollar’s strength. What’s Driving the UBS Currency Outlook Towards 0.70? UBS’s projection is not based on mere speculation; it’s rooted in a comprehensive analysis of various fundamental drivers. The UBS currency outlook for AUD/USD is influenced by several key macroeconomic themes. Let’s explore the primary factors underpinning this optimistic forecast: 1. Commodity Price Dynamics Australia is a major exporter of raw materials, particularly iron ore, coal, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Global demand for these commodities significantly impacts Australia’s terms of trade and, consequently, the value of the Australian Dollar. UBS likely anticipates a sustained or even rising trend in key commodity prices, driven by: Global Economic Recovery: As major economies, especially China, continue to stabilize and grow, demand for industrial metals and energy resources tends to increase. Supply Constraints: Ongoing geopolitical events or production challenges in other major commodity-producing regions could keep prices elevated. Green Transition Minerals: Increasing demand for minerals essential for renewable energy technologies (e.g., copper, lithium) could provide additional support. 2. Interest Rate Differentials The relative interest rates between Australia and the United States play a crucial role. Higher interest rates typically attract foreign capital seeking better returns, thus strengthening a currency. UBS’s forecast suggests an expectation of: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Policy: The RBA might maintain a relatively hawkish stance or be slower to cut rates compared to the US Federal Reserve, or even embark on further hikes if inflation proves sticky. US Federal Reserve (Fed) Policy: UBS may anticipate the Fed to cut rates more aggressively or maintain lower rates for longer as inflation cools and economic growth moderates, narrowing the yield gap in favor of the AUD. 3. Global Growth and Risk Sentiment The Australian Dollar is often considered a ‘risk-on’ currency, meaning it tends to perform well when global economic sentiment is positive and investors are more willing to take on risk. A robust global growth environment, particularly a strong recovery in China (Australia’s largest trading partner), would bode well for the AUD. UBS’s outlook likely factors in: China’s Economic Performance: Sustained recovery and stimulus measures in China directly boost demand for Australian exports. Overall Risk Appetite: A reduction in geopolitical tensions and increased stability in global financial markets would encourage capital flows into riskier assets, including the AUD. 4. Terms of Trade Australia’s terms of trade, which measure the ratio of export prices to import prices, are a key determinant of national income and currency strength. If export prices rise relative to import prices, it improves the terms of trade, boosting national income and typically leading to a stronger Australian Dollar . UBS’s projection implies an improvement in these terms over the forecast period. These interconnected factors form the bedrock of the UBS currency outlook , painting a picture of an Australian economy poised for strength relative to its US counterpart over the medium term. How Will Key Factors Influence the Australian Dollar’s Journey? The journey of the Australian Dollar towards the 0.70 mark is not a straight line. It will be influenced by a dynamic interplay of domestic and international factors. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the Forex market. Let’s break down the key influencers and their potential impact: Domestic Factors: Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Monetary Policy: The RBA’s decisions on interest rates are paramount. If the RBA maintains a tighter monetary policy than expected, or if inflation proves persistent, leading to further rate hikes, the AUD would likely strengthen. Conversely, earlier or deeper rate cuts would weigh on the currency. Australian Economic Data: Key indicators such as GDP growth, inflation figures (CPI), employment data, and retail sales provide insights into the health of the Australian economy. Stronger-than-expected data generally supports the AUD, as it signals a robust economy that might warrant tighter monetary policy. Government Policy and Fiscal Health: Government spending, taxation policies, and the overall fiscal position can impact investor confidence and, indirectly, the currency. A stable and responsible fiscal approach is generally positive for currency stability. International Factors: US Federal Reserve (Fed) Monetary Policy: The Fed’s actions on interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening are arguably the most significant external factor. If the Fed maintains higher rates for longer or hikes further, it makes the USD more attractive, potentially capping AUD/USD gains. If the Fed cuts rates aggressively, it could weaken the USD, providing tailwinds for the AUD. Global Economic Growth: As a commodity-linked currency, the AUD thrives on strong global growth, particularly from major trading partners like China. A slowdown in global growth or a recession in key economies would dampen demand for Australian exports and weigh on the AUD. Commodity Prices: Continued strength in prices for Australia’s key exports (iron ore, coal, LNG) is vital. Any significant downturn in these prices due to oversupply or weakening demand would directly impact the AUD’s value. Geopolitical Risks: Global instability, trade wars, or major conflicts can trigger a ‘flight to safety,’ often strengthening the US Dollar as a safe-haven asset, at the expense of riskier currencies like the AUD. Here’s a simplified table summarizing the potential impact of these factors: Factor Scenario Impact on AUD/USD RBA Interest Rates Higher than Fed Positive (AUD strengthens) US Fed Interest Rates Lower than RBA Positive (AUD strengthens) Commodity Prices Rising Positive (AUD strengthens) Global Growth (esp. China) Strong Positive (AUD strengthens) Australian Economic Data Strong Positive (AUD strengthens) Global Risk Sentiment ‘Risk-on’ (positive) Positive (AUD strengthens) Geopolitical Tensions Rising Negative (AUD weakens, USD strengthens) Monitoring these factors continuously will be key to understanding the Australian Dollar’s trajectory and the viability of UBS’s ambitious forecast. Ready to Trade? Applying Forex Market Analysis to Your Strategy For those considering positions based on UBS’s AUD/USD forecast , simply knowing the target isn’t enough. Successful trading requires a disciplined approach, integrating this long-term outlook with comprehensive Forex market analysis . Here’s how you can apply this information to your trading strategy: 1. Fundamental Analysis Alignment: UBS’s forecast is primarily based on fundamental factors. Your analysis should align with these drivers: Monitor Economic Calendars: Keep a close eye on economic releases from Australia (RBA meetings, CPI, employment) and the US (Fed meetings, NFP, CPI). Deviations from expectations can cause significant short-term volatility. Track Commodity Markets: Pay attention to the price movements of key Australian exports like iron ore. Strong commodity prices generally provide underlying support for the AUD. Assess Global Risk Appetite: Follow global news, geopolitical developments, and stock market performance. A positive global sentiment often correlates with a stronger AUD. 2. Technical Analysis for Entry and Exit Points: While fundamentals drive the long-term trend, technical analysis helps pinpoint optimal entry and exit points. Support and Resistance Levels: Identify key price levels where the AUD/USD pair has historically found buying or selling interest. These can act as potential turning points. Trend Indicators: Use moving averages, MACD, or RSI to confirm the prevailing trend and identify overbought/oversold conditions that might signal a temporary reversal. Chart Patterns: Look for bullish patterns (e.g., inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms) that could indicate an impending upward move, or bearish patterns that signal a correction. 3. Risk Management is Paramount: Even with a strong forecast, the Forex market is volatile. Protecting your capital is crucial. Position Sizing: Never risk more than a small percentage of your trading capital on a single trade (e.g., 1-2%). Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against your position unexpectedly. Take-Profit Levels: While the 0.70 target is long-term, consider setting intermediate take-profit levels to lock in gains along the way. 4. Diversification and Correlation: Consider how AUD/USD moves in relation to other assets in your portfolio. The Australian Dollar often correlates with commodity prices and global equities. Understanding these correlations can help you diversify your risk and identify opportunities. Integrating robust Forex market analysis with UBS’s long-term projection provides a comprehensive framework for making informed trading decisions. Remember, the market is dynamic, and continuous monitoring is essential. Beyond the Forecast: Crafting Your Winning Currency Trading Strategy A forecast, even from a reputable institution like UBS, is a guide, not a guarantee. To truly capitalize on potential movements like the AUD/USD forecast , you need a well-defined and adaptable currency trading strategy . This involves more than just identifying a direction; it encompasses planning, execution, and continuous learning. 1. Define Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance: Long-Term Investor vs. Short-Term Trader: UBS’s mid-2026 target is for a longer-term horizon. If you’re a day trader, this forecast provides context but your strategy will focus on intraday volatility. For a swing trader or long-term investor, it offers a directional bias for larger positions. Comfort with Volatility: The path to 0.70 will likely be bumpy. How much volatility are you comfortable enduring? Your risk tolerance will dictate your position sizing and the tightness of your stop-loss orders. 2. Integrate Multiple Analytical Approaches: A robust strategy often combines different forms of analysis: Fundamental Analysis: As discussed, this provides the ‘why’ behind the move. Understand the economic narratives driving the AUD and USD. Technical Analysis: This provides the ‘when’ and ‘where.’ Use chart patterns, indicators, and support/resistance levels to identify entry and exit points, as well as confirm trends. Sentiment Analysis: Gauge market sentiment by observing news headlines, social media trends, and institutional positioning. Extreme sentiment can sometimes signal a reversal. 3. Develop a Trading Plan and Stick to It: A clear trading plan is the backbone of any successful currency trading strategy . Your plan should include: Entry Criteria: What specific conditions must be met before you enter a trade? Exit Criteria: When will you take profit? When will you cut losses? Risk Management Rules: How much capital will you risk per trade? What is your maximum daily/weekly loss? Trade Management: How will you manage the trade once it’s open (e.g., trailing stops, scaling in/out)? 4. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: The Forex market is constantly evolving. Your strategy should too. Regularly review your trades, analyze your successes and failures, and adapt your plan based on market conditions and new information. Economic forecasts, including the UBS currency outlook , can change, and your strategy must be flexible enough to adjust. 5. The Psychological Edge: Emotional discipline is often the most challenging aspect of trading. Fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear of losing can lead to poor decisions. Stick to your plan, avoid overtrading, and understand that losses are a part of the game. Crafting a winning currency trading strategy is an ongoing process of education, discipline, and adaptation. While UBS’s projection offers a valuable long-term perspective, your success will ultimately hinge on the robustness of your own trading framework and your ability to execute it consistently. Challenges and Risks to the UBS Forecast While UBS’s AUD/USD forecast presents an optimistic scenario, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties and risks that could derail or alter this projection. No forecast is infallible, especially one stretching out to mid-2026. Here are some key challenges and risks: Unexpected Economic Shocks: A severe global recession, a major financial crisis, or unforeseen economic downturns in key regions (e.g., China, US) could significantly impact commodity demand and risk sentiment, weakening the AUD. Monetary Policy Divergence: If the RBA becomes unexpectedly dovish (e.g., due to a domestic economic slowdown) or the Fed becomes surprisingly hawkish (e.g., due to persistent inflation), the interest rate differential could move against the AUD, contrary to UBS’s presumed trajectory. Commodity Price Volatility: A sharp and sustained decline in the prices of Australia’s major exports (iron ore, coal) due to new supply, reduced demand, or technological shifts could severely undermine the Australian Dollar. Geopolitical Instability: Escalation of existing conflicts or emergence of new geopolitical tensions could trigger a strong flight to safe-haven assets, primarily the US Dollar, at the expense of ‘risk-on’ currencies like the AUD. Structural Changes: Long-term shifts in global trade patterns, supply chains, or energy consumption could impact Australia’s export profile and economic resilience, potentially affecting the AUD’s value. Data Surprises: Any significant deviation in key economic data points (inflation, employment, GDP) from market expectations in either Australia or the US could lead to sharp and sustained currency movements that challenge the forecast. These risks underscore the dynamic nature of Forex markets and the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptability in any trading or investment strategy. While a UBS currency outlook provides a valuable directional bias, it must be viewed within the context of these potential headwinds. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AUD/USD UBS’s projection of the AUD/USD reaching 0.70 by mid-2026 offers a compelling long-term perspective for the Australian Dollar . This forecast is underpinned by expectations of favorable commodity prices, a narrowing interest rate differential, and a generally positive global economic environment. For traders and investors, this presents a potential opportunity, but it also highlights the necessity of thorough Forex market analysis and a disciplined currency trading strategy . The journey to 0.70 will undoubtedly be marked by volatility and influenced by a myriad of domestic and international factors, from central bank policies to geopolitical events. While the AUD/USD forecast from UBS provides a strong directional signal, success in navigating this landscape will depend on your ability to interpret market dynamics, manage risk effectively, and adapt your approach as new information emerges. Whether you’re a seasoned Forex trader or an investor looking to diversify, understanding these projections and the forces behind them is crucial for making informed decisions in the ever-evolving world of currency markets.

Fast forward to today, and it’s a full-blown global asset. Price predictions for Bitcoin are already climbing toward the $127,000 mark, with analysts forecasting an 18 percent climb. But something surprising is happening in parallel. Those same experts are now tracking a lesser-known token that is igniting early-buyer excitement all over again: Bitcoin Solaris. While Bitcoin moves like a freight train, Bitcoin Solaris is more like a rocket on standby. Bitcoin Still Leads, But It’s Slowing Down Bitcoin remains the king. No dispute there. Its scarcity and security make it the foundation of the crypto market. But innovation isn’t its strongest suit. Its TPS hovers under 10, smart contracts are clunky, and forget about mobile mining. It’s digital gold, yes. But it’s not designed for the mobile-first, app-powered economy we live in now. The Bitcoin Solaris Difference Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just another altcoin chasing Bitcoin’s shadow. It’s designed to go further and faster by solving the limitations that have long held back Bitcoin. From the ground up, Bitcoin Solaris reimagines what Bitcoin could look like if it launched in today’s world. Forget the Old Playbook BTC-S Wrote a New One Its core breakthroughs include: A dual-consensus model combining Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake Validator rotation for decentralization and security Smart contracts that support DeFi, enterprise, and real-world integrations A blazing fast dual-layer architecture that reaches over 10,000 transactions per second Energy efficiency at scale, using 99.95 percent less energy than traditional mining models These aren’t small upgrades. They’re seismic shifts. Mobile Mining: Power in Your Pocket At the heart of the Bitcoin Solaris experience is the upcoming Solaris Nova app. This isn’t some theoretical interface. It’s a real mobile-first infrastructure built to make mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The mining calculator available here shows just how powerful the rewards can be.

One of the most comprehensive reviews comes from Token Empire , who covered the unique features, performance, and the overall buzz around BTC-S. The takeaway? This isn’t a flash-in-the-pan token. It’s built to scale, adapt, and possibly surpass expectations, the way early Bitcoin once did. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris introduced daily mini games for its holders for a chance to earn daily rewards, checkout all the details here. Real Rewards. Real Ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t offering just theoretical benefits. Its reward distribution system is designed for long-term sustainability and fairness. Miners, validators, and contributors are all part of an ecosystem that respects both time and effort. Here’s how it works: Rewards are distributed across both consensus layers Time-weighted calculations ensure long-term participants earn more High-performing devices yield higher returns Contribution scores are factored in to prioritize active participation The design doesn’t just reward activity.

With a final launch price of $20, early participants stand to gain up to 150 percent just by entering before July 31. More than 13,650 users have already joined, raising over 6 million dollars. It’s being described by many as one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. Less than 5 weeks left to enter Over 11,000 users already on board Dubbed the shortest presale in crypto history To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Security and Trust Already in Place Trust in the crypto world comes with proof. Bitcoin Solaris has already been audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , two of the most respected audit firms in the space. And community growth continues through its Telegram and X pages: Telegram X Investors are not just betting on hype. They’re betting on verified infrastructure. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin Might Already Be Here Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s extending its value with speed, utility, and accessibility that Bitcoin can no longer achieve. If you missed out on buying Bitcoin at $100, this might be your second chance. Analysts certainly think so, and judging by the presale momentum, thousands of early adopters agree. The door is open. The question is: Are you stepping through it?

While digital assets capture significant attention, the foundational movements in the traditional forex market analysis continue to shape global economic landscapes. Today, we turn our gaze to a significant development in the currency world: the latest UBS outlook on the British Pound (GBP) against the US Dollar (USD). For investors and traders alike, understanding these shifts is paramount, as they can signal substantial shifts in capital flows and provide valuable insights for diversified portfolios. UBS, a global financial services giant, has recently revealed a notably optimistic stance on the GBP/USD pair, indicating further upside potential for the Pound. This positive assessment is not merely speculative; it is rooted in a detailed examination of economic fundamentals and market dynamics. Why UBS Sees Further Upside for GBP/USD? UBS’s positive sentiment regarding the GBP/USD pair stems from a confluence of factors, primarily focusing on economic divergences and policy expectations between the UK and the US. Their analysis suggests that the Sterling is poised for continued strength, moving beyond recent consolidation phases. The core of their argument revolves around the differing trajectories of inflation and monetary policy, alongside an improving economic outlook for the United Kingdom. Economic Resilience: The UK economy has shown surprising resilience, with key indicators suggesting a more robust performance than initially anticipated. This includes a resilient labor market and consumer spending, which underpin economic growth. Monetary Policy Divergence: A significant driver is the expected path of interest rates from the Bank of England (BoE) compared to the Federal Reserve (Fed). While the Fed might be nearing the end of its tightening cycle, or even contemplating cuts, the BoE is perceived to have more room for sustained higher rates, or at least a slower pace of easing, to combat persistent inflation. This differential in interest rate expectations makes the Pound more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Inflation Dynamics: Although inflation remains a challenge for both economies, the narrative around its trajectory and the central banks’ responses plays a crucial role. UBS likely anticipates that the UK’s inflation will prove stickier, necessitating a more hawkish stance from the BoE for longer, thereby supporting the Pound. Based on these fundamental drivers, UBS has reportedly set an ambitious target for the GBP/USD pair, projecting it to reach 1.32 over the next 6 to 12 months. This target reflects a strong conviction in the Pound’s underlying strength and the potential for the US Dollar to weaken as global economic conditions evolve. Unpacking the Pound Forecast: Key Drivers and Challenges To fully grasp the implications of this pound forecast , it is essential to delve deeper into the specific factors influencing Sterling’s trajectory and the potential headwinds it might face. The currency market is a complex interplay of macroeconomic data, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. Drivers of Pound Strength: UK Economic Data: Recent GDP figures, retail sales, and employment data have often surprised to the upside, painting a picture of an economy that is adapting to inflationary pressures better than some European counterparts. This resilience bolsters confidence in the UK’s economic outlook. Bank of England’s Stance: The BoE has consistently reiterated its commitment to bringing inflation back to target. Should inflation remain elevated, the market anticipates that the BoE will maintain a restrictive policy stance, offering continued support for the Pound through higher interest rate differentials. Global Risk Sentiment: As global economic uncertainty persists, the US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven currency. However, if global risk sentiment improves, or if other major economies show signs of recovery, the demand for the US Dollar could wane, indirectly benefiting currencies like the Pound. Potential Challenges for the Pound: Persistent Inflation: While a hawkish BoE supports the Pound, inflation that proves too stubborn could also stifle economic growth, leading to a stagflationary environment that would be detrimental to the currency. Global Economic Slowdown: A significant global recession could dampen demand for UK exports and impact investor confidence, regardless of domestic factors. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, can introduce volatility and uncertainty, prompting a flight to safety that typically benefits the US Dollar. Political Stability: Domestic political developments in the UK can also influence investor sentiment and, consequently, the Pound’s performance. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis: Risks and Opportunities Understanding the broader forex market analysis is crucial for making informed decisions, especially when considering a specific currency pair like GBP/USD . While UBS presents an optimistic view, every market has its inherent risks and opportunities that traders and investors must consider. Here’s a breakdown of the key considerations: Aspect Potential Risks Potential Opportunities Economic Data Surprises Weaker-than-expected UK data could undermine confidence and trigger sell-offs. Stronger-than-expected UK data could fuel further Pound appreciation. Central Bank Policy Shifts A more dovish BoE or surprisingly hawkish Fed could reverse the trend. Continued BoE hawkishness and Fed dovishness would strengthen the Pound. Geopolitical Events Escalating conflicts or new global crises could trigger safe-haven flows to USD. De-escalation or stability could reduce demand for safe havens, benefiting GBP. Market Sentiment Sudden shifts in risk appetite or negative news could impact sentiment. Positive investor sentiment towards UK assets could drive inflows. It’s important for investors to conduct their own thorough due diligence and not rely solely on any single forecast, no matter how reputable the source. The market is dynamic, and conditions can change rapidly. Strategic Insights for Currency Trading: How to Approach GBP/USD For those engaged in currency trading , the UBS outlook provides a valuable framework, but successful execution requires strategic planning and disciplined risk management. Whether you are a seasoned trader or new to the forex markets, consider these actionable insights: Monitor Economic Calendars: Stay updated on key economic data releases from both the UK and the US, including inflation reports, GDP figures, employment statistics, and central bank speeches. These events are often catalysts for significant price movements in GBP/USD . Understand Technical Levels: While fundamentals drive long-term trends, technical analysis can help identify optimal entry and exit points. Look for key support and resistance levels, trendlines, and chart patterns that align with the bullish outlook. For instance, a break above a significant resistance level could confirm the upward momentum suggested by UBS. Manage Risk Prudentl y: Always define your risk tolerance before entering a trade. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and take-profit orders to lock in gains. Even with a strong forecast, unexpected market reversals can occur. Consider Diversification: For investors with broader portfolios, a stronger Pound could impact the value of international assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies. Consider how a potential appreciation of GBP might affect your overall financial position. Stay Informed on Policy Shifts: Keep a close eye on the rhetoric and actions of the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Any unexpected shift in their monetary policy stance can have an immediate and profound impact on currency valuations. An example of a strategic approach might involve a long position on GBP/USD , targeting the 1.32 level, but with a strict stop-loss order placed below a recent support level (e.g., 1.25) to protect against adverse movements. This approach combines the fundamental conviction from the UBS outlook with practical risk management techniques essential for successful currency trading . What Does the UBS Outlook Mean for Investors? The positive UBS outlook for the Pound, particularly against the US Dollar, carries significant implications for a wide range of investors, from institutional funds to individual traders. It suggests a potential shift in the global currency landscape that warrants attention. For UK-Based Investors: A stronger Pound means that purchasing power abroad increases. For those holding foreign assets, their value in Sterling terms would decrease, necessitating a review of international investment strategies. For International Investors: The prospect of a strengthening Pound makes UK assets, such as equities and bonds, potentially more attractive, as returns could be enhanced by currency appreciation. This could lead to increased capital inflows into the UK. For Businesses: Companies involved in international trade will need to assess how a stronger Pound impacts their import and export costs and revenues. Hedging strategies might become more critical to mitigate currency risk. Long-Term Perspective: While the 1.32 target is for the medium term, the underlying reasons cited by UBS – economic resilience and monetary policy divergence – could signal a more sustained period of Pound strength if these fundamentals hold. Investors should consider if this aligns with their long-term portfolio goals. Ultimately, the UBS outlook serves as a powerful signal, but it is one piece of a larger puzzle. It encourages investors to reassess their positions, consider new opportunities, and remain agile in response to evolving market conditions. The emphasis is on informed decision-making, integrating expert analysis with individual risk profiles and investment objectives. Conclusion: Navigating the Ascendant Path of the Pound The UBS outlook on the GBP/USD pair paints an Astonishingly optimistic picture, projecting significant upside potential for the British Pound with a target of 1.32. This compelling pound forecast is grounded in robust economic analysis, highlighting the UK’s resilience and the anticipated divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. While the path to 1.32 may encounter typical market volatility, the fundamental drivers outlined by UBS provide a strong narrative for Sterling’s appreciation. For anyone engaged in currency trading or simply monitoring the global financial markets, this perspective offers crucial insights. However, it is vital to approach these forecasts with a balanced view, acknowledging the inherent risks in the dynamic forex market analysis . Diligent research, disciplined risk management, and a keen eye on macroeconomic indicators will be key to navigating the potential opportunities presented by this positive outlook. As always, the market rewards those who are prepared and adaptable.

Together we can support builders earlier in their journey, accelerating the path to economic freedom. pic.twitter.com/2rU9OYKxTe — Coinbase (@coinbase) July 2, 2025 Coinbase stated that the acquisition of LiquiFi enhances its ability to offer token cap table management, vesting, and compliance support, advancing its goal of becoming a comprehensive platform for launching and scaling on-chain businesses. LiquiFi is recognized for simplifying token ownership tracking, vesting schedules, and regulatory workflows. It has become a widely used tool among early-stage crypto teams seeking to streamline their token operations. With this integration, Coinbase seeks to address common challenges faced by builders, such as fragmented data management, legal uncertainty, and complex compliance requirements. LiquiFi automates these processes, allowing teams to operate more efficiently and with greater confidence. “Launching a token today is too hard,” said Greg Tusar, vice president of institutional product at Coinbase. “With LiquiFi, we’re lowering the barrier to entry and enabling innovation at speed.” Bringing End-to-End Support to the Token Economy According to Coinbase, LiquiFi’s technology will eventually be embedded within Coinbase Prime, improving its suite of services that already includes custody, trading, and financing. This vertical integration ensures that companies issuing tokens can do so in a secure, compliant, and user-friendly environment. The firm said its long-term vision is ambitious: making token launches easier, faster, and more global than issuing traditional startup equity.

Whether you’re launching a new protocol or managing employee token compensation, the tools to succeed will soon be in one place. Coinbase Named by TIME as a ‘Disruptor’ Recently, TIME has named Coinbase one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , pointing to the crypto exchange as a “disruptor” for its aggressive policy advocacy in Washington. The recognition follows a sharp 26% year-to-date surge in Coinbase’s stock, which climbed from around $303 to a high of $382 after the Senate passed the GENIUS stablecoin bill on June 17. TIME noted that Coinbase , which in May became the first crypto stock added to the S&P 500 index, is “a key driver of the industry’s policy efforts in Washington, D.C.” With more industry-friendly legislation on the horizon, the publication said Coinbase could cement its role as the central hub for U.S. crypto trading. Coinbase’s influence extends beyond the U.S. On June 20, the exchange secured a license to provide digital asset services across the European Union under the MiCA regulatory framework, granted by Luxembourg’s financial regulator.

This single statistic defines the quarter — and reshapes how crypto information reaches users across the continent. According to Outset PR’s newly released report — building on their earlier Q1 analysis of crypto media declines in LATAM — the same downward trend played out in Western Europe between January and March, revealing a sharp contradiction: growing public interest in crypto, but shrinking media visibility. The report tracked 133 Western European outlets, of which 87 were crypto-focused, using SimilarWeb and Ahrefs to measure traffic and search visibility. A clear majority of crypto-only sites saw audience declines — driven by the combined effects of MiCA-aligned regulatory pressure, Google’s March algorithm update, and shifting search behaviors tied to market volatility. As the EU’s first comprehensive crypto framework, MiCA began reshaping media visibility by forcing outlets to rethink compliance, language, and even tone — well before full enforcement kicked in. During the aforementioned timeframe, traffic across crypto-native media dropped from 26.57 million to 22.22 million visits, a decline of more than 16%. To understand the full weight of that 82%, it needs to be broken down by region, language, and outlet structure to see who survived, who collapsed, and why. Western Europe crypto media performance: data sourced from Outset PR Where the Declines Were Sharpest: Regional Breakdown Outset PR tracks MiCA’s varied impact on crypto media across Western European countries Based on Outset PR’s findings, the hardest-hit countries were Italy and Spain, with both seeing over 70% of tracked crypto outlets lose visibility in Q1. In Italy, this decline was especially striking given that it leads the region in crypto interest — 37% of the population expresses active engagement. The downturn was largely driven by regulatory scrutiny from CONSOB, which targeted influencer-led content and investment-style messaging. Top Italian outlets lost nearly half their traffic. Only Borsainside maintained consistent growth, ending the quarter up 15.96%. In Spain, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) began enforcing strict advertising guidelines, which led to a significant reduction in ad-supported content and discoverability. Although Bit2Me News surged 149.4% in March — making it one of the top performers across the region — most other Spanish-language outlets ended the quarter with traffic in decline. Germany: Europe’s Largest Crypto Language Market Still Struggled German-speaking outlets made up nearly 40% of the crypto-native platforms reviewed in Outset PR’s dataset. Despite this dominant share, the German market faced significant visibility challenges in Q1. In February, the financial regulator BaFin issued new guidance that warned against any investment-like promotion from unlicensed parties — including media platforms. Amid these developments, outlets like Coin-Update, Krypto Magazin, and BitcoinBlog.de saw sharp traffic declines. Although a few sites posted gains in March, more than half of the region’s crypto-focused German-language publishers continued trending downward at quarter’s end. A key exception was CoinJournal DE, which grew 23.90% in Q1. Backed by Investoo Group, the outlet benefited from shared SEO expertise, multilingual publishing capabilities, and regulatory infrastructure. These elements allowed it to navigate algorithmic changes and new content standards more effectively than independent competitors. France: Transparent Labels Became the Differentiator In France, regulatory enforcement from the AMF focused on transparency rather than restrictions, prompting algorithmic suppression of outlets that failed to properly label promotions or disclose financial risks. By February, 72% of French-language crypto platforms had lost traffic. Some sites like The Blog saw their visibility collapse almost entirely. Others, such as Blockchain France and InvestX, rebounded by March, likely due to cleaner disclaimer practices, improved metadata, and expansion into multilingual publishing. The divide in outcomes highlights the start of a more polarized crypto media environment in France, where clarity and compliance are now essential for sustainable reach. Dutch-Language Media Faced Algorithmic Whiplash Outlets serving readers in the Netherlands and Belgium faced no direct media restrictions from regulators during Q1. However, their heavy reliance on SEO and Google visibility made them especially vulnerable to algorithmic shifts. Outset PR’s report also shows that in February, 76% of Dutch-speaking crypto outlets reported traffic losses. High-profile names like Bitcoin Magazine NL fell 36.78%, while Bitcoinspot.nl dropped 39.30%. A few properties — such as Beste Bank and Coinmarketcap.nl —bounced back in March, thanks to stronger content quality and diversified link-building strategies. Still, most Dutch-language outlets were unable to regain their January positions, demonstrating the inherent risk of traffic models built almost entirely around search visibility. UK Outlets Felt the Ripple Effects of Domestic Policy Although the United Kingdom is not bound by MiCA, local regulation had a comparable impact. In early January, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) expanded its financial promotions regime to include crypto. This contributed to widespread visibility losses for UK-facing outlets, especially those featuring unverified affiliate offers or poorly labeled advertorials. Most UK crypto-native platforms saw traffic decline across the quarter. Only The Market Periodical and MyCryptoSpaceUK posted quarterly gains, though both averaged well below 100K monthly visits. Meanwhile, Cryptouk.io and Bitcourier continued trending downward, underscoring that even outside of MiCA, enforcement and algorithm shifts are reshaping how crypto media operates in the UK. No UK-based outlet crossed the 500K monthly visit threshold, suggesting that while regulation played a role, overall readership remained modest compared to Germany, France, or the Netherlands. Tiered Media Analysis: Who Still Commands Reach? Outset PR’s analysis revealed that traffic is concentrated among a small group of top-tier publishers. Just seven outlets surpassed 1 million monthly visits, together accounting for 60.26% of the region’s total crypto-native traffic. A mid-tier of six outlets generated between 500K and 900K monthly visits, accounting for another 18% of total visibility. Beyond these two groups, 58 outlets attracted fewer than 100K monthly visits each, combining for only 6.24% of the total audience. While 16 outlets did post traffic increases during Q1, most of them grew by percentage, not by reach. Only Newsbit.de combined high growth with consistently strong reach above the 1 million mark. Mainstream Finance Media Outperformed Crypto-Native Outlets In contrast to crypto-specific sites, generalist finance, tech, and economic publications proved far more resilient. Outset PR tracked 46 such platforms in Western Europe, and 25 of them posted quarterly growth. Together, they generated over 106 million visits, dwarfing the 22 million visits recorded by crypto-only sites. These outlets benefited from strong domain authority, broader editorial scopes, and less reliance on price-based speculation content. Outset PR notes that finance-first platforms have become vital for crypto PR efforts — especially in a MiCA-enforced environment where credibility and compliance now define reach. Google Discover Favors Structured, Compliant Media As Outset PR notes, the battle for traffic in Q1 extended beyond search rankings — into Google Discover, where surfacing now reflects a site’s editorial structure and legal hygiene. Only 22.99% of crypto-native outlets maintained consistent presence in Google Discover in Q1 2025. By comparison, 32.61% of non-crypto-native outlets appeared consistently in Discover. Nine of these sites surpassed 1 million monthly visits, confirming the importance of technical compliance and editorial credibility in Google's evolving news ecosystem. Outset PR’s report makes one thing clear: the traffic drop experienced by crypto-covering media outlets in Western Europe during Q1 2025 was a structural reset. Regulation, platform policies, and evolving search engine standards have raised the bar for visibility, and many crypto publishers found themselves unprepared for the new terrain. In this cycle, survival hinges on multilingual reach, legal clarity, and editorial agility. SEO depth, risk disclaimers, and compliance-ready publishing aren’t just best practices — they’re the price of admission. As the standout data-driven agency with a boutique approach to crypto communications, Outset PR emphasizes the importance of tailoring media planning to business goals, market dynamics, and regional nuances.

As the industry has gone mainstream with endorsements from major corporations and political figures, builders need to return to the ecosystem’s key ideals surrounding decentralization and building for users' needs, Buterin said. In his typical jeans and relaxed dark T-shirt uniform, Buterin laid out practical “tests” that he said every crypto project should pass. These include 1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets? And 2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause? And 3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users’ funds or data? He warned that too many layer-2 networks, DeFi projects and “decentralized” front-ends rely on hidden backdoors, instant upgrade buttons or insecure interfaces that can be tampered with and hacked. Even identity and privacy solutions came under his critical eye. Zero-knowledge proofs, he noted, can backfire if users still reveal their entire transaction history when they sign in with centralized providers. Privacy, he added, must flip from being treated as an optional feature to something that reduces data leaks by default. It will be 10 years this month since the Ethereum blockchain went live, and Buterin has come under pressure over the past few months from the community to address core protocol issues. If not, the blockchain could lose its edge to competitors. For Buterin, this next phase in Ethereum’s history means building systems that pass the walk-away test, shrink the trusted base of code and resist insider attacks. This includes balancing engineering with simple, robust solutions. “If we lose that,” he concluded, “Ethereum inevitably just becomes a generational thing, and it inevitably passes like a lot of other things have passed before.” Read more: Vitalik Buterin Proposes Replacing Ethereum’s EVM With RISC-V",Tech|Ethereum|Vitalik Buterin|Decentralization|layer 2|News,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-02 15:56:29

However, as promising as this is, market insiders are turning their attention to an altcoin that promises a much more explosive Q3 growth than Ethereum, which is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project has sold out more than 50% of presale stage 5 at a price of $0.03. MUTM has already raised over $11.4 million and has attracted over 12,600 investors. Mutuum Finance is gaining traction as a serious coin among other altcoins to purchase Q3 2025. Ethereum’s Q3 Outlook: A Balanced Recovery Ahead Ethereum is trading at $2440 after bouncing off the $2400 support zone. Technicals point to a V-shaped recovery out of the $2,584-$2,620 zone. Immediate resistance zone includes $2,645-2,700. On-chain indicators show a stable institutional interest in improved flow data. Whale activity and ETF spot positions have kept ETH above multi-year price trend lines. However there are warning signs that futures market premiums are not aggressive as far as bullish conviction is concerned and Layer-1 competition will neutralize the bull wave. In contrast there is a significant interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as it seeks to revolutionize DeFi. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,600 early adopters and more than $11.4 million raised, the project is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. USD-Pegged Stablecoin Token and $50K Security Bounty Mutuum Finance in its strategic moves to build more on its DeFi platform is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. In contrast to very risky algorithmic stablecoins, this token is designed to maintain its worth even during market volatility. The project is all about security and integrity. Mutuum Finance platform is also already audited by CertiK, which once again proves the team focus on transparency, reliability, and sustainability. The audit awarded the project a 95.0 trust score, speaking to its safety. Mutuum Finance has also introduced Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, offering a 50,000 USDT reward. The bounty is split into four categories, such as the critical, major, minor, and low. This will equate all the tiers of vulnerability and reward it. Investor Rewards To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. Ethereum may be regaining its footing above $2,400, but the real breakout energy is building behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As over 12,600 investors and $11.4 million in raised capital show, early entrants are locking in at just $0.03 per token, aiming for major upside before Phase 6 pushes the price higher. Backed by a CertiK audit, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway, MUTM is not just a DeFi project, it’s a full-stack opportunity.

Tom Lee has emerged as the Chairman of BitMine, which will hold ETH, while Lubin is already the Chairman of SharpLink Gaming. Lee and Lubin Raise $675 Million for Ethereum Treasury Strategy Tom Lee and Joe Lubin have already advanced their plans to create the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. On Tom Lee’s end, BitMine announced a $250 million private placement to raise capital for its Ethereum strategy. The Bitcoin mining company stated that the net proceeds of the offering will be used to acquire ETH, which will become the firm’s primary reserve asset. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts $10,000 ATH For Ethereum This Cycle, Here’s Why BitMine plans to close this private placement on or about July 3, as it aims to become one of the largest publicly traded ETH holders with Tom Lee as the Chairman of the Board. On the other hand, SharpLink Gaming, with Joe Lubin’s help, is already the largest publicly traded Ethereum holder. The company earlier launched its Ethereum treasury with a $425 million ETH purchase. SharpLink Gaming recently announced that it has increased its total ETH holdings to 198,167 ($475 million), further establishing its position as the ‘MicroStrategy’ of Ethereum. Between June 23 and 30, it acquired 9,468 ETH for $22.8 million at an average price of $2,411 per ETH. During that same period, SharpLink Gaming also raised an additional $24.4 million through its At-The-Market (ATM) facility, selling $2.5 million shares. The company revealed that most of the proceeds will go toward further Ethereum acquisitions. As of June 30th, 100% of its ETH is staked, and the firm has earned 222 ETH in rewards since it began an ETH treasury company. Plans To Mirror Saylor’s Strategy In an X post, crypto commentator Eric Conner commented on how Ethereum is getting its own MicroStrategy era thanks to Lee and Lubin’s experiments. He highlighted BitMine’s proposed KPI of ‘ETH per share,’ which mirrors Saylor’s playbook, except that ETH earns yield in this instance through staking. Related Reading: These Companies Are Following Saylor’s Strategy Into The Bitcoin Battleground With Over $2 Billion Slated To Buy BTC Conner further remarked that BitMine’s mining DNA lets it spin up validators and tap DeFi rails, turning a once-capital-intensive operation into a cash-flow engine secured by Ethereum. On the other hand, he noted that Joe Lubin and SharpLink Gaming’s move is bigger. SharpLink is already staking its ETH holdings and plans to explore other DeFi strategies. With this move, the crypto commentator declared that ETH becomes the reserve while yielding bankroll growth. Lubin also recently raised the possibility of adding leverage to SharpLink Gaming’s Ethereum strategy, which will mirror Saylor’s strategy. He stated that they may do convertible equity and issue bonds at low rates, without putting the strategy at risk. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,444, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The recent USD/JPY forecast from UBS, projecting the pair to reach 140 by year-end, offers a compelling insight into the ongoing macro-economic shifts that can indirectly influence every asset class, including digital assets. This prediction isn’t just a number; it reflects deep analysis of monetary policy divergence, inflation trends, and global economic sentiment. Let’s delve into what this means for the global financial landscape and why it matters to you. What Does the USD/JPY Forecast to 140 Mean? The USD/JPY forecast of 140 by year-end signifies a notable strengthening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. For those unfamiliar with currency pairs, USD/JPY represents how many Japanese Yen (JPY) you need to buy one US Dollar (USD). A move from, say, 130 to 140 means the Dollar is becoming more valuable relative to the Yen. This isn’t merely a statistical adjustment; it’s a powerful indicator of underlying economic forces at play between the two largest economies in the world. This target is significant for several reasons: Monetary Policy Divergence: A primary driver is the stark contrast in monetary policies between the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). While the Fed has been on a path of aggressive interest rate hikes to combat inflation, the BoJ has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping interest rates near zero or even negative. This creates a widening interest rate differential, making the US Dollar more attractive for yield-seeking investors. Inflation Dynamics: Inflation in the US has been persistent, prompting the Fed’s actions. In Japan, inflation has historically been subdued, though it has recently seen some uptick. The difference in inflationary pressures dictates the central banks’ responses, directly impacting currency valuations. Economic Growth Outlook: Perceived differences in economic growth trajectories between the US and Japan can also influence currency strength. A stronger growth outlook for one economy typically supports its currency. Understanding these foundational elements is key to grasping the implications of UBS’s specific USD/JPY forecast . Unpacking the Japanese Yen Outlook : Beyond the Numbers The Japanese Yen outlook is perhaps the most critical component in this equation. For years, the Yen has been known as a safe-haven currency, often appreciating during times of global uncertainty. However, in recent times, its role has shifted due to the BoJ’s unwavering commitment to its Yield Curve Control (YCC) policy and negative interest rates. This stance aims to stimulate the Japanese economy and achieve a stable 2% inflation target, but it comes at the cost of Yen weakness when other major central banks are tightening. Key factors shaping the current Japanese Yen outlook include: Bank of Japan’s Stance: The BoJ remains an outlier among major central banks. Its determination to keep long-term bond yields capped, despite rising global rates, creates a significant yield gap that encourages capital outflow from Japan and into higher-yielding currencies like the US Dollar. Imported Inflation: A weaker Yen makes imports more expensive for Japan, contributing to imported inflation. While this helps the BoJ achieve its inflation target, it also impacts household purchasing power and corporate costs. Trade Balance: Japan’s trade balance can be influenced by Yen weakness. While it makes Japanese exports cheaper and potentially more competitive, the rising cost of energy and raw material imports (priced in USD) can offset these benefits, especially for a resource-scarce nation. The persistence of the BoJ’s accommodative policy is a cornerstone of the current bearish sentiment surrounding the Yen, directly underpinning the USD/JPY forecast . Broader Implications: A Forex Market Analysis Perspective A significant move in the USD/JPY pair, as projected by UBS, has ripple effects across the entire Forex market analysis landscape. The US Dollar’s strength against the Yen is often indicative of broader Dollar strength against other currencies, especially those whose central banks are also tightening monetary policy, but perhaps less aggressively than the Fed. Here’s how a strong USD/JPY can influence the broader Forex market analysis : Carry Trade Revival: The widening interest rate differential between the US and Japan makes the ‘carry trade’ more attractive. This strategy involves borrowing in a low-interest rate currency (like JPY) and investing in a high-interest rate currency (like USD). A sustained USD/JPY appreciation can fuel further carry trade activity, amplifying the Yen’s weakness. Impact on Emerging Markets: A stronger US Dollar can put pressure on emerging market currencies, especially those with significant Dollar-denominated debt. This can lead to capital outflows from these economies, creating financial instability. Global Trade and Investment Flows: Currency valuations impact the competitiveness of exports and imports. A weaker Yen makes Japanese goods cheaper abroad, potentially boosting exports, but it also increases the cost of vital imports, which can be inflationary. Global investors also weigh currency risks when making cross-border investment decisions. Thus, the UBS prediction for USD/JPY is not an isolated event but a crucial piece in the complex puzzle of global financial flows and market dynamics. Navigating Currency Exchange Rates : What History Tells Us Understanding the historical context of currency exchange rates , particularly for a major pair like USD/JPY, provides valuable perspective. The pair has seen significant volatility over decades, influenced by various economic cycles, geopolitical events, and policy shifts. For instance, the Yen saw periods of strong appreciation in the post-Plaza Accord era and during global financial crises when it served as a safe haven. Consider these historical parallels when analyzing current currency exchange rates : Past Interventions: Japan has historically intervened in the Forex market to curb excessive Yen strength. While a weaker Yen is currently desired by the BoJ, rapid depreciation could trigger concerns about import costs and financial stability, potentially leading to future interventions. Economic Shocks: Global recessions, commodity price shocks, and geopolitical tensions have historically led to shifts in safe-haven flows, impacting the Yen’s value. While the current weakness is policy-driven, unexpected external shocks could alter the trajectory. Monetary Policy Cycles: The current divergence is reminiscent of past periods where central banks were out of sync, leading to sustained currency trends. However, these cycles eventually turn, often when economic conditions or policy priorities shift. While history doesn’t repeat itself exactly, it often rhymes. The current situation is unique in the scale of monetary policy divergence, making the UBS prediction particularly noteworthy. Actionable Insights from the UBS Prediction : What Should You Consider? For investors and traders, the UBS prediction of USD/JPY at 140 by year-end offers actionable insights, though it’s crucial to remember that forecasts are subject to change and come with inherent risks. This outlook suggests a continued preference for the US Dollar over the Japanese Yen in the short to medium term. Here are some considerations: For Forex Traders: Those looking to trade currency pairs might consider strategies that capitalize on continued Yen weakness. This could involve long positions on USD/JPY or shorting JPY against other major currencies that are also experiencing tighter monetary policy (e.g., EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY). However, managing risk through stop-loss orders and position sizing is paramount. For Global Investors: The implications extend beyond direct currency trading. Companies with significant exposure to Japanese imports or exports will see their cost structures or revenues impacted. Investors holding Japanese assets might face currency depreciation risks on their returns when converted back to their base currency. Conversely, US dollar-denominated assets become more attractive for non-US investors. Monitoring Central Bank Communications: Keep a close eye on statements from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Any hint of a shift in their respective monetary policy stances – for example, the Fed slowing its hiking pace or the BoJ tweaking its YCC policy – could significantly alter the Japanese Yen outlook and the USD/JPY forecast . Economic Data Releases: Key economic indicators from both the US (inflation, employment, GDP) and Japan (inflation, wages, industrial production) should be closely monitored as they provide real-time insights into the health of each economy and potential policy responses. The UBS prediction serves as a strong directional guide, but market participants must remain agile and responsive to evolving economic data and policy shifts. Conclusion UBS’s bold USD/JPY forecast of 140 by year-end underscores the significant divergence in monetary policies and economic conditions between the United States and Japan. This outlook for the Japanese Yen is largely shaped by the Bank of Japan’s continued commitment to ultra-loose monetary policy, contrasting sharply with the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening. The implications ripple across the entire Forex market analysis , influencing capital flows, carry trades, and the competitiveness of global trade. While the historical context of currency exchange rates offers valuable lessons, the current environment presents unique challenges and opportunities. For anyone engaged in global finance, from traditional markets to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, understanding this key UBS prediction is essential for informed decision-making and navigating the evolving economic landscape. Staying abreast of central bank actions and key economic data will be paramount in the months ahead.

Ethereum Forms Bearish Rounded Top: Breakdown Targets $2,300 The Ethereum ($ETH/$USDT) 30-minute chart presents a clear rounded top formation, typically interpreted as a bearish reversal pattern. The arc began forming on June 29, with Ethereum gradually losing upward momentum after peaking just below $2,530. This slow transition from bullish to bearish sentiment is often driven by fading buyer interest and profit-taking, leading to a progressively weaker price structure. Source: CoinGlass The rounded top was completed between June 30 and July 1, culminating in a breakdown below the neckline zone near $2,470, marked with a red arrow. This breakdown indicates a shift in market control from buyers to sellers, leading to a sharp price rejection and initiating a short-term downtrend. The decline pushes $ETH down to lows of approximately $2,390, a retracement of over 5% from the local high. Interestingly, following the breakdown, the chart shows signs of short-term recovery, with buyers stepping in around the $2,400 support zone. A green candle appears near July 2, indicating a potential relief bounce or dead cat bounce. However, unless Ethereum reclaims the $2,470–$2,600 zone convincingly, this move may be short-lived. In summary, Ethereum has exhibited a textbook rounded top breakdown, and caution is advised unless a strong recovery invalidates this bearish setup.

The U.S. M2 money supply recently soared to an unprecedented $21.94 trillion in May, a figure that on the surface might signal robust economic growth. Yet, for the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, particularly the Bitcoin outlook , this record surge introduces a complex web of signals. Are we witnessing the fuel for a new bull run, or is this a precursor to economic headwinds that could challenge even the most resilient digital assets? Let’s unpack this critical development and understand its profound implications. What is the U.S. M2 Money Supply and Why Does its Record High Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving into Bitcoin’s fate, it’s essential to grasp what the M2 money supply actually represents. In simple terms, M2 is a broad measure of the total amount of money circulating in an economy. It includes: M1: All physical cash (currency), checking accounts, and traveler’s checks. Savings Deposits: Money held in savings accounts. Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs): Interest-bearing accounts offered by banks. Small-Denomination Time Deposits: Certificates of Deposit (CDs) under $100,000. Retail Money Market Mutual Funds: Funds that invest in short-term debt instruments. The recent jump to $21.94 trillion isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of significant monetary expansion. This growth has largely been fueled by aggressive quantitative easing (QE) programs and massive government stimulus measures implemented during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Federal Reserve buys bonds and injects liquidity into the banking system, and when governments send out stimulus checks, the M2 money supply naturally expands. For the Bitcoin outlook , a rising M2 money supply presents a fascinating dichotomy. On one hand, an abundance of liquidity in the financial system can lead to a ‘search for yield.’ With more money chasing investment opportunities, some of it inevitably flows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This influx of capital can drive up demand and prices. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has historically been seen by some as a hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies, a narrative that gains traction when the money supply expands rapidly. However, there’s another side to this coin, one that sparks considerable inflation concerns and complicates the macroeconomic landscape for digital assets. Bitcoin Outlook : The Dual-Edged Sword of Liquidity and Inflation Concerns The current macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin is a delicate balance between the potential benefits of increased liquidity and the looming threat of inflation. Let’s explore this push and pull: The Bullish Case: Liquidity and the Search for Yield When there’s a flood of money in the system, traditional safe havens like bonds might offer low returns. This can push investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, with their potential for outsized gains, often become attractive targets. This ‘risk-on’ sentiment is fueled by easy money policies, which reduce borrowing costs and encourage speculative investments. In this scenario, Bitcoin could theoretically benefit from the sheer volume of capital looking for a home, seeing its price ascend as more dollars chase a finite supply of digital assets. The Bearish Case: Inflation Concerns and Economic Headwinds Conversely, a rapid expansion of the money supply, if not met by a proportional increase in goods and services, can lead to inflation. Simply put, ‘too much money chasing too few goods’ drives up prices. This erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies and can create economic instability. While some proponents argue Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, its performance during recent inflationary periods has been mixed, often correlating more with technology stocks than traditional safe-havens like gold. This challenges the narrative that Bitcoin is a pure inflation hedge, especially in the short to medium term. The crucial question for the Bitcoin outlook then becomes: which force will dominate? Will the liquidity narrative prevail, pushing prices higher, or will escalating inflation concerns compel central banks to adopt policies that dampen speculative appetite? Navigating Inflation Concerns : How Does It Complicate the Fed Rate Cuts Narrative? The Federal Reserve, often referred to simply as ‘the Fed,’ has a dual mandate: to maintain maximum employment and ensure price stability (i.e., control inflation). When the M2 money supply grows at a record pace, it naturally raises alarms about potential inflation. If inflation becomes entrenched, the Fed is compelled to act. Historically, the Fed’s primary tool to combat inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows down economic activity, reduces demand, and ideally brings inflation back under control. However, this is where the plot thickens for the broader crypto market and the economy at large. For months, financial markets have been eagerly anticipating Fed rate cuts . The expectation was that as inflation cooled, the Fed would lower rates to stimulate economic growth, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment. This dovish stance is generally seen as positive for risk assets like Bitcoin, as lower rates reduce the appeal of ‘safer’ investments and make speculative ventures more attractive. However, continued robust growth in the M2 money supply throws a wrench into these expectations. Analysts warn that if this trend persists, it could put immense pressure on the Fed to reconsider its stance on easing. Instead of cutting rates, the Fed might be forced to: Maintain current high interest rates for longer: This ‘higher for longer’ scenario can starve risk assets of liquidity and make traditional investments more appealing. Even raise rates further: In a worst-case scenario, if inflation proves stickier than anticipated due to excess liquidity, the Fed might have no choice but to implement additional rate hikes, a move that would likely send shockwaves through the crypto market . Such a hawkish pivot by the Fed would significantly alter the investment landscape, making the cost of capital higher and reducing the speculative appetite that often fuels cryptocurrency booms. What Does Continued Money Supply Growth Mean for Future Fed Rate Cuts and the Crypto Market? The interplay between M2 money supply, inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions is crucial for understanding the immediate and long-term trajectory of the crypto market . Here’s a breakdown of the potential scenarios: Scenario 1: Inflationary Pressures Mount, Fed Stays Hawkish If the record M2 money supply indeed translates into persistent, high inflation, the Fed’s hands will be tied. They would prioritize price stability, meaning Fed rate cuts would be off the table, and even rate hikes could be on the horizon. In this environment, the crypto market would likely face significant headwinds. Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of less risky assets (like U.S. Treasury bonds), making speculative assets less appealing. Borrowing costs for crypto businesses and investors also rise, potentially stifling innovation and investment within the sector. Scenario 2: M2 Growth Decouples from Inflation, Fed Eases It’s possible that the increased M2 supply doesn’t translate into runaway inflation due to other economic factors (e.g., increased productivity, supply chain normalization). In this more optimistic scenario, the Fed might find room to implement Fed rate cuts , stimulating economic growth and potentially fueling a ‘risk-on’ environment. This would be highly beneficial for the crypto market , as cheaper money tends to flow into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Scenario 3: Stagflation Concerns A more challenging scenario involves ‘stagflation’ – a period of high inflation coupled with stagnant economic growth. This is particularly difficult for central banks to manage. If the record M2 money supply leads to persistent inflation but the economy struggles to grow, the Fed would be in a bind, with limited tools to address both issues simultaneously. Such an environment would likely create significant uncertainty and volatility across all markets, including the crypto market . The current consensus among many analysts is that the record M2 growth complicates the path to rate cuts. The Fed will be closely watching inflation data, employment figures, and, indeed, money supply metrics to inform its decisions. Any indication that the money supply is fueling unsustainable price increases will likely result in a more hawkish stance, putting a damper on the broader crypto market ‘s aspirations for a swift recovery fueled by monetary easing. Beyond Bitcoin: Broader Implications for the Crypto Market and Investor Sentiment While Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire digital asset space, the macroeconomic shifts driven by the U.S. M2 money supply and the Federal Reserve’s response have far-reaching implications for the entire crypto market . Altcoins, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and other emerging sectors are often more sensitive to changes in liquidity and investor sentiment than Bitcoin itself. Impact on Altcoins and DeFi Altcoins, which typically exhibit higher volatility than Bitcoin, are particularly vulnerable during periods of economic uncertainty or tightening monetary policy. When capital becomes scarcer or more expensive, investors tend to retreat from riskier assets, and altcoins often see sharper declines than Bitcoin. Similarly, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, which relies heavily on liquidity and accessible capital, could face headwinds if interest rates remain high or rise further, making borrowing more expensive and reducing the attractiveness of yield-generating strategies. Institutional Adoption and Retail Sentiment The macroeconomic environment also heavily influences institutional interest in crypto. Large institutional investors often have strict risk management frameworks and are more sensitive to traditional financial market indicators. A hawkish Fed or persistent inflation concerns might lead them to delay or reduce their crypto allocations, preferring more stable assets. Retail investor sentiment, while sometimes driven by hype, is also ultimately influenced by broader economic conditions. A tightening economy or a challenging job market can reduce discretionary income available for speculative investments, impacting overall demand in the crypto market . Key Challenges and Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Navigating the current landscape, with record money supply figures and uncertain central bank policy, presents both challenges and opportunities for crypto investors. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed decisions. Key Challenges: Macroeconomic Volatility: The crypto market is increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, making it susceptible to shifts in interest rates, inflation, and broader economic sentiment. Uncertainty in Fed Policy: The Fed’s reaction to persistent money supply growth and inflation is unpredictable, leading to potential sudden market movements. Correlation with Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s tendency to correlate with tech stocks means it may struggle in an environment where investors shun risk. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Economic Currents: Stay Informed: Regularly monitor key economic indicators such as the U.S. M2 money supply, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), employment data, and Federal Reserve statements. Understanding these trends will help you anticipate potential market shifts. Practice Risk Management: Given the heightened uncertainty, employ robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio (both within crypto and across different asset classes), and only investing what you can afford to lose. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of macroeconomic uncertainty, projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, robust technology, and active development communities tend to be more resilient. Researching the underlying value proposition of crypto assets becomes even more critical. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unnerving, a long-term investment horizon can help weather market fluctuations. Bitcoin’s underlying technology and increasing adoption continue to evolve, regardless of short-term economic headwinds. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Economic Frontier The record surge in the U.S. M2 money supply to nearly $22 trillion is a significant economic event, sending ripples of both hope and concern across financial markets, especially for the Bitcoin outlook . While the sheer volume of liquidity could theoretically boost demand for risk assets like Bitcoin, it simultaneously fuels potent inflation concerns that could compel the Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish stance. The delicate balance between encouraging economic growth and combating inflation means that previously anticipated Fed rate cuts might be delayed or even reversed, creating a challenging environment for the entire crypto market . Investors must remain vigilant, understanding that Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space are no longer isolated from traditional macroeconomic forces. The interplay of money supply, inflation, and central bank policy will be critical determinants of market sentiment and price action in the coming months. By staying informed and adopting prudent investment strategies, participants can better navigate these perilous, yet potentially rewarding, economic currents.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-price-is-ready-to-send-heres-the-significance/,"XRP appears poised for a potentially explosive move , with prominent crypto analyst Crypto Gordon signaling a major breakout on the horizon. In a recent post on X, Gordon drew attention to a tightening wedge formation on XRP’s daily chart, remarking, “The tighter the wedge, the more explosive the breakout. XRP is looking primed to SEND.” As the token trades around $2.18, this setup has stirred renewed interest and optimism among traders and analysts who see this as a crucial inflection point. The Wedge Pattern: A Ticking Time Bomb The technical structure highlighted by Gordon is a classic falling wedge, a pattern typically viewed as bullish when it appears after a rally. This pattern is characterized by a narrowing range between declining resistance and relatively steady support, creating a coil-like effect. As the wedge tightens, it signals that price volatility is compressing, often preceding a sharp breakout. XRP’s current wedge has been developing for several weeks, consolidating between $2.03 and $2.30. With each retest of support and resistance, the market has grown increasingly compressed, setting the stage for an imminent resolution. The tighter the wedge, the more explosive the breakout. $XRP is looking primed to SEND. pic.twitter.com/8NsNqCMVDL — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 1, 2025 According to Gordon and other analysts, the longer this compression continues, the stronger the eventual breakout is likely to be. This theory is backed by historical price action across various assets that tend to behave similarly when trapped in such formations. Technical Indicators and Market Momentum Beyond the visible wedge, several indicators are aligning in favor of a bullish breakout . XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) remains in a neutral zone, suggesting there is still room for upside without the risk of being overbought. Momentum indicators like the MACD are also beginning to turn upward, hinting at a possible shift in sentiment. On-chain metrics further strengthen this outlook. Open interest on XRP derivatives has been rising, signaling increased trader activity and positioning ahead of a major move. Network activity is also climbing, with a noticeable uptick in daily active addresses and transaction volume, both of which point to growing engagement across the XRP Ledger. Whales have also been accumulating, a behavior often associated with the anticipation of positive price movement. These large holders tend to move early, adding credibility to the bullish thesis. Combined with relatively stable funding rates across major exchanges, the setup suggests a market leaning cautiously bullish rather than euphorically speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s at Stake: Key Price Levels and Market Reactions Should XRP break above the upper bound of its wedge near $2.30 with strong volume, analysts forecast a swift move toward the $2.70 to $3.00 range. This level marks both a psychological threshold and the upper boundary of the previous major resistance zone. A successful breakout could reignite long-dormant bullish momentum, pushing XRP into new multi-year highs. However, if XRP fails to hold above support near $2.03 and instead breaks down, the market could see a retracement toward the $1.70 region. Such a move would invalidate the bullish wedge and likely shake out overleveraged long positions. As always, volume and confirmation remain key; without both, a breakout could prove to be a false signal. Why Gordon’s Warning Matters Now Crypto Gordon’s call stands out not just for its technical insight but also for its timing. At $2.18, XRP is trading at the midpoint of its wedge, tightening with every passing day. The convergence of technical compression, rising network activity, and trader positioning underscores the likelihood of an imminent directional move. Gordon’s statement that XRP is “primed to SEND” captures a widely shared sentiment in the market. If the breakout materializes, it could usher in a decisive new phase for XRP, possibly driving it toward long-awaited price milestones. For now, the market watches and waits for the wedge to snap.

The dispute between Celsius and Tether dates back to a 2022 agreement in which Tether provided USDT to Celsius, which sent Bitcoin (BTC) as collateral. Tether argues that Celsius is attempting to shift the blame for his own financial mismanagement onto Tether by requesting the return of approximately $2.4 billion worth of BTC (as of the date of the lawsuit), despite the liquidation being carried out at his direction and with his consent. While the case is ongoing, the US bankruptcy court allowed Celsius’ $4 billion (the current value of BTCs) BTC liquidation lawsuit against Tether to continue. At this point, the US bankruptcy judge rejected significant parts of Tether’s motion to dismiss the case and related motions. The judge also rejected Tether’s motion to dismiss the case. Celsius alleges in the lawsuit that Tether improperly liquidated more than 39,500 BTC during the crypto lender’s collapse in 2022, violating contract terms and U.S. bankruptcy law. Celsius alleges that Tether panic-sold bitcoins before the required legal deadline, selling them for less than their value and without Celsius’ approval. *This is not investment advice.

Open interest in perpetual futures listed on offshore exchanges rose by nearly 10% to $26.91 billion, the highest single-day increase since March 2, according to data source Velo. The data tracking website included activity in USD and USDT-denominated perpetuals listed on Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, and Hyperliquid. Open interest refers to the number of active or open contracts, often expressed in terms of their cumulative dollar-denominated value. An uptick in open interest alongside a price rise is said to confirm the uptrend. BTC's price surged over 3.5% to $109,600 due to a host of factors, including the disappointing U.S. ADP jobs report, which strengthened calls for Fed rate cuts, Trump's trade deal with Vietnam, and the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK). Furthermore, the perpetual funding rates of BTC and ETH rose slightly from an annualized 5% to over 7%, suggesting renewed demand for leveraged bullish plays.

This is a new tool designed to provide fast and easy cross-chain liquidity for USDC users, with over $219 billion in trading volume . This initiative aims to enhance the transfer of digital money across various blockchain networks. Gateway to Make USDC Access Seamless Across Blockchains During the announcement , Circle explained that it is hard for users today to use USDC across different blockchains. Users typically rely on third-party bridges to transfer their money, which can be slow, expensive, and sometimes unsafe. For crypto businesses, supporting multiple blockchains means locking up a significant amount of capital and utilizing it inefficiently. To solve this problem, Circle is launching Gateway, a new system that allows users to maintain a single USDC balance. This balance can be used instantly across all supported blockchains. Users just need to deposit their USDC into a non-custodial smart contract. With that one deposit, users can access their funds instantly on any supported network. This eliminates the need to transfer tokens between chains manually or rely on external bridges. Circle said this initiative is designed to make USDC more universal, instant, and easy to use, regardless of the network being used. Gateway Coming Soon to Major Blockchains Circle said that Gateway is more than just a regular feature; it is a new interoperability layer. This means it acts as a system that helps different blockchains work together more efficiently, especially for stablecoin users. This new system is designed to help developers and businesses build apps more easily, send payments faster, and enhance the user experience. Circle plans to launch Gateway in July, starting with test networks on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Base. More blockchains will be added later, depending on demand and their readiness. Circle Sees Fast Growth After Going Public This new product comes shortly after Circle’s successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) , marking a significant step forward for the company. After the listing, Circle’s market capitalization jumped to over $46 billion. Additionally, its stock price increased by more than 500% from its original offering price of $31 per share, surpassing its market value of $62 billion. This new valuation now exceeds its USDC stablecoin circulating supply.. After its successful IPO event, Circle made another big move. Most recently, the company applied for a national banking license in the United States. If approved, this license will let Circle hold its reserves and manage crypto assets for large businesses. This would enable Circle to operate more like a traditional bank while still utilizing blockchain technology. It also demonstrates the company’s goal to integrate traditional finance with the rapidly growing digital economy.

This opens the door for real-world merchants and apps to begin integrating Pi without facing infrastructure or regulatory hurdles, addressing the ecosystem’s ongoing struggle with adoption. PI coin price action remains vulnerable to short-term speculative trading, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. “This could be the strongest signal yet that Pi Network is preparing for real-world adoption and mass usage,” PI community member JoJo-π wrote on X .

The $0.475 local bottom—formed during the “buy-the-rumour” run-up to Pi2Day—has held firm as a key support zone, with a successful bounce reaffirming bullish sentiment. Momentum indicators suggest this may be the early emergence of a new uptrend. The MACD has formed a golden cross, climbing above the signal line for the first time since Pi2Day More so, the RSI has rebounded sharply from oversold territory, rising from 26 to 38, suggesting renewed buyer interest as sellers show signs of exhaustion. This has resulted in the breakout of a falling wedge, setting sights on a technical PI coin price target near $0.60 in line with the 0.618 Fibonacci level—a 20% gain from current levels. Looking ahead, further upside could be catalyzed by exchange listings or the development of new dApps leveraging the integration, offering scope for a more sustained price recovery. Large Gains Remain Distant – This Tool Makes Them Quick While this is a step in the right direction for Pi Network, a real long-term price impact remains largely speculative. Since its early-year mainnet launch, those who haven’t cashed out have spent months waiting and grappling with unrealised losses. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd, where the real gains are made. While trading bots are not a new concept, Snorter has been designed specifically for sniping with limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and even rug-pull protection. It’s one thing to get in first, it’s another thing to know when to sell—Snorter Bot can help. The project is off to a strong start— $SNORT has already raised almost $1.35 million in its first month of presale , likely driven by its high 236% APY on staking to rewards early investors.

Crypto as a whole is down by 2% in the past 24 hours, with prices depressed by the looming US tariff deadline next week, although markets are becoming more hopeful about rate cuts . As for XRP, it holds on to a modest 1% gain in a week and a 1.5% increase in the past month, although news has emerged which suggests that these percentages could increase soon . On the one hand, analysts are giving odds of 95% that XRP ETFs will gain approval, while Ripple itself has just announced the launch of an Ethereum-compatible sidechain, something which could boost usage of XRP Ledger in the longer term. XRP Price Prediction – 95% ETF Approval Odds + XRPL EVM Launch: Could XRP Hit $1,000? A couple of days ago, Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart posted ETF approval odds for various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Litecoin, Solana, Dogecoin and Cardano (among others). As we can see below, XRP is at the top of this lift (along with LTC and SOL), with a 95% chance of approval. Here are mine and @EricBalchunas ' most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025. We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025. pic.twitter.com/H3pxJhqMy3 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 As of writing, ten XRP ETF applications are awaiting evaluation, including offerings from Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares and Canary. The deadline for many of these applications currently falls in October, meaning that the XRP price could have a big boost come the final quarter of the year. Yet it has also received another boost this week, with Ripple announcing the launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain , which will bring Ethereum-comptible apps and smart contracts to XRP Ledger. While this launch could be hugely beneficial for XRP in the future, it doesn’t seem to have had much effect on the XRP price today. Source: TradingView Looking at its chart, we see that it’s on the brink of regaining momentum, after a period of overselling. Its relative strength index (purple) has just crossed 50 after several weeks below this level, while its MACD (orange, blue) looks like it’s ready to turn positive again. Now may therefore be a good time to buy XRP, with the latest CoinShares data showing that institutions have been accumulating the coin over the past week. Indeed, XRP is the third-most-purchased coin this week, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, while we have also seen Ripple locking up huge amounts of the coin in escrow over the past few days. 300,000,000 #XRP (659,823,326 USD) locked in escrow at #Ripple https://t.co/0zwzmffBHb — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) July 2, 2025 Assuming that XRP ETFs do gain approval, we could therefore see the XRP price reach $2.50 again in the next few weeks, before ending the year close to $4. And if institutional adoption accelerates — particularly with Ripple expanding cross-border payment solutions and stablecoin infrastructure — XRP could be on a long-term trajectory toward $1,000 , as it captures a larger share of global liquidity flows in the years ahead. TOKEN6900 Kicks Off Presale: Is This the Next 1000x Meme Token? As strong as XRP looks at the moment, it won’t be the only token to enjoy big rallies in the latter stages of the year. It will also receive competition from a range of newer tokens, including presale coins about to list for the first time. One of these is TOKEN6900 (T6900), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that launched its ICO earlier this week. TOKEN6900 RAISED $100K MFS pic.twitter.com/rljPotxPRm — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 2, 2025 TOKEN6900 has already raised $100,000 in its sale, with the coin adopting a viral marketing campaign full of memes riffing on the late 90s and early 2000s. In contrast to meme coins and alts that position themselves as having utility and strong fundamentals, TOKEN6900 is taking the opposite approach, declaring on its website that it’s “not built on fundamentals.” It’s simply aiming to become the next viral meme token, one which generates enough attention and momentum to rally strongly when it lists later in the year. As a token, it will have a max supply of 930,993,091 T6900, with its presale having a hard cap of $5 million. Holders will be able to stake the coin, but other than that the coin is making a boast of having no utility whatsoever. Investors intrigued by the coin can go to the TOKEN6900 website to participate in the presale, with T6900 currently available at $0.006425. This will rise again in under two days, so traders wanting to make the biggest possible gains should act quickly.

Analysts Give Key Insights,https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-bitcoins-price-reach-its-top-this-cycle-analysts-give-key-insights/,"Long-term Bitcoin holders are seeing their unrealized profits decline even as BTC trades a little over 4% from its all-time highs. According to on-chain data shared by CryptoQuant, the average unrealized profit for long-term holders, based on the MVRV ratio, is around 220%. The figure is notable but lower than the 300% and 350% levels seen during the March and December 2024 market peaks. LTH Profits Slide The realized price for long-term holders now stands at $39,000, which means that significant gains are still present despite the decline in unrealized profits. Moreover, the current profit levels are similar to those last seen during the October 2024 correction, which further indicates that while BTC remains strong, the market has yet to reach peak profit extremes. To match previous cycle tops, CryptoQuant said that Bitcoin would need to climb toward $140,000, a level many are anticipating. As Bitcoin trades near $107,000, market participants are preparing for a period that has historically brought slower activity and new narratives. According to crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades, the cryptocurrency has entered the third quarter of 2025, a period historically known for slow price action and lower volumes. Summer months typically bring reduced liquidity for both BTC and ETH, which makes Q3 the quietest quarter of the year. However, Daan noted that this slower period often sets the stage for new narratives to emerge, which could present new opportunities ahead for traders. This aligns with Bitfinex experts, who said that the bull run is intact, but expect Q3 to be slower Weaker Momentum? While seasonal patterns are in play, one concerning factor is Bitcoin’s Bull Score, which has moved into neutral territory at 50. The metric gauges market conditions needed to continue a rally, and requires a reading of 60 or higher for upward momentum to continue. As such, a reading of 40 would indicate a bearish environment. The current neutral level suggests that the leading crypto asset lacks sufficient bullish strength to support a sustained price rally at this stage.

It’s raised over $502k in under 24 hours by collapsing one of the most expensive, time-sucking creative industries into something much faster. Block3 raised this figure on the strength of one idea: shrink game development from years to seconds. Its AI engine, built on a custom foundation model called Trinity, turns plain English into fully playable 3D games.. The $244 billion AI surge is colliding with the $522 billion gaming industry, and Block3 is the fusion point. The BL3 token is how this new entertainment economy runs. Block3: Prompt once, play forever For the first time in gaming history, the player becomes the platform. In gaming, the bottleneck has never been a lack of imagination but rather production. Turning a brilliant idea into a working game usually takes dozens of people, years of work, and millions in funding. Block3 erases that gap in one move. Block3 replaces artists, developers, and level designers with a specialized AI system trained to understand what a game is and how it should play. Users type in their prompt, and it builds the entire experience in seconds: visuals, controls, objectives, soundtrack, everything. Traditional studios need three years and $100M to ship one title. Block3’s Trinity could ship a trillion games in the same time, thanks to its generative AI, which is infinitely scalable. The game industry’s bottleneck just evaporated. Why Block3 is the retail entry point into the AI-Gaming explosion The market just voted with $502k in 24 hours: AI gaming is the next melt-up. The delta between production cost and consumer expectation has never been wider. BL3, the native asset powering everything from AI model training to creator monetization, becomes an instant liquidity magnet, not for what it is, but for what it breaks. Investors are flooding into the $522B market as legacy studios collapse under their cost structures. The market is ballooning, but with Block3, the weight is shifting away from legacy studios toward a nimble, modular platform that scales with data, not with payroll. While most companies rely on legacy incumbents to implement AI, Block3 has built its foundation on AI. BL3 is the only asset that gives direct exposure to the upstream layer of AI-generated content: the moment where raw imagination becomes a playable product. BL3: The only token that lets retail own the engine The BL3 token underpins every layer of the ecosystem: from paying creators for prompt-generated games to training Trinity to monetizing every transaction inside the unlimited Game Library. In just 24 hours, Block3 raised $502k at only $0.01, proving pent-up demand for direct exposure to the AI gaming trade. The presale is structured across 30 stages, with the token price increasing 5% at each stage. Those who entered in Stage 1 will have already gained more than 3x before launch. Countdown to the collapse of the studio model: Block3 presale is now live Block3 eliminates the legacy scaffolding and replaces it with a direct interface: language in, game out. This is the moment when the game industry’s gates broke, and creativity flooded in. Meanwhile, gaming is starved for scalable content. Big Tech is bloated, legacy studios are irrelevant, and the market is begging for pure AI gaming exposure. Think of it like this: Instead of betting on a specific game or company, investors are betting on people’s ability to come up with cool, imaginative ideas for games. It’s like investing in “creativity” as a whole concept.

According to a new report by Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research, this summer could be as quiet as previous years. Recalling that July is a volatile period in the US, referred to as the “Trump trade,” Lunde drew attention to important agenda items such as the budget bill, resumption of tariff decisions, and crypto-related executive order calendars. However, despite all these potential price movements, past Julys were also notable for low-volume trading periods. “In July 2022, Three Arrows Capital and Celsius went bankrupt. Last year, there were events such as the assassination attempt on Trump and Biden's resignation. During the same period, BTC distributions from Mt. Gox and sales by the German government put pressure on the market. Despite all this, the second lowest monthly trading volume in the last four years was seen in July,” Lunde said, adding that the market went into a kind of “sleep” in the summer months.

July 4: The “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget bill, which President Trump is expected to sign and could increase the U.S. budget deficit to $3.3 trillion, could come into effect. This could have a short-term positive impact on digital assets such as Bitcoin, which are limited in supply. July 9: 90-day tariff moratorium ends. Trump is expected to take new trade measures against certain countries. This could put pressure on markets. July 22: Final assessment and proposal submission date for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), which was signed in March and planned to be created with approximately 200,000 BTC (approximately $21 billion) of US seized crypto assets. The fact that details about this reserve have not been shared with the public since March increases uncertainty. Lunde warned investors that an announcement could be made on this issue at any time. Although Bitcoin is only 3% off its all-time high, funding rates, leveraged ETF exposures, trading volumes and options data reflect a cautious market stance, a factor that reduces the risk of sudden liquidations in potential uptrends, according to Lunde. “It may seem lazy to assume that this summer will be as quiet as previous years. But my current base case is that nothing new is happening. So the best strategy is to remain patient and hold onto existing positions,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation hovered around $3.4 trillion, showing little directional bias. Bitcoin briefly retreated to $105,560 during early Asian hours after failing to clear resistance the previous day, while the Crypto Fear & Greed Index edged down to 63, still in the “Greed” zone but reflecting a slight dip in sentiment. Altcoins fared no better, with most managing to pull off modest single-digit gains as of late Asian trading hours on July 2. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin powered past the previous resistance zone of $108,000 as the general market sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on all imports from Vietnam to the US. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin has been stuck between a narrow trading range of $105,430 – $108,706 as traders awaited a potential catalyst to break the deadlock. Some of the caution was warranted, as a series of high-impact US economic data releases are scheduled this week, keeping risk appetite in check. The tone was set by the ADP private payrolls report released on Wednesday, which showed a surprise decline of 33,000 jobs in June, which marked the first monthly contraction in two years and sharply missed market expectations for a 90,000–100,000 gain. The weakness, particularly in services and professional sectors, raised concerns over the strength of the US labour market and added to fears of a broader economic slowdown. Bitcoin briefly spiked following the ADP print, pushing toward the upper end of its range near $108,000 as traders speculated on a more dovish Fed response. Investors are now bracing for the official non-farm payrolls data due on Thursday, which is expected to confirm the cooling trend in employment. Forecasts suggest around 110,000–120,000 new jobs added in June, with the unemployment rate seen ticking up to 4.3%. The market will also be watching the ISM services PMI and the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for further clues on the Fed’s policy direction. There’s also the looming July 9 deadline for the White House’s tariff decision, which could reintroduce volatility across risk assets if trade tensions escalate. Until there’s more clarity on the macro front, traders are likely to remain sidelined. Further weighing on sentiment, US spot Bitcoin ETFs ended a 15-day inflow streak on Tuesday with $342.2 million in net outflows. This marked the first sign of institutional pullback after over $4.7 billion poured in since June 9, and retail traders often view this as a bearish sign. Signs of fading risk appetite were also noticeable across derivatives markets, with the BTC Binance futures premiums falling to a 21-month low of 3.9% today. Will Bitcoin go up? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at just 3.5% below its all-time high, which means the broader bullish structure remains intact. When looking at the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap, a significant cluster of liquidation interest remains concentrated just above the $105,000 level. Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap. Source: Coinglass. To the upside, the heatmap shows a dense buildup of short liquidation levels between $107,800 and $109,000. As such, Bitcoin must decisively break and hold above $109,000 to unlock further upside and trigger a liquidation cascade that could fuel a breakout rally. In the meantime, on X, most market commentators were expecting a retest of all-time highs soon. See below.

According to pseudonymous analyst StefanB, if Bitcoin fails to maintain strength above $108,900, a level he marks as a key short-term pivot, the current rally could turn into a deviation. 4-hour BTC/USDT perpetual contract chart. Source: StefanB In that case, a rejection from this zone may set the stage for a deeper pullback, with downside targets extending toward $102,000 as liquidity below recent lows gets exposed. Altcoin market The total market cap of all altcoins rose 3.2% to $1.29 trillion over the past day. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index at 22 means much of the action is limited to Bitcoin, which remains the dominant market force at the time. Large-cap altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) saw gains ranging between 1 and 5%. Meanwhile, Celestia, Sonic, and SPX6900 led gains, rising 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.5% respectively. See below: Source: CoinMarketCap Celestia: TIA printed modest gains late in the day after Celestia’s latest mainnet upgrade, Lotus, was successfully deployed on the Mocha testnet. The Lotus upgrade has reportedly improved the network’s interoperability and reduced inflation, both of which bode well when it comes to investor sentiment. Sonic: While no major catalysts could be identified at press time, gains for S seem to be supported by the launch of new merchandise in partnership with Formula 1 star Pierre Gasly.

Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV’s $624 billion in total assets — IBIT’s higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world’s largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly. While IBIT’s management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.",Markets|Bitcoin ETF|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-02 17:29:49

A new wave of altcoins is drawing investor focus, not with headlines, but with traction. Leading that charge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 DeFi upstart gaining speed fast enough to put legacy tokens on notice. Buyers who invest at this moment will see 100% returns on investment as soon as the token gets listed. Over $11.4 million has been raised so far, and there are over 12,600 early investors. By the time the presale reaches Phase 6, the token price will be at $0.035, a 16.67% immediate return on any stage 5 investment. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, continues its recovery path, stable, scalable, and favored by builders, making it a solid if more measured play. But as summer liquidity builds and market sentiment shifts, the real upside appears to be with Mutuum Finance. Solana’s Edge Over Bitcoin This Summer Solana (SOL) is currently trading $150, and its DeFi and the app ecosystem is growing ambitious fast. It is also making an impact in the institutions: U.S. banks have been collaborating with Solana, and a potential launch of Solana-focused ETFs presupposes further penetration of the mainstream. Bitcoin (BTC), at about $107,385, still has a tight range, with the wind of the ETF now following it, yet developments in the Solana environment and developer activity continue to lead indicators that the asset is yet set to perform better than Bitcoin this summer. Comparisons to legacy assets notwithstanding, when positioned against BTC, Solana is more of an apples to oranges task in proving valuable enough to trade in, this as all eyes remain on other emerging coins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Disrupts DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending with a platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. There are also the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the users to agree on terms among themselves. This direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early traction and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also organizing a huge $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners from the early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be rewarded. As the users climb the ranks they will be rewarded in bonus tokens token holding fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and bootstraps ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long-Term Built, Audited, and Now Backed by $50K Bug Bounty Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into measurable credibility. A rigorous smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most trusted security firms, has confirmed that the codebase meets high standards for transparency and safety, offering assurance to both investors and users. To further shore up its ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an Ethereum-based fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to USD. In contrast to the algorithmic models, which are susceptible to depegging, the current stablecoin is programmed to launch long-lasting liquidity, stability, and dependability to the retail and institutional users. Bitcoin grabs attention, but real gains may lie elsewhere. Solana shows steady growth, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight, $11.4M raised, 100% ROI locked in for Phase 5 buyers, and major traction in DeFi.

The legislation, referred to by Trump as the “big, beautiful bill,” is at the epicenter of a battle from within the Republican Party. Most GOP lawmakers had fallen in line after a White House pressure campaign, but a faction of House Republicans now threatens to block the bill unless significant changes are made. The lawmakers are seemingly putting the POTUS’s supposed timeline to pass the legislation in jeopardy before the July 4 holiday. Freedom caucus members demand bill amendments Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus were among the first to join the opposition. Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina, who voted against the procedural rule in committee early Wednesday, confirmed he was heading to the White House along with other Freedom Caucus members. The group has issues with the Senate’s version of the bill, which they claim veers away from the spending offsets previously agreed upon in the House. Chairman Andy Harris of Maryland told reporters that without revisions, the group would oppose the procedural vote needed to advance the bill to debate. “ Hopefully it goes back to Rules, gets moved closer to the House position, and the Senate gets called back into town, ” Harris remarked. He was not in support of the Senate’s decision to adjourn, adding that President Trump had asked lawmakers to stay put in Washington until the legislation was resolved. Despite their objections, Republican leadership has been reluctant to make any revisions to the Senate-passed bill. GOP sources told The Hill that the proposed law has some compromises, but it is more similar to the version the House previously approved. Harris insisted that he would not fall in line with the White House pressure, saying, “The White House doesn’t have a voting card.” Speaker Johnson is ‘talking’ to the divided GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson met with a group of conservative lawmakers Wednesday morning, including several Freedom Caucus members. Heading into the meeting, he told reporters, “We gotta get this done.” After more than 40 minutes, Johnson described the session as “productive” but declined to confirm if the House would proceed with the vote as scheduled. “We’ll see,” he said. “ The best thing is to send the bill back to the Senate ,” Norman said, rejecting any promises of future reforms. “ I’m done with promises… it’s what the president wants. ”. Moderate Republicans like Representatives Mike Lawler of New York, David Valadao of California, and Dan Newhouse of Washington were seen entering the West Wing Wednesday morning. These centrists are uneasy about proposed Medicaid cuts and the rollback of green energy tax credits, policies that could directly impact their districts. Over the weekend, Valadao, whose district in California’s Central Valley is a dependent of Medicaid, reckoned that he could not support a final version that slashes provider taxes and funding that is imperative to the state’s hospitals. “ I support the reasonable provisions in H.R. 1… but I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams ,” he said in a Saturday statement. He reminded his colleagues that Trump had fronted the idea of eliminating waste and fraud, without harming Medicaid. Valadao and Newhouse are the only two House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot, and are against the tax and spending bill.

The Truth Unveiled,https://coinpaper.com/9783/did-elon-musk-really-invest-104-b-in-xrp-the-truth-unveiled,"In the world of crypto, few names generate as much interest—or confusion—as Elon Musk. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Musk's Twitter posts have notoriously sent cryptocurrencies soaring or crashing, and his public musings about Bitcoin and Dogecoin are the stuff of legend. But in June of 2025, a new wave of speculation washed over the crypto space: that Musk would be investing a whopping $104 billion into Ripple's XRP. The news spread like wildfire, causing people to discuss it, causing prices to fluctuate, and creating a flurry of social media posts. But is this rumor genuine, or is this yet another example of crypto's rumor mill gone wild? The Beginning of the Musk-XRP Rumor The latest craziness began when certain crypto news aggregators and social handles started sharing headlines asserting Elon Musk wasn't just interested in XRP, but was going to invest a mind-boggling $104 billion in the token. Others even cited ”insider sources” or stated leaked documents suggested Musk's intention to use XRP as the basis for his payment strategies on X (formerly Twitter) or Tesla. Musk rumors are discredited fact-checked by reputable crypto news outlets shortly after. There is no such valid information, Crypto Times says, that Musk plans or has invested in XRP. The $104 billion, in particular, appears to be a hoax, most likely stemming from previous speculations or misinterpreted tweets. “There is no official confirmation, filing, or credible report that Elon Musk is investing $104 billion—or any sum remotely close—into Ripple’s XRP.” — Crypto Times, June 2025 Why Do Musk Rumors Move Markets? Elon Musk's influence on crypto markets is the stuff of legend. His tweets about Bitcoin's energy usage, to mention just one example, have wiped out billions in market cap overnight. His fondness for Dogecoin turned a meme coin mainstream. So when rumor associates Musk with a new token or initiative, traders and bots react instinctively, sometimes before verifying the information. The XRP rumour was not unique. Within hours, #ElonMuskXRP was trending on Twitter, and leveraged trading volume exploded. Some XRP traders were celebrating, while others insisted on a normal ”buy the rumor, sell the news.” Fact Check: What's Actually True? No Official Investment : No SEC filing, company press release, or credible source confirms any Musk investment in XRP. No Public Endorsement : Elon Musk has never tweeted about XRP, nor has he publicly endorsed Ripple or its token anywhere in recent history. Viral Rumor Misinformation : The $104B figure also appears to be recycled rumor fuel, promoted by social media algorithms and clickbait headlines. Crypto Times and other mainstream publications enhance the importance of skepticism and research, especially when rumors involve celebrity figures like Musk. Why XRP Still Matters—With or Without Musk Despite the false rumor, XRP remains one of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies on the planet. Ripple's aggressive expansion to grow its On-Demand Liquidity network, achieve regulatory clarity, and work with banks maintains real-world adoption momentum. The Musk rumor, as false as it may be, did serve to highlight just how quickly sentiment can shift—and just how much attention XRP continues to attract. Conclusion The Elon Musk-XRP saga is the ultimate text book demonstration of what happens when rumors, hype, and Twitter converge in crypto. While the idea of a $104 billion investment was great copy, reality—the way it so often does in crypto—was much less dramatic. For investors and hobbyists alike, the lesson is straightforward: make sure to check your facts before you FOMO, and let's face it here, the world of digital assets is one where not everything that's trending is real.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|SPONSORED|BTC|DOGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-02 17:40:49

The blockchain-based payments company has formally applied for a U.S. banking license through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), marking a move that could reshape its operational reach within the financial system. The application, first reported by The Wall Street Journal and shared on X by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, was greeted with excitement by the XRP Army as it signals Ripple’s intent to elevate its regulatory standing. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 XRP Army Reacts The XRP community has responded with enthusiasm to Ripple’s decision to seek a U.S. banking license, viewing it as a defining moment in the company’s evolution. Many supporters see this as further evidence that XRP can become a globally utilized digital asset and power a new financial system. This move positions Ripple to operate alongside traditional banks under federal supervision and comes shortly after the OCC gave banks the green light to engage with cryptocurrencies . For longtime followers, the potential to one day interact directly with a federally licensed “XRP Bank” in the United States is both validating and energizing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 One community member emphasized that Ripple’s growth is becoming more visible, and this banking license application is evidence that the company is building something far more substantial. Another highlighted the prospect of someday using an XRP bank in the U.S., and this license could make that a reality if approved. Ripple CEO Weighs In Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse weighed in on X, reaffirming the company’s commitment to regulatory alignment and infrastructure integrity in his public statement following the banking license announcement. He emphasized that applying for a national bank charter from the OCC reflects Ripple’s long-standing approach to compliance, and if approved, would position Ripple under both federal and state oversight, a regulatory structure that few others in the stablecoin space can claim. Garlinghouse also revealed that Ripple, through its affiliate Standard Custody , has applied for a Federal Reserve master account. This step would allow Ripple to hold RLUSD reserves directly with the Fed, offering a heightened level of security and transparency. The CEO highlighted RLUSD’s design to meet the expectations of a $250 billion market by prioritizing regulation and operational resilience from the outset. Ripple is becoming a trusted institutional partner . This puts XRP and RLUSD at the forefront of a major financial shift.

As of press time, Solana’s market capitalization stood at $81.58 billion, up from $77.63 billion the previous day, an increase of $3.95 billion. The asset’s price is also trending higher, trading at $152.71 after gaining more than 3% on the day and approximately 7% over the past week. Solana one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The bullish momentum was sparked by the launch of the REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF, which officially began trading on July 2 on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This fund is the first Solana-focused ETF in the United States and recorded around $8 million in trading volume within just 20 minutes of its debut, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1940407756051394680 Jointly launched by asset managers REX Shares and Osprey Funds, the ETF provides direct exposure to Solana while also offering staking rewards. Structure of Solana staking ETF Roughly 80% of the fund is allocated to spot SOL holdings, with over half of that amount staked to generate on-chain yield. Investors can expect annual returns of between 7% and 7.3% from the staking portion. The remainder of the ETF’s portfolio includes Solana-linked international products and liquid staking assets, such as JitoSOL. A critical factor behind the ETF’s approval was its legal structure. REX and Osprey established the fund as a C-corporation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing them to navigate around regulatory hurdles that have delayed other crypto-related ETFs. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing additional Solana ETF applications from major financial firms, including VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, and Grayscale. Although none have been approved yet, the SEC has extended its review periods into late July. Analysts now place a 95% chance that at least one Solana ETF will receive regulatory approval before the end of 2025.

The agreement uses an at-the-market (ATM) share issuance structure, allowing Green Minerals to raise funds flexibly over a 12-month period. Flexible Capital Structure to Minimize Dilution The deal includes a put option that lets Green Minerals issue new shares based on market conditions. This provides capital access when needed while helping maintain shareholder value and minimizing unnecessary stock dilution. Meanwhile, LDA Capital receives a call option, enabling it to subscribe for up to 1% of the company’s shares at NOK 6.95 each at any point over the next year. A Strategic Push Toward Bitcoin Accumulation At current market rates, if Green Minerals raises the full $25 million, it could acquire around 232.34 BTC. As of now, the company holds approximately four Bitcoins but aims to significantly expand this figure through targeted funding strategies. BTC is currently recovering, approaching the $107,000 mark with a recent high of $107,724. This aligns with Green Minerals’ bullish stance on Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Leadership Sees Bitcoin as Core to Growth Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl called the LDA deal a “strategic mechanism to fund growth,” emphasizing the importance of flexibility and resilience in a volatile market.

According to the bank’s H2 2025 market outlook, Bitcoin could climb to $135,000 by September 30 and reach $200,000 by the end of December. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, highlighted rising demand from crypto funds and corporate treasuries as major factors. He also cited favorable government policies as a key driver of Bitcoin’s expected growth. Strong Inflows from ETFs and Treasuries Drive Optimism Kendrick pointed out that strong inflows into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and growing interest from companies are now driving Bitcoin’s price. In the second quarter of 2025, spot ETFs and corporate treasuries bought 245,000 BTC. Large companies, excluding those in the Strategy Sector, purchased around 56,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Virginia-based firm added nearly 69,000 BTC during the same period. Kendrick noted that while Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, has slowed its pace, other firms are stepping in to fill the gap. He expects even more crypto assets to be bought in the third quarter than in the second. If his forecast is correct, Bitcoin would gain over $92,000 in just six months, rising from its current price of $107,644. This would mark a record-breaking second-half performance in the cryptocurrency’s 15-year history. Investors Turning to Bitcoin as a Macro Asset Standard Chartered analysts explained that in Q2, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $12.4 billion in assets. This is more than gold ETFs, despite global tensions, especially in the Middle East. Kendrick sees this as a sign that investors are seeing the top coin more seriously as a store of value . He also noted that hedge funds have not significantly increased their short positions. This shows that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Traditionally, Bitcoin peaked around 500 days after its “halving” event and then declined. Kendrick believes that the cycle no longer applies, saying that ETFs and corporate buyers, which did not exist in earlier years, are now driving prices. He noted that long-term holders are likely to sell less in 2025, and continued buying will overpower any selling pressure. Policy Changes That Could Boost Bitcoin Kendrick pointed out possible policy changes that could give Bitcoin an extra push. He said that if President DonaldTrump announces a new Federal Reserve Chair early, it might lead to faster interest rate cuts. This move could raise Bitcoin’s price. Furthermore, if the GENIUS stablecoin bill, which now has bipartisan support , is passed into law soon. This would make dollar-backed tokens more popular and attract more retail investors, which would also help Bitcoin. Kendrick said Bitcoin’s price has followed long-term U.S. bond yields since early 2024 and expects this to continue. Additionally, new 13F filings suggest that big investors, including sovereign wealth funds, are buying Bitcoin. Kendrick expects this buying to increase in the next filings in August, which could push the price higher.

With rising trading volume and mixed technical indicators, the next move could swing either way, keeping the market on edge. RSI Holds Neutral As Bitcoin Awaits A Clearer Signal According to Shaco AI, in a recent update on X, Bitcoin is currently hovering around $107,264.17, positioning itself just above two key moving averages. It’s nudging the 25-day SMA at $107,229.82 and holding slightly above the 50-day SMA, which sits at $107,040.81. This positioning reflects a mild bullish bias in recent sessions, keeping both bulls and bears on alert. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Risks Market Crash After Closing Below Final Weekly Resistance Looking at momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is resting at 53.36—firmly in neutral territory. This suggests that Bitcoin is neither overbought nor oversold at the moment, offering no strong directional clues as it keeps the market guessing. Furthermore, the Average Directional Index (ADX) adds to this indecisive mood, coming in at a soft 20.44. This low reading signals a weak trend, meaning there’s not enough force from bulls or bears to drive a clear breakout just yet. In other words, the market isn’t leaning heavily in either direction. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains in negative territory at -137.33. Although it isn’t signaling any strong downward momentum, traders may want to stay cautious and alert for any sudden shift in the current tone. Despite the technical indecision, market activity is picking up. Bitcoin’s recent trading volume has surged to 1903.51, well above the average of 1522.43. This uptick signals a rise in interest and participation, indicating that traders are actively positioning themselves in anticipation of Bitcoin’s next move. Critical Zones At Play As Market Prepares For A Directional Push Looking at key levels, Shaco AI highlighted that resistance is at $108,789.99, which seems to be a strong level to overcome. The level marks a significant ceiling for Bitcoin, and any attempt to push higher will need solid momentum to break through. On the other hand, support lies at $104,622.02. This support level will be critical in case the price begins to retreat, as a breakdown here could open the door for further downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $110,000: Why BTC Must Break Out Of This Wedge Based on current indicators, the analyst suggests it’s wise to keep an eye out for potential movement in either direction.

While many countries are still navigating regulatory ambiguity, Japan has already woven XRP into its financial DNA. As X Finance Bull aptly put it, Japan didn’t just adopt XRP; they made it a standard. Institutional Commitment from Day One XRP’s success in Japan is rooted in early and strategic institutional investment. In January 2016, SBI Holdings, one of Japan’s most influential financial conglomerates, invested approximately ¥3 billion (about $25 million at the time) into Ripple, acquiring nearly 17% of the company. By 2021, SBI disclosed that it held around 10% of Ripple’s equity , underscoring its continued confidence in Ripple’s long-term value proposition. Japan didn’t just adopt $XRP . They made it a financial standard. 80% of their banks. SBI backing. Mega institutions lining up since day one. Ripple is woven into Japan’s financial DNA. Think the West won’t follow? That’s your bet to lose. pic.twitter.com/lFtf9ylUn1 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 2, 2025 That commitment materialized further with the formation of SBI Ripple Asia Co., Ltd. in May 2016. This joint venture was created to advance blockchain-based financial services throughout Japan and the broader Asia-Pacific region. It has since played a central role in facilitating Ripple’s technology adoption across multiple countries, including Thailand and Cambodia. XRP in the Banking System Perhaps most significantly, XRP has found a home in Japan’s banking sector . According to data cited in the image and reinforced by X Finance Bull, approximately 80% of Japanese banks are connected to Ripple through various blockchain and payment partnerships. This includes mega-institutions such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) and Mizuho Financial Group, which have worked alongside Ripple to test and implement its technology for faster, cheaper cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This level of banking sector engagement is unprecedented globally and has helped solidify XRP’s role not just as a speculative asset but as a utility token with real-world, high-volume use cases. Regulatory Clarity and Market Trust A key factor behind Japan’s XRP integration is the regulatory clarity provided by its financial authorities. While XRP has faced ongoing legal challenges in the U.S., Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) has treated it as a legitimate digital asset from early on. This has provided a stable environment for institutional adoption and retail usage to grow organically. SBI VC Trade, a digital asset exchange under SBI Holdings, has been at the forefront of this movement. It not only offers XRP trading to Japanese investors but also operates a validator node on the XRP Ledger, further demonstrating the depth of local commitment to the asset’s ecosystem. A Model for the West? Japan’s deep-rooted XRP adoption is more than a regional phenomenon, it’s a case study for the rest of the world. The integration of XRP across banking, retail, and institutional layers shows what’s possible when innovation meets regulatory foresight and strategic investment. As the United States and Europe continue to grapple with digital asset frameworks, Japan’s success story with XRP offers a glimpse of what the future could look like, where blockchain isn’t just an experiment but a functioning pillar of modern finance. Japan didn’t just adopt XRP. They made it a financial standard. And as global interest in Ripple’s technology continues to grow, the West may soon find itself following the path Japan paved years ago.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 108,000 YouTube subscribers that based on historical precedence, Bitcoin may reach a cycle peak within just a few months. “If we’re talking about September, October, with it just being July now – July, August, September, and then October – that’s already two to three months, potentially, that we have left in this bull market.” The analyst says that based on other market cycles, Bitcoin is probably about 88% of the way through its current bull run , meaning that risk is asymmetrically skewed to the downside for BTC. “If we’re thinking about this being the entire cycle that we’ve already seen in terms of upside, from bear market bottom to bull market top, and potentially this additional upside, potentially over a period of two to three months extra, then it just showcases to us that maybe we have a very small sliver of time and price expansion left versus the price expansion and time that we’ve already seen elapse over the course of this cycle, which comes down to that 88% figure.” Source: Rekt Capital Looking at his chart, the trader suggests Bitcoin may soar somewhere near $140,000 before reaching the cycle’s high. Rekt Capital notes that some analysts are suggesting this cycle may be different from prior ones and run for longer, but such theories will have to be tested when the time is right. Bitcoin is trading for $109,463 at time of writing, up 3.1% in the last 24 hours.

(ATXG) has announced a new non-binding agreement to purchase a total of 12,000 Bitcoin, revising the 8,000 BTC purchase plan it announced in May. This potential acquisition is worth approximately $1.3 billion at current prices. The company said in a statement today that the acquisitions will be financed through the sale of ATXG shares, which are traded on Nasdaq. However, details of the plan remain unclear. Addentax said the final agreement is subject to signing, a comprehensive due diligence process being completed and necessary approvals being obtained. Addentax said, “This specification sets the preliminary framework for the planned acquisition and is not a binding contract.” The company explained that critical details such as how many BTC will be purchased, how many shares will be issued, and share pricing have not yet been determined. Despite this, management continues to intend to allocate significant resources to its long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Related News: Renowned Economist Robert Kiyosaki Says, “Bitcoin Seems Very Expensive Right Now, But I'm Still Buying It,” and Explains Why However, Addentax’s market value remains below $7 million as of today, according to Google Finance data. The company’s plans to make a crypto investment of this scale have raised questions among investors, with its shares trading below $1 for over a year. Experts point to the potential risk of share dilution and volatility. The company’s past crypto ventures have also attracted attention. In May, it announced that it had held an acquisition talks worth around $800 million with “influential” crypto representatives, including memecoin investors named TRUMP, but stated that no binding agreement had been made at the time. Addentax, a textile company, is one of the latest to join the ranks of companies planning to create cryptocurrency reserves. However, some observers argue that such statements can sometimes be used to boost company stocks. The 2017 Long Island Iced Tea company’s name change to Long Blockchain Corp. and the explosion of its stock price remains one of the most remembered examples of this. *This is not investment advice.

The news comes the day Ripple said it applied for a national banking license at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). This license would allow the company to expand its crypto services and operate across state lines under federal regulation. A key part of the new collaboration is support for Ripple USD (RLUSD), Ripple’s U.S. dollar stablecoin. OpenPayd will allow for the direct minting and burning of RLUSD. The companies said the solution aims to simplify cross-border payments, treasury management, and dollar liquidity needs. “The future of global finance depends on seamless interoperability between traditional infrastructure and digital assets,” saidJack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of stablecoins, adding that the partnership “gives enterprises reliable access to RLUSD, combining the stability and compliance they expect with the connectivity they need.” Ripple Payments, per the release, processes over $70 billion in payment volume annually, spanning more than 90 payout markets.

XRP’s price action in recent days has been highlighted by a quick surge to $2.30 on June 30, in what looks like the bulls trying to close the month of June above $2.20. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency has slipped back below this level in the most recent two days. Although momentum has not yet returned in full, bullish predictions are still active, and this latest prediction adds another confident voice to the growing chorus of those expecting a significant breakout. XRP Price As High As $20 To $30 Taking to the social media platform, Vincent Van Code, an AI startup founder, offered his personal price outlook for XRP. He explained that while he rarely comments on specific targets, he believes the asset has the potential to reach between $30 and $50. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 However, it is important to note that this reasoning is not rooted in technical analysis, but rather in belief and long-term conviction based on XRP’s current price trajectory. Furthermore, he noted that his investment in XRP is shaped by this personal view of a $20 to $30 price target and admitted he cannot predict the timing of such a rally. The details of how the journey plays out to this price target are far less important than the eventual outcome. It is clear that the ultra-bullish price prediction is not intended to persuade or convince others. However, it shows the confidence some traders have in XRP’s future price. It also resonates with many predictions from other crypto participants regarding XRP, both in terms of technical and fundamental analysis. Familiar Price Predictions Within The Altcoin’s Circle This prediction aligns with a broader sense of optimism often found among XRP supporters. Although some critics continue to argue that price targets of $30 or more are unrealistic, especially due to its huge circulating supply, many in the XRP community continue to see such price targets as attainable.

The beliefs of extravagant XRP price targets are often based on its fundamentals, mostly on expectations of widespread adoption in cross-border payments and institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. In fact, one analyst pointed to this as the reason why the XRP price will surge above $1,000, stabilize at this level, and eventually become very expensive. Technical analysis from crypto analyst JackTheRippler pointed to an incoming price target above $30 for XRP. In a similar vein, a recent technical analysis by popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shows that the altcoin is on track to climb above $9.5 and reach as high as $37.5. XRP rallied to as high as $2.30 on June 30, and then reversed to an intraday low of $2.15 in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.19.

Drawing on historical chart patterns and long-term technical analysis, Egrag suggests that XRP may be on the verge of a powerful rally, one that most investors might be overlooking. With XRP currently trading at $2.22, his analysis could not be more timely. Historical Patterns Point to a Major Breakout Egrag’s chart focuses on XRP’s price history from 2014 to the present, using a logarithmic scale to trace long-term movements. The analyst identifies a repeating fractal, one that occurred during the 2016–2017 cycle, where XRP formed a triangle pattern before a sharp decline. Despite the steep 2,497% drop that followed, XRP eventually reversed into an explosive rally. #XRP – The Hidden Pump Is Right Under Our Nose! What if the opportunity is that simple? #XRPFamily STAY STEADY and STRONG ! , Together We Rise and We Shall Fly So High pic.twitter.com/KEPRw58NjU — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 1, 2025 Today, Egrag sees an almost identical formation developing. Once again, XRP is consolidating within a triangle, but this time the setup suggests an upward breakout. If history repeats in the opposite direction, Egrag projects a staggering potential upside of 24,174%, a move that would catapult XRP far beyond its current level. In his words, the bullish opportunity is “right under our nose,” and he cautions that the simplicity of the setup may be what makes it so easily overlooked. Technical Alignment Meets Shifting Sentiment This technical outlook arrives at a time when the broader sentiment around XRP is turning more favorable . The long-running SEC v. Ripple lawsuit brought significant uncertainty to the token, but recent developments have opened the door for institutional re-engagement and more confident participation from retail investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further reinforcing XRP’s legitimacy is its inclusion in Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund and its increasing adoption in Japan’s financial ecosystem. Ripple’s deep ties with Japanese financial giant SBI Holdings and the recent launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain have positioned XRP as a key asset within Asia’s fintech space. Against this backdrop, the technical structure on Egrag’s chart, marked by low volatility and price compression, suggests that XRP is preparing for a decisive move. Typically, such triangle formations resolve with strong momentum, and if XRP breaks upward, the move could be dramatic. A Simple Setup with Life-Changing Potential Egrag’s message is clear: while many look for complicated indicators, the real opportunity may lie in observing simple, proven chart formations. His call to action, “We Shall Fly So High”, captures the growing excitement among XRP believers who see this moment as a turning point. With XRP hovering at $2.22 and sitting just beneath the apex of its multi-year triangle, the market may be underestimating what’s about to come. If Egrag’s analysis holds, the “hidden pump” he describes could soon become anything but hidden. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Why Deutsche Bank, Europe’s Largest Lender, Bets Big on Digital Assets Deutsche Bank, Europe’s largest lender, has demonstrated considerable ambition regarding this initiative and digital assets more broadly. On June 8, Deutsche Bank announced its exploration of stablecoins as the institution evaluated whether to issue its own digital currency or participate in broader industry initiatives, according to Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank’s head of digital assets and currencies transformation, in a Bloomberg interview. The bank is also examining the potential for developing tokenized deposits that could enhance transaction settlement efficiency. Beyond Europe, the German financial giant has been pursuing expansion opportunities in Latin America. According to a press release shared with Cryptonews in May, Taurus, a Swiss digital asset infrastructure provider backed by Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, partnered with financial technology company Parfin to accelerate institutional adoption of digital assets across Latin America and Europe.

This rising altcoin is drawing attention as a structured early-entry option, driven by momentum and a disciplined rollout strategy. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Investor Optimism on the Rise Unlike its more established counterparts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is not caught in a tug-of-war between sentiment shifts and regulatory hurdles. Instead, it’s carving a clear growth trajectory. Analysts are increasingly highlighting its strategic development plan, tight token distribution, and consistent investor interest as signs of something more sustainable. Several early funding phases have already reached full allocation, and upcoming milestones are set to add further momentum. The methodical nature of MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s market approach is appealing to investors who are looking to enter during the project’s formative stage. The focus on controlled expansion and community engagement is positioning it as a timely altcoin play as markets prepare for broader recovery cycles. SHIBA INU: Mixed Signals Despite Growing Holder Base SHIBA INU continues to experience suppressed price action throughout the year. However, a significant number of long-term holders have maintained or even increased their positions. On-chain metrics show a buildup of around 30 trillion SHIB tokens by mid-level wallets — a notable show of confidence. While some chart analysts have pointed to a possible double-bottom structure and a potential bullish breakout, traders remain hesitant until key resistance levels are convincingly surpassed. SHIB’s short-term path appears dependent on a broader shift in retail interest or external market catalysts. Cardano Faces Market Pressure Amid Whale Movements Cardano has entered a technically oversold zone, but recovery hasn’t followed suit. Trading activity is low, and recent news — such as ADA integration into Brave Wallet — has yet to make a measurable impact on its price. At the same time, significant whale wallet transactions suggest indecision. After accumulating for months, large holders are beginning to liquidate portions of their holdings, contributing to volatility. Without a decisive news trigger or shift in sentiment, ADA risks drifting toward longer-term support levels. XRP Investors Wait for Legal Developments XRP continues to be weighed down by its protracted legal battle with U.S. regulators. Price charts now show consolidation within a tightening range, with minimal volatility. While hopes remain high that a positive outcome could shift the tide, until there’s formal clarity, many investors are sitting on the sidelines. The market sees XRP’s future as closely tied to the outcome of legal proceedings and potential regulatory guidance for digital assets. Until then, momentum is likely to remain muted. Conclusion: Momentum Is Shifting — Eyes on MAGACOIN FINANCE While well-known assets like SHIBA INU, Cardano, and XRP navigate a complex environment, investors are increasingly looking toward focused, early-stage projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining credibility as a project with strong fundamentals and organized progress — making it an attractive consideration for forward-thinking portfolios. With market dynamics favoring calculated entries, MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the asset best aligned with where sentiment is heading next.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.495 Price Change 24h 2.27% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.495 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis Pi price bounced from $0.4778 to $0.4953, signalling a small recovery after testing critical support levels. MACD shows a narrowing bearish gap, hinting at possible reversal momentum if buying volume sustains above current levels. RSI remains below 40, indicating weak buying strength and continued bearish sentiment. As of July 2, 2025, Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.4953, up 3.32% in the past 24 hours. The price bounced from a support level near $0.478, showing signs of short-term strength. The Immediate resistance lies around $0.505, and a breakout above this zone could open a path toward $0.52. Pi 1-day chart shows a weak momentum despite a short-term price rally The Pi Network 1-day chart shows a rebound as Pi coin price rose to $0.4953 after testing key support. Despite this rise, MACD remains in bearish territory, signalling weak momentum across the Pi Network market. The RSI stands at 38.13, reflecting low buying strength and a cautious current Pi Network sentiment. This aligns with uncertainty caused by ongoing token unlocks and increased selling pressure. Without bullish confirmation, the network price prediction remains bearish for the short term, though long-term recovery depends on ecosystem traction and demand. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart shows consolidation as Pi coin price trades between $0.48 and $0.50 with low volatility. MACD is showing signs of flattening, but no bullish crossover has formed, indicating weak momentum in the Pi Network market. The RSI has climbed to 40.84, hinting at small buying interest but still reflecting a bearish current Pi Network sentiment. Key resistance levels remain near $0.505, while support is holding around $0.478. Unless stronger demand emerges, the short-term price prediction points to sideways movement under pressure from high circulating supply and ongoing token unlocks. Pi/USDT Price Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? Pi price may stay in a range between $0.48 and $0.52 with weak momentum and ongoing token unlock pressure. A breakout above $0.52 could signal short-term recovery, but selling risks remain high. Market sentiment and volume will guide the next move. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. On June 28, Pi Network announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the mainnet, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-02 19:05:00

Liquifi is a platform that helps manage tokens, particularly for new projects that are just getting started. This move is part of Coinbase’s plan to support early-stage token projects. Launching new tokens on the blockchain can be a complicated and complex process. By acquiring Liquifi, Coinbase aims to simplify and streamline this process. What Liquifi Brings to Coinbase Liquifi provides essential tools for managing token details, including capitalization tables, vesting schedules, and compliance with legal regulations. With Liquifi’s services, Coinbase can help developers and companies handle these tricky parts more easily. The platform automates many key tasks and reduces the risks associated with creating new tokens. Coinbase’s leaders believe this acquisition will help solve everyday problems token creators face. These problems often include legal, tax, and regulatory issues that make launching tokens a complex and challenging task to manage. Liquifi’s technology and knowledge will help remove these obstacles, making the process simpler and easier to grow. This latest acquisition follows the trading platform’s hint at more mergers and acquisitions in May, which aligns with its long-term plan. Integrating Liquifi into the Coinbase Prime Platform Coinbase plans to add Liquifi’s features to Coinbase Prime, its platform designed for large investors and institutions. This integration will provide institutional users with enhanced tools to manage token projects, improving their approach to investments and token launches. Overall, this acquisition shows Coinbase’s commitment to supporting innovation in the crypto world and making token management easier for everyone involved. This will create a better and simpler experience for token issuers and investors. During the announcement, Coinbase’s executive Greg Tusar stated that the goal of this acquisition is to make launching tokens easier, faster, and more accessible worldwide. Coinbase aims to support creators from the outset, even before their tokens are launched or listed on exchanges. This early help can make launches go more smoothly and ensure compliance with the rules. Part of Coinbase’s Bigger Growth Plan Notably, the purchase of Liquifi is Coinbase’s fourth deal in 2025. Earlier this year, Coinbase purchased Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange . Additionally, the exchange acquired Spindl, a platform specializing in on-chain advertising and attribution. The company also bought the team behind Iron Fish, which develops privacy-focused crypto solutions. These purchases demonstrate Coinbase’s strategy to develop a comprehensive range of services for the cryptocurrency market.

The project, according to a press release, focuses on testing how tokenized carbon credits can be created and tracked using blockchain infrastructure. These credits, which represent greenhouse gas reductions from projects like reforestation or renewable energy, are often bought by companies aiming to offset their emissions. The firms will focus on how blockchain handles credit lifecycle management, data compatibility and registry access. ""Our shared aim is to establish standardized infrastructure that enhances information and price transparency, paving the way for financial innovation and increased market liquidity,"" said Keerthi Moudgal, head of product at Kinexys Digital Assets. The initiative underscores JPMorgan's growing presence in the red-hot tokenization space, a sector that has attracted global banks and asset managers such as BlackRock , HSBC and Citi . Tokenization is the process of using blockchain rails to transact with traditional financial instruments, promising more efficient operations, around-the-clock settlements and increased transparency. JPMorgan has been an early leader operating its own private blockchain network Kinexys, formerly known as Onyx and JPM Coin, which now settles $2 billion in daily transactions, according to the bank. It also piloted last month a deposit token called JPMD on Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Coinbase.

The rush to secure banking services is linked to the new requirements for regulated stablecoins, which require proof of bank reserves. Ripple has applied for a US banking license, seeking a foothold in mainstream finance, reported the Wallstreet Journal. The issuer of XRP made the unexpected move after years of aiming to replace banking. Ripple’s move follows the bid of Circle to gain access to a banking license and store its USD reserves backing the USDC stablecoin and other assets. More crypto companies are seeking a link to mainstream finance, as a response to the GENIUS bill on the required stablecoin reserves. Ripple still manages cross-border payments through its distributed ledger and has recently launched dollar-backed stablecoin RLUSD. Securing a banking license will give Ripple full control of the RLUSD fiat reserves. The banking license may go further than just serving the purposes of RLUSD. Multiple crypto projects are seeking to create a bank to fill the niche of the bankrupt Silicon Valley Bank. If Ripple fails to secure a banking license, it would still be able to launch a fully regulated stablecoin, as the GENIUS bill envisions multiple types of legal issuers. Nonbank entities will also be able to issue stablecoins, but local banks will also have a convenient regulatory framework to launch tokens. Ripple seeks further proof of RLUSD reliability The co-founder and CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, reiterated the backing of RLUSD as one of the main motivators to seek a bank license. Ripple seeks a national bank charter from the OCC, meaning compliance with both state and federal oversight. Garlinghouse recalled Ripple also sought out a Fed Master Account, meaning RLUSD reserves could also be stored directly with the Fed. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 Ripple has always kept close to banking institutions, granting its XRPL technology as an alternative to SWIFT payments. XRP was also viewed as a ‘bankers’ coin’ in the past, as Ripple aimed to augment banking, instead of disrupting it entirely. Ripple has been categorized as a digital ‘neobank’ despite its lack of an official license. Based on its current services, which include remittances, lending, asset storage, payments, and other features, Ripple has been deemed the equivalent of a banking company. Ripple also partners with other payment providers like OpenPayd to move fiat and expand the reach of RLUSD. Ripple’s XRP rallies on news of banking application XRP immediately reacted to the news of the banking license application, rising from its sideways movement. XRP expanded from recent lows around $2.17 up to $2.26 before taking a step back. XRP rallied after the news of Ripple’s application for a banking license, once again signaling mainstream acceptance. | Source: Coingecko XRP open interest also rose to $1.8B, from levels of around $1.68B. The asset still sees 75% long positions, though the recent rally mostly liquidated short positions on Binance. The asset still awaits a breakout to a much higher range. The Ripple community was overall enthusiastic about the banking license, showing the mainstream acceptance of the platform. The role of XRP remains limited, as Ripple can handle payments even without the asset, but trading remains highly liquid and the token has shown the ability to outperform based on general market hype.

Malpass said the Fed's interest rates are “still too high” and are holding back growth in the U.S. economy. Malpass criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s statement that Trump’s tariffs had raised inflation expectations and delayed interest rate cuts. Malpass described Powell’s assessment, made in Europe, as “contextual but distracting,” adding, “The real problem is that the Fed is still keeping interest rates too high.” Stating that the European Central Bank prefers low growth, Malpass stated that this approach is not suitable for the US: “The entire economy cannot be run on the principle of ‘let’s not overheat.’ That’s bad for the middle class and small businesses.” Malpass argued that Trump's proposal to not tax tips was a step in the right direction to support the working class. The program also brought up the compromise bill that would extend Trump’s tax cuts. Former Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Larry Summers’ article titled “This Bill Is Dangerous” was recalled. Malpass said he disagreed with these criticisms: “If this law is not passed, there will be a tax increase. This will have a negative impact on growth. Rubin and Summers' proposals are from the 1990s. Today's conditions are different.” Related News: BREAKING: Critical Banking License Application Submitted by Ripple - Exciting Developments for XRP Malpass responded to criticism that the bill would add an additional $3.3 trillion to the budget as follows: “These numbers are static models that assume the tax cuts are not extended and have no impact on growth. That is not the reality. The U.S. economy could grow much faster.” Malpass argued that the anti-growth economic models used by the Fed must change. “Everyone in Washington is focused on growing the government.

Below we highlight five such projects, summarizing their core features and CoinMarketCap statistics. Trava Finance (TRAVA) Trava Finance is a cross-chain lending marketplace on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows projects and individuals to launch their own lending pools. Launched in 2021, Trava lets users create and manage “User-owned pools” for lending and borrowing. It also incorporates AI-powered analytics to reduce risk – for example, it offers tools like the BRicher token-price aggregator, Token Health indicators, and a Credit Score system to inform investment decisions. Trava Governance is fully decentralized, letting TRAVA token holders vote on upgrades. The team is even experimenting with NFT collateral: they launched “Trava Knight” NFTs and an auction platform as steps toward NFT-backed loans. Key features: Cross-chain lending pools; AI-driven analytics (credit scoring, token health); decentralized governance; NFT-collateral experimentation. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00008485 (24h volume ≈$74 K); Market Cap ≈$343.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈4.05 B TRAVA. Trading: TRAVA trades on exchanges such as MEXC (TRAVA/USDT), BitMart, and PancakeSwap v2. UniLend Finance (UFT) UniLend is a permissionless DeFi protocol that uniquely combines spot trading and lending/borrowing for any ERC-20 token. Unlike other platforms that limit which tokens can be used, UniLend lets any community member list an ERC-20 token for lending, borrowing, and trading. Its upcoming UniLend V2 (launched Feb 2024 on Ethereum) promises expanded features and performance. UniLend also bridges into AI: it offers an AI Agent Hub where users can co-create on-chain AI agents using modular smart-contract “lego” components. The native UFT token is used for platform governance; holders can vote on proposals and earn rewards from liquidity mining and protocol fees. Key features: Permissionless trading & lending for all ERC-20 tokens; unified spot and lending markets; community governance (UFT) and a separate UFTG community token; modular AI Agent Hub for on-chain AI agents. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.00605 (24h volume ≈$54.7 K); Market Cap ≈$554.3 K; Circulating Supply ≈91.67 M UFT. Trading: UFT is listed on exchanges like AscendEX, Uniswap V2, and SushiSwap. ForTube (FOR) – The Force Protocol ForTube (formerly The Force Protocol ) is an open-source DeFi lending platform, deployed on Binance Smart Chain in 2020. It describes itself as a suite of crypto-finance service protocols aimed at developers. The platform supports crypto-backed lending and borrowing , yield farming, and issuance of on-chain stablecoins. Its services include cross-chain asset transfers, crypto-asset-backed stablecoin insurance, token insurance, and on-chain payments. ForTube’s smart contracts allow users to deposit, borrow, and repay assets at any time, with interest rates automatically adjusted by the protocol. Notably, the ForTube network has been audited by SlowMist for security. Key features: BSC-based DeFi lending/yield-farming; crypto-collateralized stablecoin issuance; permissionless platform with SDK/APIs for developers; algorithmic interest rates; audited smart contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.000738 (24h volume ≈$128 K); Market Cap ≈$586.7 K; Circulating Supply ≈795 M FOR. Trading: FOR is tradable on major CEXs (Binance, Huobi, etc.) and decentralized exchanges. Interlay (INTR) Interlay is a Bitcoin-centric cross-chain DeFi protocol . Its goal is to bring Bitcoin into the wider DeFi ecosystem. As its website states, “Interlay is a modular, programmable layer between Bitcoin and the multi-chain ecosystem that unlocks decentralized (financial) use cases for BTC”. The main feature is the interBTC bridge, a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset secured by a decentralized network of vaults. Interlay also provides a DeFi hub for BTC – enabling Bitcoin swaps, lending, and staking with low fees (payable in any asset). The INTR token underpins the protocol: holders can lock INTR to vote on governance (“stake-to-vote”) and pay transaction or cross-chain fees, and INTR can even serve as collateral for interBTC or other assets. Key features: Trustless BTC bridge (interBTC) for using BTC across multiple chains; Bitcoin DeFi hub (swaps, lending, staking); modular architecture supporting EVM and Rust contracts. Coin stats: Price ≈$0.002310 (24h volume ≈$59.7 K); Market Cap ≈$154.8 K; Circulating Supply ≈67.0 M INTR. Trading: INTR is listed on exchanges like Kraken and Gate.io. Kintsugi (KINT) Kintsugi is Interlay’s canary network deployed on Kusama. It runs the same codebase as Interlay but serves as an innovation hub, getting new features first. Kintsugi’s flagship product is kBTC , a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on Kusama backed by multi-collateral insurance (like a decentralized BTC-pegged stablecoin). The KINT token is primarily for governance (deciding protocol upgrades) and paying network fees. In practice, Kintsugi aims to stress-test and refine Interlay’s designs; as the Interlay docs say, “Kintsugi focuses strictly on innovation and will always be ahead in terms of features”. Key features: Kusama-based experimental layer for Bitcoin DeFi; 1:1 BTC-backed kBTC asset with MakerDAO-inspired multi-collateral insurance; token governance and fees (KINT). Coin stats: Price ≈$0.17 (24h volume ≈$65.5 K); Market Cap ≈$583.6 K; Circulating Supply ≈3.43 M KINT. Trading: KINT is traded on platforms like Kraken and Gate.io. Summary: Each of these projects has a unique niche in DeFi lending/borrowing, often involving cross-chain or Bitcoin-focused features. Their market caps are currently under $1 M, which implies both potential upside and higher risk. Before investing, do your own research: check current prices, liquidity, and developments. CoinMarketCap provides up-to-date stats (as cited above) to help track these tokens. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), long considered core holdings, have seen substantial whale activity in recent weeks — a sign that larger players are anticipating a strong market expansion. However, rather than remaining concentrated in legacy assets, a portion of this capital is finding its way into new, high-upside projects. One name rising quickly in this space is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a politically themed meme token drawing increased attention from institutional and retail investors alike. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Early Traction from High-Net Players Positioned as more than just a typical meme token, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on transparent economics and a strict no-VC policy. The total token supply is fixed at 170 billion , with no stealth emissions or inflation mechanisms. Every token is accessible to the public, fostering open participation and avoiding centralized control. The project’s growing appeal is also tied to its successful audit by HashEx — a move that has helped instill early credibility. In recent weeks, both wallet engagement and token acquisition rates have risen sharply. Analysts suggest this indicates early-stage positioning by whales, particularly those migrating from ETH and SOL, who are seeking untapped upside before the asset lists publicly. Whales typically enter before breakout moments, and this pattern appears to be forming with MAGACOIN FINANCE . The current momentum points to accumulation underway ahead of what some expect could be 25x to 30x returns for early participants. Ethereum Whales Stack $3.79 Billion in Fresh ETH Positions June 2025 was marked by aggressive Ethereum accumulation. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH collectively purchased more than 1.49 million ETH — an equivalent of nearly $3.8 billion . This group now owns close to 27% of ETH’s circulating supply , an indicator of deep confidence in Ethereum’s long-term trajectory. Despite market pullbacks, high-value investors are positioning themselves early — often during periods of price weakness. A single transaction exceeding $73 million highlighted the scale of this conviction. However, analysts note that some of this capital is now branching out into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE , offering more aggressive growth potential. Solana’s Whale Moves Signal Broader Reallocation Solana’s recent on-chain activity mirrors this trend. In mid-June, over 2 million SOL (worth more than $320 million ) changed hands across two major transactions. The appearance of a new receiving wallet suggested potential institutional onboarding or strategic repositioning. Just days later, another $323 million in SOL shifted between private wallets — all during a market pullback sparked by global political tensions. Despite volatility, large holders kept accumulating, demonstrating a focus on long-term value. Earlier flows out of whale wallets initially led to price softness, but data shows many of these funds were reallocated rather than sold. The pattern reveals not just belief in Solana, but an appetite for complementary assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer a higher ceiling for growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Early-Stage Winner of 2025 The political meme coin category has exploded in visibility this year — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge. With zero VC unlocks, a fixed token supply, and mounting retail interest, its structure is primed for breakout movement. Still unlisted and operating beneath the radar of mainstream hype, it’s attracting attention from forward-thinking ETH and SOL holders looking to scale returns early. The current bonus structure adds urgency, providing a limited-time advantage to those who act now. With momentum building and market interest turning to utility-backed meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the go-to asset for those targeting accelerated growth before broader exposure takes hold.

But now, in just a few months, Trump and his family have made more than $620 million by diving into the world of crypto . Is Trump using his power as president to make this money? Let’s look at how he’s turning digital coins into millions. Fast Money: From Real Estate to Crypto For years, the Trump family made their money the traditional way, buying land, building towers, and putting their name on fancy buildings all over the world. But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, things have changed. The same man who once criticized crypto has now done a complete turnaround and jumped right into it. With their new projects like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin , the Trumps are making money much faster than they ever did by selling condos. One of their biggest money-makers right now is World Liberty Financial, which sells its tokens and runs a stablecoin called USD1, linked to the US dollar. By March, this project had sold about $550 million worth of tokens, and nearly $400 million of that went directly to the Trump family. Earlier, Trump even offered a private dinner to the trump memecoin’s biggest holders. Crypto Beats Real Estate To see how big this is, compare it to Trump’s old business. Last year, his company made about $34 million from licensing buildings. That’s small compared to the hundreds of millions flowing in from crypto projects in just months. And it’s not stopping there. Trump’s family also has a stake in American Bitcoin, a company that wants to go public as a big Bitcoin miner. If that works, it could add even more to their crypto fortune. New Money, Same Name No matter what, the Trump name keeps pulling in money. Now, instead of waiting years to finish towers and resorts, the Trumps can earn millions quickly by putting their name on digital coins.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-02 19:34:33

AI Projects Dominance Spikes and Altcoin Frenzy,https://cryptonews.com/news/what-if-bitcoin-200k-scenario/,"What would happen if Bitcoin reached $200,000? Nearly doubling its previous all-time high, a $200K price would move Bitcoin into a new tier of market capitalization, roughly matching the valuation of global blue-chip equities and sovereign debt holdings. It would likely attract new classes of capital and global media attention. This article uses AI to analyze and explore that possibility through a structured framework. Instead of speculating on a date or treating the figure as inevitable, it investigates what could unfold if Bitcoin does reach this benchmark. Drawing from prior market cycles and behavior patterns, it outlines key indicators investors might observe across dominance, altcoin behavior, sector reactions, macro drivers, and psychological sentiment. Bitcoin Price 2017-Present (Source: CoinMarketCap) Rather than offering predictions, the goal is to map potential outcomes. The AI analysis considers how markets have responded to previous rallies and what those patterns might imply for a future where Bitcoin touches $200K. Research Approach and Analytical Framework To ground the analysis, we analyzed data from two previous bull cycles with ChatGPT’s o3 model—2017 and 2020 to 2021—using CoinMarketCap and TradingView . Both periods saw Bitcoin leading the initial price movements, followed by capital rotation into altcoins. BTC dominance rose early, then declined as other tokens gained traction. This historical lens helps to frame a plausible path forward. AI analysis added structure by projecting how different segments might react under specific conditions. These include shifts in BTC dominance, ETH /BTC ratio trends, and short-term altcoin volatility following a price spike. We assume Bitcoin reaches $200K in an environment that supports a higher risk appetite, such as post-ETF-approval inflows, macroeconomic easing, or a weakening dollar. No single catalyst is implied, but conditions would likely include strong institutional demand and favorable regulation. Initial Shock: Bitcoin Dominance Spikes If Bitcoin breaks through $200K, dominance is likely to climb in the early stages. In past cycles, this has indicated capital concentration in Bitcoin as investors seek security in the most liquid asset. In 2017, dominance fell from 64 percent to under 40 percent as the rally matured. In the 2021 cycle, it peaked around 73 percent before dropping below 50 percent once altcoins gathered momentum. Bitcoin Dominance 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) At the $200K level, Bitcoin would almost certainly attract institutional flows and dominate trading volumes. Search interest and media coverage would spike, even among retail investors who have stayed on the sidelines. Historically, these moments have been associated with a rapid inflow of attention and capital, setting the stage for short-lived overextension. However, the rise in dominance might be temporary. Once BTC appears to stabilize at new highs, capital could begin rotating into ETH and eventually into smaller assets. This transition has occurred before, often within weeks of a Bitcoin top. Altcoin Rotation: ETH Rebounds, Altseason Looms Ethereum has historically underperformed during Bitcoin-led surges but tends to recover strongly once BTC momentum cools. During the late 2020 rally, ETH/BTC declined even as BTC rallied. But by mid-2021, Ethereum regained ground and outperformed Bitcoin in percentage terms for several months. The ETH/BTC ratio climbed steadily, indicating renewed confidence in broader crypto exposure. Ethereum to Bitcoin Ratio 2017-Present (Source: TradingView) Blockchaincenter’s Altcoin Season Index supports this. In both 2017 and 2021, altcoin rallies intensified once Bitcoin had already established a local high. In 2021, large-cap alts rose by over 170 percent compared to a relatively flat BTC. Smaller tokens often lag further, but their moves are sharper once they catch up. If BTC reaches $200K and then stabilizes, the conditions for a classic altcoin season may emerge. Capital typically flows first to ETH, then to mid-cap tokens, and finally to microcaps as risk appetite increases. Altcoin Season Index 2020-Present (Source: Blockchaincenter) These transitions are fast and often unpredictable. Investors watching dominance metrics, ETH/BTC ratios, and liquidity conditions may spot the early signs of such a rotation. Sector Reactions: DeFi, Memecoins, Metaverse Beyond general altcoins, specific token sectors have often been the primary beneficiaries of late-cycle capital. In 2021, DeFi protocols, meme tokens, and metaverse-related assets surged once Bitcoin began to flatten out. These moves were amplified by social sentiment and community engagement rather than core utility. Should Bitcoin reach $200K, speculative capital may again flow into these and other new, trending segments (AI, RWA , etc). Traders who missed the early BTC gains may chase higher beta assets, especially if short-term sentiment supports them. These rallies tend to be brief and steep, with heightened volatility on both the upside and downside. Timing also matters. These sectors often peak just after Bitcoin tops. Watch for rising social engagement and increasing trading volume as early indicators. Macro Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts No major price level exists in a vacuum. A $200K Bitcoin would likely follow a set of favorable macro and regulatory developments. Additional ETF approvals could trigger new flows from wealth managers and pension funds. A weakening dollar or easing Fed stance might drive investors to reevaluate long-term stores of value, and persistent inflation could push more institutional interest into hard digital assets. What drives the price also shapes what follows. An ETF-driven rally would likely keep most capital in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, if broader macro recovery leads the charge—like a tech-stock rebound or real yield compression—then altcoins might benefit as well. The nature of the catalyst would determine the breadth of participation. A narrow rally driven by institutions tends to favor high-liquidity assets. A wider rally, driven by retail and macro optimism, tends to pull in speculative names. The outcome is not just price-based but structural. Understanding this would help investors anticipate where capital may flow next. Mapping Reversal Risks and Volatility Ahead In past cycles, dominance tends to peak around the time Bitcoin hits its top. When BTC hit $20K in December 2017, dominance fell shortly after. In 2021, BTC reached $69K while dominance was already declining, setting the stage for broad market retracements. The scenario might look like this: Bitcoin touches $200K, dominance climbs to 60 percent, then retreats over several days as capital disperses. If this process unfolds too quickly, altcoin prices may rise and fall just as fast. Tokens with low liquidity or inflated valuations may see abrupt corrections. The risk isn’t only that prices fall, but that the correction hits different sectors at different speeds. Bitcoin may remain steady while smaller tokens experience outsized drawdowns. Investors unfamiliar with this dynamic may misread the timing, entering too late or exiting too early. Volatility often follows rapid rotations. Watching dominance trends and ETH/BTC shifts can help assess when momentum begins to fade. Investor Sentiment Shifts—Retail vs Institutional Retail behavior often mirrors price action. In 2017 and 2021, Google Trends data shows search interest for “Bitcoin” peaked near the market top. These periods were marked by media saturation and public curiosity. Bitcoin Google Trend Index (Source: Google) Recent rallies haven’t generated the same level of attention. Even with new highs, search volume remains well below prior peaks. If Bitcoin hits $200K under similar conditions, the move may be driven more by institutions than retail. This could delay broader participation, especially in altcoins. A subdued retail environment might mute initial volatility, but it could also dampen follow-through in later phases. Altcoin seasons tend to rely on retail-driven liquidity. If that component is missing or delayed, smaller tokens may struggle to replicate past performance. Still, attention can return quickly. If media focus intensifies, search trends could reverse rapidly. Retail engagement tends to follow headlines. Preparing for a Potential $200K Bitcoin Market As we’ve explored what might happen if Bitcoin reaches $200K, we’ve drawn from real-world data and historical behavior to outline potential developments across market structure, investor behavior, and asset rotation. Key indicators to monitor include Bitcoin dominance, ETH/BTC ratio trends, and search activity. These offer insight into whether a rally is broadening, narrowing, or beginning to reverse. Rather than make a prediction, this scenario helps map expectations. Understanding previous cycles doesn’t guarantee foresight, but it does offer useful context. If Bitcoin does approach $200K, preparation will matter more than precision. The post What If Bitcoin Hits $200K?

Daily volumes range from hundreds of thousands to several million dollars. Gasspas is trading at an almost-negligible price, while the others trade in the cent range. They are listed on multiple exchanges (e.g. LBank, MEXC, Gate) which helps maintain liquidity. Each coin’s appeal is driven by its IP/meme theme (a comic character, viral cat memes, or a celebrity tie-in) and active community interest. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The move came amid fresh attention to Tuttle Capital’s proposed 2x Long BONK ETF, which has taken a procedural step forward but remains unapproved. Tuttle Capital originally filed a Form N-1A on Jan. 27, for a suite of leveraged ETFs, including a 2x Long BONK product. On July 1, the firm submitted a post-effective amendment stating that the ETF could become effective no sooner than July 16. This means the product could launch after that date, pending regulatory clearance and operational readiness. The filing includes similar 2x long exposure funds for other assets, including SOL, TRUMP, MELANIA, XRP, ADA and LTC. This update has rekindled investor interest in BONK, reflecting broader appetite for structured meme coin exposure via traditional financial instruments. However, the ETF is not yet approved, and the July 16 date only marks the earliest possible activation under current SEC procedures. Elsewhere, BONK developers announced that the Saga phone token redemption program will officially end on July 31. Of the 20,000 allocations, roughly 17,599 have been claimed. Unclaimed tokens will be returned to the BONK DAO and earmarked for future ecosystem development. This change coincides with the launch of the Solana Seeker phone, signaling a transition in Solana Mobile’s device cycle. Meanwhile, the Solana network continues to grow. DeFi Development Corp has joined as a validator, boosting infrastructure decentralization. The broader network has now surpassed 350 on-chain integrations, increasing the visibility and utility of tokens like BONK across DeFi and Web3 use cases. Technical Analysis Highlights BONK climbed from $0.0000136 to a peak of $0.00001524, up 12.1%, before closing at $0.00001494. Price broke through resistance at $0.0000144 during the 16:00 UTC hour on strong volume of 1.38 trillion. A head-and-shoulders pattern formed between 16:48 and 17:47 UTC, indicating potential exhaustion. Breakdown below $0.00001500 saw heavy selling, with 73.9 billion in volume during the 17:39 candle. Support is now seen around $0.0000142, bolstered by high-volume buying during the 13:00 hour. Volatility and volume remain elevated, suggesting continued short-term speculation.

In the post , Trump shared that there will be a lot of cooperation between the two countries. Afterwards, he revealed the conditions in the agreement set for Vietnam. Following the deal, Vietnam will pay the United States a 20% tariff on all goods sent to their territory and a 40% on any transshipping. In exchange, Vietnam will do something they have never done before: grant the United States complete access to their markets for trade. This means they will open their Market to the US, allowing them to sell their products in Vietnam with no tariffs. Trump mentioned that he made this deal after talking with To Lam, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. The US president anticipated that the SUV, or a Large Engine Vehicle, which is very popular in the United States, would be an excellent addition to the different product lines in Vietnam. According to Trump, working with the General Secretary was truly a pleasure for him. Vietnam aims to finalize a trade deal with the US before the tariff deadline strikes Vietnam had already been subjected to a 46% tariff as part of Trump’s announcements about reciprocal tariffs for “Liberation Day.” Later, that tariff was put on hold for 90 days, and this suspension is set to expire next week. In late June, following the deadline, Pham Minh Chinh , the Prime Minister of Vietnam, said he anticipated finalizing a trade agreement with the US before the deadline. Chinh expressed that he believes the outcome will arrive in less than two weeks. The Prime Minister also speculated that good things will come their way. Meanwhile, Vietnam and the US have a strong understanding of tariffs. The Office of the United States Trade Representative reported that 2024 goods trade between the US and Vietnam reached about $149.6 billion. They also mentioned that US exports of goods to Vietnam in 2024 were $13.1 billion, a 32.9% increase worth $3.2 billion compared to 2023. Additionally, they stated that in 2024, US imports of goods from Vietnam amounted to $136.6 billion, rising by 19.3% worth $22.1 billion from 2023. The trade deficit for the US with Vietnam was $123.5 billion in 2024, reflecting an increase of 18.1% worth $18.9 billion over the previous year. Vietnam faces pressure to balance the US and China in its trade activities The Southeast Asian nation, China’s neighbour and huge recipient of Chinese investment, has found itself in a tight spot as it tries to keep trading with the US without conflicting with China. The United States happens to be its largest export market and a security ally, after all. Vietnam’s Government Office, which oversees the country’s ministries, conducted an emergency talk with the government’s trade gurus on April 3 – the day President Trump had unveiled the tariffs. Officials in the trade and customs ministries were given instructions to intensify their checks during the meeting and two weeks to come up with an effective strategy to tackle Illegal transshipment. This was after it was revealed that some goods that Vietnam sent to the West have Chinese-made inputs, while Chinese companies have also set up factories to cater to US customers. In many cases, Vietnamese workers process the products, which are then legally sent to the US with a “Made in Vietnam” label. American officials have accused China of running goods through Vietnam to gain lower tariffs for products that do not have much Vietnamese involvement.

This figure dwarfs the combined activity of major competitors like OKX, Deribit, BitMEX, and Bybit, which together account for only about 10%. Taker Volume Signals Market Supremacy Takers are traders who accept existing offers or bids on a platform’s order book rather than placing their own. Since they want their request filled immediately, they tend to “take” a value that’s already listed so that they can react swiftly to a cryptocurrency’s price movements. This is done through the so-called market orders. This metric is crucial: it indicates where positions fill fastest and where capital flows are most concentrated. Experts usually consider the taker volume important for gauging real-time market activity, and according to CryptoQuant, Binance is the overwhelming leader, capturing 87% of such deals. That it holds the lion’s share of this activity indicates that Binance is the go-to platform for traders looking to act quickly on price trends, especially those using leverage-heavy BTC futures contracts. As noted by analyst J.A. Maartun, the exchange’s dominance means traders’ orders will be filled rapidly, while market watchers like him get to “monitor order books, liquidity levels, and capital flows more effectively.” Binance’s grip on the space is not new, but it solidified following the 2022 collapse of FTX, which at one point was one of its main rivals. The gap it left behind saw the then Changpeng Zhao-led firm steadily grow its daily trading volume to cement its place as the largest crypto exchange in the world based on this metric. Beyond Futures However, its dominance isn’t just in the futures space. As recently reported by CryptoPotato , the BTC.com mining pool exclusively directs almost 98% of its identifiable Bitcoin exchange flows to Binance, making it the primary gateway for new BTC entering the market. The crypto exchange also dominates USDT liquidity on Tron, with on-chain data showing it routinely processes more than 65% of the stablecoin’s transfers on the network. This amounts to anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion worth of TRC-20 Tether processed each day. Nonetheless, this extreme centralization is a double-edged sword. While it offers unmatched liquidity and efficiency, it also concentrates systemic risk. Any significant operational, regulatory, or technical issue impacting Binance could send shockwaves across the entire crypto ecosystem, disrupting derivatives pricing, spot liquidity, and even stablecoin flows.

Also, an incubator known for strategically supporting early-stage protocols across DeFi, GameFi , infrastructure, and data sectors. While their portfolio includes big names, several DWF-backed tokens currently trade under a $1 million market cap, offering sharp upside potential for those paying attention. 1. UnMarshal (MARSH) UnMarshal is a blockchain data indexing protocol that simplifies access to on-chain data. Its infrastructure powers oracles, dashboards, analytics tools, and DeFi apps by structuring blockchain data into easily queryable APIs. Built for developers, it supports multiple chains including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon. The MARSH token fuels the ecosystem, compensating node runners and contributors. UnMarshal has announced a strategic Buyback & Burn program targeting over 4 million MARSH tokens in 2025, aimed at reducing supply and enhancing long-term token value. Founder @manoharshetty96 has reiterated in recent AMAs that UnMarshal is committed to sustainable value creation. The buyback model is not just a hype mechanism—it’s a deflationary commitment to loyal holders and ecosystem contributors. Currently, MARSH is trading for less than 2 cents and has a market cap of under $800K. Yet, it boasts a strong presence on exchanges like Gate.io, MEXC, KuCoin, and HitBTC , making it one of the most accessible low-cap data-focused assets. Use Case: On-chain data indexing Narrative: Buyback & burn / DePIN / DataFi Exchanges: MEXC, KuCoin, Gate.io, HitBTC Watch for: Dev updates, integration with emerging L2s, buyback execution 2. NEST Protocol (NEST) NEST Protocol is a decentralized trading infrastructure offering a unique suite of DeFi building blocks. Its core includes: NEST Oracle (decentralized price feed system) NEST Assets (for token generation) NESTcraft , a toolkit for building customizable derivatives and risk-sharing tools A major extension of this ecosystem is NESTFi , a decentralized perpetual exchange powered by smart contracts. Unlike typical perpetuals relying on centralized liquidity or market-makers, NESTFi uses algorithmic mint/burn logic where traders’ profits are minted and losses are burned by smart contracts—eliminating counterparty risks. With a price in the micro-cent range and a market cap well below $600K, NEST is trading on HTX, CoinW , and PancakeSwap v2 . It’s one of the most undervalued infra tokens supported by DWF Labs, especially given the recent surge in attention around on-chain derivatives and oracle security. Use Case: Oracles, perpetuals, risk markets Narrative: DeFi infra / On-chain trading / Modular derivatives Exchanges: HTX, CoinW, PancakeSwap v2 Watch for: NESTFi adoption, oracle integration with L2s 3. Dreams Quest (DREAMS) Dreams Quest is a GameFi project building a metaverse RPG titled “The Fall of Azoria” , developed natively for mobile. The game blends Web2 and Web3, allowing traditional gamers to play with full blockchain ownership of items and characters. DREAMS token underpins this experience—used for in-game purchases, staking, and NFT interactions. What sets Dreams Quest apart is its effort to offer real custody over in-game assets , something most Web3 games have promised but not delivered. Recent demos and community updates have shown immersive gameplay and NFT integration, especially via mobile UX—a strategic focus for mass adoption. DREAMS trades at a deep discount, with a sub-$400K market cap and relatively healthy volume for its size. It’s listed on MEXC, KuCoin , and PancakeSwap , and is likely on DWF Labs’ radar for strategic incubation as the Web3 gaming narrative heats up. Use Case: GameFi, NFT metaverse Narrative: Web3 mobile gaming / Play-to-earn evolution Exchanges: KuCoin, MEXC, PancakeSwap Watch for: Game release, NFT integration, GameFi trends 4. Senso (SENSO) SENSO powers the Sensorium Galaxy , a metaverse social platform blending immersive experiences with AI and blockchain. Think of it as a blend of social VR, digital concerts, and AI avatars where users interact in real-time. While Sensorium’s hype peaked during the metaverse boom, its recent pivot into AI-driven social spaces has revived attention. The SENSO token is used to buy virtual goods, access premium content, and power governance within the metaverse. Despite trading at just over half a cent and having a sub-$500K market cap, SENSO still maintains moderate volume and is actively traded on Gate.io, MEXC , and KuCoin . DWF Labs has previously backed similar immersive world projects, and with SENSO quietly iterating, it may see renewed interest. Use Case: Metaverse interaction, AI-powered virtual worlds Narrative: AI x Metaverse / Digital identity Exchanges: Gate.io, KuCoin, MEXC Watch for: New AI integrations, partnership with VR platforms 5. Crust Network (CRU) Crust Network is a decentralized cloud storage protocol built on Polkadot. It uses IPFS infrastructure and supports storage markets, offering staking, governance, and DePIN models via its native CRU token. Its consensus mechanism is a hybrid of GPoS (Guaranteed Proof-of-Stake) and MPoW (Meaningful Proof-of-Work) , enabling secure and efficient storage validation. Use cases range from decentralized backups to NFT data storage and full dApp hosting. Despite being a technically strong project, Crust Network has been flying under the radar with a market cap just under $1M. It remains listed on Gate, MEXC, HTX , and LATOKEN , and as the Real World Asset (RWA) and DePIN narrative continues to build, CRU may re-enter investor radar—especially given Polkadot’s upcoming tech revamp. Use Case: Decentralized storage (DePIN) Narrative: Polkadot storage / DePIN / Web3 infra Exchanges: Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, LATOKEN Watch for: New integrations, GPoS staking rewards Summary All five tokens share two traits: they’re tied to ambitious infrastructures (storage, oracles, gaming, metaverse, and indexing), and they’re under $1M in market cap despite exchange listings and DWF Labs backing. Token Market Cap 24h Volume Sector MARSH ~$764K ~$449K Data indexing / DePIN NEST ~$514K ~$461K Oracles / On-chain trading DREAMS ~$316K ~$200K GameFi / RPG SENSO ~$384K ~$276K AI / Metaverse CRU ~$997K ~$202K Decentralized Storage These low-cap gems are supported by DWF Labs , one of the most active Web3 market makers and incubators. While not guaranteed to moon, they’re part of real ecosystems, trade on reputable platforms, and could benefit from resurgence in their sectors (GameFi, AI, Oracles, DePIN, etc.). Perfect candidates for speculative tracking as altseason hits up. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Musk has long been a kingmaker in the meme coin scene , with past endorsements prompting the rise of the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pnut (PNUT). With hopes of salvaging the relationship fading, investor confidence has dropped, triggering a 5% daily loss and casting doubt on TRUMP’s ability to regain momentum. Trump’s was asked “Are you going to deport Elon Musk?” Trump: We will have to look into this. pic.twitter.com/joVUlxPkqU — Fake Batman (@FakeBatmanClub) July 2, 2025 As a hype-driven meme coin, TRUMP has relied heavily on high-profile influence—its last major spark being the late-May “Presidential Dinner” for top holders. Since then, it’s plunged more than 46%, as retail interest fizzles and no new endorsements have emerged. TRUMP Coin Price Analysis: Does Trump Face a Breakdown Without Musk? While the slide on the daily has seen the post-breakout momentum of a 1-month falling wedge pattern stall, the TRUMP coin price still echoes a familiar historical setup. Trump coin price 1-day chart, historic falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. It closely mirrors the April breakout from an identical falling wedge pattern—one that also saw price action retrace to a previous lower low as a launchpad for its next upwards move. Momentum indicators flash a similar setup too. The MACD line faces a potential death cross below the signal line—a sign the breakout may not have the conviction for a lasting uptrend. However, the RSI lingers in near-oversold conditions at 35. This suggests that sellers are near exhaustion, clearing the path for buyers to step in and continue the upward move. If this setup plays out like the April breakout, a 2x gain could be on the cards, targeting the early March peak at $17.50. However, weaker social backing this time—amid Trump’s fallout with Elon Musk—could sap sentiment and stall momentum. If sell pressure wins out, the pattern could fully break down, invalidating the bullish outlook. A reversal would rule out a new higher low since the mid-April market bottom and a longer-term uptrend, revisiting support around $7.25 in a 17% dip.

In an interview with Bloomberg , the SkyBridge Capital founder says he thinks the BTC treasury business model will fade away. “Right now we’re having this replicative treasury company idea… So, you know, it will fade.” The investor says that eventually, investors will begin to question why they’re paying a premium for a “middleman” to hold an asset when they could simply hold BTC on their own. Over the last year, there has been a trend among corporations of accumulating Bitcoin, both as a savings mechanism and a strategy to convert their shares into proxies for investing in the flagship cryptocurrency. Some of the recently launched BTC treasuries include Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC , Grant Cardone’s Cardone Capital , Gamestop and Japanese hotel company MetaPlanet . Other companies like Michael Saylor’s Strategy have been employing the same tactics for years. However, Scaramucci says he feels different about Strategy. “Saylor’s case is different, because he’s got a couple different products going now… I’m not negative on the others, because I’m too bullish on Bitcoin, but I would just say as an investor, you have to look through the underlying costs associated with each one of these treasury companies… “The question is, if you’re giving somebody $10 and they’re putting $8 into Bitcoin, are they going to do well? Yes. But you might have been better off just putting $10 into Bitcoin. I think that’s an issue.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the updated version of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Trump's total wealth remains stable at $6.4 billion, while cryptocurrency projects now account for a significant portion of his fortune. Previous reports have indicated that Trump has earned over $600 million from various ventures including golf clubs, licensing deals, and crypto. However, this new report includes the first detailed accounting of the Trump family’s expanding crypto investments, including NFT collections, decentralized finance (DeFi) project World Liberty Financial, and memecoins. Related News: Analysis Company Shares July Expectations for Bitcoin and Altcoins - Will They Continue to Sleep, or Will the Giant Awaken? According to Bloomberg, the Trump family made $390 million from the World Liberty token sale alone, and $150 million from the official Trump memecoin that launched in January. Those earnings could increase further as their crypto ventures expand. The Trump family also owns a 20 percent stake in crypto mining company American Bitcoin. The company is planned to go public through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. American Bitcoin was founded with mining company Hut 8 and infrastructure provider America Data Centers and aims to create a treasury reserve with the Bitcoins it produces. *This is not investment advice.

47289715,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=759289,1751486292,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47289715.jpeg,Ethereum-linked stocks jumped as companies shifted reserves from bitcoin to ETH,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-linked-stocks-rise-on-tokenization/,"Ethereum-linked stocks saw a sharp boost on Wednesday, as companies pivoting toward ETH strategies caught the attention of traders. The rally came while hype around stablecoins and tokenization picked up again across the crypto industry, according to reporting from CNBC. The biggest gainer was BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin mining firm that decided this week to make Ethereum its primary treasury reserve asset. Shares jumped nearly 20% after the news and have now exploded over 1,000% since that announcement. SharpLink Gaming, a betting firm that also added ETH to its treasury strategy, rose more than 11%. And Bit Digital, which left bitcoin mining behind last week to focus fully on Ethereum treasury holdings and staking, saw its shares increase by more than 6%. Firms adopt Ethereum for reserves and staking Traders responded to growing signs that Ethereum isn’t just surviving its recent slump, it’s being adopted in new ways. One of the strongest signals came from Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens, who said : “We’re finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they’re going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways.” At the same time, crypto ETF flows showed a clear divergence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which had seen inflows for 15 straight trading sessions, broke that streak on Tuesday. While that happened, Ethereum ETFs brought in $40 million in inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust pulling in most of it. ETH ETFs had looked dead just a month ago, with traders calling them zombie funds. Now they’re seeing fresh interest again. Ethereum itself rose 5% on the day, based on pricing from Coin Metrics. But it’s still down 24% in 2025. The network has been under pressure since its last major technical upgrade failed to boost revenue. Its long-term value is also being questioned as faster rivals like Solana grab more attention. All of this is happening in a year where geopolitical chaos continues to keep investors on edge. Tokenization and stablecoin news fuel Ether demand Despite that, Ethereum’s role in tokenization is driving new activity. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee called Ethereum “the backbone and architecture” of stablecoins. Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), the two biggest stablecoins, are both issued on the Ethereum network. Lee’s comment points to why ETH is still central when it comes to building stable digital payment rails. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, known as BUIDL (short for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), also started out on Ethereum before expanding to other blockchains. Tokenization is the process of creating digital versions of real-world assets or securities and putting them on-chain. But people who hold those tokenized assets don’t own the actual underlying thing. They hold the crypto equivalent. Robinhood added to the momentum this week when it said it would allow trading of tokenized US stocks and ETFs across Europe. That follows a wave of renewed attention toward stablecoins in June, sparked by Circle’s IPO and a US Senate vote to approve the GENIUS Act , a stablecoin regulation bill. Ethereum will turn ten years old at the end of July. It’s still down roughly 75% from its all-time high. But as ETH-related stocks and funds climb, and more firms ditch bitcoin for Ethereum-focused treasuries, traders are watching closely. Whether it rebounds or not, it’s still in the middle of crypto’s biggest conversation.

Despite ongoing development across its ecosystem, ADA’s price action has cooled, and investors are beginning to reassess their Q3 strategies. Meanwhile, a rising DeFi competitor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining serious ground, rapidly positioning itself as one of the top cryptos to watch this summer. At present, Mutuum Finance is at phase 5 of its presale and has sold out over 50% of this phase. The project has already received more than $11.4 million and has drawn close to 12,600 investors. Early projections hint that Mutuum Finance is on path toward the $1 mark if adoption scales. As ADA treads water, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a strong altcoin coin for Q3 and beyond. Cardano’s Mid‑Year Outlook Cardano (ADA) is at around the price of $0.5613 which has been trading under the support of its price at $0.56 following a price decrease on low volume. Nevertheless, some are optimistic, July tends to deliver upbeat results as ADA builds an average of more than 8% during this month. Today, such news as the incorporation of Shinrai into Brave may lead to increased on-chain transactions. In total, ADA is becoming an attractive Layer -1 solution that has an adequate risk-reward ratio on the way into the coming quarter 3, in contrast to the narrative of high volatility, which accompanies Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance’s Phase 5 Presale Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance presale has started and the momentum is increasing very fast. There are more than 12,600 investors who have already joined the project, and raised over $11.4 million, proving that it is not a mere DeFi experiment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining serious traction, over $11.4 million raised and 12,600+ investors onboard at just $0.03 per token. As Phase 5 passes the 50% mark, price increases are imminent. USD-Pegged Stablecoin and $50K Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance plans to launch an Ethereum-based fully-collateralized USD stablecoin. The asset is stable during market downturns unlike algorithmic stablecoins which are likely to depeg in a volatile market. Mutuum Finance as a part of its focus on security and transparency has also opened its official Bug Bounty Program in cooperation with CertiK with awards amounting to 50,000 USDT. The prize is divided in four levels, critical, major, minor and low where all vulnerability levels are covered and rewarded. This is another feature that shows the proactive attitude of Mutuum to developing trust in the form of tangible infrastructure and effective security. Transformation of DeFi to a Proven Dual-Lending Formula Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features a hybrid lending platform that combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is designed to meet the need of any investor who wants to earn a passive income by putting his USDT in smart contract pools which ensure stable passive income based on its interest rate which fluctuates up and down according to the market conditions. In addition the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model allows lenders and borrowers to remain fully involved in deciding the terms of a trade with no third-party involvement. Cardano’s momentum is fading, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surges ahead. With $11.4M raised by 12,600+ investors and Phase 5 50% sold out at just $0.03, upside potential is clear. Its dual-lending model, stablecoin, and CertiK audit add credibility. Secure your position before the next price hike.

Bitcoin tested resistance, Ethereum showed signs of consolidation, and Solana continued to battle bearish pressure. While gains were mixed, the underlying setups hint at brewing volatility and opportunities ahead. Whether you're tracking momentum or hunting early signals, the latest movements are worth your attention. This roundup is powered by Outset PR —a crypto-native agency that aligns high-precision storytelling with real-time market insight. Bitcoin Bears Hold Ground as Bulls Struggle to Gain Momentum Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently in a tug-of-war between its bulls and bears, with prices bouncing between around $102,000 and nearly $110,000. The nearest resistance sits at close to $114,000, and it has struggled to break past this level. The bears seem to have a slight edge as Bitcoin’s price recently dipped by over 5% this month. However, there's still hope for bulls, as long-term trends show a growth of 9% over six months. To ignite a stronger rally, Bitcoin would need to surge roughly 15% from its current range to breach $122,000, where a significant resistance level lies. Ethereum Struggles to Break Out, Bulls Await Key Resistance Level Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is hovering between two and a half to three thousand dollars, showing a minor decline in recent weeks. The bulls seem hesitant but remain hopeful as they eye the three thousand sixty-dollar mark as a potential breakout point. The recent downtrend of about five percent over the week suggests caution, but the situation isn’t overly bleak yet. If Ethereum can rally past the top resistance barrier, it might push toward nearly three thousand five hundred, marking a potential climb of around twenty-five percent. However, if it dips below the support level of around two thousand one hundred eighty-five, a further decline might be on the horizon. Currently, market trends indicate a testing time for Ethereum enthusiasts. Solana Struggles as Bears Take the Lead Source: tradingview Solana is currently trading between $139.87 and $167.27, showing signs of bearish momentum. Its price has slipped over 4% this week, nearly 18% this past month, and over 21% in the last six months, reflecting weakness in bullish support. With an RSI around 50, the market isn't oversold or overbought, but bears seem to dominate. Resistance is around $181, with stronger resistance at $208, making these levels crucial for any bullish breakout. Support is found at $126.67 and further down at $99.27, which might see testing if the bearish trend continues. Solana's potential upside from its current range could reach 25% if bulls can reclaim momentum and aim for resistance levels.

In a new CNBC interview, Lee says the S&P 500 is in the midst of the “most hated V-shaped” rally after the stock market index recovered from a 2025 low of 4,835 to a new all-time high of 6,215 points. According to Lee, many investors dumped their stock holdings during the market’s early-year decline, only to be left on the sidelines as equities staged a strong rebound. “A lot of folks liquidated at the lows, but we know that whenever the VIX (volatility index) is above 60 and falls below 30, you’ve made a decisive low. And now visibility is better, tariffs aren’t as bad as we expected, and the inflation impact has been very muted, and outside of tariffs, [underlying] inflation is much lower than people expected.” Looking ahead, Lee believes that there’s no reason to be bearish on the S&P 500 after casting off five shocks in half a decade. “I think there’s more upside to 6,600 [points] because the P/E (price to earnings) of the market can go up a lot. We already had five shocks. We had the Covid shock, the supply-chain shock, the inflation shock, the Fed-fastest-hikes-in-history [shock] and then we had the tariff shock. So five shocks in five years, and earnings kept growing. If this was a stock, we’d say, ‘Look if you try to kill it five times and it still grew earnings, we would put a much higher multiple.” As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,198 points.

XRP is showing encouraging growth in wallet activity ahead of key updates, while HYPE traders remain cautious following a recent drop. But one project is shifting the focus to long-term commitment from the very beginning. BlockDAG is doing more than attracting interest. It’s keeping users engaged through features like Buyer Battles, where competition and rewards create stickiness before any exchange launch. This strategy not only boosts presale activity but also builds a deeper sense of community. For those weighing their next move, BlockDAG remains one of the smartest crypto coins to buy now. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Builds Loyalty Beyond the Presale Buyer Battles isn’t just a promotional tool; it’s a system designed to build lasting commitment. The feature ranks top buyers in each presale batch, offering recognition, exclusive benefits, and visibility. What looks like a ranking board is actually a powerful loyalty framework that keeps users connected through every stage. By mixing competition with rewards, Buyer Battles turns typical presales into ongoing participation. Instead of a one-time buy and wait, users are encouraged to watch, compete, and climb the leaderboard. This constant engagement builds momentum toward the mainnet launch and strengthens the user relationship with BlockDAG. The results are clear. BlockDAG’s presale has already pulled in $327 million, with over 23.5 billion coins sold. It’s currently in batch 29, priced at $0.0276. Yet, through the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, users can still buy BDAG for $0.0016 until August 11, which reflects the original batch 1 rate. With this setup, BlockDAG is doing more than driving sales. It’s creating a community of active participants prepared for what’s next. For anyone exploring crypto coins to buy now with built-in loyalty, BlockDAG offers a smart and structured opportunity. Breaking Down the Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Drop The recent Hyperliquid (HYPE) price drop has caught the attention of traders after its steep correction. After jumping from nearly $17 to a high of $45, the coin has pulled back around 20 percent and now trades below $38. This slide happened even as Eyenovia and Lion Group made big treasury announcements, which failed to keep demand up. Many traders took the opportunity to secure profits, triggering heavy selling pressure. Technically, support is found near $38.13. If that holds, the price may steady, but if it breaks, a dip to the $27 to $31 range is possible. Falling trading volume has also weakened the token’s buy-and-burn feature, which had previously helped keep prices high. Why 2025 Might Be a Key Year for XRP Growth There’s renewed focus on XRP price analysis following a sharp increase in network activity and several big updates ahead. For example, XRP Ledger address usage jumped from an average of 35,000 to more than 295,000 daily users, suggesting growing traction. A new sidechain compatible with Ethereum is also expected by June’s end. Over 90 projects plan to build on this upgrade, which could expand XRP’s utility even further. At the same time, a possible spot ETF approval is drawing attention, with public feedback due in July and a decision expected by October. Ripple’s push into tokenizing real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries, backed by strategic collaborations, has already added $157 million to the network, a 35% jump in just one month. Loyal User Bases Could Shape the Next Phase in Crypto While price moves can dominate the headlines, long-term value often hinges on community engagement. XRP’s growing adoption and HYPE’s recent decline show how updates and market reactions drive short-term shifts. BlockDAG, though, is focusing on building from within. With features like Buyer Battles and a strong presale funnel, BlockDAG is cultivating a loyal base that goes beyond price speculation. This design for sustained participation could be what sets it apart in the coming cycles. For those seeking crypto coins to buy now with long-term upside and strong foundations, BlockDAG offers a compelling path built on user commitment.

Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5498 Market cap $577M Trading volume (24-hour) $14.95M Circulating supply 1.04B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5514 24-hour low $0.5145 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.31% 50-day SMA $0.5907 14-Day RSI 40.72 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 63 (Greed) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6576 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos breaks key resistance, surging 6.26%. Strong bullish momentum, but volume isn’t keeping pace. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ sees over 6% price jump Tezos has made a notable rally today, June 2, climbing by 6.26%, with a strong bullish candlestick closing near $0.5486. This surge breaks out of a period of consolidation between $0.51 and $0.53, and shows room to continue upward. The Bollinger Bands are widening, indicating volatility and potential for further upward movement. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD, which had previously shown weakness with negative histograms, has now flipped to positive momentum, supporting the bullish trend. However, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) is still trending sideways, suggesting caution as volume isn’t surging with the same intensity as price movement. The significant breakout over the $0.57 level could signal further upside. A price pullback toward $0.50 could serve as a buy zone. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ tests the critical resistance at $0.56 Per the 4-hour chart, Tezos has surged above $0.54, touching a high near $0.5518, challenging resistance levels from earlier in the week. The Balance of Power (BoP) shows increasing buying strength, reflected in the recent price action. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The price is testing the critical resistance at $0.56. If this level is broken, a move toward $0.58 is highly likely. However, the potential for a retracement to $0.53 should not be dismissed, as the market has experienced multiple rejections in the past at this resistance zone.

Tezos shows a promising upward momentum, especially with the breakout on the 1-day chart. Traders can expect further gains, potentially testing $0.57, but also remain cautious of possible pullbacks to $0.50-$0.53. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it is currently trading between $0.5145 and $0.5302.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-02 20:05:00

The deal, revealed Tuesday, comes as momentum builds around a possible green light for Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs). DeFi Development Corp Doubles Down on Solana With $100M Raise Plan According to the company, the offering will be made to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. Buyers may also be granted an option to purchase an additional $25 million of the notes within 13 days of the initial issuance. 1/ Today, we announce a $100M private convertible note offering, with plans to accumulate more $SOL . Here’s what it means. pic.twitter.com/LGdJAuKDM6 — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) July 1, 2025 The notes, which will be unsecured and carry interest payable twice a year, mature on July 1, 2030. Prior to January 2030, they can only be converted under specific conditions. After that, conversion will be allowed at any time before maturity. Holders will have the option to convert into cash, company stock, or a mix of both, depending on terms set during pricing. DeFi Development Corp plans to use part of the funds to repurchase its own common stock through a prepaid forward agreement with one of the note purchasers. The rest of the proceeds will support general operations, including further accumulation of Solana (SOL), a central part of the company’s asset strategy. The structure of the offering also includes a hedge mechanism. Investors may use derivatives to hedge their exposure, potentially influencing the price of the company’s stock. These moves could affect the market not only at issuance but throughout the life of the notes, especially during any conversion windows. However, this fundraising effort follows a recent setback. On June 11, the company withdrew its $1 billion registration filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after regulators found it ineligible for the streamlined S-3 form. The disqualification was due to a missing internal controls report in its latest Form 10-K. Originally filed in April, the S-3 was intended to raise capital to build a sizable SOL treasury, mirroring Strategy’s Bitcoin approach, with returns expected through long-term staking and asset appreciation. Despite the regulatory hiccup, DeFi Development Corp remains focused on executing its Solana-centric vision, now shifting to the private markets for funding. With SOL ETF Interest Building, DeFi Development Corp Plays Offense After 16% Stock Dip The fundraising push came shortly after DFDV’s stock fell 16% on June 24, indicating a strategic move to stabilize capital and reassure investors. The timing also aligns with growing institutional interest in Solana, as the SEC approaches key decisions on several crypto ETF proposals, among them, spot Solana ETFs that could further boost demand for the token. Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart of Bloomberg recently raised their approval odds for SOL, XRP, and LTC ETFs to near certainty, with final deadlines approaching in October. Bloomberg ETF analysts have sharply raised expectations for US approval of spot funds tracking Solana, Litecoin, and XRP. #ETFs #XRP https://t.co/dKK2ZIbW8c — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 A broader crypto index ETF could be approved even sooner. According to the analysts, the odds for that product hitting the market this week now sit at 95%. A wave of new altcoin ETFs, including for Dogecoin, Cardano, and Polkadot, could follow before year-end. On June 1, the Rex Shares–Osprey SOL + Staking ETF ($SSK) officially launched , becoming the first U.S. ETF to offer staking exposure. The fund meets regulatory requirements by allocating 40% of its assets to overseas-listed Solana products, sidestepping stricter rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Just a day earlier, the SEC approved Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to convert into an ETF, giving indirect Solana exposure alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano. SEC Approves Grayscale Conversion of the Digital Large Cap Fund, turning it into a spot ETF tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum and other majors. @Grayscale and @SECGov filings indicate trading will start soon, pending logistics. #ETF #Crypto https://t.co/tGWFaISU19 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 1, 2025 With ETF speculation heating up and Solana-linked products gaining traction, DeFi Development Corp’s move indicates both a defensive and an opportunistic play. If ETF approval lands in the coming weeks, the firm could be positioned to capitalize on renewed demand for exposure to SOL. The offering, however, still depends on market conditions and final pricing agreements with institutional buyers. The company has not disclosed when the transaction will close.
