The executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets highlighted that the stablecoin legislation could arrive at the president’s desk in a few months. Stablecoin Sits at the Top of US Government Priority List During the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, held in New York on March 18, Hines reiterated the imminence of the regulation, especially after the Senate Banking Committee voted to approve the GENIUS Act. Bo Hines’ statement suggests the US government is keen on maintaining the dollar’s dominance against all odds. He also highlighted the US government’s stance towards stablecoin, noting that it remains a priority in the nation’s regulatory agenda. Truly, Bitcoin’s strategic reserve has garnered positive attention these past few weeks, but this does not relegate the stable assets to the background. Momentum is building gradually, so it may not be too long before the stablecoin legislation, first introduced by Sen. Bill Hagerty , gets to Trump’s table. Senate Banking Committee Advances Proposed Bill Last Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted to push the stablecoin bill to the full Senate. It is worth noting that none of the amendments suggested by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren were listed in the bill, not even her proposal to limit stablecoin issuance to banking institutions. While Senator Tim Scott of the Senate Banking Committee termed the bill a victory for innovation, Warren claimed that it would bring chaos. “Without changes, this bill will supercharge the financing of terrorism. It will make sanctions evasion by Iran, North Korea, and Russia easier,” she argued. Stablecoin Market Nears Bull Cycle Amid this regulatory unsettlement, the stablecoin market is seeing a slight rally. The supply of leading stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC has significantly increased around market top cycles . Analysts and market observers have reasons to believe the current bull cycle has not reached its climax. According to IntoTheBlock, the upward trajectory of stablecoin supply supports this assumption.

Nick said the odds of getting through the Bitcoin Act were increasing for several reasons. The legislation mandates a blueprint for the US Treasury to purchase 1 million BTC over the next five years. He explained that Congress is more knowledgeable about Bitcoin than ever before and is growing appreciative of the precarious conditions of the national debt and deficit. He added that the public was realizing the importance of diversifying the national strategic reserve and owning a commodity asset—in this case, something precious like BTC with gold. Congressman Begich has been pushing support for the bill recently, which has received bipartisan co-sponsorship by several members of Congress. Other motion sponsors include Rep. Pat Harrigan (RNC), Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), and Rep. Michael Rulli (R-OH), who understand Bitcoin’s promise to provide better national financial security. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of the longest-standing Bitcoin proponents, has introduced companion legislation in the upper chamber, adding to what is looking to be some momentum for the bill. The industry is rallying behind the BITCOIN bill, and the public is backing it as well The bill has received interest in the industry and beyond from proponents of digital assets and other political leaders. Bitcoin Policy Institute and other commentators have complimented the bill, stating it is part of a broader trend to update the financial infrastructure and utilize fewer fiat reserves. Public interest in the Bitcoin Act is also growing, with the Bitcoin community and financial pundits invoking the law’s ability to act as an inflation hedge and protector against economic volatility. Social media has also embraced the bill significantly, with community groups championing the idea. The legislation suggests a framework for potentially accumulating 1 million BTC over five years, with purchases of 200,000 BTC per year. However, all of these acquisitions are required under the bill to occur by budget-neutral mechanisms, namely Federal Reserve remittances and gold certificate revaluations, thereby keeping taxpayer burdens to an absolute minimum. The bill also asserts BTC self-custody rights, ensuring that federal agents do not hinder individuals’ ability to own and transact with Bitcoin. This has attracted the attention of both libertarian-leaning policymakers and advocates of financial freedom. The US is advancing its financial leadership in digital assets The Bitcoin Act follows the President’s recent executive order calling for establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” indicative of the administration’s commitment to fully harnessing the future of digital assets. If successful, the bill would enshrine BTC’s position in national financial strategy, providing a template for other countries to follow. As Congressman Begich drifts between, supporters, policymakers, financial institutions and global markets will watch and listen closely to the bill’s progression. As adoption continues, the Bitcoin Act would radically shift how the US government relates to BTC and the broader digital economy. Congressman Nick Begich stated that the United States’ proof of reserves system, as defined in the bill, would be comparable to the one the Central American country uses, whereby the government’s BTC address is published. He said one of the enduring problems around Fort Knox was that there was no public auditing to back it up, which led to concerns over the gold content. Some commentators assumed the US held less gold than it said; others that it held more. Begich pointed out that there was no way American citizens could independently verify the existence of the gold we were being told the country had.

According to Nazarov, the administration is determined to end regulatory pressure and position the country as a leader in the burgeoning Web3 economy. Speaking about the event, Nazarov noted the increasing interaction between policymakers and the crypto industry. While optimism about the administration’s approach to digital assets is growing, he noted that much of the market’s initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin was already priced in during the election period. However, he expects greater regulatory clarity to pave the way for greater institutional adoption that could significantly expand the market. “As we get more clarity, and especially as that clarity allows more regulated entities to enter the industry, the numbers that these entities represent will make it clear that this is a much bigger market than it is now,” Nazarov said. While much of the summit was spent with public statements from President Trump and tech investor David Sacks, Nazarov shed light on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, noting widespread optimism among industry leaders who appreciated the participation of key officials, including the Treasury Secretary, the Commerce Secretary and members of Congress such as Tom Emmer and Bryan Steil. Nazarov noted that it is now increasingly recognized that the crypto industry has been unfairly targeted in past regulatory environments. “It is now increasingly clear that our industry has been unfairly persecuted in a way that has prevented it from thriving in the United States,” he said. According to Nazarov, the administration’s strategy revolves around securing U.S. leadership in the global crypto economy. “The general motto of this administration is that if something has a global impact or an impact on the U.S. economy, then they want to be in a leadership position,” he said. He argued that this commitment was underlined by the presence of senior officials and their commitment to ensuring that the crypto industry was no longer stifled by unfair policies. He said the government’s goal was to create an environment where blockchain innovation could thrive and make the U.S. a dominant force in the Web3 financial system. Related News: BREAKING: One of the Oldest Altcoins Decides to Change Its Name - It Will Change Completely When asked what steps the U.S. should take to capitalize on this position, Nazarov pointed to the country’s already strong financial system and reputation for reliable transactions and low levels of fraud. He outlined three key priorities to further solidify his leadership: Issuing High-Quality Digital Assets – The US should focus on creating the most reliable stablecoins, tokenized funds, commodity coins, and tokenized real estate assets. Automating Compliance – Reducing compliance costs through blockchain technology will make operations more efficient and attract international investors. Increasing Market Share in the Web3 Economy – By implementing these improvements, the US can expand its role in the emerging decentralized financial landscape. Nazarov believes that if the US successfully addresses these priorities, it could not only support the growth of the crypto industry domestically but also gain a competitive advantage in the broader global financial system. *This is not investment advice.

41884950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141217,1742340011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Survey: 83% of Institutions to Supercharge Crypto Allocation in 2024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/institutions-supercharge-crypto-allocation/,"Are you ready for a seismic shift in the financial landscape? Buckle up, because a groundbreaking new survey suggests institutional investors are about to massively increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies. Imagine a world where Wall Street giants aren’t just dipping their toes, but diving headfirst into the crypto pool. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the compelling reality painted by a recent report from Coinbase and EY-Parthenon. Let’s delve into the exciting details of this eye-opening survey and explore what it means for the future of digital assets and, potentially, your investment portfolio. Unveiling the Surge in Institutional Crypto Investment The headline is attention-grabbing for a reason: a staggering 83% of institutions surveyed are planning to pump more capital into crypto this year. This isn’t just a marginal increase; it’s a clear signal of growing confidence and conviction in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This data emerges from a comprehensive survey conducted by Coinbase in collaboration with EY-Parthenon, tapping into the insights of over 350 institutional investors. These aren’t just small firms; we’re talking about significant players managing substantial assets. The survey paints a picture of a financial world where institutional crypto investment is rapidly becoming mainstream, not a niche experiment. But what’s driving this bullish sentiment? Let’s break down the key factors: Attractive Returns: Institutions are laser-focused on generating returns, and cryptocurrencies are increasingly seen as a prime opportunity. Respondents in the survey overwhelmingly rated cryptocurrencies as the most attractive avenue for risk-adjusted returns over the next three years. In a world of low interest rates and uncertain traditional markets, crypto’s potential for high growth is proving irresistible. Portfolio Diversification: Smart investors know the importance of diversification. Cryptocurrencies offer a unique asset class with low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds, making them an attractive tool for diversifying portfolios and mitigating overall risk. As institutions seek to build resilient portfolios, crypto allocation becomes a strategic imperative. Maturity of the Crypto Market: The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly in recent years. Improved infrastructure, clearer regulations in some jurisdictions (though still evolving), and the emergence of institutional-grade custody solutions have reduced perceived risks and made it easier for large players to participate. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Let’s be honest, FOMO plays a role. As early institutional adopters demonstrate success in the crypto space, others are feeling the pressure to get in on the action. No institution wants to be left behind as a potentially transformative asset class takes off. The 5% Threshold: A Significant Crypto Allocation Milestone While the 83% figure is impressive, another data point from the survey is particularly noteworthy: a substantial portion of respondents plan to allocate more than 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Why is this significant? A 5% allocation, while seemingly small, represents a major commitment from institutional investors. For large funds managing billions or trillions of dollars, a 5% allocation translates to a massive influx of capital into the crypto market. This level of crypto allocation signals a serious long-term investment strategy, not just speculative trading. Consider this in the context of the broader financial world. Institutional investors are typically conservative and deliberate in their investment decisions. For them to earmark over 5% of their portfolios for a relatively new and volatile asset class like crypto speaks volumes about their conviction. It suggests they view crypto not just as a fleeting trend, but as a fundamental part of the future financial ecosystem. Who are these Institutional Investors? The survey encompasses a diverse range of institutional investors . While the specific breakdown of respondents isn’t detailed in the provided content, we can infer that it likely includes: Hedge Funds: Known for their agility and appetite for alternative investments, hedge funds have been among the early adopters of crypto. Asset Managers: Traditional asset management firms are increasingly exploring crypto to meet client demand and enhance portfolio performance. Pension Funds and Endowments: While typically more conservative, some pension funds and endowments are beginning to cautiously allocate to crypto, recognizing its potential long-term growth. Corporations: Companies are exploring crypto for treasury management, payments, and even as part of their business models. The increasing participation of diverse institutional investors underscores the broadening appeal and acceptance of cryptocurrencies across the financial spectrum. Navigating the Challenges of Cryptocurrency Adoption While the survey paints a rosy picture of institutional crypto adoption, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain. Cryptocurrency adoption , particularly at the institutional level, is not without its hurdles. These include: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty The lack of clear and consistent regulations globally remains a significant concern for institutions. Regulatory ambiguity can create compliance headaches and hinder investment decisions. Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Managing this volatility and its impact on portfolio risk is a key challenge for institutional investors. Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount. Institutions require robust, institutional-grade custody solutions, which are still evolving in some areas. ESG Concerns Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are increasingly important to institutional investors. The energy consumption of some cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, raises ESG concerns that need to be addressed. Education and Expertise Understanding the complexities of the crypto market and blockchain technology requires specialized knowledge. Institutions need to build internal expertise or partner with firms that possess it. Despite these challenges, the survey data suggests that institutions are increasingly confident in their ability to navigate these hurdles and capitalize on the opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The institutional embrace of crypto has implications for everyone, not just large financial firms. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Validate Your Crypto Thesis: If you’re already invested in crypto, this survey reinforces the long-term potential of the asset class. Institutional interest is a powerful validation signal. Consider Diversification: If you’re not yet invested in crypto, now might be the time to consider a small allocation as part of a diversified crypto portfolio . Follow the lead of the institutions and explore the potential benefits. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about regulatory developments, technological advancements, and institutional adoption trends to make informed investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors are typically long-term oriented. Adopt a similar mindset when it comes to crypto. Focus on the long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Conclusion: The Institutional Crypto Wave is Building The survey findings are clear: institutional interest in crypto is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful wave building momentum. The fact that 83% of institutions plan to increase their crypto allocation this year, with a significant portion aiming for over 5%, is a resounding endorsement of the asset class. While challenges remain, the potential rewards are clearly compelling institutions to embrace crypto. This institutional influx of capital and expertise is likely to further mature the crypto market, drive innovation, and ultimately pave the way for wider adoption across the financial world. The message is loud and clear: institutional crypto is here to stay, and it’s poised to play an increasingly significant role in the future of finance.

Last around $124, the Solana price remains in a clear downtrend from the record highs it hit in January near $300, and is currently down around 57% from these peaks. Recent rejections of the 21DMA in recent weeks, as well as a strong rejection of the 200DMA earlier this month, suggest that the bears remain very much in control of this market. And weak interest from institutional investors in the new Solana futures product on CME will give the bears further ammunition to push the price lower. First day for Solana CME futures. $12m notional volume pic.twitter.com/OTSfw90tJf — adam (@abetrade) March 18, 2025 Bearish conditions in the Solana market are justified in the context of broader macro worries, which have taken a heavy toll on risk appetite in recent weeks, and declining on-chain activity. While the US economy continues to hold up well in early 2025, risks to the medium-term outlook have risen substantially thanks to Trump’s trade wars and D.O.G.E-related government spending cuts. The collapse of US consumers: Unemployment expectations in the US are now ABOVE 2020 levels and at their highest since 2008. In 2024, a poll showed that a whopping 56% of Americans thought the US was in a recession. Is the US set to enter a recession? (a thread) pic.twitter.com/iQhcQkRGUv — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 18, 2025 Trump administration officials and even the President himself have warned that a period of adjustment could be coming that could be painful for the economy and markets. And, all the while, since peaking in the immediate aftermath of the Trump and Melania meme coin launches in January, Solana’s on-chain activity has been in decline. Solana transaction fees, a proxy for on-chain activity, just reached its weakest levels since September, suggesting lackluster demand for block space, per The Block . How Low Could the Solana Price Go? The fundamental and technical pictures both look downbeat for the Solana price. A further decline feels highly likely. But how low might the Solana price go? Well, $110 has been a solid area of support going back to mid-2024. If that level breaks, a rush down towards the near notable area around $80 seems likely. But depending on how bad things get on the macro front, Solana could see a much bigger drop than that. Let’s say the US economy does fall into recession, but stubbornly high inflation complicates the Fed’s easing efforts, and the federal government seems reluctant to step in with an increase in stimulus via more government spending. That could revive talks of a new “great recession”. And this could be an environment where Solana collapses all the way back to its early 2023 levels in the $15-30 area. That would mark a decline of as much as 90% from its January highs. In the world of crypto, this is not unheard of decline. In fact, in altcoin markets its to be expected. And Solana already has a history of similar declines, dropping 97% from its 2021 peak above $260 to its 2022 trough around $8. Buy the Solana Dip? Savvy investors would view a Solana price drop back to $30 as a generation investment opportunity. That’s because, while macro uncertainties could persist for some time, the future for crypto is looking brighter than it ever has before. The industry has been given a historic thumbs up from the US government and global Bitcoin adoption is surging. The Trump administration is stuffed with crypto HODLers and supporters. David Sacks, the current White House Crypto and AI Czar was a former investor. Medium-term macro risks aside, the longer-term outlook for the crypto industry looks as strong as its ever looked. Macro fears will eventually ease and, if financial conditions ease substantially in the coming years, crypto markets are set to pop.

The media outlet explained: “Receiving a heavy penalty would have a negative impact on Bithumb’s IPO [bid]. As such, Bithumb cannot help but be sensitive to the probe’s results.” The second hurdle pertains to Bithumb’s complex ownership structure, and ongoing questions about who owns the platform. While the legal case has resolved some issues, questions still remain over the elusive businessman Kang Jong-hyun ’s connections with the exchange. The media outlet wrote that “clarifying its governance structure would be an urgent task for both Lee and Bithumb.” In a further development, the media outlet MTN News reported that Bithumb will create a KB “account opening window” at its customer service lounge in Seoul’s Gangnam District on March 24.

Nvidia, the titan of GPUs, just dropped a bombshell at GTC 2025, unveiling two game-changing “personal AI supercomputers.” These aren’t your average desktops; we’re talking about powerhouses designed to bring cutting-edge AI development right to your fingertips. For crypto enthusiasts and tech innovators alike, this announcement signals a massive leap forward in accessible AI power, potentially revolutionizing everything from blockchain analytics to decentralized AI applications. Let’s dive into what makes these new machines so groundbreaking. Unveiling the Power of Personal AI Supercomputers Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s charismatic CEO, took center stage at GTC 2025 to introduce the DGX Spark and DGX Station – the vanguard of what he calls “personal AI supercomputers.” These aren’t just incremental upgrades; they represent a fundamental shift in how AI computing power is distributed and utilized. Huang boldly declared, “This is the computer of the age of AI,” emphasizing that these machines are the blueprint for future computing. But what exactly makes them ‘supercomputers’ and why should you care? Here’s the lowdown on these AI powerhouses: Democratizing AI Development: For years, supercomputing-level AI capabilities were confined to massive data centers and deep-pocketed corporations. Nvidia is changing the game by bringing this immense processing power to individual developers, researchers, and enterprises, effectively democratizing access to advanced AI supercomputers . Edge Computing Revolution: Both DGX Spark and DGX Station are designed for “edge” deployment.

While the outlook remains bearish, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has issued a $1 million forecast for the coin in the mid-term. In an investor note issued on March 18, Hougan uncovered why Bitcoin price reacts the way it does during an economic crisis. Bitcoin Price and Macroeconomic Trend According to the Bitwise executive in his weekly CIO memo , Bitcoin does not always behave like a hedge against crisis, which is why most people buy it. There are instances where BTC price reacts to macroeconomic news in correlation with the broader US stock market. Ahead of the March 2025 FOMC Meeting , this consolidation in Bitcoin price is showing up again. Amid this uncertainty, the Bitwise CIO said staying invested in BTC is the recipe for long-term growth. He highlighted how the price of the coin largely soared over 190% in subsequent years after a dip. He labeled this trend a “dip then rip” phenomenon, one he believes might soon play out for the coin. Using the Discounted Cashflow Analysis (DCA) discount factor, Hougan projected that a $1 million Bitcoin price target by 2029 implies a net value of $218,604 today if investors apply a 50% discount. Where is the BTC Price Heading? In his analysis, Matt Hougan showcased the correlation between BTC and the US Tariff war. He highlighted how BTC’s reaction solely hinges on its low liquidity. Per the analysis, in the short term, the geopolitical tariff war injects liquidity into the market. If this trend does not change in the short term, it might favor the coin as Bitcoin serves as a hedge against economic uncertainty. While many have speculated about the future of the coin, Matt Hougan reiterated Bitwise’s long-term price target of up to $1.1 million for Bitcoin. At the moment, the coin traded within a tight range, moving from a low of $81,179.99 to a high of $84,230. The headwind is not cleared, but experts, including Cathie Wood, have predicted a deflationary boom ahead . Regulations to Boost Market Outlook According to ecosystem projections, the US government’s pivot to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve might play a long-term role in shaping the asset’s future. With a decisive move by proponents like Senator Cynthia Lummis, who re-introduced the Bitcoin Act Bill , institutional investors’ confidence in the coin is growing. The shifting regulation around BTC is also spreading to other asset classes, like stablecoins in the ecosystem.

Recent technical analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency’s price could decline further, potentially reaching as low as $1,060. Multiple factors, including weak market structure, lack of bullish momentum, and negative on-chain data, influence the downward movement. Ethereum Price Faces Continuous Rejections at $4,000 Resistance According to price analysis by Mags , Ethereum has failed to break the $4,000 resistance level three times in this cycle. Each rejection has led to a further decline, with the latest downturn pushing the cryptocurrency below its mid-range level. The price is now also trading below an upward-sloping trendline support, which had been holding since the previous cycle bottom. Analysts warn that Ethereum could continue its decline if it does not reclaim $2,500 in the near term. A further drop below the current levels could expose ETH to a potential fall toward $1,060, where the range low is positioned. The lack of strong support suggests that downward movement remains a strong possibility. Source: X Market data indicates that Ethereum price remains under bearish pressure. The altcoin has not shown signs of establishing a solid bottom, raising the risk of prolonged losses. Without a strong recovery above resistance levels, the bearish trend may persist. ETH/BTC Pair Remains in a Bearish Trend Additionally, the ETH/BTC trading pair has been underperforming, signaling weakness in Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the three-day chart remains below 30, a level that often indicates oversold conditions. However, historical trends show that oversold levels have not always marked a definitive bottom for Ethereum price. Since mid-2024, ETH/BTC has recorded multiple breakdowns, with declines of 13%, 21%, 25%, and 19.5%. The 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) continue to trend downward, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Additionally, analyst CarpeNoctom has pointed out that ETH/BTC has yet to confirm a bullish divergence on its weekly chart, further suggesting that ETH price could struggle to find support. Source: X Declining ETF Flows and Weak On-Chain Activity Since the start of the year, Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen consistent outflows. In March 2021, the net assets of spot Ether ETFs decreased by 9.8%, amounting to $2.54 billion. Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, suffered a slight decrease of 2.35% to $35.74 billion. This divergence indicates that institutional fund managers are losing interest in Ethereum. Further, there is decreasing network usage evidenced by on-chain data. It is worth mentioning the median gas fees have declined on the mainnet and fluctuating at approximately 1.12 GWEI in March. This is a far lower turnover as compared to the previous calendar year, meaning that there are less transaction taking place on the network. Technical analysts believe that the future performance of Ethereum price is not looking good as it remains below some key levels. The next level of support is at $1,060 which blends with the lower limit of the long-term trading range. As of this writing, the altcoin is trading at $1,923.03, which is 27.81% low from the previous month. Despite a market cap of $231.96 billion, the ongoing downward trend suggests continued selling pressure.

Blockpit, headquartered in Linz and led by CEO Florian Wimmer, recently announced it had achieved profitability in 2024, making it an attractive target for investors seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for compliant crypto services. The exact amount of RBI’s investment, as well as Blockpit’s valuation, remain undisclosed. Simplifying Crypto Tax Compliance The deal marks Elevator Ventures’ first foray into the crypto startup space. Blockpit represents a “bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto sector,” said Maximilian Schausberger, managing director at Elevator Ventures, in an interview with brutkasten, adding: “If we succeed in enabling users and crypto traders to be compliant with tax issues and tax payments, then the topic will also become interesting for the masses. Financial institutions want to simplify the topic of taxes for their customers, among other things.” With the investment, Elevator Ventures wants to support Blockpit in further expanding the services that have already been successfully rolled out in ten countries. Maximilian Schausberger of Elevator Ventures (rights) and Florian Wimmel of Blockpit in an interview. / Source: brutkasten For Blockpit, the partnership bridges the crypto industry and traditional finance, an important aspect of its strategy. Wimmer called the investment a “next step,” citing the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation as a catalyst for growing institutional investment. Wimmer added that he sees RBI-backed Elevator Ventures, which manages €100 million (around $110 million) and has invested in 17 startups, as a valuable partner with experience in the TradiFi space. Schausberger also believes that regulation is crucial for the crypto sector to reach the mass market. However, he agreed that it’s still very difficult for crypto investors to file their taxes correctly when they have different assets across multiple wallets and perhaps even multiple countries. That’s where Blockpit can provide a solution and make that step easier, according to Schausberger. Blockpit’s Expansion Plans: Eastern Europe and Beyond Blockpit will use the investment to expand into new European markets, specifically in Eastern Europe. The company will also develop tools for proving the origin of funds for bank withdrawals and crypto exchange transfers. Blockpit was founded in 2017 and currently employs 30 people. In 2021, the company raised $10 million in a Series A round led by MiddleGame Ventures. In November 2023, following its 2020 merger with German competitor CryptoTax, Blockpit also acquired Swiss rival Accointing in a multi-million euro deal.

The weekly chart on Binance (DOGE/USDT) reveals that DOGE is currently trading just above the significant 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.167. This retracement is drawn from the all-time low at $0.0805 to the peak of $0.4844. Dogecoin Reversal Confirmed? A notable technical development is the interaction with a long-standing descending trendline, extending from the May 2021 all-time high. DOGE recently retested this trendline as support after breaking above it in November 2024. Last week’s candle printed a Hammer-like formation, characterized by a small real body near the top of the range and a significantly longer lower shadow. While the candle also displays a modest upper wick, the dominance of the lower shadow signals that buyers absorbed aggressive sell pressure below the trendline and pushed the price back above the 0.786 Fibonacci level – a strong bullish signal. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin And Altcoins’ Next Surge – Here’s The Timeline However, this week could be as important as last week. A weekly close above $0.167 seems essential to confirm the momentum. Otherwise, another test of the multi-year trendline could become a make-or-break moment for the Dogecoin price. Notably, momentum indicators remain neutral to bearish. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed around 39, reflecting subdued buying strength and highlighting that DOGE is still operating below the neutral 50 mark. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are providing layered resistance above the current price. The 100-week EMA lies at $0.17284, positioned just above DOGE’s current range, while the 50-week EMA is located at $0.21427. The 20-week EMA, the more immediate resistance during previous rallies, now sits at $0.24805. Support is reinforced at the 200-week EMA around $0.13621, a level that would likely serve as a last line of defense should DOGE crash below the multi-year trendline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge Price action in recent weeks also shows DOGE breaking down from a bearish flag or channel formation, with the breakdown accelerating toward the confluence of the 0.786 Fibonacci level and the descending trendline retest. Despite this, the market responded with strong buying interest in the highlighted red support zone. On-chain data further contextualizes the recent price action. Analytics firm Santiment reported via X today that Dogecoin, like most meme coins, has been heavily impacted during the ongoing two-month market-wide retracement. However, Santiment pointed out a bullish divergence on the network side. The firm states: “Dogecoin, like most meme coins, have been hammered during the 2-month crypto-wide retrace. However, we recommend keeping an eye on the rising level of wallets holding at least 1M $DOGE, which has recovered during the price dump. Active addresses are also at 4-month highs.” Adding to this sentiment, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades commented via X: “DOGE similar to PEPE but has already retaken the Election level after sweeping it. I think these are key levels to keep watching on a lot of these alts. A sweep & retake signals some short term relief and these levels can offer a clean invalidation level afterwards.” This aligns with the technical observation that DOGE’s recent price action may represent a sweep of liquidity below a key level, followed by a recovery above support — a typical short-term bullish reversal pattern in crypto markets.

In a new post, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 133,300 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the daily chart. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. “XRP is shaping up a head-and-shoulders on the weekly chart. It spotlights the $2 support. Holding it is crucial.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to $1.255 if crypto bears shatter support at $2. XRP is trading for $2.38 at time of writing, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests Solana ( SOL ) may soar to the upper bound of an ascending channel after respecting the pattern’s diagonal support around $126. An ascending channel is traditionally seen as a bullish pattern, indicating that an asset is printing higher highs and higher lows. “Solana set to bounce? Eyeing a climb from the channel’s base to the upper resistance at $140.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Solana is trading for $129 at time of writing, up 1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says the smart contract project Qtum ( QTUM ) may be gearing up for a huge corrective move if it moves below a key support level that has remained intact since November 2022. “QTUM could be on the verge of a breakout! Keep an eye on the $1.88 support level.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that QTUM may plunge to as low as $0.63. QTUM is trading for $2.23 at time of writing, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours.

XRP Price Holds Steady While BNB’s Future Remains Divided,https://thecoinrise.com/final-call-blockdags-400-bonus-offer-ends-soon-xrp-price-holds-steady-while-bnbs-future-remains-divided/,"Traders are closely watching the latest movements across major cryptocurrencies, with the Ripple (XRP) price maintaining key levels despite recent market shifts. While some expect a potential rebound, others remain cautious about downside risks. Meanwhile, discussions around the Binance coin (BNB) future continue, as analysts assess its long-term position within the Binance ecosystem. Price forecasts vary, with resistance levels in sight but concerns over bearish market conditions keep some traders on edge. For those searching for the top crypto to buy, the BlockDAG (BDAG) BDAG800 bonus offer is nearing its final stretch. With BDAG’s presale exceeding $203.5 million and early buyers already seeing 2,380% ROI, this limited-time 400% bonus draws attention before the upcoming 10 exchange listings take BDAG into its next phase. XRP Price Defies Bearish Signals The XRP price has been holding steady above key support levels despite recent fluctuations in the broader crypto market. Analysts have noted that if the XRP price remains above $2, a potential rebound toward $2.50 or higher could be possible. However, bearish signals suggest that a drop below this level could send it toward $1.50. Institutional demand and speculation about XRP’s role as a possible U.S. reserve asset have contributed to maintaining its price stability. Some traders are closely watching whether the XRP price will consolidate before making a move, while others remain cautious about potential downward pressure. For now, XRP continues to trade around $2.20–a crucial price range, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. Binance Coin Future: Where is BNB Headed Next? Market analysts have been debating the Binance coin (BNB) future, as the token continues to show resilience. BNB’s future largely depends on its role within the Binance ecosystem, with its use cases expanding across transactions, trading fees, and smart contract capabilities. Price predictions suggest that if an upward trend continues, BNB could reach resistance levels near $767.09 or even higher in 2025. But if the market sentiment weakens, a decline to support levels near $453.69 is possible. Analysts tracking the Binance coin future believe BNB’s long-term performance will be influenced by exchange activity, regulatory developments, and ongoing improvements within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Traders remain divided on whether BNB will push higher or face a prolonged consolidation. Final Days for Buyers to Claim BlockDAG’s 400% Bonus Time is running out for anyone hoping to secure BlockDAG’s generous 400% bonus on BDAG purchases—the biggest offer yet by the project. Early participants have seen returns as high as 2,380%, leading many to view this offer as a last-chance opportunity before it disappears for good. The project’s crypto presale has entered batch 27 and the coin price has climbed to $0.0248, surpassing $203.5 million in total funds raised with 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Analysts predict BDAG could reach $1 post-listing, with some even suggesting a climb to $20 by 2027. Let’s put that into perspective—a $1,000 purchase currently translates to $5,000 worth of BDAG, which equals about 201,612 coins. This means a $1,000 purchase could be over $201K post listing and over $4 million by 2027 when BDAG hits the predicted $20. Getting in on the 400% bonus has the potential to show traders a life-changing return in just a couple of years. As BDAG’s price climbs steadily and speculation about upcoming CEX listings adds to the excitement, anyone observing the project’s progress might consider stepping in now to capture the 400% bonus while it is still on the table. The clock is ticking on this deal, and those who act quickly stand to benefit the most from BDAG’s upward trajectory. Final Thoughts XRP price movements have kept traders on their toes, holding steady while market watchers assess its next direction. Will it push toward $2.50, or is a slide to $1.50 still on the table? At the same time, the Binance coin (BNB) future remains a key discussion, with some predicting a strong rally and others warning of possible declines. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is capturing interest as one of the top crypto to buy with its 400% bonus offer nearing expiration. The presale has already crossed $203.5 million, and BDAG’s upcoming exchange listings could shift demand even further. The window to lock in this bonus is closing—those looking for an early position may want to act before the bonus is gone forever.

Just when it seemed like regulatory pressure was tightening its grip on the digital asset space, this ruling offers a beacon of hope. Let’s dive into the details of this landmark case and what it signifies for the future of crypto innovation. Victory for Innovation: SEC Lawsuit Dismissed Against BitClout Founder The news broke recently that a U.S. court decided to throw out the lawsuit initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Nader Al-Naji, the individual behind BitClout. This decentralized social network, launched with ambitious goals, found itself in the crosshairs of regulators. The SEC had originally charged Al-Naji with a hefty $3 million wire fraud in 2024, adding to the growing list of legal battles in the cryptocurrency sector. However, in a surprising move, both the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) filed motions to drop the charges, culminating in the court’s dismissal. This development begs the question: what does this dismissal truly mean for the crypto landscape? Understanding the Charges Against the BitClout Founder To fully grasp the significance of this dismissal, it’s crucial to understand the initial charges brought against the BitClout founder , Nader Al-Naji. While details are still emerging regarding the exact reasons for the SEC’s change of heart, the original lawsuit centered around allegations of wire fraud amounting to $3 million. It’s important to note that the SEC’s scrutiny often revolves around whether digital assets are considered securities, and therefore subject to securities laws. In the case of BitClout, a decentralized social network, the SEC’s concerns likely stemmed from the platform’s tokenomics and fundraising mechanisms. Here’s a breakdown of what we know about the situation: Initial Charge: The SEC initially charged Nader Al-Naji with $3 million in wire fraud in 2024. Double Jeopardy? Interestingly, both the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) moved to drop charges, suggesting a potentially coordinated decision or a re-evaluation of the case’s merits. Decentralized Social Network in Focus: BitClout, as a decentralized social network, likely presented a novel regulatory challenge, pushing the boundaries of existing frameworks. Unclear Specifics: The exact reasons for the dismissal remain somewhat opaque, leaving room for speculation and further investigation into the SEC’s rationale. Crypto Regulation and the Shifting Sands This case unfolds against a backdrop of increasing global attention on crypto regulation . Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee digital assets, seeking to balance innovation with investor protection. The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder could be interpreted in several ways within this broader regulatory context: Potential Setback for SEC: This dismissal might be seen as a setback for the SEC’s aggressive enforcement stance in the crypto space. It could signal a need for more robust evidence and clearer legal grounds before initiating such high-profile lawsuits. Nuance in Decentralization: The case highlights the complexities of regulating decentralized platforms. BitClout’s nature as a decentralized social network may have presented unique challenges for applying traditional securities laws. Precedent or Exception? It remains to be seen whether this dismissal sets a precedent for future cases or if it’s an isolated incident based on the specific circumstances of the BitClout case. The crypto community will be watching closely for subsequent regulatory actions. Call for Clarity: This situation underscores the urgent need for clearer regulatory guidelines in the crypto industry. Ambiguity can stifle innovation and create uncertainty for developers and entrepreneurs. Who is Nader Al-Naji, the BitClout Founder? Nader Al-Naji is the individual at the heart of this legal drama. Known for his background in decentralized technologies and social networking, Al-Naji launched BitClout with the vision of creating a new paradigm for social media, one built on blockchain technology. BitClout aimed to tokenize social influence, allowing users to invest in the profiles of celebrities and influencers. While the platform generated initial buzz and attracted a community, it also faced criticism and regulatory scrutiny. This SEC lawsuit dismissal marks a significant chapter in Al-Naji’s journey and potentially for the future trajectory of BitClout itself. Key takeaways about Nader Al-Naji: Aspect Details Role Founder of BitClout Background Decentralized technologies, social networking Vision for BitClout Tokenize social influence, blockchain-based social media Legal Challenge Subject of SEC lawsuit, later dismissed Decentralized Social Network: A New Frontier? BitClout, the platform at the center of this legal battle, is a prime example of a decentralized social network . These platforms represent a departure from traditional social media giants, aiming to distribute control and ownership among users rather than centralizing it in the hands of corporations. Decentralized social networks leverage blockchain technology to achieve greater transparency, censorship resistance, and user empowerment. However, they also present new challenges for regulators, as traditional legal frameworks may not neatly apply to these novel structures. Benefits of Decentralized Social Networks like BitClout: Censorship Resistance: Built on blockchain, these networks are inherently more resistant to censorship compared to centralized platforms. User Data Control: Users potentially have greater control over their data and privacy. Tokenized Economies: Many decentralized social networks incorporate tokens and crypto-economic models, potentially rewarding users for participation and content creation.

Challenges for Decentralized Social Networks: Regulation and Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape is a major challenge. Scalability: Scaling decentralized networks to accommodate large user bases can be technically complex. User Experience: Making decentralized platforms user-friendly for mainstream adoption is crucial. Content Moderation: Decentralization can complicate content moderation and addressing harmful content. Actionable Insights and Future Implications The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder offers several key takeaways and actionable insights for the crypto community and beyond: Vigilance and Legal Preparedness: Crypto projects, especially those pushing the boundaries of decentralization, must remain vigilant about regulatory risks and prioritize legal preparedness. Dialogue with Regulators: Open communication and dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies are essential to foster understanding and develop sensible regulatory frameworks. Focus on Compliance Innovation: Innovation should not only be technological but also extend to compliance solutions that align with regulatory expectations while preserving the core values of decentralization. Advocacy for Clear Rules: The crypto community should actively advocate for clear and consistent regulatory rules that promote innovation and protect users without stifling growth. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for Crypto? The U.S. court’s dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder is undoubtedly a significant moment. While the full implications are still unfolding, it offers a potential breather for the crypto industry, particularly for projects exploring decentralized models. This case underscores the ongoing tension between innovation and regulation, and the need for a balanced approach that fosters growth while addressing legitimate concerns.

Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has just dropped a game-changer: Raydium LaunchLab . This isn’t just another launchpad; it’s a direct challenge to Pump.fun, aiming to redefine how new tokens are launched and traded on Solana. With reports swirling that Pump.fun is venturing into Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Raydium’s counter-move is bold and strategic. Let’s dive deep into what LaunchLab brings to the table and why this rivalry is heating up the DeFi summer. What is Raydium LaunchLab and Why is it a Pump.fun Rival? Raydium LaunchLab is essentially a token launchpad built on the Raydium DEX. Think of it as a platform designed to facilitate the initial distribution and trading of new cryptocurrency tokens. But why is it being positioned as a Pump.fun rival ? The context is crucial here. Pump.fun has gained significant traction in the Solana ecosystem for its streamlined and, some might say, ‘easy-to-pump’ token launch mechanism. However, recent whispers suggest Pump.fun is developing its own AMM, which could directly compete with Raydium’s core business. Raydium’s LaunchLab appears to be a preemptive strike, offering projects an alternative launch platform within the Raydium ecosystem itself, especially for those who already prefer Raydium’s AMM. Here’s a quick breakdown of why this rivalry is significant: Market Share: Pump.fun has been making waves. Blockworks reports indicate that tokens launched on Pump.fun accounted for a whopping 41% of Raydium’s swap fee revenue last month. This highlights Pump.fun’s growing influence and the potential revenue at stake. Competitive Response: Raydium launching LaunchLab is a clear signal – they’re not willing to cede ground. It’s a proactive move to retain and attract projects within their ecosystem. Ecosystem Wars: This isn’t just about two platforms; it’s about the direction of the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Will it be dominated by specialized platforms like Pump.fun, or will established DEXs like Raydium consolidate more services under their umbrella? Decoding the Features: What Makes Raydium LaunchLab Stand Out? Raydium is touting several key features for LaunchLab, aiming to attract projects looking for more control and flexibility in their token launches. Let’s break down what Raydium LaunchLab offers: Custom Bonding Curves: This is a significant differentiator. Bonding curves dictate the price of a token as supply changes. LaunchLab allows projects to design custom bonding curves, offering greater control over token price discovery and distribution. This is in contrast to more standardized approaches that other platforms might offer. Flexible Fees: Fees are a critical aspect for any project launching a token. LaunchLab promises flexible fee structures, potentially allowing projects to tailor costs to their specific needs and tokenomics. This could be a major draw for projects mindful of launch expenses. Multi-Token Support: While details are still emerging, multi-token support suggests LaunchLab might facilitate launches involving more complex token structures or perhaps even NFTs alongside fungible tokens. This adds a layer of versatility that could appeal to a broader range of projects. Raydium AMM v4 Integration: For projects already comfortable with or preferring Raydium’s AMM v4, LaunchLab provides a seamless integration. Launching on LaunchLab means projects can easily tap into Raydium’s existing liquidity and user base. Here’s a table summarizing the key features for a quick comparison: Feature Raydium LaunchLab Potential Pump.fun Approach Bonding Curves Customizable Likely Standardized Fees Flexible Potentially Fixed/Less Flexible Token Support Multi-Token Primarily Single Token (as of current understanding) AMM Integration Raydium AMM v4 Potentially Developing Own AMM The DeFi Token Launchpad Arena: Benefits and Challenges Ahead The emergence of token launchpads like Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun is a boon for the DeFi space. They democratize access to token launches, allowing new projects to reach a wider audience and raise capital more efficiently. However, this space also comes with its set of challenges. Benefits of Launchpads: Accessibility for New Projects: Launchpads lower the barrier to entry for new projects to launch their tokens. They provide a platform and infrastructure that might be complex and costly to build independently. Increased Liquidity: By launching on established DEXs or platforms with built-in trading mechanisms, projects can quickly establish liquidity for their tokens. Community Engagement: Launchpads often have existing communities of users interested in new projects, providing immediate exposure and potential investors. Innovation in Token Distribution: Features like custom bonding curves in LaunchLab push the boundaries of how tokens can be distributed and priced, leading to more innovative tokenomics. Challenges and Considerations: Rug Pull Risks: The ease of launching tokens also brings risks. Users need to be vigilant about project due diligence as the barrier to entry decreases, potentially increasing the number of less reputable projects. Market Volatility: Token launches, especially in the DeFi space, can be highly volatile. Investors need to be aware of the risks involved and manage their investments accordingly. Platform Competition: As more launchpads emerge, competition will intensify. Platforms will need to continuously innovate and offer unique value propositions to attract both projects and users. Regulatory Scrutiny: The DeFi space is under increasing regulatory attention. Launchpads and token launches will likely face greater scrutiny as the industry matures. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun Landscape For crypto enthusiasts and project developers, here are some actionable insights to consider as the Solana DEX launchpad landscape evolves: For Project Developers: Evaluate Your Needs: Consider your project’s specific requirements. Do you need highly customizable bonding curves? Is flexible fee structure a priority? Raydium LaunchLab might be a strong contender if these are key factors. Platform Alignment: If you already utilize or prefer Raydium’s AMM, LaunchLab offers seamless integration. If you are exploring different AMM options, weigh the pros and cons of each platform. Community and Exposure: Assess the reach and community engagement offered by each platform. Where will your project gain the most relevant exposure? For Crypto Users and Investors: Due Diligence is Key: Whether it’s a token launched on Raydium LaunchLab or Pump.fun, always conduct thorough research on the project team, tokenomics, and roadmap before investing. Understand the Risks: Be aware of the inherent risks in new token launches, including volatility and potential rug pulls. Invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose. Explore New Opportunities: Launchpads can be a source of early access to promising projects. Keep an eye on platforms like Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun for potential investment opportunities, but always with caution and informed decision-making. Conclusion: The Future of Solana DeFi is Heating Up Raydium’s entry into the launchpad arena with LaunchLab is a significant development for the Solana DeFi ecosystem. By directly challenging Pump.fun and offering a feature-rich platform, Raydium is signaling its ambition to remain a dominant force. This competition is ultimately beneficial for the entire Solana ecosystem, fostering innovation and providing more options for both projects and users. As the battle for DeFi dominance unfolds, keep a close watch on Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun – they are shaping the future of token launches on Solana and beyond.

The ever-innovative Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest and a major player in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena, has just dropped a bombshell that could reshape the future of finance. Wood has publicly stated her ambition to tokenize some of Ark Invest’s prominent funds. Yes, you heard that right – tokenization is on the horizon for Ark Invest, and it could be a game-changer. What’s the Buzz About Asset Tokenization and Why Ark Invest is Betting Big? So, what exactly is asset tokenization , and why is Cathie Wood so excited about it? In simple terms, asset tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – think stocks, bonds, real estate, or even venture fund shares – as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can then be traded, managed, and interacted with in a much more efficient and accessible way. Cathie Wood, known for her forward-thinking approach and deep dives into disruptive technologies, sees immense potential in asset tokenization . Speaking recently, she emphasized her belief that tokenization is not just a fleeting trend but a major evolutionary step in finance. She anticipates a “tremendous rate” of growth in this space, envisioning a future where tokenization becomes a mainstream practice. Why is Ark Invest so interested in tokenization ? Let’s break it down: Increased Accessibility: Tokenizing funds like Ark’s venture fund (ARKVX) or the Digital Asset Revolution fund could open them up to a wider range of investors. Traditionally, access to venture funds might be limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Tokenization can fractionalize ownership, making it possible for smaller investors to participate. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded more easily and efficiently on secondary markets compared to traditional fund shares. This increased liquidity can be a significant advantage for investors. Imagine being able to trade shares of a venture fund as easily as you trade crypto ETFs – that’s the potential of tokenization . Operational Efficiency: Blockchain technology, which underpins tokenization , can streamline many administrative and operational processes associated with fund management. This could lead to reduced costs and faster transaction times. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Ark Invest is all about investing in innovation. By embracing tokenization , they are positioning themselves at the forefront of financial technology and preparing for a future where digital assets play an increasingly dominant role. Which Ark Invest Funds Could Be Tokenized? Exploring the Possibilities Cathie Wood specifically mentioned Ark’s venture fund (ARKVX) and the Digital Asset Revolution fund as potential candidates for tokenization . Let’s delve a bit deeper into these funds and why they might be prime for this transformation: Ark Venture Fund (ARKVX): This fund focuses on investing in private and public companies across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. Tokenization could revolutionize access to venture capital, which has historically been a relatively illiquid and exclusive asset class. Ark Digital Asset Revolution Fund: As the name suggests, this fund is already deeply embedded in the digital asset space, investing in companies that are involved in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital transactions. Tokenization of this fund would be a natural extension of its existing focus and could further amplify its exposure to the digital asset revolution. While these two funds are specifically highlighted, the potential for tokenization could extend to other Ark Invest funds in the future. The key is to identify funds where tokenization can unlock significant benefits for both Ark Invest and its investors. The Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the Path to Tokenization in the U.S. Cathie Wood is acutely aware of the regulatory environment surrounding tokenization . She acknowledged that the regulatory framework for asset tokenization is still “in the process of being established” in the United States. This is a crucial point, as regulatory clarity is essential for the widespread adoption of tokenization . Currently, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is complex and evolving. Agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are actively working to define the rules of the road for crypto and tokenization . Ark Invest, with its experience in navigating the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs , is likely well-positioned to work within these evolving regulations to bring its tokenization vision to life. Key regulatory considerations for tokenization include: Regulatory Aspect Considerations Securities Laws Are tokenized fund shares considered securities? If so, they would be subject to SEC regulations, including registration requirements and investor protection rules. Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of tokenized assets is paramount. Regulations will likely address the requirements for custodians and the security measures needed to protect investors’ assets. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Tokenization platforms and issuers will need to comply with AML and KYC regulations to prevent illicit activities. Tax Implications Clear tax guidance is needed for tokenized assets to ensure investors understand their tax obligations. Despite the regulatory complexities, Cathie Wood’s confidence suggests that she believes a workable regulatory path exists for tokenization in the U.S. Her experience in launching spot Bitcoin ETFs , which also faced significant regulatory hurdles, demonstrates her ability to navigate challenging regulatory environments. Unlocking the Power of Tokenization: Benefits Beyond Accessibility While increased accessibility and liquidity are major advantages of tokenization , the benefits extend even further. Let’s explore some additional perks: Fractional Ownership: Tokenization enables fractional ownership of assets. Instead of having to buy a whole share of a fund, investors could purchase fractions of tokens, making it more affordable to invest in high-value assets. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional stock markets with limited trading hours, tokenized assets can potentially be traded 24/7 on decentralized exchanges, offering greater flexibility for investors worldwide. Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions involving tokenized assets. This enhances trust and reduces the risk of fraud. Smart Contracts and Automation: Tokenization can be integrated with smart contracts, enabling automated processes for dividend distribution, voting rights, and other fund management functions. Global Reach: Tokenization can facilitate cross-border investments, making it easier for investors from different countries to access and trade assets. Challenges and Considerations: Is Tokenization a Smooth Ride? While the potential of tokenization is immense, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed: Regulatory Uncertainty: As mentioned earlier, the evolving regulatory landscape remains a key challenge. Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for fostering trust and encouraging wider adoption. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is generally secure, vulnerabilities can exist in smart contracts and tokenization platforms. Robust security measures are essential to protect against hacking and theft. Adoption Hurdles: Educating investors and the broader financial industry about tokenization and its benefits is crucial for driving adoption. Overcoming inertia and traditional practices can be a challenge. Interoperability: Ensuring interoperability between different tokenization platforms and blockchains is important for creating a seamless and interconnected ecosystem. Valuation and Pricing: Establishing clear and reliable methods for valuing and pricing tokenized assets is essential for market efficiency and investor confidence. The Future is Tokenized: How This Trend Could Reshape Investment Cathie Wood’s foray into tokenization signals a significant step towards the future of finance. Asset tokenization has the potential to revolutionize not just fund management but the entire investment landscape. By making assets more accessible, liquid, and efficient, tokenization could democratize investment opportunities and unlock trillions of dollars in value. Imagine a future where: Retail investors can easily invest in a fraction of a commercial real estate property through tokenized shares. Small businesses can raise capital by tokenizing their equity, accessing a global pool of investors. Art and collectibles become more accessible to a wider audience through fractional tokenization . Supply chains become more transparent and efficient through the tokenization of goods and assets. Cathie Wood’s vision for tokenization is not just about Ark Invest funds; it’s about contributing to a broader transformation of the financial system. As the regulatory environment matures and technology advances, asset tokenization is poised to become a defining trend of the coming decade, reshaping how we invest, trade, and interact with assets. Conclusion: A Bold Move Towards a Tokenized Tomorrow Cathie Wood’s intention to tokenize Ark Invest funds is a bold and exciting move that underscores the growing importance of asset tokenization in the financial world. While challenges remain, the potential benefits – increased accessibility, enhanced liquidity, and greater efficiency – are too compelling to ignore. As Ark Invest, a leader in disruptive innovation, embraces tokenization , it sends a powerful signal to the market that the future of finance is increasingly digital and tokenized. Keep a close watch on this space – the tokenization revolution is just getting started, and Ark Invest is ready to lead the charge.

33767162,[object Object],1742344221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,FOMC Preview: Bitcoin At Risk As Fed Prepares Market-Shaking Decision,https://bitcoinist.com/fomc-preview-bitcoin-faces-a-major-test/,"All eyes are on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting tomorrow, March 19, with a rate decision that many analysts believe could set the tone for global risk assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), for the months ahead. Markets are pricing in a 99% probability that the Federal Reserve will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but the real driver of volatility could be the central bank’s updated Dot Plot—a key measure of policymakers’ rate projections. What Bitcoin Investors Need To Know Although the consensus is that the Fed will not move rates this time, the Dot Plot may reveal how many cuts are likely for the remainder of the year. Many market participants are bracing for anywhere between one and three cuts. Three cuts would signal a more aggressive pivot toward easing, often viewed as bullish for risk assets such as Bitcoin. Two cuts are generally seen as a neutral scenario, implying a balanced policy approach. One cut or fewer could be interpreted as bearish , underscoring the possibility that the Fed may stay tight longer than markets expect. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will address the press about 30 minutes after the rate announcement, providing further insights into the central bank’s thinking. Of particular interest to Bitcoin and traditional investors alike is any hint regarding the potential end of Quantitative Tightening (QT) . Recent speculation suggests that if Powell signals a wind-down—or even a shift back to asset purchases—market sentiment could improve “significantly,” as one senior strategist noted. Kyledoops, a widely followed technical analyst, noted , “Polymarket is pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed ends QT before May. If Powell even whispers ‘QE’ at the next FOMC, markets will move fast. But knowing Powell, he’ll keep it as vague as possible.” Prominent crypto commentators are issuing mixed yet intense warnings about the volatility that could be unleashed once the Fed’s plans become clear. Cobak (@CobakOfficial) wrote on X: “A big move is coming soon! BTC has major liquidation clusters at $81,640 & $84,800. With the FOMC rate decision approaching, where will Bitcoin head first?” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) expressed a cautiously bullish view but expects further “chop” until the announcement: “Weekly open below, target still above, still expecting further chop until FOMC. Range scenario continuing to play out and eyes on weekly open as I wouldn’t be surprised that gets tapped. Also FOMC meeting in two days, which fully confirms our bottom call scenario.” He further elaborated that the best prices for trades often come around the FOMC meeting itself, observing: “It just induces more low conviction traders… which is another reason why the best prices (tops and bottoms) come right before and right after FOMC… As you know, the candles open is always a strong characteristic of the current situation.” On potential targets for Bitcoin, Astronomer indicated he’s watching the $80,900 zone for “more longs,” while also suggesting a scenario where BTC could surge toward $87,000 if it breaks out above weekly open levels. ING Sees Weakening Growth Banking giant ING, in a recent note, highlighted an evolving macro picture clouded by President Trump’s policy priorities: “After 100bp of interest rate cuts in late 2024, Chair Powell suggests that the Fed aren’t in a hurry to ease policy further and a no change outcome is widely expected on 19 March. But President Trump’s spending cuts and trade protectionist policies are hurting growth prospects and will likely force the central bank’s hand in the second half of 2025.” ING underscores that while the Fed is not currently under immediate pressure to reduce rates—given still-solid employment numbers and inflation “tracking hot”—mounting downside risks could shift the balance of policymaking: “Disappointing economic data and President Trump showing no sign of wavering in his commitment to these policies has led equity markets to take a dimmer view on the prospects for the economy… We therefore expect the Fed to largely retain their forecasts… with two 25bp rate cuts this year. Nonetheless, the outlook for growth is cooling and the pressure for the Fed to offer more support to the economy will likely grow.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,725.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|crypto|crypto news|Fed|FOMC|FOMC Preview,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-19 00:30:21

Bitcoin Extends Lead Over Ethereum (ETH) by 30% in Three Weeks Ethereum price has remained trapped within a narrow range below $2,000, weighed down by uncertainty surrounding the Hoodi update and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance. While Ethereum was once projected to surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization, thanks to its decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract capabilities. However, Bitcoin has widened the valuation gap, outperforming ETH significantly in recent weeks. BTC/ETH Ratio | March 18, 2025 | TradingView The BTC/ETH ratio, which tracks the relative performance of both assets, hit a record high of 44.6 on March 14. With Bitcoin trading at $83000 and Ethereum at $1,900, 1 BTC can now purchase over 44 ETH, up 30% from the 1:33 ratio observed at the recent lows of February 25. Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem Sheds $29 Billion in 30 Days Ethereum’s sharp devaluation can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, Trump’s new trade tariff policies have rattled global markets, prompting crypto investors to seek safety in Bitcoin over Ethereum. Secondly, ETH price has struggled with network scalability issues and failed updates, which have dampened investor confidence. Historical data suggests that Ethereum’s devaluation has accelerated after the Ethereum Merge, with multiple failed network upgrades pushing ETH supply above pre-Merge levels. The Ethereum Foundation attempted to regain control by reshuffling leadership in February, yet investor sentiment remains bleak following the disappointing Pectra and Hoodi updates. Ethereum TVL, March 19 2025 | Source: DeFiLlama For context, Ethereum DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) was $118 billion on February 19. However, as per DefiLlama data on March 19, that figure has now plunged to $89 billion, marking a $29 billion capital outflow—25% of the total deposits within Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. This aligns with ETH’s 30% price decline, reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance as the BTC/ETH trading ratio hit fresh highs. Bearish Outlook for ETH in the Days Ahead The $29 billion drop-off in Ethereum’s DeFi TVL, coupled with continued scalability struggles ahead of the Fed rate decision heigtens bearish risks ahead. As liquidity dries up in the DeFi ecosystem, ETH coins previously locked in smart-contracts trickle into the short-term market supply. Hence, if the capital outflows persist, ETH could face further downward pressure, potentially retesting the $1,500 support zone. Additionally, with Bitcoin dominance widening, ETH price risks losing more market share in the near-term especially if US Fed rate decision falls below market expectations on Wednesday. Ethereum Price Forecast: Bears Must Hold $2,100 Resistance to Avoid Major Liquidations Ethereum price forecast signals lean neutral as it consolidates near $1,941 after a prolonged downtrend, with key technical indicators signaling potential volatility ahead. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,413 and the 100-day EMA at $2,695 indicate a bearish trend, while the 200-day EMA at $2,851 reinforces long-term resistance. Ethereum remains firmly below these moving averages, highlighting persistent selling pressure. However, a bullish reversal could emerge if buyers regain momentum above short-term resistance levels. Ethereum price forecast The Bearish Balance Power (BBP) indicator at -107.25 suggests that sellers have dominated price action, maintaining downward pressure over the past month. The recent series of lower highs and lower lows further confirm bearish market structure. However, decreasing volume on red candles implies that selling momentum may be weakening, leaving room for a potential relief rally. A breakout above $2,100 could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bears to cover positions, which may result in a rapid move toward $2,400-$2,500 before an ultimate correction. If the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday sparks a positive market reaction, Ethereum could swiftly breach $2,100, invalidating the bearish outlook and exposing short sellers to significant liquidations. Failure to reclaim this level, however, could lead to another retest of $1,700-$1,500, extending the current downtrend.

Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, as any adjustments could influence the crypto market. Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Interest Rates Steady The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain the current interest rate range between 4.25% and 4.5% after its March meeting. Despite ongoing speculation about potential cuts, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently indicated caution in adjusting rates. Powell points to inflation concerns and global economic uncertainties. Some economists suggest that rate cuts may not occur until later in the year. Consequently, Fed rate cuts are projected around June 2025, as inflation remains a focal point of monetary decisions. Powell’s post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET is expected to provide further insight into the Fed’s future approach. With the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting expected to conclude tomorrow, crypto investors remain on edge about interest rate decisions. While market analysts predict that rates will stay unchanged, uncertainty surrounding inflation, trade policies, and economic growth continues to fuel volatility. Crypto Market To Crash? Bitcoin (BTC) has been fluctuating around $85K as the crypto market is in a volatile phase before the FOMC announcement. Many traders believe a crypto market crash could follow if the Fed signals a prolonged period of high interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates usually benefit more traditional types of investments such as bonds and savings accounts. As a result of this, capital is leaked from riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rate cuts can boost liquidity and drive more money into speculative assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. But the Fed has stayed hawkish for a while, keeping rates higher, in order to curb inflation. Under these conditions, the crypto market is struggling, and a lot of investors are expecting relief from rate cuts in 2025. While inflation seems to be cooling, with the U.S CPI falling from 3.1% to 2.8%, this may not be enough to stop the Fed easing its policy. Incase the Federal Reserve signals that rate cuts are approaching, a surge in altcoin prices could follow. This is because increased liquidity would likely encourage higher risk appetite among traders. However, if the central bank keeps rates high for an extended period, crypto markets may decline.

The newly launched service could enable customers to purchase up to $1 million in debt backed by Bitcoin, excluding UK and Australian clients. In addition, it will allow qualifying members to keep their Bitcoin as a long-term financial instrument while providing several features to safeguard members’ investments and facilitate borrowing. Xapo Bank is providing its members access to Bitcoin-backed lending and loans With Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance in the U.S., Wall Street companies such as Cantor Fitzgerald have established their own Bitcoin financing businesses. As a result, the investment bank has announced partnerships with Anchorage Digital and Copper.co to support its expanding global Bitcoin financing business. During the cryptocurrency boom of the pandemic, Xapo became one of the first banks to open a physical headquarters in Europe, settling in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Last year, the company secured regulatory approval in the UK. Afterwards, it engaged its customers by providing them with interest-bearing Bitcoin accounts and other banking services. Coinbase had previously partnered with Morpho Labs to offer a Bitcoin-backed loan service that let its U.S. users borrow up to 100,000 USD coins. However, it discontinued the issuance of Bitcoin-backed loans in 2023. The companies have since re-established their services using the decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Asset managers are also using decentralized finance (DeFi) to earn a yield on Bitcoin-backed loans. In contrast, Xapo represents a centralized entity. According to a statement, bank customers should obtain approval first, and their linked Bitcoin is stored “in a vault until the loan is paid back” over a timeframe that can extend as much as a year. Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo, believes many longstanding holders of Bitcoin distanced themselves from crypto-asset-backed lending after seeing predatory lending and faulty products. “That’s why we’re doing things differently,” he said. Coinbase’s Bitcoin-backed loan service allows users to borrow up to $100,000 in USDC Except for residents of New York, all Americans can use this service, which is based on the Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network. Borrowers need to over-communicate their loans, where Bitcoin collateral will be automatically converted to Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) , a token backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in Coinbase custody. Coinbase’s loans help users get liquidity without selling their Bitcoin and triggering taxables. Max Branzburg, the company’s vice president, stated that this product aims to improve Bitcoin’s use case in a decentralized environment. It streamlines the loan process, enabling borrowers to receive loans without credit checks or fees. Repayment terms are flexible; however, borrowers need to exercise caution and monitor the value of their collateral to avoid liquidation. As a result, bitcoin-backed loans have become popular among investors who wish to take advantage of liquidity while retaining their holdings. According to estimates by HFT Market Intelligence, the crypto-backed loan market will increase from $8.5 billion in 2024 to $45 billion by 2030. Now that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, institutions and DeFi protocols are monitoring cryptocurrency lending opportunities more closely. Rivals such as Ledn have also experienced demand for similar products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

While the broader trend for DOGE remains bearish, analysts are confident of a short-term rally to reclaim its one-month high. Dogecoin Price Targets Breakout To $0.29 As bears stamp their authority in DOGE, there is rippling optimism that the dog-themed cryptocurrency could see a rally. According to an X post by Igor Bondarenko, Dogecoin’s price can go as high as $0.29 in the short term. Bodarenko hinges his prediction on DOGE approaching its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). As the dog-themed project inches toward the EMA, pundits say it may be a support level for traders entering the space. On the flip side, a failure to break the EMA level could spell doom for the beleaguered asset. Per Bondarenko, Dogecoin prices may fall as low as $0.10 in the near future. “A breakout could drive DOGE to $0.23 and $0.29,” said Bodarenko. “If rejected, a drop below $0.14 could send it to $0.10. Long-term predictions for Dogecoin prices are fairly upbeat with one analyst predicting DOGE to hit $20 in the coming months. At the moment, Dogecoin price sits at $0.16 and has gained over 6% over the last 7 days. On-chain Indicators Scream Promise For Dogecoin While short-term technicals are predicting a small spike in Dogecoin’s value, on-chain indicators are pointing to a seismic leap. For one, DOGE address activity has soared to 1 million unique users with active addresses spiking by 400%. Furthermore, fundamentals are indicating potential for a rally as high as $50. The filing of a DOGE ETF application by BlackRock may be the trigger for a seismic rally for the memecoin. Other institutional players are watching the space with keen interest as the assets move from memecoin to begin clutching at real-world applications. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analysts DOGECAPITAL and Trader Tardigrade remain optimistic in their prediction that DOGE can clinch $80, citing cyclical patterns from 2021. “If historical trends repeat, Dogecoin is likely to begin its upward reversal soon, entering phase 2 of its parabolic rise,” said DOGECAPITAL The post Dogecoin Price Eyes Breakout To $0.29 In The Short Term appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|DOGE Price Rally|Dogecoin (DOGE)|Dogecoin price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-19 00:57:40
