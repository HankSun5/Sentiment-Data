The executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets highlighted that the stablecoin legislation could arrive at the president’s desk in a few months. Stablecoin Sits at the Top of US Government Priority List During the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit, held in New York on March 18, Hines reiterated the imminence of the regulation, especially after the Senate Banking Committee voted to approve the GENIUS Act. Bo Hines’ statement suggests the US government is keen on maintaining the dollar’s dominance against all odds. He also highlighted the US government’s stance towards stablecoin, noting that it remains a priority in the nation’s regulatory agenda. Truly, Bitcoin’s strategic reserve has garnered positive attention these past few weeks, but this does not relegate the stable assets to the background. Momentum is building gradually, so it may not be too long before the stablecoin legislation, first introduced by Sen. Bill Hagerty , gets to Trump’s table. Senate Banking Committee Advances Proposed Bill Last Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted to push the stablecoin bill to the full Senate. It is worth noting that none of the amendments suggested by US Sen. Elizabeth Warren were listed in the bill, not even her proposal to limit stablecoin issuance to banking institutions. While Senator Tim Scott of the Senate Banking Committee termed the bill a victory for innovation, Warren claimed that it would bring chaos. “Without changes, this bill will supercharge the financing of terrorism. It will make sanctions evasion by Iran, North Korea, and Russia easier,” she argued. Stablecoin Market Nears Bull Cycle Amid this regulatory unsettlement, the stablecoin market is seeing a slight rally. The supply of leading stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC has significantly increased around market top cycles . Analysts and market observers have reasons to believe the current bull cycle has not reached its climax. According to IntoTheBlock, the upward trajectory of stablecoin supply supports this assumption.

Nick said the odds of getting through the Bitcoin Act were increasing for several reasons. The legislation mandates a blueprint for the US Treasury to purchase 1 million BTC over the next five years. He explained that Congress is more knowledgeable about Bitcoin than ever before and is growing appreciative of the precarious conditions of the national debt and deficit. He added that the public was realizing the importance of diversifying the national strategic reserve and owning a commodity asset—in this case, something precious like BTC with gold. Congressman Begich has been pushing support for the bill recently, which has received bipartisan co-sponsorship by several members of Congress. Other motion sponsors include Rep. Pat Harrigan (RNC), Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), and Rep. Michael Rulli (R-OH), who understand Bitcoin’s promise to provide better national financial security. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of the longest-standing Bitcoin proponents, has introduced companion legislation in the upper chamber, adding to what is looking to be some momentum for the bill. The industry is rallying behind the BITCOIN bill, and the public is backing it as well The bill has received interest in the industry and beyond from proponents of digital assets and other political leaders. Bitcoin Policy Institute and other commentators have complimented the bill, stating it is part of a broader trend to update the financial infrastructure and utilize fewer fiat reserves. Public interest in the Bitcoin Act is also growing, with the Bitcoin community and financial pundits invoking the law’s ability to act as an inflation hedge and protector against economic volatility. Social media has also embraced the bill significantly, with community groups championing the idea. The legislation suggests a framework for potentially accumulating 1 million BTC over five years, with purchases of 200,000 BTC per year. However, all of these acquisitions are required under the bill to occur by budget-neutral mechanisms, namely Federal Reserve remittances and gold certificate revaluations, thereby keeping taxpayer burdens to an absolute minimum. The bill also asserts BTC self-custody rights, ensuring that federal agents do not hinder individuals’ ability to own and transact with Bitcoin. This has attracted the attention of both libertarian-leaning policymakers and advocates of financial freedom. The US is advancing its financial leadership in digital assets The Bitcoin Act follows the President’s recent executive order calling for establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” indicative of the administration’s commitment to fully harnessing the future of digital assets. If successful, the bill would enshrine BTC’s position in national financial strategy, providing a template for other countries to follow. As Congressman Begich drifts between, supporters, policymakers, financial institutions and global markets will watch and listen closely to the bill’s progression. As adoption continues, the Bitcoin Act would radically shift how the US government relates to BTC and the broader digital economy. Congressman Nick Begich stated that the United States’ proof of reserves system, as defined in the bill, would be comparable to the one the Central American country uses, whereby the government’s BTC address is published. He said one of the enduring problems around Fort Knox was that there was no public auditing to back it up, which led to concerns over the gold content. Some commentators assumed the US held less gold than it said; others that it held more. Begich pointed out that there was no way American citizens could independently verify the existence of the gold we were being told the country had.

According to Nazarov, the administration is determined to end regulatory pressure and position the country as a leader in the burgeoning Web3 economy. Speaking about the event, Nazarov noted the increasing interaction between policymakers and the crypto industry. While optimism about the administration’s approach to digital assets is growing, he noted that much of the market’s initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin was already priced in during the election period. However, he expects greater regulatory clarity to pave the way for greater institutional adoption that could significantly expand the market. “As we get more clarity, and especially as that clarity allows more regulated entities to enter the industry, the numbers that these entities represent will make it clear that this is a much bigger market than it is now,” Nazarov said. While much of the summit was spent with public statements from President Trump and tech investor David Sacks, Nazarov shed light on the discussions that took place behind closed doors, noting widespread optimism among industry leaders who appreciated the participation of key officials, including the Treasury Secretary, the Commerce Secretary and members of Congress such as Tom Emmer and Bryan Steil. Nazarov noted that it is now increasingly recognized that the crypto industry has been unfairly targeted in past regulatory environments. “It is now increasingly clear that our industry has been unfairly persecuted in a way that has prevented it from thriving in the United States,” he said. According to Nazarov, the administration’s strategy revolves around securing U.S. leadership in the global crypto economy. “The general motto of this administration is that if something has a global impact or an impact on the U.S. economy, then they want to be in a leadership position,” he said. He argued that this commitment was underlined by the presence of senior officials and their commitment to ensuring that the crypto industry was no longer stifled by unfair policies. He said the government’s goal was to create an environment where blockchain innovation could thrive and make the U.S. a dominant force in the Web3 financial system. Related News: BREAKING: One of the Oldest Altcoins Decides to Change Its Name - It Will Change Completely When asked what steps the U.S. should take to capitalize on this position, Nazarov pointed to the country’s already strong financial system and reputation for reliable transactions and low levels of fraud. He outlined three key priorities to further solidify his leadership: Issuing High-Quality Digital Assets – The US should focus on creating the most reliable stablecoins, tokenized funds, commodity coins, and tokenized real estate assets. Automating Compliance – Reducing compliance costs through blockchain technology will make operations more efficient and attract international investors. Increasing Market Share in the Web3 Economy – By implementing these improvements, the US can expand its role in the emerging decentralized financial landscape. Nazarov believes that if the US successfully addresses these priorities, it could not only support the growth of the crypto industry domestically but also gain a competitive advantage in the broader global financial system. *This is not investment advice.

41884950,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=141217,1742340011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Survey: 83% of Institutions to Supercharge Crypto Allocation in 2024,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/institutions-supercharge-crypto-allocation/,"Are you ready for a seismic shift in the financial landscape? Buckle up, because a groundbreaking new survey suggests institutional investors are about to massively increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies. Imagine a world where Wall Street giants aren’t just dipping their toes, but diving headfirst into the crypto pool. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the compelling reality painted by a recent report from Coinbase and EY-Parthenon. Let’s delve into the exciting details of this eye-opening survey and explore what it means for the future of digital assets and, potentially, your investment portfolio. Unveiling the Surge in Institutional Crypto Investment The headline is attention-grabbing for a reason: a staggering 83% of institutions surveyed are planning to pump more capital into crypto this year. This isn’t just a marginal increase; it’s a clear signal of growing confidence and conviction in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. This data emerges from a comprehensive survey conducted by Coinbase in collaboration with EY-Parthenon, tapping into the insights of over 350 institutional investors. These aren’t just small firms; we’re talking about significant players managing substantial assets. The survey paints a picture of a financial world where institutional crypto investment is rapidly becoming mainstream, not a niche experiment. But what’s driving this bullish sentiment? Let’s break down the key factors: Attractive Returns: Institutions are laser-focused on generating returns, and cryptocurrencies are increasingly seen as a prime opportunity. Respondents in the survey overwhelmingly rated cryptocurrencies as the most attractive avenue for risk-adjusted returns over the next three years. In a world of low interest rates and uncertain traditional markets, crypto’s potential for high growth is proving irresistible. Portfolio Diversification: Smart investors know the importance of diversification. Cryptocurrencies offer a unique asset class with low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds, making them an attractive tool for diversifying portfolios and mitigating overall risk. As institutions seek to build resilient portfolios, crypto allocation becomes a strategic imperative. Maturity of the Crypto Market: The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly in recent years. Improved infrastructure, clearer regulations in some jurisdictions (though still evolving), and the emergence of institutional-grade custody solutions have reduced perceived risks and made it easier for large players to participate. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Let’s be honest, FOMO plays a role. As early institutional adopters demonstrate success in the crypto space, others are feeling the pressure to get in on the action. No institution wants to be left behind as a potentially transformative asset class takes off. The 5% Threshold: A Significant Crypto Allocation Milestone While the 83% figure is impressive, another data point from the survey is particularly noteworthy: a substantial portion of respondents plan to allocate more than 5% of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. Why is this significant? A 5% allocation, while seemingly small, represents a major commitment from institutional investors. For large funds managing billions or trillions of dollars, a 5% allocation translates to a massive influx of capital into the crypto market. This level of crypto allocation signals a serious long-term investment strategy, not just speculative trading. Consider this in the context of the broader financial world. Institutional investors are typically conservative and deliberate in their investment decisions. For them to earmark over 5% of their portfolios for a relatively new and volatile asset class like crypto speaks volumes about their conviction. It suggests they view crypto not just as a fleeting trend, but as a fundamental part of the future financial ecosystem. Who are these Institutional Investors? The survey encompasses a diverse range of institutional investors . While the specific breakdown of respondents isn’t detailed in the provided content, we can infer that it likely includes: Hedge Funds: Known for their agility and appetite for alternative investments, hedge funds have been among the early adopters of crypto. Asset Managers: Traditional asset management firms are increasingly exploring crypto to meet client demand and enhance portfolio performance. Pension Funds and Endowments: While typically more conservative, some pension funds and endowments are beginning to cautiously allocate to crypto, recognizing its potential long-term growth. Corporations: Companies are exploring crypto for treasury management, payments, and even as part of their business models. The increasing participation of diverse institutional investors underscores the broadening appeal and acceptance of cryptocurrencies across the financial spectrum. Navigating the Challenges of Cryptocurrency Adoption While the survey paints a rosy picture of institutional crypto adoption, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain. Cryptocurrency adoption , particularly at the institutional level, is not without its hurdles. These include: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty The lack of clear and consistent regulations globally remains a significant concern for institutions. Regulatory ambiguity can create compliance headaches and hinder investment decisions. Volatility Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Managing this volatility and its impact on portfolio risk is a key challenge for institutional investors. Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount. Institutions require robust, institutional-grade custody solutions, which are still evolving in some areas. ESG Concerns Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are increasingly important to institutional investors. The energy consumption of some cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, raises ESG concerns that need to be addressed. Education and Expertise Understanding the complexities of the crypto market and blockchain technology requires specialized knowledge. Institutions need to build internal expertise or partner with firms that possess it. Despite these challenges, the survey data suggests that institutions are increasingly confident in their ability to navigate these hurdles and capitalize on the opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? The institutional embrace of crypto has implications for everyone, not just large financial firms. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights: Validate Your Crypto Thesis: If you’re already invested in crypto, this survey reinforces the long-term potential of the asset class. Institutional interest is a powerful validation signal. Consider Diversification: If you’re not yet invested in crypto, now might be the time to consider a small allocation as part of a diversified crypto portfolio . Follow the lead of the institutions and explore the potential benefits. Stay Informed: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Stay informed about regulatory developments, technological advancements, and institutional adoption trends to make informed investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors are typically long-term oriented. Adopt a similar mindset when it comes to crypto. Focus on the long-term potential rather than short-term price fluctuations. Conclusion: The Institutional Crypto Wave is Building The survey findings are clear: institutional interest in crypto is not just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful wave building momentum. The fact that 83% of institutions plan to increase their crypto allocation this year, with a significant portion aiming for over 5%, is a resounding endorsement of the asset class. While challenges remain, the potential rewards are clearly compelling institutions to embrace crypto. This institutional influx of capital and expertise is likely to further mature the crypto market, drive innovation, and ultimately pave the way for wider adoption across the financial world. The message is loud and clear: institutional crypto is here to stay, and it’s poised to play an increasingly significant role in the future of finance.

Last around $124, the Solana price remains in a clear downtrend from the record highs it hit in January near $300, and is currently down around 57% from these peaks. Recent rejections of the 21DMA in recent weeks, as well as a strong rejection of the 200DMA earlier this month, suggest that the bears remain very much in control of this market. And weak interest from institutional investors in the new Solana futures product on CME will give the bears further ammunition to push the price lower. First day for Solana CME futures. $12m notional volume pic.twitter.com/OTSfw90tJf — adam (@abetrade) March 18, 2025 Bearish conditions in the Solana market are justified in the context of broader macro worries, which have taken a heavy toll on risk appetite in recent weeks, and declining on-chain activity. While the US economy continues to hold up well in early 2025, risks to the medium-term outlook have risen substantially thanks to Trump’s trade wars and D.O.G.E-related government spending cuts. The collapse of US consumers: Unemployment expectations in the US are now ABOVE 2020 levels and at their highest since 2008. In 2024, a poll showed that a whopping 56% of Americans thought the US was in a recession. Is the US set to enter a recession? (a thread) pic.twitter.com/iQhcQkRGUv — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 18, 2025 Trump administration officials and even the President himself have warned that a period of adjustment could be coming that could be painful for the economy and markets. And, all the while, since peaking in the immediate aftermath of the Trump and Melania meme coin launches in January, Solana’s on-chain activity has been in decline. Solana transaction fees, a proxy for on-chain activity, just reached its weakest levels since September, suggesting lackluster demand for block space, per The Block . How Low Could the Solana Price Go? The fundamental and technical pictures both look downbeat for the Solana price. A further decline feels highly likely. But how low might the Solana price go? Well, $110 has been a solid area of support going back to mid-2024. If that level breaks, a rush down towards the near notable area around $80 seems likely. But depending on how bad things get on the macro front, Solana could see a much bigger drop than that. Let’s say the US economy does fall into recession, but stubbornly high inflation complicates the Fed’s easing efforts, and the federal government seems reluctant to step in with an increase in stimulus via more government spending. That could revive talks of a new “great recession”. And this could be an environment where Solana collapses all the way back to its early 2023 levels in the $15-30 area. That would mark a decline of as much as 90% from its January highs. In the world of crypto, this is not unheard of decline. In fact, in altcoin markets its to be expected. And Solana already has a history of similar declines, dropping 97% from its 2021 peak above $260 to its 2022 trough around $8. Buy the Solana Dip? Savvy investors would view a Solana price drop back to $30 as a generation investment opportunity. That’s because, while macro uncertainties could persist for some time, the future for crypto is looking brighter than it ever has before. The industry has been given a historic thumbs up from the US government and global Bitcoin adoption is surging. The Trump administration is stuffed with crypto HODLers and supporters. David Sacks, the current White House Crypto and AI Czar was a former investor. Medium-term macro risks aside, the longer-term outlook for the crypto industry looks as strong as its ever looked. Macro fears will eventually ease and, if financial conditions ease substantially in the coming years, crypto markets are set to pop.

The media outlet explained: “Receiving a heavy penalty would have a negative impact on Bithumb’s IPO [bid]. As such, Bithumb cannot help but be sensitive to the probe’s results.” The second hurdle pertains to Bithumb’s complex ownership structure, and ongoing questions about who owns the platform. While the legal case has resolved some issues, questions still remain over the elusive businessman Kang Jong-hyun ’s connections with the exchange. The media outlet wrote that “clarifying its governance structure would be an urgent task for both Lee and Bithumb.” In a further development, the media outlet MTN News reported that Bithumb will create a KB “account opening window” at its customer service lounge in Seoul’s Gangnam District on March 24.

Nvidia, the titan of GPUs, just dropped a bombshell at GTC 2025, unveiling two game-changing “personal AI supercomputers.” These aren’t your average desktops; we’re talking about powerhouses designed to bring cutting-edge AI development right to your fingertips. For crypto enthusiasts and tech innovators alike, this announcement signals a massive leap forward in accessible AI power, potentially revolutionizing everything from blockchain analytics to decentralized AI applications. Let’s dive into what makes these new machines so groundbreaking. Unveiling the Power of Personal AI Supercomputers Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s charismatic CEO, took center stage at GTC 2025 to introduce the DGX Spark and DGX Station – the vanguard of what he calls “personal AI supercomputers.” These aren’t just incremental upgrades; they represent a fundamental shift in how AI computing power is distributed and utilized. Huang boldly declared, “This is the computer of the age of AI,” emphasizing that these machines are the blueprint for future computing. But what exactly makes them ‘supercomputers’ and why should you care? Here’s the lowdown on these AI powerhouses: Democratizing AI Development: For years, supercomputing-level AI capabilities were confined to massive data centers and deep-pocketed corporations. Nvidia is changing the game by bringing this immense processing power to individual developers, researchers, and enterprises, effectively democratizing access to advanced AI supercomputers . Edge Computing Revolution: Both DGX Spark and DGX Station are designed for “edge” deployment.

While the outlook remains bearish, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has issued a $1 million forecast for the coin in the mid-term. In an investor note issued on March 18, Hougan uncovered why Bitcoin price reacts the way it does during an economic crisis. Bitcoin Price and Macroeconomic Trend According to the Bitwise executive in his weekly CIO memo , Bitcoin does not always behave like a hedge against crisis, which is why most people buy it. There are instances where BTC price reacts to macroeconomic news in correlation with the broader US stock market. Ahead of the March 2025 FOMC Meeting , this consolidation in Bitcoin price is showing up again. Amid this uncertainty, the Bitwise CIO said staying invested in BTC is the recipe for long-term growth. He highlighted how the price of the coin largely soared over 190% in subsequent years after a dip. He labeled this trend a “dip then rip” phenomenon, one he believes might soon play out for the coin. Using the Discounted Cashflow Analysis (DCA) discount factor, Hougan projected that a $1 million Bitcoin price target by 2029 implies a net value of $218,604 today if investors apply a 50% discount. Where is the BTC Price Heading? In his analysis, Matt Hougan showcased the correlation between BTC and the US Tariff war. He highlighted how BTC’s reaction solely hinges on its low liquidity. Per the analysis, in the short term, the geopolitical tariff war injects liquidity into the market. If this trend does not change in the short term, it might favor the coin as Bitcoin serves as a hedge against economic uncertainty. While many have speculated about the future of the coin, Matt Hougan reiterated Bitwise’s long-term price target of up to $1.1 million for Bitcoin. At the moment, the coin traded within a tight range, moving from a low of $81,179.99 to a high of $84,230. The headwind is not cleared, but experts, including Cathie Wood, have predicted a deflationary boom ahead . Regulations to Boost Market Outlook According to ecosystem projections, the US government’s pivot to set up a strategic Bitcoin reserve might play a long-term role in shaping the asset’s future. With a decisive move by proponents like Senator Cynthia Lummis, who re-introduced the Bitcoin Act Bill , institutional investors’ confidence in the coin is growing. The shifting regulation around BTC is also spreading to other asset classes, like stablecoins in the ecosystem.

Recent technical analysis suggests that the cryptocurrency’s price could decline further, potentially reaching as low as $1,060. Multiple factors, including weak market structure, lack of bullish momentum, and negative on-chain data, influence the downward movement. Ethereum Price Faces Continuous Rejections at $4,000 Resistance According to price analysis by Mags , Ethereum has failed to break the $4,000 resistance level three times in this cycle. Each rejection has led to a further decline, with the latest downturn pushing the cryptocurrency below its mid-range level. The price is now also trading below an upward-sloping trendline support, which had been holding since the previous cycle bottom. Analysts warn that Ethereum could continue its decline if it does not reclaim $2,500 in the near term. A further drop below the current levels could expose ETH to a potential fall toward $1,060, where the range low is positioned. The lack of strong support suggests that downward movement remains a strong possibility. Source: X Market data indicates that Ethereum price remains under bearish pressure. The altcoin has not shown signs of establishing a solid bottom, raising the risk of prolonged losses. Without a strong recovery above resistance levels, the bearish trend may persist. ETH/BTC Pair Remains in a Bearish Trend Additionally, the ETH/BTC trading pair has been underperforming, signaling weakness in Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the three-day chart remains below 30, a level that often indicates oversold conditions. However, historical trends show that oversold levels have not always marked a definitive bottom for Ethereum price. Since mid-2024, ETH/BTC has recorded multiple breakdowns, with declines of 13%, 21%, 25%, and 19.5%. The 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) continue to trend downward, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Additionally, analyst CarpeNoctom has pointed out that ETH/BTC has yet to confirm a bullish divergence on its weekly chart, further suggesting that ETH price could struggle to find support. Source: X Declining ETF Flows and Weak On-Chain Activity Since the start of the year, Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US have seen consistent outflows. In March 2021, the net assets of spot Ether ETFs decreased by 9.8%, amounting to $2.54 billion. Bitcoin ETFs, on the other hand, suffered a slight decrease of 2.35% to $35.74 billion. This divergence indicates that institutional fund managers are losing interest in Ethereum. Further, there is decreasing network usage evidenced by on-chain data. It is worth mentioning the median gas fees have declined on the mainnet and fluctuating at approximately 1.12 GWEI in March. This is a far lower turnover as compared to the previous calendar year, meaning that there are less transaction taking place on the network. Technical analysts believe that the future performance of Ethereum price is not looking good as it remains below some key levels. The next level of support is at $1,060 which blends with the lower limit of the long-term trading range. As of this writing, the altcoin is trading at $1,923.03, which is 27.81% low from the previous month. Despite a market cap of $231.96 billion, the ongoing downward trend suggests continued selling pressure.

Blockpit, headquartered in Linz and led by CEO Florian Wimmer, recently announced it had achieved profitability in 2024, making it an attractive target for investors seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for compliant crypto services. The exact amount of RBI’s investment, as well as Blockpit’s valuation, remain undisclosed. Simplifying Crypto Tax Compliance The deal marks Elevator Ventures’ first foray into the crypto startup space. Blockpit represents a “bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto sector,” said Maximilian Schausberger, managing director at Elevator Ventures, in an interview with brutkasten, adding: “If we succeed in enabling users and crypto traders to be compliant with tax issues and tax payments, then the topic will also become interesting for the masses. Financial institutions want to simplify the topic of taxes for their customers, among other things.” With the investment, Elevator Ventures wants to support Blockpit in further expanding the services that have already been successfully rolled out in ten countries. Maximilian Schausberger of Elevator Ventures (rights) and Florian Wimmel of Blockpit in an interview. / Source: brutkasten For Blockpit, the partnership bridges the crypto industry and traditional finance, an important aspect of its strategy. Wimmer called the investment a “next step,” citing the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation as a catalyst for growing institutional investment. Wimmer added that he sees RBI-backed Elevator Ventures, which manages €100 million (around $110 million) and has invested in 17 startups, as a valuable partner with experience in the TradiFi space. Schausberger also believes that regulation is crucial for the crypto sector to reach the mass market. However, he agreed that it’s still very difficult for crypto investors to file their taxes correctly when they have different assets across multiple wallets and perhaps even multiple countries. That’s where Blockpit can provide a solution and make that step easier, according to Schausberger. Blockpit’s Expansion Plans: Eastern Europe and Beyond Blockpit will use the investment to expand into new European markets, specifically in Eastern Europe. The company will also develop tools for proving the origin of funds for bank withdrawals and crypto exchange transfers. Blockpit was founded in 2017 and currently employs 30 people. In 2021, the company raised $10 million in a Series A round led by MiddleGame Ventures. In November 2023, following its 2020 merger with German competitor CryptoTax, Blockpit also acquired Swiss rival Accointing in a multi-million euro deal.

The weekly chart on Binance (DOGE/USDT) reveals that DOGE is currently trading just above the significant 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.167. This retracement is drawn from the all-time low at $0.0805 to the peak of $0.4844. Dogecoin Reversal Confirmed? A notable technical development is the interaction with a long-standing descending trendline, extending from the May 2021 all-time high. DOGE recently retested this trendline as support after breaking above it in November 2024. Last week’s candle printed a Hammer-like formation, characterized by a small real body near the top of the range and a significantly longer lower shadow. While the candle also displays a modest upper wick, the dominance of the lower shadow signals that buyers absorbed aggressive sell pressure below the trendline and pushed the price back above the 0.786 Fibonacci level – a strong bullish signal. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin And Altcoins’ Next Surge – Here’s The Timeline However, this week could be as important as last week. A weekly close above $0.167 seems essential to confirm the momentum. Otherwise, another test of the multi-year trendline could become a make-or-break moment for the Dogecoin price. Notably, momentum indicators remain neutral to bearish. The weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) closed around 39, reflecting subdued buying strength and highlighting that DOGE is still operating below the neutral 50 mark. The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are providing layered resistance above the current price. The 100-week EMA lies at $0.17284, positioned just above DOGE’s current range, while the 50-week EMA is located at $0.21427. The 20-week EMA, the more immediate resistance during previous rallies, now sits at $0.24805. Support is reinforced at the 200-week EMA around $0.13621, a level that would likely serve as a last line of defense should DOGE crash below the multi-year trendline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakout Alert! This Pattern Could Trigger A ‘Parabolic’ Surge Price action in recent weeks also shows DOGE breaking down from a bearish flag or channel formation, with the breakdown accelerating toward the confluence of the 0.786 Fibonacci level and the descending trendline retest. Despite this, the market responded with strong buying interest in the highlighted red support zone. On-chain data further contextualizes the recent price action. Analytics firm Santiment reported via X today that Dogecoin, like most meme coins, has been heavily impacted during the ongoing two-month market-wide retracement. However, Santiment pointed out a bullish divergence on the network side. The firm states: “Dogecoin, like most meme coins, have been hammered during the 2-month crypto-wide retrace. However, we recommend keeping an eye on the rising level of wallets holding at least 1M $DOGE, which has recovered during the price dump. Active addresses are also at 4-month highs.” Adding to this sentiment, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades commented via X: “DOGE similar to PEPE but has already retaken the Election level after sweeping it. I think these are key levels to keep watching on a lot of these alts. A sweep & retake signals some short term relief and these levels can offer a clean invalidation level afterwards.” This aligns with the technical observation that DOGE’s recent price action may represent a sweep of liquidity below a key level, followed by a recovery above support — a typical short-term bullish reversal pattern in crypto markets.

In a new post, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 133,300 followers on the social media platform X that XRP may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the daily chart. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. “XRP is shaping up a head-and-shoulders on the weekly chart. It spotlights the $2 support. Holding it is crucial.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that XRP will fall to $1.255 if crypto bears shatter support at $2. XRP is trading for $2.38 at time of writing, up 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst suggests Solana ( SOL ) may soar to the upper bound of an ascending channel after respecting the pattern’s diagonal support around $126. An ascending channel is traditionally seen as a bullish pattern, indicating that an asset is printing higher highs and higher lows. “Solana set to bounce? Eyeing a climb from the channel’s base to the upper resistance at $140.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Solana is trading for $129 at time of writing, up 1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says the smart contract project Qtum ( QTUM ) may be gearing up for a huge corrective move if it moves below a key support level that has remained intact since November 2022. “QTUM could be on the verge of a breakout! Keep an eye on the $1.88 support level.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to predict that QTUM may plunge to as low as $0.63. QTUM is trading for $2.23 at time of writing, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours.

XRP Price Holds Steady While BNB’s Future Remains Divided,https://thecoinrise.com/final-call-blockdags-400-bonus-offer-ends-soon-xrp-price-holds-steady-while-bnbs-future-remains-divided/,"Traders are closely watching the latest movements across major cryptocurrencies, with the Ripple (XRP) price maintaining key levels despite recent market shifts. While some expect a potential rebound, others remain cautious about downside risks. Meanwhile, discussions around the Binance coin (BNB) future continue, as analysts assess its long-term position within the Binance ecosystem. Price forecasts vary, with resistance levels in sight but concerns over bearish market conditions keep some traders on edge. For those searching for the top crypto to buy, the BlockDAG (BDAG) BDAG800 bonus offer is nearing its final stretch. With BDAG’s presale exceeding $203.5 million and early buyers already seeing 2,380% ROI, this limited-time 400% bonus draws attention before the upcoming 10 exchange listings take BDAG into its next phase. XRP Price Defies Bearish Signals The XRP price has been holding steady above key support levels despite recent fluctuations in the broader crypto market. Analysts have noted that if the XRP price remains above $2, a potential rebound toward $2.50 or higher could be possible. However, bearish signals suggest that a drop below this level could send it toward $1.50. Institutional demand and speculation about XRP’s role as a possible U.S. reserve asset have contributed to maintaining its price stability. Some traders are closely watching whether the XRP price will consolidate before making a move, while others remain cautious about potential downward pressure. For now, XRP continues to trade around $2.20–a crucial price range, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. Binance Coin Future: Where is BNB Headed Next? Market analysts have been debating the Binance coin (BNB) future, as the token continues to show resilience. BNB’s future largely depends on its role within the Binance ecosystem, with its use cases expanding across transactions, trading fees, and smart contract capabilities. Price predictions suggest that if an upward trend continues, BNB could reach resistance levels near $767.09 or even higher in 2025. But if the market sentiment weakens, a decline to support levels near $453.69 is possible. Analysts tracking the Binance coin future believe BNB’s long-term performance will be influenced by exchange activity, regulatory developments, and ongoing improvements within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Traders remain divided on whether BNB will push higher or face a prolonged consolidation. Final Days for Buyers to Claim BlockDAG’s 400% Bonus Time is running out for anyone hoping to secure BlockDAG’s generous 400% bonus on BDAG purchases—the biggest offer yet by the project. Early participants have seen returns as high as 2,380%, leading many to view this offer as a last-chance opportunity before it disappears for good. The project’s crypto presale has entered batch 27 and the coin price has climbed to $0.0248, surpassing $203.5 million in total funds raised with 18.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Analysts predict BDAG could reach $1 post-listing, with some even suggesting a climb to $20 by 2027. Let’s put that into perspective—a $1,000 purchase currently translates to $5,000 worth of BDAG, which equals about 201,612 coins. This means a $1,000 purchase could be over $201K post listing and over $4 million by 2027 when BDAG hits the predicted $20. Getting in on the 400% bonus has the potential to show traders a life-changing return in just a couple of years. As BDAG’s price climbs steadily and speculation about upcoming CEX listings adds to the excitement, anyone observing the project’s progress might consider stepping in now to capture the 400% bonus while it is still on the table. The clock is ticking on this deal, and those who act quickly stand to benefit the most from BDAG’s upward trajectory. Final Thoughts XRP price movements have kept traders on their toes, holding steady while market watchers assess its next direction. Will it push toward $2.50, or is a slide to $1.50 still on the table? At the same time, the Binance coin (BNB) future remains a key discussion, with some predicting a strong rally and others warning of possible declines. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is capturing interest as one of the top crypto to buy with its 400% bonus offer nearing expiration. The presale has already crossed $203.5 million, and BDAG’s upcoming exchange listings could shift demand even further. The window to lock in this bonus is closing—those looking for an early position may want to act before the bonus is gone forever.

Just when it seemed like regulatory pressure was tightening its grip on the digital asset space, this ruling offers a beacon of hope. Let’s dive into the details of this landmark case and what it signifies for the future of crypto innovation. Victory for Innovation: SEC Lawsuit Dismissed Against BitClout Founder The news broke recently that a U.S. court decided to throw out the lawsuit initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Nader Al-Naji, the individual behind BitClout. This decentralized social network, launched with ambitious goals, found itself in the crosshairs of regulators. The SEC had originally charged Al-Naji with a hefty $3 million wire fraud in 2024, adding to the growing list of legal battles in the cryptocurrency sector. However, in a surprising move, both the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) filed motions to drop the charges, culminating in the court’s dismissal. This development begs the question: what does this dismissal truly mean for the crypto landscape? Understanding the Charges Against the BitClout Founder To fully grasp the significance of this dismissal, it’s crucial to understand the initial charges brought against the BitClout founder , Nader Al-Naji. While details are still emerging regarding the exact reasons for the SEC’s change of heart, the original lawsuit centered around allegations of wire fraud amounting to $3 million. It’s important to note that the SEC’s scrutiny often revolves around whether digital assets are considered securities, and therefore subject to securities laws. In the case of BitClout, a decentralized social network, the SEC’s concerns likely stemmed from the platform’s tokenomics and fundraising mechanisms. Here’s a breakdown of what we know about the situation: Initial Charge: The SEC initially charged Nader Al-Naji with $3 million in wire fraud in 2024. Double Jeopardy? Interestingly, both the SEC and the Department of Justice (DoJ) moved to drop charges, suggesting a potentially coordinated decision or a re-evaluation of the case’s merits. Decentralized Social Network in Focus: BitClout, as a decentralized social network, likely presented a novel regulatory challenge, pushing the boundaries of existing frameworks. Unclear Specifics: The exact reasons for the dismissal remain somewhat opaque, leaving room for speculation and further investigation into the SEC’s rationale. Crypto Regulation and the Shifting Sands This case unfolds against a backdrop of increasing global attention on crypto regulation . Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee digital assets, seeking to balance innovation with investor protection. The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder could be interpreted in several ways within this broader regulatory context: Potential Setback for SEC: This dismissal might be seen as a setback for the SEC’s aggressive enforcement stance in the crypto space. It could signal a need for more robust evidence and clearer legal grounds before initiating such high-profile lawsuits. Nuance in Decentralization: The case highlights the complexities of regulating decentralized platforms. BitClout’s nature as a decentralized social network may have presented unique challenges for applying traditional securities laws. Precedent or Exception? It remains to be seen whether this dismissal sets a precedent for future cases or if it’s an isolated incident based on the specific circumstances of the BitClout case. The crypto community will be watching closely for subsequent regulatory actions. Call for Clarity: This situation underscores the urgent need for clearer regulatory guidelines in the crypto industry. Ambiguity can stifle innovation and create uncertainty for developers and entrepreneurs. Who is Nader Al-Naji, the BitClout Founder? Nader Al-Naji is the individual at the heart of this legal drama. Known for his background in decentralized technologies and social networking, Al-Naji launched BitClout with the vision of creating a new paradigm for social media, one built on blockchain technology. BitClout aimed to tokenize social influence, allowing users to invest in the profiles of celebrities and influencers. While the platform generated initial buzz and attracted a community, it also faced criticism and regulatory scrutiny. This SEC lawsuit dismissal marks a significant chapter in Al-Naji’s journey and potentially for the future trajectory of BitClout itself. Key takeaways about Nader Al-Naji: Aspect Details Role Founder of BitClout Background Decentralized technologies, social networking Vision for BitClout Tokenize social influence, blockchain-based social media Legal Challenge Subject of SEC lawsuit, later dismissed Decentralized Social Network: A New Frontier? BitClout, the platform at the center of this legal battle, is a prime example of a decentralized social network . These platforms represent a departure from traditional social media giants, aiming to distribute control and ownership among users rather than centralizing it in the hands of corporations. Decentralized social networks leverage blockchain technology to achieve greater transparency, censorship resistance, and user empowerment. However, they also present new challenges for regulators, as traditional legal frameworks may not neatly apply to these novel structures. Benefits of Decentralized Social Networks like BitClout: Censorship Resistance: Built on blockchain, these networks are inherently more resistant to censorship compared to centralized platforms. User Data Control: Users potentially have greater control over their data and privacy. Tokenized Economies: Many decentralized social networks incorporate tokens and crypto-economic models, potentially rewarding users for participation and content creation.

Challenges for Decentralized Social Networks: Regulation and Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape is a major challenge. Scalability: Scaling decentralized networks to accommodate large user bases can be technically complex. User Experience: Making decentralized platforms user-friendly for mainstream adoption is crucial. Content Moderation: Decentralization can complicate content moderation and addressing harmful content. Actionable Insights and Future Implications The dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder offers several key takeaways and actionable insights for the crypto community and beyond: Vigilance and Legal Preparedness: Crypto projects, especially those pushing the boundaries of decentralization, must remain vigilant about regulatory risks and prioritize legal preparedness. Dialogue with Regulators: Open communication and dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies are essential to foster understanding and develop sensible regulatory frameworks. Focus on Compliance Innovation: Innovation should not only be technological but also extend to compliance solutions that align with regulatory expectations while preserving the core values of decentralization. Advocacy for Clear Rules: The crypto community should actively advocate for clear and consistent regulatory rules that promote innovation and protect users without stifling growth. Conclusion: A Breath of Fresh Air for Crypto? The U.S. court’s dismissal of the SEC lawsuit against the BitClout founder is undoubtedly a significant moment. While the full implications are still unfolding, it offers a potential breather for the crypto industry, particularly for projects exploring decentralized models. This case underscores the ongoing tension between innovation and regulation, and the need for a balanced approach that fosters growth while addressing legitimate concerns.

Raydium, a leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has just dropped a game-changer: Raydium LaunchLab . This isn’t just another launchpad; it’s a direct challenge to Pump.fun, aiming to redefine how new tokens are launched and traded on Solana. With reports swirling that Pump.fun is venturing into Automated Market Makers (AMMs), Raydium’s counter-move is bold and strategic. Let’s dive deep into what LaunchLab brings to the table and why this rivalry is heating up the DeFi summer. What is Raydium LaunchLab and Why is it a Pump.fun Rival? Raydium LaunchLab is essentially a token launchpad built on the Raydium DEX. Think of it as a platform designed to facilitate the initial distribution and trading of new cryptocurrency tokens. But why is it being positioned as a Pump.fun rival ? The context is crucial here. Pump.fun has gained significant traction in the Solana ecosystem for its streamlined and, some might say, ‘easy-to-pump’ token launch mechanism. However, recent whispers suggest Pump.fun is developing its own AMM, which could directly compete with Raydium’s core business. Raydium’s LaunchLab appears to be a preemptive strike, offering projects an alternative launch platform within the Raydium ecosystem itself, especially for those who already prefer Raydium’s AMM. Here’s a quick breakdown of why this rivalry is significant: Market Share: Pump.fun has been making waves. Blockworks reports indicate that tokens launched on Pump.fun accounted for a whopping 41% of Raydium’s swap fee revenue last month. This highlights Pump.fun’s growing influence and the potential revenue at stake. Competitive Response: Raydium launching LaunchLab is a clear signal – they’re not willing to cede ground. It’s a proactive move to retain and attract projects within their ecosystem. Ecosystem Wars: This isn’t just about two platforms; it’s about the direction of the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Will it be dominated by specialized platforms like Pump.fun, or will established DEXs like Raydium consolidate more services under their umbrella? Decoding the Features: What Makes Raydium LaunchLab Stand Out? Raydium is touting several key features for LaunchLab, aiming to attract projects looking for more control and flexibility in their token launches. Let’s break down what Raydium LaunchLab offers: Custom Bonding Curves: This is a significant differentiator. Bonding curves dictate the price of a token as supply changes. LaunchLab allows projects to design custom bonding curves, offering greater control over token price discovery and distribution. This is in contrast to more standardized approaches that other platforms might offer. Flexible Fees: Fees are a critical aspect for any project launching a token. LaunchLab promises flexible fee structures, potentially allowing projects to tailor costs to their specific needs and tokenomics. This could be a major draw for projects mindful of launch expenses. Multi-Token Support: While details are still emerging, multi-token support suggests LaunchLab might facilitate launches involving more complex token structures or perhaps even NFTs alongside fungible tokens. This adds a layer of versatility that could appeal to a broader range of projects. Raydium AMM v4 Integration: For projects already comfortable with or preferring Raydium’s AMM v4, LaunchLab provides a seamless integration. Launching on LaunchLab means projects can easily tap into Raydium’s existing liquidity and user base. Here’s a table summarizing the key features for a quick comparison: Feature Raydium LaunchLab Potential Pump.fun Approach Bonding Curves Customizable Likely Standardized Fees Flexible Potentially Fixed/Less Flexible Token Support Multi-Token Primarily Single Token (as of current understanding) AMM Integration Raydium AMM v4 Potentially Developing Own AMM The DeFi Token Launchpad Arena: Benefits and Challenges Ahead The emergence of token launchpads like Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun is a boon for the DeFi space. They democratize access to token launches, allowing new projects to reach a wider audience and raise capital more efficiently. However, this space also comes with its set of challenges. Benefits of Launchpads: Accessibility for New Projects: Launchpads lower the barrier to entry for new projects to launch their tokens. They provide a platform and infrastructure that might be complex and costly to build independently. Increased Liquidity: By launching on established DEXs or platforms with built-in trading mechanisms, projects can quickly establish liquidity for their tokens. Community Engagement: Launchpads often have existing communities of users interested in new projects, providing immediate exposure and potential investors. Innovation in Token Distribution: Features like custom bonding curves in LaunchLab push the boundaries of how tokens can be distributed and priced, leading to more innovative tokenomics. Challenges and Considerations: Rug Pull Risks: The ease of launching tokens also brings risks. Users need to be vigilant about project due diligence as the barrier to entry decreases, potentially increasing the number of less reputable projects. Market Volatility: Token launches, especially in the DeFi space, can be highly volatile. Investors need to be aware of the risks involved and manage their investments accordingly. Platform Competition: As more launchpads emerge, competition will intensify. Platforms will need to continuously innovate and offer unique value propositions to attract both projects and users. Regulatory Scrutiny: The DeFi space is under increasing regulatory attention. Launchpads and token launches will likely face greater scrutiny as the industry matures. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun Landscape For crypto enthusiasts and project developers, here are some actionable insights to consider as the Solana DEX launchpad landscape evolves: For Project Developers: Evaluate Your Needs: Consider your project’s specific requirements. Do you need highly customizable bonding curves? Is flexible fee structure a priority? Raydium LaunchLab might be a strong contender if these are key factors. Platform Alignment: If you already utilize or prefer Raydium’s AMM, LaunchLab offers seamless integration. If you are exploring different AMM options, weigh the pros and cons of each platform. Community and Exposure: Assess the reach and community engagement offered by each platform. Where will your project gain the most relevant exposure? For Crypto Users and Investors: Due Diligence is Key: Whether it’s a token launched on Raydium LaunchLab or Pump.fun, always conduct thorough research on the project team, tokenomics, and roadmap before investing. Understand the Risks: Be aware of the inherent risks in new token launches, including volatility and potential rug pulls. Invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose. Explore New Opportunities: Launchpads can be a source of early access to promising projects. Keep an eye on platforms like Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun for potential investment opportunities, but always with caution and informed decision-making. Conclusion: The Future of Solana DeFi is Heating Up Raydium’s entry into the launchpad arena with LaunchLab is a significant development for the Solana DeFi ecosystem. By directly challenging Pump.fun and offering a feature-rich platform, Raydium is signaling its ambition to remain a dominant force. This competition is ultimately beneficial for the entire Solana ecosystem, fostering innovation and providing more options for both projects and users. As the battle for DeFi dominance unfolds, keep a close watch on Raydium LaunchLab and Pump.fun – they are shaping the future of token launches on Solana and beyond.

The ever-innovative Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest and a major player in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena, has just dropped a bombshell that could reshape the future of finance. Wood has publicly stated her ambition to tokenize some of Ark Invest’s prominent funds. Yes, you heard that right – tokenization is on the horizon for Ark Invest, and it could be a game-changer. What’s the Buzz About Asset Tokenization and Why Ark Invest is Betting Big? So, what exactly is asset tokenization , and why is Cathie Wood so excited about it? In simple terms, asset tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets – think stocks, bonds, real estate, or even venture fund shares – as digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can then be traded, managed, and interacted with in a much more efficient and accessible way. Cathie Wood, known for her forward-thinking approach and deep dives into disruptive technologies, sees immense potential in asset tokenization . Speaking recently, she emphasized her belief that tokenization is not just a fleeting trend but a major evolutionary step in finance. She anticipates a “tremendous rate” of growth in this space, envisioning a future where tokenization becomes a mainstream practice. Why is Ark Invest so interested in tokenization ? Let’s break it down: Increased Accessibility: Tokenizing funds like Ark’s venture fund (ARKVX) or the Digital Asset Revolution fund could open them up to a wider range of investors. Traditionally, access to venture funds might be limited to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals. Tokenization can fractionalize ownership, making it possible for smaller investors to participate. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded more easily and efficiently on secondary markets compared to traditional fund shares. This increased liquidity can be a significant advantage for investors. Imagine being able to trade shares of a venture fund as easily as you trade crypto ETFs – that’s the potential of tokenization . Operational Efficiency: Blockchain technology, which underpins tokenization , can streamline many administrative and operational processes associated with fund management. This could lead to reduced costs and faster transaction times. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Ark Invest is all about investing in innovation. By embracing tokenization , they are positioning themselves at the forefront of financial technology and preparing for a future where digital assets play an increasingly dominant role. Which Ark Invest Funds Could Be Tokenized? Exploring the Possibilities Cathie Wood specifically mentioned Ark’s venture fund (ARKVX) and the Digital Asset Revolution fund as potential candidates for tokenization . Let’s delve a bit deeper into these funds and why they might be prime for this transformation: Ark Venture Fund (ARKVX): This fund focuses on investing in private and public companies across various sectors, including technology, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. Tokenization could revolutionize access to venture capital, which has historically been a relatively illiquid and exclusive asset class. Ark Digital Asset Revolution Fund: As the name suggests, this fund is already deeply embedded in the digital asset space, investing in companies that are involved in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and digital transactions. Tokenization of this fund would be a natural extension of its existing focus and could further amplify its exposure to the digital asset revolution. While these two funds are specifically highlighted, the potential for tokenization could extend to other Ark Invest funds in the future. The key is to identify funds where tokenization can unlock significant benefits for both Ark Invest and its investors. The Regulatory Landscape: Navigating the Path to Tokenization in the U.S. Cathie Wood is acutely aware of the regulatory environment surrounding tokenization . She acknowledged that the regulatory framework for asset tokenization is still “in the process of being established” in the United States. This is a crucial point, as regulatory clarity is essential for the widespread adoption of tokenization . Currently, the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is complex and evolving. Agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are actively working to define the rules of the road for crypto and tokenization . Ark Invest, with its experience in navigating the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs , is likely well-positioned to work within these evolving regulations to bring its tokenization vision to life. Key regulatory considerations for tokenization include: Regulatory Aspect Considerations Securities Laws Are tokenized fund shares considered securities? If so, they would be subject to SEC regulations, including registration requirements and investor protection rules. Custody and Security Ensuring the secure custody of tokenized assets is paramount. Regulations will likely address the requirements for custodians and the security measures needed to protect investors’ assets. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Tokenization platforms and issuers will need to comply with AML and KYC regulations to prevent illicit activities. Tax Implications Clear tax guidance is needed for tokenized assets to ensure investors understand their tax obligations. Despite the regulatory complexities, Cathie Wood’s confidence suggests that she believes a workable regulatory path exists for tokenization in the U.S. Her experience in launching spot Bitcoin ETFs , which also faced significant regulatory hurdles, demonstrates her ability to navigate challenging regulatory environments. Unlocking the Power of Tokenization: Benefits Beyond Accessibility While increased accessibility and liquidity are major advantages of tokenization , the benefits extend even further. Let’s explore some additional perks: Fractional Ownership: Tokenization enables fractional ownership of assets. Instead of having to buy a whole share of a fund, investors could purchase fractions of tokens, making it more affordable to invest in high-value assets. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional stock markets with limited trading hours, tokenized assets can potentially be traded 24/7 on decentralized exchanges, offering greater flexibility for investors worldwide. Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of all transactions involving tokenized assets. This enhances trust and reduces the risk of fraud. Smart Contracts and Automation: Tokenization can be integrated with smart contracts, enabling automated processes for dividend distribution, voting rights, and other fund management functions. Global Reach: Tokenization can facilitate cross-border investments, making it easier for investors from different countries to access and trade assets. Challenges and Considerations: Is Tokenization a Smooth Ride? While the potential of tokenization is immense, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed: Regulatory Uncertainty: As mentioned earlier, the evolving regulatory landscape remains a key challenge. Clear and consistent regulations are crucial for fostering trust and encouraging wider adoption. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is generally secure, vulnerabilities can exist in smart contracts and tokenization platforms. Robust security measures are essential to protect against hacking and theft. Adoption Hurdles: Educating investors and the broader financial industry about tokenization and its benefits is crucial for driving adoption. Overcoming inertia and traditional practices can be a challenge. Interoperability: Ensuring interoperability between different tokenization platforms and blockchains is important for creating a seamless and interconnected ecosystem. Valuation and Pricing: Establishing clear and reliable methods for valuing and pricing tokenized assets is essential for market efficiency and investor confidence. The Future is Tokenized: How This Trend Could Reshape Investment Cathie Wood’s foray into tokenization signals a significant step towards the future of finance. Asset tokenization has the potential to revolutionize not just fund management but the entire investment landscape. By making assets more accessible, liquid, and efficient, tokenization could democratize investment opportunities and unlock trillions of dollars in value. Imagine a future where: Retail investors can easily invest in a fraction of a commercial real estate property through tokenized shares. Small businesses can raise capital by tokenizing their equity, accessing a global pool of investors. Art and collectibles become more accessible to a wider audience through fractional tokenization . Supply chains become more transparent and efficient through the tokenization of goods and assets. Cathie Wood’s vision for tokenization is not just about Ark Invest funds; it’s about contributing to a broader transformation of the financial system. As the regulatory environment matures and technology advances, asset tokenization is poised to become a defining trend of the coming decade, reshaping how we invest, trade, and interact with assets. Conclusion: A Bold Move Towards a Tokenized Tomorrow Cathie Wood’s intention to tokenize Ark Invest funds is a bold and exciting move that underscores the growing importance of asset tokenization in the financial world. While challenges remain, the potential benefits – increased accessibility, enhanced liquidity, and greater efficiency – are too compelling to ignore. As Ark Invest, a leader in disruptive innovation, embraces tokenization , it sends a powerful signal to the market that the future of finance is increasingly digital and tokenized. Keep a close watch on this space – the tokenization revolution is just getting started, and Ark Invest is ready to lead the charge.

Bitcoin Extends Lead Over Ethereum (ETH) by 30% in Three Weeks Ethereum price has remained trapped within a narrow range below $2,000, weighed down by uncertainty surrounding the Hoodi update and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance. While Ethereum was once projected to surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization, thanks to its decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract capabilities. However, Bitcoin has widened the valuation gap, outperforming ETH significantly in recent weeks. BTC/ETH Ratio | March 18, 2025 | TradingView The BTC/ETH ratio, which tracks the relative performance of both assets, hit a record high of 44.6 on March 14. With Bitcoin trading at $83000 and Ethereum at $1,900, 1 BTC can now purchase over 44 ETH, up 30% from the 1:33 ratio observed at the recent lows of February 25. Ethereum DeFi Ecosystem Sheds $29 Billion in 30 Days Ethereum’s sharp devaluation can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, Trump’s new trade tariff policies have rattled global markets, prompting crypto investors to seek safety in Bitcoin over Ethereum. Secondly, ETH price has struggled with network scalability issues and failed updates, which have dampened investor confidence. Historical data suggests that Ethereum’s devaluation has accelerated after the Ethereum Merge, with multiple failed network upgrades pushing ETH supply above pre-Merge levels. The Ethereum Foundation attempted to regain control by reshuffling leadership in February, yet investor sentiment remains bleak following the disappointing Pectra and Hoodi updates. Ethereum TVL, March 19 2025 | Source: DeFiLlama For context, Ethereum DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) was $118 billion on February 19. However, as per DefiLlama data on March 19, that figure has now plunged to $89 billion, marking a $29 billion capital outflow—25% of the total deposits within Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. This aligns with ETH’s 30% price decline, reinforcing Bitcoin’s dominance as the BTC/ETH trading ratio hit fresh highs. Bearish Outlook for ETH in the Days Ahead The $29 billion drop-off in Ethereum’s DeFi TVL, coupled with continued scalability struggles ahead of the Fed rate decision heigtens bearish risks ahead. As liquidity dries up in the DeFi ecosystem, ETH coins previously locked in smart-contracts trickle into the short-term market supply. Hence, if the capital outflows persist, ETH could face further downward pressure, potentially retesting the $1,500 support zone. Additionally, with Bitcoin dominance widening, ETH price risks losing more market share in the near-term especially if US Fed rate decision falls below market expectations on Wednesday. Ethereum Price Forecast: Bears Must Hold $2,100 Resistance to Avoid Major Liquidations Ethereum price forecast signals lean neutral as it consolidates near $1,941 after a prolonged downtrend, with key technical indicators signaling potential volatility ahead. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $2,413 and the 100-day EMA at $2,695 indicate a bearish trend, while the 200-day EMA at $2,851 reinforces long-term resistance. Ethereum remains firmly below these moving averages, highlighting persistent selling pressure. However, a bullish reversal could emerge if buyers regain momentum above short-term resistance levels. Ethereum price forecast The Bearish Balance Power (BBP) indicator at -107.25 suggests that sellers have dominated price action, maintaining downward pressure over the past month. The recent series of lower highs and lower lows further confirm bearish market structure. However, decreasing volume on red candles implies that selling momentum may be weakening, leaving room for a potential relief rally. A breakout above $2,100 could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bears to cover positions, which may result in a rapid move toward $2,400-$2,500 before an ultimate correction. If the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate decision on Wednesday sparks a positive market reaction, Ethereum could swiftly breach $2,100, invalidating the bearish outlook and exposing short sellers to significant liquidations. Failure to reclaim this level, however, could lead to another retest of $1,700-$1,500, extending the current downtrend.

Investors are awaiting the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates, as any adjustments could influence the crypto market. Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Interest Rates Steady The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain the current interest rate range between 4.25% and 4.5% after its March meeting. Despite ongoing speculation about potential cuts, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently indicated caution in adjusting rates. Powell points to inflation concerns and global economic uncertainties. Some economists suggest that rate cuts may not occur until later in the year. Consequently, Fed rate cuts are projected around June 2025, as inflation remains a focal point of monetary decisions. Powell’s post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET is expected to provide further insight into the Fed’s future approach. With the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting expected to conclude tomorrow, crypto investors remain on edge about interest rate decisions. While market analysts predict that rates will stay unchanged, uncertainty surrounding inflation, trade policies, and economic growth continues to fuel volatility. Crypto Market To Crash? Bitcoin (BTC) has been fluctuating around $85K as the crypto market is in a volatile phase before the FOMC announcement. Many traders believe a crypto market crash could follow if the Fed signals a prolonged period of high interest rates. Specifically, higher interest rates usually benefit more traditional types of investments such as bonds and savings accounts. As a result of this, capital is leaked from riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rate cuts can boost liquidity and drive more money into speculative assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. But the Fed has stayed hawkish for a while, keeping rates higher, in order to curb inflation. Under these conditions, the crypto market is struggling, and a lot of investors are expecting relief from rate cuts in 2025. While inflation seems to be cooling, with the U.S CPI falling from 3.1% to 2.8%, this may not be enough to stop the Fed easing its policy. Incase the Federal Reserve signals that rate cuts are approaching, a surge in altcoin prices could follow. This is because increased liquidity would likely encourage higher risk appetite among traders. However, if the central bank keeps rates high for an extended period, crypto markets may decline. Tightening financial conditions could drive further losses. With investors awaiting Powell’s remarks, the next 24 hours could determine whether the market stabilizes or experiences a crypto market crash.

The newly launched service could enable customers to purchase up to $1 million in debt backed by Bitcoin, excluding UK and Australian clients. In addition, it will allow qualifying members to keep their Bitcoin as a long-term financial instrument while providing several features to safeguard members’ investments and facilitate borrowing. Xapo Bank is providing its members access to Bitcoin-backed lending and loans With Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance in the U.S., Wall Street companies such as Cantor Fitzgerald have established their own Bitcoin financing businesses. As a result, the investment bank has announced partnerships with Anchorage Digital and Copper.co to support its expanding global Bitcoin financing business. During the cryptocurrency boom of the pandemic, Xapo became one of the first banks to open a physical headquarters in Europe, settling in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Last year, the company secured regulatory approval in the UK. Afterwards, it engaged its customers by providing them with interest-bearing Bitcoin accounts and other banking services. Coinbase had previously partnered with Morpho Labs to offer a Bitcoin-backed loan service that let its U.S. users borrow up to 100,000 USD coins. However, it discontinued the issuance of Bitcoin-backed loans in 2023. The companies have since re-established their services using the decentralized lending protocol Morpho. Asset managers are also using decentralized finance (DeFi) to earn a yield on Bitcoin-backed loans. In contrast, Xapo represents a centralized entity. According to a statement, bank customers should obtain approval first, and their linked Bitcoin is stored “in a vault until the loan is paid back” over a timeframe that can extend as much as a year. Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo, believes many longstanding holders of Bitcoin distanced themselves from crypto-asset-backed lending after seeing predatory lending and faulty products. “That’s why we’re doing things differently,” he said. Coinbase’s Bitcoin-backed loan service allows users to borrow up to $100,000 in USDC Except for residents of New York, all Americans can use this service, which is based on the Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network. Borrowers need to over-communicate their loans, where Bitcoin collateral will be automatically converted to Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) , a token backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in Coinbase custody. Coinbase’s loans help users get liquidity without selling their Bitcoin and triggering taxables. Max Branzburg, the company’s vice president, stated that this product aims to improve Bitcoin’s use case in a decentralized environment. It streamlines the loan process, enabling borrowers to receive loans without credit checks or fees. Repayment terms are flexible; however, borrowers need to exercise caution and monitor the value of their collateral to avoid liquidation. As a result, bitcoin-backed loans have become popular among investors who wish to take advantage of liquidity while retaining their holdings. According to estimates by HFT Market Intelligence, the crypto-backed loan market will increase from $8.5 billion in 2024 to $45 billion by 2030. Now that Bitcoin is becoming mainstream, institutions and DeFi protocols are monitoring cryptocurrency lending opportunities more closely. Rivals such as Ledn have also experienced demand for similar products. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

While the broader trend for DOGE remains bearish, analysts are confident of a short-term rally to reclaim its one-month high. Dogecoin Price Targets Breakout To $0.29 As bears stamp their authority in DOGE, there is rippling optimism that the dog-themed cryptocurrency could see a rally. According to an X post by Igor Bondarenko, Dogecoin’s price can go as high as $0.29 in the short term. Bodarenko hinges his prediction on DOGE approaching its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). As the dog-themed project inches toward the EMA, pundits say it may be a support level for traders entering the space. On the flip side, a failure to break the EMA level could spell doom for the beleaguered asset. Per Bondarenko, Dogecoin prices may fall as low as $0.10 in the near future. “A breakout could drive DOGE to $0.23 and $0.29,” said Bodarenko. “If rejected, a drop below $0.14 could send it to $0.10. Long-term predictions for Dogecoin prices are fairly upbeat with one analyst predicting DOGE to hit $20 in the coming months. At the moment, Dogecoin price sits at $0.16 and has gained over 6% over the last 7 days. On-chain Indicators Scream Promise For Dogecoin While short-term technicals are predicting a small spike in Dogecoin’s value, on-chain indicators are pointing to a seismic leap. For one, DOGE address activity has soared to 1 million unique users with active addresses spiking by 400%. Furthermore, fundamentals are indicating potential for a rally as high as $50. The filing of a DOGE ETF application by BlackRock may be the trigger for a seismic rally for the memecoin. Other institutional players are watching the space with keen interest as the assets move from memecoin to begin clutching at real-world applications. Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analysts DOGECAPITAL and Trader Tardigrade remain optimistic in their prediction that DOGE can clinch $80, citing cyclical patterns from 2021. “If historical trends repeat, Dogecoin is likely to begin its upward reversal soon, entering phase 2 of its parabolic rise,” said DOGECAPITAL The post Dogecoin Price Eyes Breakout To $0.29 In The Short Term appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|DOGE Price Rally|Dogecoin (DOGE)|Dogecoin price Analysis,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-19 00:57:40

Meanwhile, Hedera (HBAR), currently trading around $0.19, is making headlines as a prominent whale shifts focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), an emerging DeFi project in its presale phase. This strategic investment has sparked widespread speculation of an impending bull run, with analysts closely watching the market for a breakout rally. Why The Whale is Shifting to Mutuum Finance Meanwhile, crypto whales are doubling down on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in its presale at $0.02, as analysts predict a surge to $5 after launch. This fast-growing altcoin currently exists in the third stage of its presale period contributing to its nearly $3.9 million funding pool. The cryptocurrency price stands at $0.025 in the upcoming stage and more than 6100 investors have already added their stakes before the expected 25% increase occurs. Early investors who purchase during this stage can multiply their investment by 200% upon release at $0.06. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contrast model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. Mutuum Finance Presale Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $3.9 million in investments and now attracts more than 6100 investors. The Phase 3 token price at $0.02 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 25% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Potential investors who join during the presale period could earn 200% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the Decentralized market market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. Transforming Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance uses Ethereum to stabilize its stablecoin through USD fund deposits. The stablecoin system supports financial transactions through its resistant structure that prevents algorithmic stability problems. Mutuum Finance establishes decentralized finance development through the unification of modern financial lending methods alongside strong infrastructure systems. The crypto market continues to advance as XRP shows sign of reaching $4 while Hedera’s (HBAR) receives whale activity and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) grows in strength. Mutuum Finance provides investors with an early entry opportunity to benefit from its expanding dual-model decentralized lending system. The presale price sits at $0.02 while the ongoing fundraising has reached $3.9 million from more than 6,100 investors which makes the future price increase to $0.025 the ideal time to enter the market. Secure MUTM tokens during the presale to be a part of DeFi’s future because this strategic move guarantees at least 200% profit potential.

Why Another 30% Crash Against Bitcoin Could Be Imminent,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-price-on-the-brink-why-another-30-crash-against/,"Ethereum price is at a critical point. As it struggles to keep up with Bitcoin (BTC), new indicators hint at a possible 30% drop ahead. With key technical levels weakening and market sentiment turning, the Ethereum price could be in for a sharp fall. Meanwhile, assets like FloppyPepe (FPPE) continue to surge against the tide. Selling out its private sale in a record time of 24 hours, the AI token garnered almost $1 million indicating early adoption and investor confidence. In its ongoing presale, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is selling out at a low price of $0.0000002. Prolonged Downtrend Pushes Ethereum Price Toward Critical Levels The Ethereum price is currently facing significant downward pressure against Bitcoin (BTC), with technical indicators suggesting a potential 30% decline. The ETH/BTC pair has reached multi-year lows, dropping to 0.022 BTC, a level not seen since May 2020. Crypto analyst Alessandro Ottaviani characterizes the current rapid and steep Ethereum price decline as a “falling knife” scenario, cautioning that attempting to buy in at perceived low points may result in further losses if the downtrend continues. This decline is part of a prolonged downtrend, with Ethereum’s native token, Ether losing over 85% against Bitcoin (BTC) since its peak in June 2017. The RSI on the two-week ETH/BTC chart has fallen to a record low of 23.32, indicating persistent oversold conditions and raising concerns about further depreciation. The Ethereum price is at $1,919 , a struggle to surpass the $2,500 mark has persistently been close to impossible. Ethereum (ETH) is precariously positioned, with technical indicators pointing toward a possible 30% decline against Bitcoin (BTC).

This intense run of declines saw the cryptocurrency reach a low of $1,750 on March 11, marking its lowest point since November 2023. However, despite this steep drop, a new technical setup suggests Ethereum could be on the verge of a bullish turnaround, as it now retests a key resistance level on the 4-hour chart. Ethereum Retests Critical Resistance After Rebound Ethereum’s price action has been full of downtrends and many investors exiting their positions since the beginning of March. As such, Ethereum broke finally below $2,000 on March 10 after support failed to hold, and has spend the past week trading below this level. Related Reading: Ethereum, Dogecoin Lead Large Cap Losses As Bitcoin Moves Into Bear Market Territory Although after sinking to $1,750, Ethereum has shown signs of recovery and has now rebounded to around $1,900. This little price action of recovery has brought the cryptocurrency back to a downward-sloping resistance trendline, a level that has acted as a barrier to brief upward movements of accumulations during the recent downtrend. The test of this resistance now presents a potential breakout scenario where bullish momentum flows into Ethereum. An analyst on TradingView highlighted this setup, noting that a breakout above the resistance trendline could open the doors for a significant rally above $2,000. Analyst Sets Bullish Price Targets For ETH Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment that continues to weigh heavily on the broader crypto market, a TradingView analyst has identified a bullish trade setup on Ethereum’s 4-hour candlestick chart. This suggests that despite the recent decline, there remains a degree of optimism among some analysts and investors who believe Ethereum could soon regain its bullish footing. Related Reading: Ethereum In 2024 Vs. 2025: What Important Technical Indicators Are Saying According to the analysis, a confirmed breakout above $1,885 could serve as an ideal entry point. At the time of writing, Ethereum is yet to break above the downward sloping resistance trendline, as the breakout point is currently set just below $2,000. If Ethereum were to eventually break above the resistance, the analyst noted a probable price target of $2,596. On the flip side, the analysis advices placing a stop loss at $1,700, meaning the setup is structured to manage risk while aiming for substantial gains. This is in case if the bearish momentum is too great to be overcome, and the Ethereum price gets rejected again at the resistance trendline. Given the high-risk reward ratio, the analyst advised watching for a surge in volume, which would provide confirmation that Ethereum is breaking out with momentum. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,895. Price action in the past 24 hours saw Ethereum reach an intra-day high of $1,950 before rejecting. However, the leading altcoin is still rolling around this resistance trendline, and there is a chance of a push upward again in the next 48 hours.

Four.Meme said in a March 18 X post that its launch function was back after inspecting and addressing a security issue. It had earlier suspended the function to investigate it, saying it was “under attack.” “The launch function has now been resumed after a thorough security inspection. Our team has addressed the issue and reinforced system security. Compensation for affected users is underway,” the Four.Meme team said. Source: Four.Meme Web3 security firm ExVul said in a March 18 X post that the exploit appeared to be a market manipulation technique known as a sandwich attack that netted the attacker $120,000. It said the attacker “pre-calculated the address for creating the liquidity pool’s trading pair” and utilized one of the platform’s functions to purchase tokens, which successfully bypassed Four.Meme’s token transfer restrictions. “Subsequently, the hacker lay in wait for Four.Meme to add liquidity to the transaction, ultimately siphoning off the funds,” ExVul added. Source: ExVul Blockchain security firm CertiK came to a similar conclusion and said the attacker transferred an imbalanced amount of un-launched tokens to pair addresses before the pair was created, then manipulated the price at launch to sell them afterward for profit. “In this case of SBL token, for example, the attacker sent a bit of SBL token to the pre-calculated pair address in advance, then profited 21.1 BNB by sandwiching the add liquidity transaction at launch,” CertiK said. Source: CertiK The tactic saw the attacker leave with at least 192 BNB ( BNB ), worth about $120,000, which they sent to the decentralized crypto exchange FixedFloat, according to CertiK.

41890581,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=695580,1742349316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41890581.jpeg,Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood says most meme coins are headed to zero,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cathie-wood-meme-coins-are-headed-to-zero/,"The $2.6 trillion crypto market is drowning in meme coins, and Cathie Wood says most of them will crash. The Ark Invest CEO said on Bloomberg Television that the flood of new tokens created by AI and blockchain technology is nothing but a hype cycle that will end with investors holding worthless coins. “There are millions of meme coins being created, and they are not going to be worth very much,” Cathie said. She made it clear: her private funds are not investing in them. She warned that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has no plans to regulate meme coins, meaning buyers are on their own. “If I have one message for those listening who are buying meme coins: buyer beware. There’s nothing like losing money for people to learn, and they’ll learn that the SEC and regulators are not taking responsibility for these meme coins.” Trump’s meme coin explodes, then collapses Days before taking office, Donald Trump launched his own meme coin. It attracted billions in trading volume almost instantly. But the hype didn’t last. The price crashed, proving Cathie’s point about how quickly these tokens can lose value. Some investors still see meme coins as a form of digital collectibles rather than serious investments. “Some will withstand the judgment of time,” Cathie said, adding that Trump’s token could be one of the few that survive. The biggest meme coin remains Dogecoin, which has a market cap of over $50 billion. Others like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk have also gained massive followings. For retail traders, the appeal is clear: meme coins are cheap, and if they skyrocket, early buyers can make massive returns. But Cathie is not convinced. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, most meme coins have no real use case, and their prices can rise or fall within minutes. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana keep growing While Cathie dismissed meme coins, she reinforced her optimism about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. She pointed to their growing adoption, saying the number of use cases is only increasing. Bitcoin remains the strongest player, and she has repeatedly predicted it will surpass $1 million by 2030. For now, Bitcoin sits below $82,000, down about 13% this year. But unlike meme coins, it has institutional backing and a fixed supply, which helps drive long-term demand. Ethereum and Solana also continue to grow, with more projects being built on their networks. Meanwhile, the meme coin market continues to operate in the Wild West. Prices swing wildly, mostly because a handful of people control the supply. Many meme coins are concentrated in the hands of developers and insiders, meaning they can dump their holdings at any time, leaving others with worthless tokens. Scams are another issue. Rug pulls, where developers abandon a project and take the money, are common. Few meme coins are audited, making them easy targets for hacks. Buyers rarely know what they are investing in, and Cathie sees this as a major red flag. Trump’s token and the controversy Unlike most meme coins, Trump’s token has direct ties to the former president. The $Trump token features an image of him with his fist raised, a reference to a photo taken after the assassination attempt at one of his campaign rallies. The token launched on the Solana blockchain and was quickly listed on Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Robinhood. A second token, $Melania, became available on Kraken, KuCoin, and Bitget. In the first few days, $Trump surged more than tenfold, hitting $73.4 before losing steam when $Melania was introduced. The most controversial part? 80% of the $Trump token supply is owned by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC—companies linked to Trump’s business interests. That gives them control over liquidity and price movements, something that has worried critics. Reactions to Trump’s token have been mixed. Some crypto traders saw it as a sign that Trump supports crypto and could bring more legitimacy to the space. Others were less enthusiastic. Some investors were hoping for a serious push toward crypto regulation, not another meme coin. Financial regulators were not amused. Government watchdogs immediately criticized the token, calling it another ethics violation by Trump. Critics argued that it was just another way for him to profit off his political image.

Can XRP price breach the $2.5 resistance in the upcoming trading sessions? XRP Price Remains Below $2.30 as Investors Shift Focus to Low-Cap Altcoins Ripple (XRP) was among the top-performing altcoins last week, driven by reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) was considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of its settlement talks with Ripple. The anticipation that this move could eliminate a significant regulatory hurdle for altcoin ETF approvals fueled a strong rally. Investors flocked to XRP, alongside other top altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), and Hedera (HBAR), with ETF approval filling in progress, all of which posted double-digit gains before facing corrections this week. Ripple (XRP) price trading below $2.30, March 19, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap However, this week, the momentum has shifted away from XRP as new ETF developments have emerged. Canary Capital’s filing for a SUI spot ETF —its sixth altcoin ETF filing —alongside Nasdaq’s Polkadot ETF application has spurred fresh investor interest. As a result, both DOT and SUI have experienced notable price surges. A broader market analysis suggests that investors are rotating capital out of last week’s top gainers, including XRP, in pursuit of these emerging narratives. This rotation has left Ripple price trading below the $2.30 mark on Thursday, with its trading volume declining alongside other major altcoins such as LTC, SOL, and ADA, all of which have seen increased selling pressure over the past 24 hours. XRP Derivative Traders Take a Cautious but Optimistic Stance Ahead of US Fed Rate Decision While XRP’s price has struggled to maintain momentum this week, investors have rotated capital into emerging altcoins like Polkadot (DOT) and SUI, driven by fresh ETF narratives. Despite the bearish sentiment in the spot market, derivatives trading data reveals a more optimistic outlook, with traders positioning themselves for potential upside ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate decision. Three vital derivative trading indices compiled by CoinGlass on Wednesday suggesting an imminent bullish reversal in XRP price momentum: 1. XRP Derivatives Volume Climbs 7.34% as Open Interest Rises XRP derivatives trading volume has increased by 7.34%, reaching $5.05 billion, while open interest (OI)—the total value of active futures contracts—has edged up 1.85% to $3.19 billion. This signals growing market participation, with traders actively opening new positions in anticipation of heightened volatility. An uptick in OI typically reflects confidence in an impending price move. Ripple (XRP) Derivatives Markets Analysis, March 19 2025 | Source: Coinglass 2. Long/Short Ratio Indicates Bullish Leverage Bias On leading exchanges, XRP traders are showing a strong inclination towards long positions. The long/short ratio on Binance XRP/USDT accounts stands at 2.394, meaning there are nearly 2.4 long positions for every short. Similarly, OKX’s long/short ratio is 2.01, reinforcing the bullish outlook. When traders disproportionately favor longs, it often suggests an expectation of upward price movement. 3. Sell-Side Liquidations Decline as Bulls Gain Control XRP’s sell-side liquidations have notably decreased, suggesting that bearish pressure is easing. In contrast, buy-side liquidations have risen, indicating that leveraged traders are positioning for an upward price move. This shift reduces the risk of downside volatility and supports the case for a potential recovery rally. XRP Market Outlook: Despite short-term price consolidation below the $2.30 level, XRP derivatives traders appear to be positioning for a bullish breakout towards $2.50. With rising open interest, a positive long/short ratio, and reduced sell-side liquidations, XRP may be primed for an upward move—contingent on the broader market reaction to the Fed’s rate decision on Wednesday. XRP Price Forecast: $2.50 Breakout Could Spur More Gains XRP price forecast remains cautiously bullish as the price consolidates around $2.28, with technical indicators showing mixed signals ahead of a potential breakout. The Bollinger Bands (BB) midpoint at $2.33 remains a key resistance level, while the lower BB at $1.95 provides strong support. A decisive break above $2.33 could trigger momentum toward $2.50, where a breakout may fuel an extended rally. XRP Price Forecast The MACD indicator is flashing early signs of a bullish crossover, with the MACD line moving upward toward the signal line, suggesting waning bearish momentum. Additionally, the histogram bars are transitioning from red to green, reinforcing the potential for a bullish reversal. The previous 30% rally within four trading sessions, highlighted in the chart, sets a precedent for XRP’s ability to surge once a breakout occurs. However, the recent 7.88% retracement over the last four sessions raises caution. A failure to reclaim $2.33 could see further declines, with $2.00 as the next major support. The trading volume of 609M during the recent pullback suggests some hesitation among buyers. If XRP can sustain momentum and break $2.50, it could target $2.70-$2.90 in the coming weeks. Conversely, rejection at resistance could trigger further downside consolidation.

In a March 18 X post, “rxbt” — the maintainer of the bot called “aixbt,” which commentates on the market — said its core systems weren’t impacted, and the breach wasn’t the result of manipulating the AI. “We’ve migrated servers, swapped keys, paused dashboard access for security upgrades, and reported hacker addresses to exchanges,” rxbt added. Source: rxbt CoinGecko data shows that the aixbt (AIXBT) token on the Ethereum layer 2 Base has fallen 15.5% to 9 cents since the hack , which happened on March 18 at 1:58 am UTC.

Spencer Farrar, a partner at the AI and crypto-focused venture capital firm Theory Ventures, told Cointelegraph that these AI applications are “a bit frothy” at the moment, but more utility could come down the line. Farrar expects to see further experimentation with crypto AI tokens, as they allow retail investors to speculate on smaller market cap ideas that largely aren’t as accessible in the stock market. “Things tend to start off like this in the open-source world; you see a ton of tinkering, and then perhaps we’ll see something really big come of it.” Related: Not every AI agent needs its own cryptocurrency: CZ Decentralized AI researcher “S4mmy” said on X that AI agents managing crypto funds must be battle-tested further to ensure threat actors can’t easily compromise AI bots and steal funds. “Excited to see how these solutions evolve over the next 12 months as large DeFi protocols integrate existing solutions or develop their own,” they added.

A BNB whale recently moved $338 million worth of BNB to Binance, fueling speculation about a potential sell-off. Despite concerns, BNB’s price held strong, jumping 7% in 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Cardano price has seen volatility after the network finalized its first-ever Constitution, a key step toward decentralization. ADA surged 126% in Q4 but now trades at $0.76, pulling back from its recent highs. While these networks react to crypto market downturn signals, BlockDAG is moving forward with its most critical milestone yet. The Final Testnet on March 28 isn’t just another update—it’s the last step before Mainnet. Every stress test, transaction, and feature is setting the stage for mass adoption, proving BlockDAG’s real-world impact before it goes fully live. BlockDAG’s Final Testnet: The Last Step Before Adoption BlockDAG’s Final Testnet goes live on March 28, and it’s more than just a technical step—it’s a direct countdown to Mainnet and mass adoption. While most testnets are routine, this one is different. Every stress test, transaction, and feature rolled out will serve as proof-of-concept before BlockDAG enters full-scale operations. The crypto market has seen uncertainty with the recent crypto market downturn, but BlockDAG isn’t slowing down. Instead, it’s pushing forward, ensuring its technology is tested and optimized before going live. Momentum is already strong. BlockDAG’s presale has raised $203.5 million, with over 18.7 billion BDAG coins sold across 27 batches. The price has jumped 2,380% from $0.001 to $0.0248, rewarding early buyers. With 10 major exchange listings confirmed, demand is expected to rise further as the network moves closer to its Mainnet launch. Unlike projects struggling in the crypto market downturn, BlockDAG is growing its ecosystem, attracting developers, and strengthening its position. With the SpaceDev partnership, BlockDAG is also focusing on developer engagement through hackathons, grant programs, and ecosystem expansion. March 28 isn’t just another update—it’s a turning point that will prove the network is ready for real-world adoption. As this final phase unfolds, all eyes are on what happens next. Market Reacts as a BNB Whale Moves $338M A BNB whale has transferred $338 million worth of BNB to Binance, raising speculation about a possible sell-off. Large transfers like this often trigger uncertainty, but the market absorbed the pressure well. Instead of dropping, BNB jumped 7% in 24 hours and is up 10.79% over the past week. Some believe this move signals participation in an upcoming Binance Launchpool event, while others see it as a repositioning strategy. Despite the uncertainty, BNB has held steady, showing strong demand. Analysts are watching for a potential price dip, with predictions of BNB falling to $450 before rebounding later in the year. Historically, movements by a BNB whale have led to volatility, and this case is no different. With Binance-backed projects like Babylon, Zircuit, and StakeStone gaining traction, BNB’s long-term outlook remains a major point of discussion. Community Vote Finalized, but Cardano Price Remains Volatile The Cardano price saw a strong rally in late 2024, jumping 126% in Q4 and reaching $0.84 after years of trading below $0.50. This momentum came as the network finalized its first official Cardano Constitution, which passed with 85% community approval. The ratification marks a major step toward decentralization, with over 108,000 delegators and 800+ DReps now actively shaping governance. Despite the milestone, ADA has struggled to hold its gains, with the Cardano price now at $0.76, down from its peak of $1.23 in Q3 2024. Cardano’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) surged 94% QoQ, reaching $448.9 million, showing increased adoption in the ecosystem. However, network fees have spiked 254% to $1.8 million, which could impact user engagement. With the focus shifting toward scalability and expansion in 2025, ADA’s price action remains uncertain as the market waits for further developments. Summing Up The BNB whale transfer of $338 million to Binance has raised speculation, but instead of a sell-off, BNB’s price climbed 7% and remains steady. Meanwhile, the Cardano price has pulled back to $0.76, even after the network finalized its first Cardano Constitution and saw DeFi TVL grow 94% to $448.9 million. While these networks navigate uncertainty, BlockDAG is pushing forward with its Final Testnet on March 28. This isn’t just a technical step—it’s a countdown to mass adoption. With $203.5 million raised, 18.7 billion BDAG coins sold, and 10 CEX listings ahead, momentum is strong. Every transaction in this testnet proves BlockDAG’s real-world impact before the Mainnet launches, making this a critical moment for the network and its supporters.

But amidst all the noise, many are starting to realize that they may have missed some of the top cryptos for significant returns. Mantra Coin, for example, had its moment and some folks might be kicking themselves for not jumping on board sooner. If you’re one of those who missed the boat, don’t sweat it — there’s another big shot you still have time to grab. If you’re looking for the next big thing, you might want to pay attention to Qubetics . This project is getting a lot of hype, and analysts are predicting massive returns, especially with its presale still ongoing. With a project like Qubetics, the opportunity isn’t slipping through the cracks — it’s right in front of you. Let’s talk about how Qubetics is more than just a coin. It’s offering real solutions to problems other crypto projects have failed to address, particularly with its QubeQode IDE platform. For those looking to dive into something that’s not only profitable but actually useful in real-world applications, Qubetics is that next big move. The hype is real, and analysts are projecting big price spikes after the presale ends. Here’s a breakdown of why Qubetics should be on your radar when looking for top cryptos for significant returns in 2025. Mantra Coin: A Missed Opportunity Mantra Coin’s rise to fame was like a rollercoaster. In the early days, it had a lot of potential — the promise of staking rewards and decentralized governance got people excited. But despite all that, the project never quite reached the heights that many had hoped for. If you’re one of the people who kept saying “maybe next time,” you probably missed out on some serious gains. It’s easy to feel like you dropped the ball with Mantra Coin, but hey, the crypto world is all about second chances. Even with all the excitement surrounding Mantra Coin, its market performance just didn’t align with expectations. As the space grew and new projects like Qubetics emerged, it became clear that some of the older coins didn’t evolve quickly enough. The takeaway here? Timing matters. Sure, you may have missed Mantra Coin, but that doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of the next big thing. Qubetics is here, and it’s gaining ground quickly. Unlike its predecessors, this one has a solid roadmap, cutting-edge technology, and a much more exciting vision for the future. Analysts are predicting big things for Qubetics, with prices set to soar once the presale ends. Those who missed Mantra Coin still have a chance to make a splash in 2025 — but it’s about choosing the right opportunity. And Qubetics might just be it. Qubetics: The Popular Crypto Coin to Buy in 2025 Now, let’s get into the heart of the matter. If you’re hunting for top cryptos for significant returns, Qubetics ($TICS) is where the money’s at. This project has been on fire lately, and it’s easy to see why. Not only does Qubetics offer a solid technical foundation, but it’s tackling real-world issues that other cryptocurrencies haven’t even come close to solving. The big game-changer here? The QubeQode IDE platform. This isn’t just some “to the moon” coin with no substance — Qubetics has a purpose. For anyone looking to develop software or create decentralized applications, QubeQode is a tool that will change the game. Think about it: you’re a software developer who wants to build the next big app. But using clunky, outdated tools is holding you back. With QubeQode, those problems are solved. It’s fast, efficient, and designed to make the development process easier and more cost-effective. Whether you’re a tech startup looking to streamline your development, a small business owner trying to build a decentralized app, or a student working on a blockchain project, Qubetics has something to offer. And here’s where it gets really interesting. As the Qubetics presale enters its 26th stage, analysts are making some pretty bold predictions. Currently priced at $0.1181 per token, $TICS is poised for massive growth. Analysts are predicting it could hit $0.25 by the time the presale ends, offering a 111% ROI. But that’s just the start. Once the mainnet launches, the price of $TICS could skyrocket to $5, offering a 4130% ROI — that’s huge. Qubetics: Real-Life Applications and Benefits Let’s talk specifics.

The switch to Vaulta is tentatively scheduled for the end of May and will include a new token and the establishment of an advisory group known as the Vaulta Banking Advisory Council to help with the firm’s new direction, the company said in a March 18 statement. In a separate statement, the firm said the network’s EOS ( EOS ) token will transition to the Vaulta Token, which will be available on the nearly 140 exchanges where EOS trades and through a swap portal available in May. It added that the token’s ticker and technical details will be revealed at a later date. Source: EOS Network Vaulta will also inherit EOS Network’s underlying infrastructure, including integration with the Bitcoin digital banking solution, exSat, which complements Vaulta’s BankingOS system, offering a suite of financial services through partnerships with Ceffu, Spirit Blockchain and Blockchain Insurance Inc. EOS Network’s rebranding to Vaulta marks a significant course correction for the blockchain, which launched to great fanfare in June 2018 off the back of a year-long and largest-ever $4.1 billion ICO run by the company behind the network, Block.one. Following its launch, EOS was a top 10 project by market cap for several years. But its value has been in steady decline and is now just inside the top 100, sitting at 95, according to CoinGecko. There’s a range of opinions about where EOS went wrong. Some who volunteered to assist in developing the network say there was a lack of support and direction from Block.one. Related: Tracing the evolution of Blockchain, with Eos Network Foundation exec Block.one made a $24 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2019, and some commentators argued that the firm’s focus then shifted from EOS’ base tech to other projects — like the social app-turned-NFT marketplace Voice and the crypto exchange Bullish. Goodblock CEO Douglas Horn believes EOS investors were misled from the start, telling Cointelegraph Magazine in 2023 that “Block.one did a deceitful ICO, whether that was planned from the beginning or not.” Magazine: Whatever happened to EOS?

Historically, when Bitcoin has faced these levels in a bull market, it’s broken through, held steady, and soared higher. Bitcoin is hovering around $85K as the crypto market experiences volatility ahead of the FOMC announcement. Many traders fear a market crash if the Fed hints at keeping interest rates high for a longer period. However, in a latest X post, Lark Dewis, a Bitcoin investor and entrepreneur, is referring to a chart created 150 years ago by a farmer from Ohio that shows when to make the most money in markets. This chart has been notably accurate in the past such as predicting the market crash in 2008 by advising people to exit in 2007. New ATH For Bitcoin Soon? His chart divides the market into cycles and signals the “good times”, “hard times,” and years in which panics have occurred, and has specific years marked for optimal profit-taking. Now, the chart suggests that 2026 will be a “year of good times,” likely indicating a great time to sell and take profits. The question being raised is whether this market cycle will extend to 2026 and if we will see a new all-time high for Bitcoin next year. https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1902008405012713579 Ultimately, he shared that we will have to wait and see, as only time will reveal if the prediction holds true. Analysts’ Point Of Views While on-chain data is suggesting that Bitcoin’s market might be changing, recently, Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, believes that the bull run could be finished, and we may see prices either move slowly or drop for the next 6 to 12 months. Analysts predict Bitcoin could hit new all-time highs by June 2025. However, a rising wedge pattern on the BTC chart suggests that it might happen even sooner. The wedge is nearing its breaking point, and if Bitcoin breaks out, we could see a huge price surge. On the other hand, a rejection could lead to more downside for the cryptocurrency. $1M By 2029? Bitcoin has dropped 30% since hitting new highs in mid-January. While this may seem concerning, it’s actually a typical pullback in a bull market. In past bull runs, Bitcoin has fallen as much as 55% before going on to hit new all-time highs. Besides, despite a bearish outlook, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2029, citing its history of growth after dips. He believes a “dip then rip” trend may happen again. FOMC Meeting Decides The Course Bitcoin is hovering around $83,500 with little movement as the market waits for tomorrow’s FOMC meeting. With uncertainty in the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed is playing it safe in March, offering little guidance on what’s next, which has left the market uncertain. If rates stay the same, Bitcoin and crypto could see some momentum, especially since Polymarket is predicting a 100% chance of a rate cut in May.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 02:27:58

Markets are sliding, traders are on edge, and the economy isn’t making things easier. The central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged, but that won’t be enough to calm investors. Everyone is waiting for Jerome Powell to speak. His press conference and the Fed’s new economic projections will shape the next big move. Wall Street is already bracing for the worst. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 10% from its last high. Investors are nervous. The Fed’s projections aren’t reliable either, with Goldman Sachs warning that they might still include two rate cuts despite economic uncertainty. Tariff policies under Donald Trump remain unclear, making inflation even harder to predict. The central bank will pretend it has control, but the market knows better. Fed’s next move could break market confidence Traders have been counting on the Fed put, the idea that the central bank will act to prevent a complete market crash. That belief is getting tested. If the Fed signals a hawkish stance or even hesitates, it could trigger a deeper sell-off. The market has already been struggling, and another hit could send stocks lower. Venu Krishna, a strategist at Barclays, told investors that panic hasn’t fully set in, but it might. “This may be due to markets’ faith in the Fed put, which crucially could be put to test this week at the FOMC meeting,” Krishna said . If Powell delivers an unexpected stance on inflation or rate cuts, Wall Street could spiral. Meanwhile, Larry Benedict, founder of The Opportunistic Trader, pointed to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which tracks market fear. It’s lower than last August’s levels, but that doesn’t mean much. “Volatility is a little bit higher, but for what’s going on in the market, it’s not really that high,” Benedict said. If markets are underestimating the risk, things could unravel fast. The S&P 500 has fallen after five of the last ten Fed meetings, with the biggest drop hitting nearly 3% back in December. If Powell’s press conference brings more uncertainty, that pattern could continue. Wall Street sentiment crashes as cash piles up The latest Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey sent another warning signal. Investor sentiment just saw its biggest drop since March 2020, when the markets crashed during the pandemic. Michael Hartnett, an investment strategist at Bank of America, called it a “bull crash”, a complete reversal in optimism due to growth fears and Trump’s tariff policies. It was the seventh biggest sentiment drop in 24 years. Investors are running. Exposure to U.S. equities saw the biggest drop on record. Traders are also hoarding cash at levels last seen during the March 2020 crash. Wall Street is in full defense mode. Economic growth expectations collapsed, posting the second-largest drop in history. That matters. The survey’s growth outlook has always lined up with S&P 500 performance, and the decline suggests bad news for stocks. Some traders think the worst is over. Hartnett noted that this kind of sentiment drop could mean the market pullback is nearing its end. But he also warned that the data isn’t bad enough to suggest a true bottom yet. Stocks could still fall further. The S&P 500 barely held out of correction territory on Tuesday, avoiding a 10% drop from its last high. The market is in a dangerous place.

Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $83,000 mark, while XRP and Solana saw sharper declines. The global cryptocurrency market showed modest gains over the past day, with the total market capitalization rising to $2.72 trillion, reflecting a 0.26% increase. However, trading activity slightly declined, with the total market volume slipping 1.34% to $72.25 billion in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) price today Bitcoin traded at $82,636.21, down around 0.71% in the past 24 hours. The coin’s 24-hour trading range was between $81,179.99 and $83,505.6. Bitcoin’s market dominance edged lower, falling 0.22% to 60.57%. US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a rebound on Monday, recording net inflows of $274.6 million—the highest daily figure in six weeks. This marks a sharp turnaround after five consecutive weeks of outflows, which had drained over $5 billion from these funds since February 4. Despite the recent decline in investor sentiment, the latest inflows pushed cumulative all-time net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs to $35.9 billion. Ethereum (ETH) price today Ethereum (ETH) price bucked the general trend to trade in the green on Wednesday. The token was up over 1% to trade at $1,932.14. The intraday low and high were $1,872.51 and $1,947.77, respectively. Ether has struggled to regain momentum after falling below $2,200 on March 9, with the altcoin down 14% this month. The decline has weighed on investor sentiment, especially as the broader crypto market has only dropped 4% in the same period. XRP and SOL price today XRP fell over 1.4%, trading at $2.26 after hitting an intraday low of $2.23 and a high of $2.30. Solana (SOL) registered a 0.4% drop to $124.68 trading between $121.94 and $125.98 in the past 24 hours. Trading volume was down 6% at $2.35 billion. Solana’s SOL futures debuted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Monday, marking a key milestone for institutional access to the asset. However, unlike the highly anticipated launches of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures, the introduction of SOL derivatives generated little excitement. The first day of trading saw a notional daily volume of $12.3 million, with open interest reaching $7.8 million. These figures are notably lower compared to the initial trading activity seen during the CME debuts of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures.

DJT on Truth Social – wow he's confirming XRP will be included in the Strategic Reserve. 10:24am Eastern https://t.co/5L1o192c59 pic.twitter.com/FplPRzFi0p — Kim Runner (@kimrunner) March 2, 2025 However, a week later, the US President signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and a separate US Digital Asset Stockpile. He authorized the treasury and commerce secretaries to find budget neutral ways to accumulate more Bitcoin. However, no such plans to add to the Digital Asset Stockpile were announced. And as it turned out, XRP didn’t even make it into the stockpile. The stockpile is made up of crypto assets confiscated in prior law enforcement actions, and no XRP made it in. The U.S. government holds a massive crypto portfolio, with Bitcoin making up 98% of its total holdings Top assets in the portfolio: – 198K BTC ($17.64B) – 56K ETH ($122.2M) – 750 WBTC ($66.6M) – 40.2K BNB ($24.1M) – 15.1M TRX ($3.71M) pic.twitter.com/YnhAEKz82O — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) March 8, 2025 Given that the executive order ruled out adding additional assets to the stockpile, it would appear that XRP has now totally missed out. However, still at $2.26, the XRP price remains elevated more than 4x above its levels prior to President Trump’s election victory last November. As difficult macro conditions weigh on risk appetite and the broader crypto market, it would appear that there is quite some room for deflation in the XRP market. XRP Price Prediction – Can it Surge 500%? The rising risk that the US economy slumps into a recession in 2025 could drive substantial further downside in the crypto market in the coming months. XRP could quickly fall all the way back to its 2023 highs under $1.0, even if the SEC settles its case against Ripple Labs. However, once macro conditions start to improve, potentially facilitated by a major easing of US financial conditions, could the bull market return with a bang? Could XRP end Trump’s four year term 500% higher than current levels? Well, everything is possible in crypto. But investors need to be aware of some major redflags before investing in XRP. Firstly, Bitcoin is catching the global zeitgeist right now thanks to the growing narrative that it is “digital gold”, thanks to its decentralized and neutral nature. XRP can make no such claim – the XRP Ledger is powered by a network of nodes that Ripple retains major influence over. Secondly, Ripple also continues to hold over 55% of the pre-mined supply, raising concerns about future market manipulation and sell pressure. BREAKING: Even under FIT21 as recently passed by the U.S. House, XRP does NOT constitute a ""decentralized system"" pic.twitter.com/D03gmTfTm7 — Bryan Jacoutot (@BryanJacoutot) January 26, 2025 Finally, XRP’s real world utility remain under scrutiny. Ripple’s entire business aims to facilitate inter-bank transactions and settlement in a more efficient way than the current SWIFT system. However, in its more than 12 years of existence, the jury is out over whether its really made much of a dent. Meanwhile, in more exciting areas of crypto industry growth, such as DeFi , XRP is nowhere to be seen. Per DeFi Llama , the total value of crypto locked into smart contracts on its blockchain was around $80 million. Despite its big name, XRP remains a high speculative crypto play. It could rally 500% to above $10 per token in the coming years, but this would require some major developments in terms of real world adoption. However, the hype around Trump showing some favoritism to the token could fade now that XRP failed to make it into the crypto reserve, and XRP could just as easily crash from current levels. A Better Bet – Solaxy (SOLX) A crypto with a better possibility of rallying 500% this year might be an exciting new project called Solaxy (SOLX) . Solaxy is a soon to launch, first of its kind layer-2 scaling blockchain on Solana. Solana, while known for its speed and cheap fees, continues to suffer from serious congestion problems at times of high demand. Anticipating that the Solana ecosystem will continue to experience rapid growth in the coming years, Solaxy is making waves as the first viable Solana layer-2 project. Its no surprise that its presale has already been able to raise close to $27 million in just a few short months. With dozens of crypto experts coming out in support of the project, interested investors would do well to learn more about Solaxy before its presale finishes.

Miller said the bill aims to “promote prosperity” for Minnesotans by allowing the Minnesota State Board of Investment to invest state assets in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies, just as it invests in traditional assets. Several other US states have introduced similar Bitcoin-buying bills, with 23 states having introduced legislation to create a Bitcoin reserve, according to Bitcoin Laws. A total of 39 different bills related to state investments in Bitcoin have been introduced across 23 US states. Source: Bitcoin Laws Under Miller’s bill, Minnesota state employees would be able to add Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their retirement accounts. It would also give residents the option to pay state taxes and fees with Bitcoin. Colorado and Utah already accept crypto for tax payments, while Louisiana allows it for state services. Investment gains from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would also be exempt from state income taxes. In the US, up to $10,000 paid to the state can be deducted from federal taxes under the state and local tax deduction, but any amount beyond that is subject to both state and federal tax obligations . Related: SEC could axe proposed Biden-era crypto custody rule, says acting chief The increasing number of US states proposing Bitcoin reserve bills follows Senator Cynthia Lummis’ July Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which directs the federal government to buy 200,000 Bitcoin annually over five years, totaling 1 million Bitcoin. However, on March 12, Lummis proposed a newly reintroduced BITCOIN Act , allowing the government to potentially hold more than 1 million Bitcoin as part of its newly established reserve. Bitcoin has shown significant gains compared to traditional assets in recent years. From August 2011 to January 2025, Bitcoin posted a compound annual growth rate of 102.36%, compared to the S&P 500’s 14.83%, according to Curvo data.

The bank’s coin is a so-called digital financial asset (DFA). Sberbank said its token price was “tied to the international price of cocoa” through “a cash-settled futures contract” on the Moscow Exchange. Sberbank Launches Blockchain-powered Commodities Token The Russian media outlet RBC reported that Sberbank says its coin allows customers access to the “international agricultural market.” Using a Sberbank ATM. (Source: Terpila Tepilov/YouTube/Screenshot) Russian banks have flocked to the DFA sector in recent years, with the crypto- and blockchain-keen Sberbank leading the way . Russian law defines DFAs as “tokenized versions of real assets,” which are uniformly issued using blockchain technology. While in the past, the term was ambiguous, legislators have been careful to explain that DFAs do not refer to “cryptocurrencies or other tokens that are traded on crypto exchanges .” The Russian Central Bank is the sole regulator of the DFAs market. The bank polices would-be issuers, and can issue them with operating permits.

Unlike tokenized real world assets ( RWA s), DFAs make use of private blockchain networks. The offices of the Moscow Exchange, in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Weekend Production/YouTube/Screenshot) Sberbank claimed that its coin could help protect Russian investor “against a possible weakening of the ruble.” It noted that it could perform this function by ensuring its token price “includes the currency revaluation of the underlying asset.” It suggested that companies that use cocoa as a raw material could use its DFA “to hedge the risks of rising prices” in the agricultural sector. “We have developed a cocoa DFA that combines the traditional appeal of commodity markets and innovative technologies.” Alexander Zozulya, Director of Global Markets, Sberbank DFAs: Growing in Popularity? The bank said that each token would be worth “one kilogram of cocoa.” It added that only companies and qualified investors would be able to buy the coin. The firm will initially offer its “cocoa index DFA” for “a period of up to four months,” but would allow traders to apply for “early redemption.” One of Russia's largest energy firms is already wooing buyers with the prospect of looser US restrictions https://t.co/i3bcFZmSOb — Bloomberg (@business) March 18, 2025 The DFAs market grew x4 in 2024, Sberbank has noted. The bank also claimed in February this year that the market is currently worth 684 billion rubles (over $8.3 billion). Russian banks say that 98% of DFAs are “debt tokens,” but add that “hybrid and index instruments” are also making their debuts.

Standard Chartered Lowers Expectations",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ethereum-to-4000-standard-chartered-lowers-expectations/,"Ethereum, like the broader crypto market, has experienced a sharp drop in price in recent weeks. From a high of $3,352 at the start of 2025, Ether now trades around $1,800 and $1,900, reflecting a sharp drop to the world’s second-biggest crypto by market cap. Looking at Ether’s bigger picture, it’s down 47% from last year’s value. Related Reading: XRP To Triple Digits? Analyst Confident In $100 Price Goal If we go by the latest analyses and observations from commentators, Ether’s price correction will likely be extended. The altcoin is facing a huge bearish wave, with plenty of market factors undermining its price performance. One significant factor is Standard Chartered’s recent decision to cut its price prediction by 60%, confirming market expectations. News: Standard Chartered slashes ETH price target! 🚨 The bank cuts its 2025 ETH forecast from $10K to $4K, blaming Layer-2 networks like Base, which they say has drained $50B from Ethereum’s market value.#Ethereum #ETH #Crypto #Layer2 #Base #Blockchain — Andres Meneses (@andreswifitv) March 17, 2025 Ethereum Faces A Descending Channel Ethereum is currently in a price slump, and many experts expect a much deeper dive in the next few weeks.

Also, the asset’s moving averages suggest a neutral trend and possible price consolidation. Ethereum (ETH) remains in the correction zone today, trading around $1,874.

The asset’s price is consolidating below its 5-day and 200-day moving averages, with traders looking for possible rejection or breakout. Since it fell below $2k, sentiments have been generally bearish, with many questioning its future price trends. Standard Chartered Cuts Price Estimates For Ethereum Even some of the biggest banks, like Standard Chartered Bank, are lowering their expectations of Ethereum. From a high of $10,000, the bank is reducing its price target to just $4,000, explaining that the Layer 2s are impacting its bottom line. The bank added that changes and improvements to the blockchain affected its overall value, like its shift to the proof-of-stake and scaling roadmap. Standard Chartered used Coinbase’s Base Layer 2 as an example, suggesting that the project has cost Ethereum $50 billion from its market cap. According to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered analyst, Ethereum’s losses will continue as Base’s dominance in the industry continues. Kendrick calls this the blockchain’s “midlife crisis”, adding that Ethereum’s chain has become a commodity with its Layer 2 framework. Related Reading: Solana Marks 5-Year Journey – 400 Billion Transactions And Counting Things Ethereum Can Do To Address Its Slide According to Kendrick, Ethereum can address its downturn in two ways. First, it can leverage its security-based dominance in the context of the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). If Ethereum focuses on security, it can maintain its 80% market share. Second, it can charge taxes for its Layer 2s, but it’s highly unlikely. Kendrick expects Ethereum to continue its underperformance in the short term.

Crypto influencer John Squire shared a tweet emphasizing Rao’s position on XRP, stating : “BOOOOOOM!! Former Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation at @Ripple, Dilip Rao, confirms: #XRP is NOT meant for retail! Every single $XRP will be like GOLD!” The discussion stems from an interview where Rao addressed the role of retail investors in the XRP market. He acknowledged that many individuals engage in speculative trading but clarified that this is not Ripple’s primary focus. BOOOOOOM!! Former Global Head of Infrastructure Innovation at @Ripple , Dilip Rao, confirms: #XRP is NOT meant for retail! Every single $XRP will be like GOLD! pic.twitter.com/qpkfezRLm3 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) March 16, 2025 Dilip Rao’s Perspective on XRP Use Case During the interview, Rao was asked whether the speculative nature of cryptocurrency trading hindered the broader adoption of digital assets. He explained that XRP is traded on approximately 150-200 exchanges worldwide. However, he described much of this trading as “shallow” and stated that it does not align with Ripple’s strategic goals. He further elaborated, “What we are pursuing is the use of XRP as a financial asset by sophisticated institutions as a bridging mechanism. So does this hurt or harm? Well, it creates a lot of noise and you know we certainly don’t want that much noise but we’re waiting, and for example this last quarter the bulk of XRP sales were to institutional investors. And as this transitions away from retail to institutions who start to use it for wholesale financial usage, that’s when the turning point will come.” Rao’s comments suggest that Ripple envisions XRP primarily as a tool for institutional transactions rather than for retail speculation. His assertion that a shift toward institutional adoption represents a key turning point implies that the company’s strategic focus lies in large-scale financial applications rather than serving individual traders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Pushback from the XRP Community Despite Squire’s interpretation of Rao’s comments, some members of the XRP community have challenged the claim that XRP is “not meant for retail.” A prominent response came from X user Moon Lambo, who argued that Rao’s words were being misrepresented. Moon Lambo countered Squire’s assertion. He stated , “He never said $XRP isn’t for retail. He cited that Ripple isn’t pursuing a retail use case, which is true. Their clients are businesses. Also, if retail could no longer access $XRP for any reason, that would dramatically and negatively impact price. So this idea of $XRP not being for retail is very negative.” He further referenced David Schwartz, one of the original architects of XRP, who has previously stated that XRP was designed to be a more efficient version of Bitcoin. According to Moon Lambo, this reinforces the idea that XRP is accessible to everyone, including retail investors, due to its decentralized and open-source nature. The Ongoing Debate The debate over XRP’s role in the financial ecosystem remains contentious. While Ripple has historically focused on institutional adoption , the token itself continues to be widely traded and held by retail investors. Whether XRP is “meant” for retail may ultimately be a matter of perspective, depending on whether the focus is placed on Ripple’s business strategy or the decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger. As the digital asset industry evolves, the distinction between institutional and retail usage may continue to blur. Regardless of Ripple’s position, XRP remains accessible to anyone who wishes to trade, hold, or use it. Whether its long-term value will be shaped more by institutional or retail adoption remains an open question.

As the SEC v. Ripple case continues, it presents both challenges and opportunities, particularly for the broader cryptocurrency market. The Ripple Effect on Altcoins Ripple has been at the center of attention due to its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. The SEC’s pursuit of Ripple has raised questions about the regulatory treatment of other cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins. While Ripple has borne the brunt of the SEC’s crackdown, its potential victory could set a precedent for other tokens. However, the excitement surrounding Ripple’s legal progress hasn’t fully extended to other altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. SEC’s Shifting Stance on Crypto John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and founder of CryptoLaw, explains how the SEC has dramatically shifted its approach in recent years. The agency has dropped major cases, including against Coinbase and Kraken, and concluded investigations into many crypto companies such as Gemini and Robinhood. This shift indicates a willingness to ease its stance on the crypto industry, suggesting a more lenient regulatory environment moving forward. However, Ripple’s case remains unresolved due to the complexity of prior judicial rulings. Hope for Resolution in the Ripple Case Despite the lingering uncertainty, there is optimism that the SEC and Ripple are nearing a resolution. As the industry awaits clarity, Deaton points out that a favorable outcome for Ripple could lead to a more level playing field for innovation in the crypto space. Although many are impatient about price action and wondering why altcoins haven’t surged like expected, the legal progress signals a bullish time for the industry as a whole. Looking Ahead for Crypto Innovation While altcoin prices may not have moved as anticipated, experts believe that the resolution of Ripple’s case could open the door for broader market growth. Deaton remains positive, saying that the current environment could be one of the most bullish in crypto’s history.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|XRP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 03:26:34

A massive 129 million PI tokens, worth $140.61 million, will hit the market. Despite Binance’s community voting in favor of a PI listing, the CEX hasn’t made an announcement. Pi Network (PI) has seen its price take a significant hit, dropping 19% in the last day to trade around $1.09, according to the latest data from CoinMarketCap. This slide has also pushed Pi Network down the cryptocurrency rankings, from the 11th spot to 15th, as of writing. A key indicator of the market’s reaction is the massive 70% surge in trading volume, signaling a rush to sell. While there was considerable initial excitement surrounding Pi Coin, recent times have been tougher. The lack of major updates and key announcements seems to be adding to the pressure, leading to a more negative sentiment among investors. PI Token Unlock and Market Sentiment The primary driver behind this latest price drop appears to be the upcoming release of Pi tokens.

Once liquidity was added by Four.Meme, the attacker executed transactions that allowed them to siphon funds from the platform.

CertiK Alert @CertiKAlert · Follow Replying to @CertiKAlert 1/ In this case of SBL token for example, the attacker sent a bit of SBL token to the pre-calcualted pair address in advance, then profited 21.1 BNB by sandwiching the add liquidity transaction at launch. 11:08 am · 18 Mar 2025 5 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply By manipulating token prices at the time of launch, the attacker was able to profit significantly.

Overall, the attacker netted 192 BNB, worth around $120,000, and sent the funds to the decentralized exchange FixedFloat. Four.Meme’s second security breach in two months This is the second time in as many months that Four.Meme has fallen victim to an exploit. On February 11, the platform suffered another attack that led to the loss of approximately $183,000 worth of digital assets. The latest breach underscores ongoing security concerns within the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector, where emerging platforms remain prime targets for attackers . Crypto exploits continue to surge Four.Meme’s latest attack is part of a wider trend of rising crypto-related exploits. February alone saw approximately $1.53 billion in losses due to scams, hacks, and exploits, with the $1.4 billion Bybit hack accounting for the majority of the damage. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has reported that illicit crypto transaction volumes reached $51 billion in the past year, attributing this surge to an increasingly professionalized landscape of cybercrime. AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and organized cyber syndicates have contributed to making the crypto sector more vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.

With hype building and analysts predicting a major market move, savvy investors are locking in positions early on the best meme coins to invest in now. One name that’s turning heads is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , currently in its 14th presale stage and offering an insane 3650% ROI potential. This isn’t just another meme token—it’s a high-utility best meme coin to invest in now with staking rewards, an engaging P2E game, and a community-driven movement that thrives on seizing market dips. Meanwhile, Dogwifhat (WIF), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Ponke (PONKE) continue to capture investor interest with their strong communities and evolving ecosystems. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin That Could Deliver a 3650% ROI What if you could lock in a $6,500 investment at $0.00016 per coin today and see it grow to over $24,000 when the price hits $0.0006 at listing? That’s the reality staring investors in the face as BTFD Coin’s presale nears its final stages. If its anticipated moon price of $0.006 becomes a reality, those same coins could be worth a jaw-dropping $240K. BTFD isn’t just about hype—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem built on Ethereum, combining P2E gaming, staking, and a vibrant community into one powerhouse of a project. With over 11,400 holders already backing it and $6.37 million raised, the presale momentum of this best meme coin to invest in is undeniable.

Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Meme Coin Riding the Community Wave One of the most recognizable meme coins in recent months, Dogwifhat (WIF) has become a cultural phenomenon among crypto traders. Initially starting as a joke, WIF has evolved into a highly liquid meme coin with strong market traction. Unlike many other projects, its strength comes from a hyper-engaged online community that keeps the momentum alive even during market corrections. WIF continues to thrive on social media buzz, and as we’ve seen with past meme coin successes, hype alone can push prices to unexpected highs.

While initially considered a Doge imitator, SHIB has since launched Shibarium (a Layer 2 solution), a metaverse project, and its DeFi integrations—all aimed at keeping it relevant beyond the hype. Despite its massive market cap, SHIB still commands major retail investor interest, making it one of the few meme coins with true staying power. Why does SHIB belong on this list of the best meme coins to invest in now?

As reported by Law360 , court documents reveal that on February 28, U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry J. Ricardo granted the request from federal prosecutors in New York to dismiss the complaint without prejudice, marking a big turn in the case. SEC and DOJ Drop Charges The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had previously accused Al-Naji of fraud, also took steps to remove its civil charges against him in late February. The SEC had alleged that Al-Naji orchestrated a “multi-million-dollar fraudulent crypto asset scheme,” using investor funds for personal expenses, including renting a mansion in Beverly Hills and giving extravagant gifts to family members. Al-Naji’s troubles began in March 2021 when he was arrested and charged with wire fraud and the sale of unregistered securities. The SEC accused him of misleading investors by presenting BitClout as a decentralized project with no company behind it. Al-Naji, who operated under the pseudonym “Diamond Hands,” was said to have raised approximately $257 million through the sale of BitClout’s native token, BTT. However, according to the SEC, he diverted over $7 million for personal use, including luxurious living expenses and family gifts. Legal Background: SEC’s Allegations The SEC’s complaint against Al-Naji stressed how he tried to create the illusion of a decentralized platform while securing a letter from a well-known law firm, claiming that BTT tokens were unlikely to be classified as securities under federal law. The agency argued that Al-Naji’s attempt to avoid federal regulations by creating a “fake decentralized” project was a clear effort to defraud investors. Ripple Effects for the Crypto Community The legal outcome could set a significant precedent for the cryptocurrency industry, particularly for projects claiming to be decentralized. Al-Naji’s case was closely watched by many in the crypto community, as it could have wider implications for how other crypto ventures approach regulatory compliance.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTT|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 03:53:14

This latest movement has drawn some attention amongst investors, mainly because the token is approaching a support level. Besides, other metrics support the notion that SHIB price is likely to remain under selling pressure in the next several days. Shiba Inu’s Price Decline Since February Shiba Inu’s price has shown a consistent decline since hitting a high of $0.00001894 in February 2025. As of mid-March, the token is trading around $0.00001251, marking a significant decrease in its value. For several weeks, the coin has failed to have a continuous upswing of prices, but rather has short-lived upward movements followed by declines. The recent bearish move on SHIB was amplified after the asset staged a very short-lived recovery attempt. Last week it reached an intraweek low of $0.00001082 before recovering to $0.0000138, a 26% bounce back. Nevertheless, this decisive rise was short-term and the price began to decline, now the coin is trying to hold on to key levels. However, with the exchange reserves hitting an all time low , Shiba Inu may be bracing for a recovery. Death Cross Pattern Points To Further Downside One of the technical indications that has raised concern about Shiba Inu price trend to the traders is the “Death Cross”. This pattern occurs when the 50-day moving average (MA) falls below the 200-day moving average (MA) suggesting a bearish trend. On the SHIB/USD chart, it has recently occurred and this means that the short term trend is bearish. SHIB/USD 1 day price chart (source: TradingView) The Death Cross is considered as a bearish signal, indicating that the price may continue to go lower in the short term. Additionally, the price is below both the 50 day and 200 day moving averages, which supports the notion that selling pressure may increase. The lower band of the Bollinger Bands, which is at $0.00001123, is also seen as a potential target for SHIB in the coming days, adding to the bearish outlook. Whale Activity and Market Sentiment According to new findings, Shiba Inu has been linked to the early holders or whales through price fluctuations patterns. As per the on-chain market analysis data by Glassnode, the whales held 20% of the overall supply of Shiba Inu before the beginning of the 2021 bull phase. It also means that these large holders have been instrumental in influencing the price of SHIB, especially where they buy or sell the token in large volumes The current SHIB price action is being watched to see if whales will bring about some changes to the market. If these early holders begin selling more of their SHIB holdings, it can further contribute to the downward trend. Source: X During this price decline, the $0.00001 price level is considered to be the critical support level. Nevertheless, over the past month, SHIB has only briefly dipped below this level and has immediately rebounded, which can be seen as a sign that there is demand at this price. Nonetheless, to turn the tides in its favor, SHIB must at least regain the $0.000013 threshold as it slowly navigates towards a scope of a bullish market. Failure to breach this resistance level will keep the Shiba Inu price range confined below, possibly retesting the lower support barriers.

Theo quy luật, các thị trường bò thường chứng kiến những đợt sụt giảm khoảng 30% trước khi quay đầu tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ trở lại. Tuy nhiên, khác với các chu kỳ trước, đợt tăng giá hiện tại từng được định hình bởi những đợt điều chỉnh nông hơn , nhờ sự tham gia mạnh mẽ của các tổ chức lớn và nhu cầu từ các quỹ ETF Bitcoin. Nhưng giờ đây, dòng vốn đang chảy ra khỏi các quỹ ETF Bitcoin giao ngay ở Mỹ, với tổng cộng $921.4 triệu bị rút ra chỉ trong tuần qua, cho thấy rằng các nhà đầu tư tổ chức chưa thực sự quay lại để cân bằng áp lực bán. Hình: Dòng vốn Bitcoin của các nhà nắm giữ ngắn hạn theo các nhóm khác nhau. (Nguồn: Glassnode) Các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn tiếp tục đối mặt với khoản lỗ chưa thực hiện , làm gia tăng áp lực bán. Đặc biệt, những người mua Bitcoin trong khoảng 7 đến 30 ngày gần đây dễ đầu hàng nhất. Theo lịch sử, khi dòng tiền mới chậm lại và xu hướng cơ sở chi phí thay đổi, đó là tín hiệu cho thấy nhu cầu đang suy yếu. Điều này càng rõ ràng hơn khi Bitcoin gặp khó khăn trong việc duy trì trên các mức hỗ trợ quan trọng. Nếu không có người mua mới xuất hiện, Bitcoin có thể bước vào giai đoạn tích lũy kéo dài hoặc thậm chí giảm sâu hơn khi những nhà đầu tư yếu tay tiếp tục thoát lệnh. Yếu tố chính cần theo dõi bây giờ là liệu các nhà đầu tư dài hạn hay dòng tiền tổ chức có quay lại ở mức giá thấp này hay không. Nếu những “túi tiền sâu” bắt đầu hấp thụ nguồn cung, điều này có thể kích hoạt giai đoạn tích lũy, giúp ổn định giá và đảo ngược tâm lý thị trường. Nền kinh tế Mỹ cũng đang ở ngã ba đường: thị trường lao động vẫn mạnh nhưng đang hạ nhiệt, lạm phát đang giảm tốc, nhưng niềm tin tiêu dùng thì tụt dốc. Tháng 2 vừa qua, lạm phát vẫn ổn định nhờ giá vé máy bay và xăng dầu giảm bù đắp cho chi phí nhà ở tăng cao. Tuy nhiên, sự gián đoạn chuỗi cung ứng và áp lực thuế quan có thể đẩy giá lên cao trong những tháng tới. Số lượng việc làm mới tăng trong tháng 1, trong khi số lượt sa thải chạm mức thấp nhất trong bảy tháng, cho thấy sự ổn định. Mặc dù vậy, tỷ lệ thất nghiệp ẩn đang tăng, và bất ổn thương mại, đặc biệt là các loại thuế quan mới đối với các mặt hàng nhập khẩu chính, đang đè nặng lên tâm lý doanh nghiệp. Niềm tin người tiêu dùng đã giảm xuống mức thấp nhất trong hơn hai năm, với kỳ vọng lạm phát tăng vọt và sự bất ổn kinh tế làm lu mờ triển vọng của cả hộ gia đình lẫn doanh nghiệp. Cách mà Fed phản ứng với các chính sách thương mại và rủi ro lạm phát sẽ quyết định liệu nền kinh tế có ổn định được hay sẽ tiếp tục suy yếu.

Điều này có thể thúc đẩy dòng vốn chảy vào các quỹ ETF ETH, đặc biệt nếu lợi suất staking (khoảng 3-4% mỗi năm) được tích hợp sẵn. Tuy nhiên, sự giám sát của SEC vẫn là một trở ngại lớn. Ở Thái Lan, Ủy ban Chứng khoán đã chấp thuận cho phép giao dịch USDT và USDC trên các sàn được cấp phép, tạo ra một tiền lệ pháp lý có thể ảnh hưởng đến chính sách stablecoin toàn cầu. Tại Mỹ, Thượng nghị sĩ Cynthia Lummis đã tái giới thiệu dự luật BITCOIN nhằm thiết lập Dự trữ Bitcoin Chiến lược, nhằm tăng cường an ninh tài chính – mặc dù vấp phải sự phản đối từ các tổ chức ngân hàng và Fed. Trong khi đó, Strategy tuyên bố huy động $21 tỷ thông qua đợt phát hành cổ phiếu để mở rộng danh mục Bitcoin của mình, củng cố sự quan tâm từ các tổ chức nhưng cũng thu hút sự chú ý từ cơ quan quản lý. Những diễn biến này cho thấy crypto đang dần hòa nhập vào tài chính truyền thống, mang theo những tác động lâu dài đến thị trường. Thị trường đang chờ đợi một cú hích mới.

The feature, which was announced on Mar. 18, lowers counterparty risks while preserving decentralization by combining identity verification with liquidity pools. Decentralized finance has made it possible for users to trade assets without the need for middlemen, but because fund providers are anonymous, liquidity pools have often been risky. To solve this, Verified Pools requires users to link their Coinbase Wallet, Prime Onchain Wallet, or third-party wallets using a Coinbase Verifications credential. This gives on-chain transactions an extra layer of trust by ensuring that liquidity providers are verified. Based on the Uniswap ( UNI ) v4 protocol , Verified Pools uses “hooks” to enable advanced smart contract functionality, allowing trading features that can be customized. Additionally, the platform has teamed up with Gauntlet to optimize the health of the liquidity pool. Transactions occur on Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 network, which helps reduce costs and improve speed. Currently, Verified Pools is available in the U.S., Singapore, the Netherlands, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and the Channel Islands. You might also like: Ark Invest buys $14m in Coinbase stock despite crypto dip For institutions, Verified Pools offers concentrated liquidity and controlled access, ensuring only verified users can supply or trade assets. For a safer trading environment, institutions can communicate through APIs or Prime Onchain Wallet. Retail traders can also use Verified Pools for direct, intermediary-free trading with verified liquidity. Users can transact while maintaining complete control over their assets by linking a wallet. The launch comes at a time of renewed interest in Coinbase. A Bernstein Research analysis, as reported by Yahoo Finance on Mar. 18, predicted that Coinbase stock could rise more than 60% and hit $310, citing favorable U.S. regulatory changes. The report called Coinbase the “Amazon of crypto” and emphasized its strong position as a leader in the crypto infrastructure. Trump’s recent pro-crypto initiatives, such as his executive order to establish a Bitcoin reserve , have also raised hopes for the industry’s future. As Coinbase grows its on-chain ecosystem, it appears ready to take advantage of these developments.

Recent development underscores this trend: DeepSeek has open-sourced its models and implemented model distillation, a process where larger “teacher” models transfer inference logic to smaller “student” models, optimizing knowledge compression and performance. Similarly, OpenAI’s ChatGPT o3 release further emphasizes post-training and reinforcement learning, further highlighting the industry’s focus on refining existing AI capabilities. Bittensor provides an open, decentralized platform for AI model collaboration and sharing. In July 2024, Bittensor and Cerebras released the BTLM-3b-8k open-source LLM, which has garnered over 16,000 downloads on Hugging Face, demonstrating Bittensor’s technical capabilities. Despite launching in 2021, Bittensor remained largely absent from the 2024 AI Agent boom, with its token price stagnant. However, on February 13, 2025, Bittensor introduced the Dynamic TAO (dTAO) upgrade, aimed at optimizing token issuance, improving fairness, and increasing liquidity. This mirrors the impact of Virtuals Protocol’s AI Agent LaunchPad, which led to $VIRTUAL’s market cap surging 50x in 2024. The report “dTAO and the Evolution of Bittensor: Reshaping Decentralized AI with Market-Driven Incentives” details the transformative impact of the February 13 dTAO upgrade on the Bittensor ecosystem, focusing on its architectural innovations, economic models, and ecosystem dynamics . The Bittensor system has witnessed a 100% increase in accounts, growing from 100,000 at the start of 2024 to nearly 200,000. Bittensor Network Architecture The Bittensor system comprise of three core components: the Subtensor Polkadot parachain with an EVM-compatible layer (TAO EVM), 64 Subnets, and a Root Subnet. Subtensor Chain and TAO EVM Subtensor is a Layer 1 blockchain built using Polkadot’s Substrate SDK that records key subnets activities such as validator scoring weights and staked token amounts. Every 360 blocks (72 minutes), the Yuma Consensus algorithm calculates the emissions distribution for the 64 subnets. The Subtensor EVM-compatible layer (TAO EVM), launched on December 30, 2024, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to be deployed and interacted with the Subtensor blockchain without modification. All EVM operations are executed solely on the Subtensor blockchain and do not interact with the Ethereum network, meaning that smart contracts on Bittensor are limited to the Bittensor network and are independent of the Ethereum mainnet. Currently in its early stages, TAO EVM is being actively developed, with projects like TaoFi building AI-powered DeFi infrastructure, including a TAO-backed stablecoin, a decentralized exchange, and a liquid staking version of the TAO token. Account System Coldkey-Hotkey Dual-Key System The dTAO account system adopts a Coldkey-Hotkey dual-key system for enhanced security and flexibility. A hotkey can be linked to one coldkey within the same subnet, or to coldkeys from different subnets (though this is not recommended). A coldkey can be linked to multiple hotkeys. Subnet UID System Subnet UID Generation After a minimum 100 TAO registration fee, a Subnet UID is generated and bound to the hotkey. To become a miner, a user simply needs a hotkey, coldkey, and Subnet UID. Requirements to Become a Validator To become a subnet validator, a user must stake at least 1000 TAO and rank within the top 64 in stake amount. Notably, validators can hold multiple UID slots across multiple subnets without additional staking (similar to a restaking mechanism). To maintain competitiveness within a subnet, validators strive to build a strong reputation and performance record to attract more TAO delegations, ensuring they rank within the top 64. Subnet Structure & Capacity Limits Subnet 1: 1024 UID slots, up to 128 validators, 1024 total participants. Other 64 subnets: 256 UID slots, up to 64 validators, 256 total participants. Subnet Competition & Incentive Mechanism Within each subnet, validators assign tasks to miners (subnet miners). Upon task completion, miners submit results to validators. Validators evaluate and rank submissions, distributing TAO rewards based on performance. Validators also earn rewards for accurately assessing high-quality miners, driving subnet performance. This competitive evaluation and incentive distribution is automated by the subnet creator’s incentive code. Subnets Construct a Multi-Layered Ecosystem The Bittensor subnet ecosystem is designed as a multi-layered system where miners, validators, subnet creators, and consumers each play a distinct role in driving high-quality AI services. Miners: Host AI models, provide services, and compete for TAO rewards based on performance. Validators: Evaluate miners, prevent collusion, and ensure high-quality AI services. Subnet Creators : Design specialized subnets for specific AI domains, defining consensus and incentive structures. Consumers : Access AI services(querying APIs, obtaining training datasets, or utilizing computing resources for AI model training) by paying token. Miners Layer Miners are the core computational nodes, hosting AI models and providing inference/training services. They compete for incentives based on P2P rankings, ensuring high-quality contributions. Validators Layer Validators ensure fair evaluation of miners’ AI models and prevent collusion and malicious behavior . They act as “judges” in the network, ensuring high-quality AI services. Consumers Layer Consumers, including end-users and businesses, utilize TAO tokens to access a range of AI services: Developers querying AI APIs. Research institutions accessing AI training datasets. Businesses leveraging Bittensor’s computing resources for AI model training. Consumers benefit from direct access to AI services provided by miners, eliminating the need to own AI models and reducing overall AI computing costs. Stake-Based Consensus Bittensor’s stake-based consensus mechanism is primarily designed to address the following issues: Preventing Malicious Score Manipulation and Ensuring Fair Scoring: The iterative correction w==fw adjusts any weights that deviate too much from the consensus (i.e., the stake-weighted average w), mitigating attempts to skew scores. This “self-calibrating balance” ensures fair scoring by correcting overestimations by malicious actors. Rewarding High-Quality AI Contributors: Validators consistently contributing high-quality outputs maintain a high rank even after weight corrections, as their reported weights align with the consensus value. Consider a market for premium agricultural products. Farmers who consistently produce high-quality crops receive better prices. Here, high-quality nodes earn more tokens, thereby motivating continual improvements. This process is like statistical smoothing of a large dataset. After many rounds of “smoothing,” the true position (or rank) of each participant is revealed. Importantly, the density evolution compresses the anomalous (excessive) weight from the adversarial side more than it does for the honest side. Bittensor’s stake-based consensus mechanism leverages rigorous mathematical models and game theory tools. By establishing update formulas, weighted average consensus, iterative corrections, and density evolution, the system can automatically calibrate excessive weight deviations and ensure fair final reward distribution. This process is akin to a smart balance or a reputation system that continuously self-calibrates to ensure fair scoring, incentivize outstanding contributions, and prevent malicious collusion and vote manipulation. Building on this foundation, the dTAO upgrade further refines this system with enhanced smoothing controls and improved weight trust strategies, bolstering robustness and fairness in adversarial environments while reducing computational resource consumption. Yuma Consensus: Dynamically Programmable Incentives and Consensus Bitcoin has built the world’s largest peer-to-peer network of hash power, where anyone can freely compete by contributing local computational power to secure a global ledger. Its incentive rules were fixed at design time, driving the ecosystem to evolve in a relatively static manner. Unlike Bitcoin’s static incentive model, Yuma Consensus (YC) offers a dynamic, programmable framework. YC integrates the objective function, staking rewards, and weight adjustment mechanism directly into the consensus process, enabling dynamic adaptation based on node contributions and behavior. Weight Vector of Subnet Validators Each subnet validator maintains a weight vector, with each element representing the scoring weight that the validator assigns to all subnet miners. This weight is based on the validator’s historical performance and is used to rank miners. For example, if a validator’s scoring vector is w=wn the resulting ranking reflects each miner’s contribution level as perceived by that validator. Impact of Staking Amount YC calculates reward distribution using both the weight vector and the staking amount, creating a “stake → weight → reward” feedback loop. Reward Calculation and Distribution Validators submit ranking results to the YC algorithm, which processes the data approximately every 12 seconds. Rewards (in TAO) are then distributed to miners and validators. This comprehensive mechanism enables YC to continuously and fairly distribute rewards across a decentralized network, dynamically adapting to contributions quality and maintaining overall network security and efficiency. Knowledge Distillation & Mixture of Experts (MoE): Collaborative Learning and Efficient Contribution Evaluation Knowledge Distillation (Digital Hivemind) Bittensor introduces the concept of knowledge distillation, which is akin to the collaborative work of neurons in the human brain, where nodes share knowledge and learn collectively by exchanging data samples and model parameters. In this process, nodes continuously exchange data and model parameters, forming a self-optimizing network that improves prediction accuracy over time. Each node contributes its knowledge to a shared pool, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of the network, making it faster and more suitable for real-time learning applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Crucially, this approach effectively mitigates the risk of catastrophic forgetting—a common challenge in machine learning. Nodes can retain and expand their existing knowledge while incorporating new insights, thereby enhancing the network’s robustness and adaptability. By distributing knowledge across multiple nodes, the Bittensor TAO network becomes more resilient to interference and potential data breaches. This robustness is especially important for applications that handle highly secure and privacy-sensitive data, such as financial and medical information Mixture of Experts (MoE) Bittensor employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to optimize AI predictions , significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of solving complex problems through collaborative specialization among multiple AI models . For example, when generating Python code with Spanish annotations , a multilingual model and a code-specialized model can work together, producing results of far higher quality than a single model alone. The Bittensor protocol features a parameterized function system, commonly referred to as neurons, which are distributed peer-to-peer. Each neuron maintains zero or more network weights and evaluates neighboring nodes by training neural networks through mutual ranking mechanisms. These ranking scores are then accumulated on the digital ledger, ensuring transparent and fair contributions. Nodes with higher rankings receive monetary rewards and increased network weight, directly linking contributions to incentives, thereby promoting fairness and transparency. This mechanism effectively establishes a market, allowing intelligent systems to price information in a peer-to-peer manner over the internet while incentivizing nodes to continuously improve their knowledge and expertise. To ensure equitable reward distribution, Bittensor integrates Shapley Value principles from cooperative game theory, providing a method for distributing rewards based on each node’s contribution. Under the Yuma Consensus (YC) framework, validators score and rank expert models, and rewards are distributed according to Shapley Value principles. This approach enhances network security, efficiency, and continuous improvement, reinforcing Bittensor’s decentralized AI ecosystem. Dynamic TAO Why Introduce dTAO? Key Issues with the Current Subnet Model: Resource Overlap and Redundancy: Multiple subnets engage in similar tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, text prompting, price prediction), leading to inefficient resource allocation. “Bad Money Drives Out Good”: High-quality subnets struggle to secure funding and development space. The short seven-day protection period risks premature elimination due to insufficient root validator support. Validator Centralization and Insufficient Incentives for New Subnets: Root validators may not represent diverse TAO holder opinions, and their assessments can be skewed. Validators lack incentives to migrate to new subnets, as it could result in immediate reward losses. Key Issues with the Economic Model One major issue with Bittensor’s mechanism design is that although all participants receive TAO, no one is actually paying TAO, which creates continuous selling pressure. Currently, the questions that miners answer are not posed by real users; instead, they are provided by the subnet owners—either simulating real user queries or based on historical user demands. As a result, even if the miners’ responses have value, that value is captured by the subnet owners. Whether the miners’ answers help subnet owners improve their model algorithms or are directly used by the subnet owners for model training to enhance their products, the value generated by the work of miners and validators is appropriated by the subnet owners. In theory, subnet owners should be paying for this value. Furthermore, subnet owners not only avoid any costs but also enjoy 18% of subnet emissions. This means that the Bittensor ecosystem is not tightly bound—participants maintain loose ties based on development and collaboration. Projects on a subnet can exit at any time without incurring any loss (since the subnet registration fee is refunded). Currently, the primary mechanism for token reclamation in the Bittensor system is through the registration fees paid by subnet miners and validators; however, these fees are minimal and insufficient to support effective value capture. Although staking has become the main mechanism, the amount of TAO recovered through blockchain transaction fees and registration fees remains limited. Staking is divided into two forms: Validator Staking: Participants stake TAO to support network security and earn rewards, accounting for 75% of all issued TAO. Validators currently receive approximately 3,000 TAO per day, with an annualized return rate of over 15%. However, after the first halving, this allocation will drop to 1,500 TAO per day, reducing the attractiveness of staking and weakening its effect on balancing token supply and demand. Subnet Registration Staking: The addition of new subnets significantly affects the TAO supply. This poses a challenge because the total issuance of TAO is fixed; an increase in the number of subnets will dilute the rewards across all subnets, making it difficult for existing subnets to sustain operations and potentially leading to the exit of some subnets from the network. Core Mechanism of Dynamic TAO Binding Validators and Teams to the Ecosystem: Investment-Driven Profit dTAO implements a market-driven approach where each subnet has a liquidity pool of TAO and subnet tokens. When TAO holders (validators and subnet owners) stake, they exchange TAO for dTAO, with the amount determined by: During the exchange, the pricing mechanism between TAO and dTAO follows the constant product formula of Uniswap V2: τ*α=K where τ represents the amount of TAO and α represents the amount of dTAO. In the absence of additional liquidity injection, regardless of how much TAO is exchanged for dTAO or dTAO is exchanged for TAO, K remains constant. Conversely, when dTAO holders unstake, it is equivalent to exchanging dTAO for TAO, and the amount of TAO obtained follows the formula: Unlike Uniswap V2, dTAO liquidity pools do not allow direct liquidity additions. New liquidity comes from newly allocated TAO (50% of new minted dTAO is injected into the liquidity pool) and 50% of total dTAO issuance. This mechanism prevents initial token dumping and encourages continuous contributions. Validators act as venture capitalists, evaluating subnet technology, market potential, and performance. Stake/Unstake operations do not change the value of K, while liquidity injection increases K to K’. Subnet token with a higher price relative to TAO receives larger share of new TAO emissions In the previous system, the proportion of newly issued TAO allocated to each subnet was determined by Root Network Validators. However, this approach introduced several potential issues. For instance, Root Network control was concentrated among a few validators, meaning that even if validators colluded to allocate newly issued TAO to low-value subnets, they would face no penalties. Dynamic TAO eliminates the privileges of the Root Network and transfers decision-making power over TAO emissions to all TAO holders. Example Analysis After the Dynamic TAO network upgrade, every subnet has now minted its corresponding dTAO tokens. The genesis supply of dTAO for each subnet is equal to the amount of TAO locked by the Subnet Owner when creating the subnet. 50% of dTAO enters the liquidity pool; 50% is allocated to the owner..Example: Subnet #1 owner locks 1,000 TAO, resulting in 1,000 dTAO. Initial liquidity: 500 dTAO and 1,000 TAO. The remaining 500 dTAO is allocated to the Subnet Owner. If a Validator joins Subnet #1 and stakes 1,000 TAO, they will receive 250 dTAO. At this point, the liquidity pool holds 2,000 TAO and 250 dTAO. If Subnet #1 earns 720 TAO per day from block rewards, 360 TAO will be automatically injected into the liquidity pool. The number of newly minted dTAO per day is determined by the subnet’s own emission schedule. Impact of dTAO The introduction of dTAO fundamentally reshapes the TAO distribution and staking mechanism. Staking TAO becomes akin to “buying into” subnet tokens, not just risk-free staking.This creates greater opportunities for high-quality subnets to emerge, as early validator support for strong subnets can lead to potentially high returns, even multiples of their initial capital. Encourages more rigorous decision-making from stakers, who now must conduct due diligence to select the most promising subnets. Short-term staking and unstaking have a greater impact on dTAO prices than the actual TAO earnings of a subnet, leading to higher variability in staking returns. Eliminates validator control over block rewards, significantly increasing the cost for potential attackers attempting to manipulate the network via large staking amounts. How Will the Bittensor Ecosystem Evolve After the dTAO Upgrade? To analyze the impact of the dTAO upgrade, we will focus on two key questions: How does subnet demand translate into demand for subnet tokens? Can the introduction of subnet tokens create a “TAO Summer,” accelerating innovation within the TAO ecosystem? How Does Subnet Demand Translate into Demand for Subnet Tokens? To participate in a subnet and earn rewards, users are required to initially acquire dTAO subnet tokens and subsequently stake them with a validator. This process inherently elevates the price of dTAO within the respective subnet. As the price of dTAO rises, the overall value of dTAO in the liquidity pool increases, and the system automatically allocates more TAO rewards to that subnet, allowing miners and stakers to earn higher returns. This mechanism establishes a positive feedback loop: User acquisition of dTAO drives up its price. Elevated dTAO prices result in increased TAO emissions for the subnet. Increased rewards attract a larger user base. The expanded user base further fuels dTAO price appreciation. Conversely, significant dTAO sell-offs trigger a price decline, leading to reduced TAO emissions for the subnet, which subsequently diminishes user participation. Overall, the price volatility observed in subnet tokens is primarily influenced by market supply and demand, the size of the liquidity pool, and the system’s automated incentive mechanisms. dTAO vs. AI Agent Launchpads The dTAO mechanism exhibits parallels with the AI agent launchpad model, both of which necessitate the initial purchase of platform tokens to engage with project-specific tokens. In AI agent launchpads, once a single AI agent token experiences rapid price growth and generates wealth effects, a wave of users enters the ecosystem, creating additional buy pressure on the platform token. However, notable distinctions exist between dTAO and AI agent launchpad models: Market Entry and Liquidity: AI agent launchpad models typically confine the use of platform tokens for AI agent token purchases to the project’s initial, low market capitalization phase. Upon reaching a designated valuation, AI agent tokens are introduced to external markets, establishing liquidity pools that enable users to exchange them for Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets. This allows for profit realization and direct purchase of AI agent tokens with ETH or SOL. Conversely, within the dTAO ecosystem, as dTAO prices ascend and users seek to secure profits or transition to another promising subnet, the sole exchange option is dTAO for TAO. This limitation can induce substantial price volatility within the liquidity pool. Trading and Compatibility: While dTAO token liquidity pools are hosted on the TAO EVM, facilitating trading on EVM-compatible DEXs like taodotbot, HotKeySwap, and Backprop Finance, direct trading with ETH is not supported. Furthermore, mainstream wallets and DEXs currently lack compatibility with dTAO tokens. Backprop Finance Another key aspect is the unique emissions mechanism of the dTAO ecosystem. As shown in the chart below, after the dTAO upgrade, emissions have become much more concentrated at the top. The top five subnet projects now receive up to 40% of total emissions. With 7,200 TAO distributed daily, this means the top five subnet projects alone receive approximately $1 million worth of TAO per day, based on TAO’s price on February 18, 2025. If the dTAO ecosystem evolves similarly to the Virtual ecosystem, where certain projects gain significant traction, then high-market-cap subnets will capture the vast majority of new emissions. For new projects to compete, they must demonstrate strong potential to attract stakers, miners, and validators. This could require participants to migrate from other subnets by converting their TAO into dTAO for the new subnet, which may involve selling subnet tokens from existing liquidity pools to increase the market cap of the new subnet. Can the Introduction of Subnet Tokens Accelerate Innovation in the TAO Ecosystem? Currently, most Bittensor subnet tokens have relatively low market capitalizations, with none exceeding $10 million in valuation. Chutes Chutes, launched in December 2024, has rapidly ascended to become the highest market capitalization subnet.It provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a developer toolkit to help developers build and deploy decentralized applications. These applications run as Docker images, similar to individual FastAPI applications, referred to as “chutes”, while the individual function modules within them are called “cords”. The platform requires users to register with a Bittensor hotkey, ensuring identity verification and security. Developers can leverage Chutes to efficiently build CUDA and Python-based environments, integrating AI models with distributed computing power via built-in middleware and API tools. The Chutes team is deeply involved in the Bittensor ecosystem and is also the creator of Subnet 19 and Subnet 56. Although Chutes was only added in December 2024, the rapid surge in Chutes’ token price demonstrates the effectiveness of the ecosystem’s positive feedback loop:users buying, pushing up prices → higher prices leading to more TAO rewards → increased incentives attracting more users → further price increases—effectively drives user participation in subnet tokens. Multi Modality Subnet 4 (Multi Modality), developed by Manifold, ranks second in market capitalization,. It focuses on multimodal AI systems, capable of processing and generating text, images, audio, and other data formats. The core mechanism of this subnet is designed for decentralized detection of AI-generated content, ensuring that the network can accurately distinguish between real media and synthetic content produced by AI models. As generative AI technologies advance rapidly, detection algorithms must continuously evolve to keep up with increasingly sophisticated synthetic media, creating a high barrier to entry and strong competitive differentiation. Miners in Subnet 4 operate binary classifiers to detect AI-generated content. They output a prediction score between 0 and 1, where values above 0.5 indicate AI-generated content. Validators in Subnet 4 challenge miners by providing a balanced test set composed of both real and synthetic media to assess miners’ detection capabilities. Although Multi Modality ranks among the top subnet tokens, its initial price surged to a $10M market cap—double its current valuation. This means that early participants did not experience strong wealth effects, as the token has since declined from its peak. Kaito Kaito, a well-known project, launched a Bittensor subnet that has underperformed. Kaito is a centralized AI search engine tailored for the crypto industry, allowing users to search the entire crypto space across platforms like Twitter, Discord, governance forums, Mirror, and Medium using a one-click solution. Beyond aggregating information, Kaito leverages AI-powered ranking, topic mining, personalization, recommendation, speech-to-text transcription, and AI-generated content to enhance its search engine. Why Did Kaito Build a Subnet on Bittensor? Kaito’s decision to establish the OpenKaito subnet on the Bittensor network was driven by the intricate demands of developing a cutting-edge search engine. The creation of such a platform involves substantial complexities, including comprehensive data acquisition, sophisticated indexing, advanced ranking algorithms, and robust knowledge graph development. To address these challenges efficiently and without the overhead of a large internal research and development team, Kaito strategically launched the OpenKaito subnet on Bittensor. Within OpenKaito, search relevance is framed as a miner-validator problem. Miners submit ranked search results, while validators apply a reward model to evaluate the quality of these responses. OpenKaito claims that its miners have outperformed OpenAI’s embedding models in external benchmark tests, achieving lower loss rates and higher Top-1 accuracy based on large-scale synthetic datasets. Why Did Kaito’s Subnet Token Fail? Despite its strong technical foundation, Kaito’s subnet token experienced underperformance due to a critical lack of integration with its core product’s utility. As a result, the subnet’s economic loop remained confined within Bittensor, failing to establish a direct and meaningful connection to Kaito’s broader business performance. In other words, Kaito is not a Bittensor-native project—its subnet merely serves as an “outsourcing technology platform.” . Masa’s TAOCAT Surpasses All Subnet Tokens in Market Capitalization TAOCAT is an AI agent developed by Masa within the Virtual protocol ecosystem. It serves as a dedicated advocate for TAO, actively participating in discussions on X to promote TAO and enhance its influence. TAOCAT leverages: Subnet 42’s real-time data infrastructure Subnet 19’s advanced large language model (LLM) Subnet 59’s Agent Arena, where it competes against other AI agents for TAO token allocation, introducing an innovative tokenized AI value capture model. Additionally, any user interaction on X contributes to TAOCAT’s training data, continuously improving its learning and evolution. While not a single subnet token, TAOCAT’s unique cross-subnet and cross-platform integration, combined with its robust social media presence, has driven its market capitalization to exceed that of numerous dtao tokens. TAOCAT’s success provides valuable insights for the development of subnet tokens: cross-subnet collaboration and social media engagement can significantly enhance a project’s network effects and market visibility , ultimately driving market capitalization growth . Has dTAO Solved the Issues in Bittensor’s Subnet Model? Mechanism Issues Persist The dTAO upgrade ties TAO emissions to the market performance of subnet tokens, shifting resource allocation decisions from a small group of root validators to a market-driven approach. This aims to incentivize greater user participation and engagement. While this mechanism partially alleviates inefficiencies caused by resource overlap—ensuring that only high-performing subnets with strong token prices receive more TAO rewards—it does not fundamentally resolve several key issues: Resource Overlap and Redundancy : If multiple subnets focus on similar tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, text prompting, or price prediction), even with market-driven adjustments, resource duplication and inefficiencies remain unresolved. Validator Centralization and Lack of Incentives for New Subnets : The dTAO upgrade does not change the dominance of top validators under Yuma Consensus.Validator assessments may be biased, and there is little incentive for them to migrate to new subnets. As of data from February 18, 2025, the top 10 validators collectively hold a notably low percentage of dTAO tokens, with individual holdings not exceeding 10%, raising concerns about equitable representation and influence. Core Flaws in the Economic Model Fundamental Economic Flaw : While all participants can earn TAO, there are no external users paying for the actual contributions of miners and validators. This results in persistent sell pressure on TAO as rewards are continuously distributed without a sustainable demand mechanism. Risk of Fake Models and Inadequate Evaluation Standards in Some Subnets : Current subnet applications include price prediction (e.g., Synth subnet), AI search engines (e.g., Kaito AI’s outsourced development), and model inference services (e.g., Inference Labs’ Omron subnet),indicate a trend toward Bittensor functioning as an “outsourcing layer” within the AI technology stack. However, while this incentive-driven model can attract developers in the short term, its long-term success depends on real-world demand and quality assurance. Evidence of Fake Model Usage : When testing Cortex.t, it was discovered that its responses were directly sourced from OpenAI’s API, rather than being generated by Bittensor miners.This suggests that some subnets may merely be “wrapper applications” rather than truly utilizing Bittensor’s decentralized AI infrastructure. Enhancing Practical Utility & Transparency : To improve technical reliability and transparency, on-chain verifiability should be enforced. Miners should be required to submit intermediate data or hash proofs for model training and inference, ensuring that outputs are genuinely generated within the Bittensor network rather than external APIs. A performance benchmarking system should be established, with standardized test datasets for different subnet types (e.g., prediction models, generative AI models). Regularly publishing rankings based on these benchmarks would foster healthy competition and drive improvements in model quality. Challenges and Limitations of dTAO: Lack of Adoption, Utility, and Staking ratio Decline The ecosystem value of dTAO tokens remains largely confined within the Bittensor network. Although EVM compatibility has been introduced, dTAO has not achieved the social media-driven exposure seen in AI Agent tokens from AI Launchpads like Virtual. Furthermore, the integration of dTAO into project tokenomics is limited, resulting in a scarcity of real utility and demand-driven consumption scenarios. Purchasing subnet tokens currently resembles a one-time investment—once users cash out, it can trigger significant price drops. This issue is particularly pronounced in outsourced AI infrastructure subnets. However, dTAO’s token model presents certain advantages when compared to the AI Agent Launchpad model: 50% of newly issued dTAO must be injected into the liquidity pool, while the remaining 50% is allocated at the discretion of subnet participants (Validators, Miners, and Owners). This ensures that only subnets continuously improving their products and attracting users receive more rewards, preventing an influx of low-quality AI Agents and accelerating TAO-driven innovation. That said, dTAO’s inability to reach a broader audience and its lack of large-scale use cases stem from ecosystem limitations and a scarcity of real consumption scenarios. Due to the absence of high-quality, rapidly growing projects, some conservative stakers have opted not to stake TAO post-dTAO upgrade. As of recent data, TAO’s staking ratio has declined from a peak of 90% to just 71%. Focusing on Subnet Projects with Strong Ties to the Bittensor Ecosystem and Real Utility for Subnet Tokens To evaluate promising subnet projects within the Bittensor ecosystem, the following criteria should be considered: Clear and Practical Use Cases: The project should address real-world problems and demonstrate evidence of user feedback. Additionally, its technical architecture must be robust and innovative, supporting distributed AI model training and inference, while projects should leverage on-chain data and transparent evaluation mechanisms to demonstrate its contributions. Well-Designed Incentive Mechanism: The incentive structure should fairly reward miners, validators, and subnet owners while avoiding sell pressure caused by a lack of sustained utility and application-driven token consumption. Strong Team, Ecosystem Integration, and Community Support : Priority should be given to Bittensor-native subnets, rather than merely outsourced AI infrastructure subnets. For outsourced technical projects, it’s crucial to examine whether the subnet token is integrated into the project’s core tokenomics. Real-World Utility for Subnet Tokens: Currently, few projects have incorporated newly issued subnet tokens into their project mechanics, as the dTAO upgrade is still in its early stages. Tokens must serve actual functions, such as payments, service access, participation incentives, or governance, to establish real demand, sustain long-term value, and ensure ecosystem health. Otherwise, tokens will remain purely speculative assets, leading to price volatility and a lack of stable incentives, ultimately failing to attract long-term users and developers. Since early 2024, the number of Bittensor subnets has doubled from 33 to 66, and with further expansion expected, several promising new subnets are likely to emerge. Economic Model Bittensor follows a fair launch model, meaning there was no pre-mine, ICO, or private sales. Every circulating The network currently mints 7,200 TAO per day (1 TAO per block, with blocks produced approximately every 12 seconds) under a programmatic issuance schedule: once half of the total supply has been distributed, the issuance rate is halved, repeating every four years until all 21 million TAO are in circulation. Although the TAO issuance curve resembles Bitcoin’s, the introduction of a burn-and-recycle mechanism makes it dynamically adjustable rather than completely fixed. According to TAOstats token recycling data, the first halving, initially planned for 2025, is now projected to occur in December 2025, based on Bittensor’s network activity since its January 3, 2021 launch. As of February 2025 , approximately 39.9% of the total supply ( 8.33 million TAO ) has been minted.

Speaking at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit 2025 about the administration’s approach, he said the initiative aligns with President Trump’s campaign promises while recognizing Bitcoin’s unique economic role. The government is working with the Treasury Department and the Secretary of Commerce to explore Bitcoin accumulation. Their goal is to do this without using public funds, he added. JUST IN – President Trump's Executive Director on digital assets: ""We talked about ways of acquiring more Bitcoin in budget neutral ways."" We want ""as much as we can get."" pic.twitter.com/zK8PyQK1Rw — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 18, 2025 “We delivered on the President’s promises that he made on the campaign trail,” he said. “The President was adamant about creating the [Strategic Bitcoin Reserve]. We wanted to make sure that we did it right in a way that respected Bitcoin for being so unique, and also gave credence to innovation and other spaces in the digital asset world,” Hines said during a panel discussion. Bitcoin’s Legitimacy Grows in US Economic Policy The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a major shift in the US government’s approach to digital assets. Central banks and national reserves have traditionally held gold and foreign currencies. Now, Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value has led the administration to see it as “digital gold.” This shift shows Bitcoin’s increasing importance in economic strategy. “We look at Bitcoin, it’s not a security, it’s a commodity as intrinsic stored value that’s traditionally accepted,” Hines explained. Government Eyes Bitcoin Expansion Without Raising Taxes The administration’s plan to accumulate Bitcoin hinges on a budget-neutral strategy, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are not used to fund purchases. While specific details on acquisition methods remain unclear, the government is exploring partnerships with the Treasury Department and the Secretary of Commerce to facilitate this effort. Hines outlined the importance of accumulating digital assets without imposing additional financial burdens on taxpayers. “It’s something that’s imperative for the United States to have, retain, continue to build on.” How Much Bitcoin Is Enough? The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve has sparked debate among financial experts and policymakers. While proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an attractive hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, critics warn of its volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Nevertheless, the administration remains committed to increasing the nation’s holdings. “I think it’s high time that our president started accumulating assets for the American people, which is what President Trump is doing, rather than taking it away,” Hines said. “And I think that’s one thing that we really wanted to make clear in this executive order.” The scale of the planned reserve remains an open question, as Hines pointed out: “I’ve been asked all the time, it’s like, how much do you want? I said, well, that’s like asking a country, ‘How much gold do you want?’ Right? I mean, as much as we can get.” As the administration works out the finer details of its plan, industry observers will be watching closely. The success or failure of the initiative could shape the future of Bitcoin in the US economy, and also its standing as a key asset in global finance.

The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF scooped a total of 2,660 BTC yesterday hinting that the institutional demand is coming back once again. Market analysts are curious whether it will help BTC price regain $90K levels in a short time period. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Records Highest Inflows in Six Weeks After a series of consecutive outflows over the last few weeks, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has now seen fresh flows coming in once again over the last two trading sessions. On Tuesday, IBIT scooped a total of 2,660 Bitcoins, worth a total of $217.26 million. This marks the highest single-day inflow for the ETF since February 4, 2025, reported analyst Trader T .

The state’s Senate passed House Bill 1447 in a 45-to-1 vote on March 18. The bill was introduced to the state’s legislative assembly on Jan. 15 and aims to protect residents from scams by introducing a slate of new guidelines for crypto ATMs and their operators. The latest version of the bill passed by the Senate requires crypto ATM and kiosk operators to be licensed in the state as money transmitters, limits customer withdrawals across their network of ATMs to $2,000 per day, and issues fraud warning notices. Initially, the bill limited crypto ATM customer transactions to $1,000 a day, but a House committee last month loosened the limits, with a $2,000 a day limit for the first five transactions within 30 days. Now, the Senate has capped the transaction limits at $2,000. The bill will need to be sent back to the House to vote on the changes before North Dakota Governor Kelly Armstrong can either veto or sign the bill into law. The bill would also require operators to use blockchain analytics to monitor for suspicious activity, such as fraud, and report it to the authorities, and to provide quarterly reports on kiosk locations, names and transaction data. The latest version of House Bill 1447 requires local crypto ATM operators to be licensed in the state as money transmitters, among other requirements. Source: North Dakota Legislative Assembly During a North Dakota House Industry, Business and Labor committee hearing on Jan. 22, the bill’s primary sponsor, House Representative Steve Swiontek, said that crypto ATMs currently lack protection measures, which has “allowed criminals to exploit them for theft.” Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen had signed similar legislation into law on March 13 , the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act, which is designed to help combat fraud. Meanwhile, US Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, who formerly chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed similar federal legislation on Feb. 25. Durbin cited a story from a constituent who fell prey to a scammer claiming the authorities had issued a warrant for their arrest but could pay a fine through a $15,000 deposit at a crypto ATM to avoid jail as motivation for introducing the new law.

One key tool investors use to gauge the prevailing mood is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Recently, this index has provided a telling snapshot of market sentiment, and it’s something every crypto enthusiast should be paying attention to. Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Deep Dive into Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a creation of Alternative.me, serves as a compass for understanding the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. As of March 19th, the index registered a score of 32. This marks a slight decrease of two points from the previous day, and crucially, it keeps the index firmly planted in the ‘Fear’ zone. But what does this really mean for you, the crypto investor? To understand the significance, let’s break down what this index is all about: Scale of Emotions: The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. Extreme Fear (0-24): A score closer to 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’ in the market. This often suggests investors are overly worried, potentially leading to undervaluation of crypto assets and creating buying opportunities. Fear (25-49): The ‘Fear’ zone, where we currently stand, implies that caution is the prevailing sentiment. Investors are hesitant, and market uncertainty is high. Greed (50-74): When the index enters the ‘Greed’ zone, it signals growing optimism and eagerness to invest. This can be a sign of market momentum but also potential overheating. Extreme Greed (75-100): A score nearing 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed’. This is often seen as a warning sign of a market bubble, where excessive optimism can lead to irrational investment decisions and potential corrections. Index Range Market Sentiment Potential Market Interpretation 0-24 Extreme Fear Potential Buying Opportunity, Market Undervalued 25-49 Fear Caution Advised, Market Uncertainty 50-74 Greed Market Optimism, Potential Overheating 75-100 Extreme Greed Market Bubble Risk, Potential Correction Decoding the Components: What Drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a data-driven tool that aggregates information from multiple sources to provide a holistic view of market emotions. Six key factors are meticulously analyzed, each contributing a specific weightage to the final index score: Volatility (25%): This measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Unusually high volatility can signal fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): By comparing the current market momentum and trading volume to the 30 and 90-day averages, the index gauges whether buyers or sellers are dominating. High buying volume indicates potential greed, while increased selling volume can point to fear. Social Media (15%): Social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, is analyzed to understand the general buzz around cryptocurrencies. A surge in positive mentions can suggest growing greed, while negative sentiment often reflects fear. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, weekly crypto surveys used to gauge investor sentiment directly. These surveys provided a direct pulse on how crypto traders and investors were feeling. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, as investors move away from riskier altcoins towards the perceived stability of Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing Google Trends for Bitcoin-related search queries provides insights into general public interest in crypto. Surges in searches like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “buy Bitcoin” can indicate growing greed, while searches related to market crashes or scams can reflect fear. Why Does Market Sentiment Matter in Crypto Investing? Understanding market sentiment is crucial in the cryptocurrency world because it’s a highly emotional and speculative market. Unlike traditional markets with established fundamentals and regulations, crypto markets are often driven by news cycles, social media trends, and investor psychology. Here’s why paying attention to sentiment, as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index, is vital: Identifying Potential Market Bottoms and Tops: Extreme fear can sometimes signal a market bottom, suggesting an opportune time to buy when assets are potentially undervalued. Conversely, extreme greed can indicate a market top, warning of a potential correction and prompting investors to consider taking profits. Making Informed Decisions: The index provides a data-backed perspective on market emotions, helping investors to avoid purely emotional reactions to market fluctuations. Instead of panicking during dips or getting overly euphoric during rallies, investors can use the index to make more calculated decisions. Understanding Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. The Fear & Greed Index helps visualize these cycles, showing periods of fear and greed that often precede market shifts. Recognizing these patterns can aid in strategic portfolio management. Gauging Investor Confidence: The index serves as a general gauge of investor confidence in the crypto market. Low confidence, as indicated by ‘Fear’, can influence investment strategies and risk assessments. Navigating Crypto Volatility with the Fear & Greed Index Crypto volatility is practically synonymous with the cryptocurrency market. Price swings can be dramatic and swift, often leaving investors feeling anxious and uncertain. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a valuable tool in navigating this inherent volatility. By understanding the prevailing market emotion, investors can: Temper Emotional Reactions: When the market dips and fear is high, the index can remind investors that this is often a natural part of the crypto cycle and potentially a time of opportunity rather than just panic. Consider Contrarian Strategies: Some investors use the Fear & Greed Index to implement contrarian investing strategies. The principle is to buy when fear is extreme (when others are selling) and sell when greed is extreme (when others are buying). Manage Risk More Effectively: By understanding the level of fear or greed in the market, investors can adjust their risk exposure accordingly. During periods of high fear, they might choose to reduce risk, while during periods of greed, they might consider taking some profits off the table. Stay Informed and Adaptable: Monitoring the Fear & Greed Index regularly keeps investors informed about the overall market mood, allowing them to adapt their strategies to the evolving market dynamics. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Landscape The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 32, remaining in the ‘Fear’ zone, serves as a potent reminder of the current market sentiment . While a slight dip from the previous day, it underscores the prevailing caution and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency space. For investors, this index is more than just a number; it’s a window into the collective emotions driving the market. By understanding and utilizing tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , you can navigate the inherent crypto volatility with greater awareness, make more informed decisions, and ultimately, become a more astute participant in this exciting and ever-evolving digital asset landscape.

33767162,[object Object],1742360418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Microsoft Uncovers New Crypto-Stealing Malware—Is Your Wallet at Risk?,https://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-uncovers-crypto-stealing-malware-wallet/,"Microsoft has identified a new remote access trojan (RAT) designed to steal cryptocurrency from users by targeting digital wallet extensions on Google Chrome. The malware, dubbed StilachiRAT, has been under investigation since November 2024, and security experts warn it poses a significant threat to crypto holders. How StilachiRAT Operates According to Microsoft’s Incident Response Team, StilachiRAT is capable of extracting credentials stored in the browser, scanning devices for crypto wallet extensions, and intercepting sensitive information such as private keys and passwords. The malware has been found to specifically target at least 20 cryptocurrency wallets, including Bitget Wallet (formerly BitKeep), Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, TronLink and OKX Wallet. Once deployed, it can steal stored digital assets by accessing clipboard data and extracting private credentials. Microsoft’s research indicates that StilachiRAT operates stealthily , using various evasion techniques to avoid detection. The malware installs itself through a compromised library file, WWStartupCtrl64.dll, which executes remote commands to manipulate infected systems. Once active, it scans the device for crypto wallet extensions and extracts saved credentials from Google Chrome’s local state files. A key feature of the malware is its ability to monitor clipboard activity, meaning if users copy and paste crypto wallet addresses or passwords, StilachiRAT can capture and redirect that information to the attacker. Microsoft also found that the trojan includes anti-forensic capabilities, such as clearing event logs and detecting sandbox environments to avoid being analyzed by cybersecurity researchers. Microsoft’s Response and Security Recommendations At present, Microsoft has not attributed the attack to any specific hacker group but has warned that due to the nature of the malware ecosystem, StilachiRAT could evolve rapidly . In a blog post, the company stated: Based on Microsoft’s current visibility, the malware does not exhibit widespread distribution at this time. However, due to its stealth capabilities and the rapid changes within the malware ecosystem, we are sharing these findings as part of our ongoing efforts to monitor, analyze, and report on the evolving threat landscape. Microsoft advises users to take precautionary measures to avoid falling victim to StilachiRAT and similar threats. The company recommends installing antivirus software , enabling cloud-based anti-phishing and anti-malware protection, and ensuring all browser extensions come from trusted sources. Users should also be cautious when copying and pasting wallet addresses and passwords, as malware like StilachiRAT specifically exploits clipboard data. With increasing security risks in the crypto space, Microsoft’s warning highlights the importance of staying vigilant against cyber threats. As hackers develop more advanced techniques to compromise digital wallets, investors and everyday users must take proactive steps to secure their assets.

He stated , “XRP is the quote currency of the XRP Ledger. This is made possible by the auto-bridge feature.” According to him, this mechanism ensures that the XRPL prioritizes XRP liquidity before determining the transaction path. Additionally, De’Vilbiss pointed out that “each transaction costs XRP for gas.” As more tokenized assets are introduced onto the ledger and transaction volumes increase, the demand for XRP rises since higher activity leads to more fee generation. He added, “So the liquidity pools quoted to XRP are favored by the Blockchain. This is the core demand to invest in XRP.” The Auto-Bridge Feature and Liquidity Flow A key function of the XRPL is its auto-bridge feature , which ensures XRP acts as an intermediary asset, optimizing trading between different tokens on the network. This feature is designed to enhance liquidity efficiency and maintain XRP’s role at the center of XRPL’s financial transactions. David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, reinforced this point in a video attached to De’Vilbiss’s tweet. He explained that XRP is fundamental to the network’s liquidity structure, stating, “The XRP Ledger has features like auto-bridging that kind of put XRP in a central role, providing liquidity between other assets.” He further noted, “The more other assets there are, the more opportunities there are for XRP to bridge between those assets.” #Ripple $XRP XRP is the quote currency of the XRP ledger.

Schwartz addressed this by stating, “It’s not a pivot away from XRP because the XRP is the XRP Ledger’s, like, native token, it’s, it’s gas token. It’s what you pay transaction fees with.” He said even as the network expands, XRP remains essential for transaction fees and liquidity functions. Schwartz also discussed how high-quality stablecoins could strengthen DeFi use cases on XRPL, including lending and real-world asset trading. He stated, “We think it’ll turbocharge some of those DeFi use cases, like lending real, real-world assets.” However, he emphasized that XRP’s role remains intact, particularly because of its function as the network’s bridge currency. The Long-Term Demand for XRP De’Vilbiss and Schwartz highlighted the increasing demand for XRP as the XRPL ecosystem grows. The introduction of more tokenized assets results in greater transaction volumes, which directly translates to higher usage of XRP for fees and liquidity provision. This dynamic reinforces XRP’s continued importance in the network, making it a key factor in XRPL’s long-term economic model.

Analysts Predict a Massive Breakout Soon!,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-analysis-is-this-the-perfect-setup-for-a-bullish-breakout/,"The post When Will XRP Price Surge? Analysts Predict a Massive Breakout Soon! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is holding steady at $2.30 after dipping over 1%, but many analysts believe the bottom is already in. With strong support levels intact and bullish indicators flashing, a breakout could be brewing. If history repeats, XRP might just be gearing up for its next big run! Crypto analyst Steph has boldly claimed that XRP has reached its bottom and is gearing up for a major rally. The altcoin recently touched a low of $1.90 on March 11 and has since shown signs of recovery. Currently trading around $2.29, XRP’s price action suggests it might be setting up for a breakout. Steph’s analysis is based on historical RSI movements. He observed that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) had been in a downtrend for two months, forming a falling wedge pattern. However, the RSI has now broken out of this trend, a signal that historically led to strong price reversals. In previous instances, such conditions triggered significant XRP rallies, with one notable example being a nearly 6X surge in November 2024. With this breakout, Steph firmly stated, “XRP bottom is in. Send it higher.” If his prediction holds, XRP may not drop below the $1.90 level and could soon embark on a bullish run. Wyckoff Re-accumulation Suggests a Big Move Ahead Adding to the bullish sentiment, Steph also pointed out that XRP is at the end stage of a Wyckoff Re-accumulation schematic. This pattern, a classic consolidation phase in uptrending markets, indicates that strong hands are absorbing supply before another leg higher. XRP has traded within this pattern since late 2024, particularly after the massive rally sparked by Donald Trump’s re-election. After hitting a peak of $3.4 in January, the token entered a prolonged consolidation phase, ranging between $2 and $3.3. However, Steph warns that XRP must avoid closing a weekly or monthly candle below the $1.9-$2 support zone to maintain this bullish structure. If it holds, he remains extremely bullish and believes XRP is primed for a breakout. When Will XRP Break Out? According to Steph, the confirmation of a breakout would come when XRP closes a daily candle above $2.9. The altcoin attempted this move on March 2, reaching $2.9 after Trump’s reserve announcement, but the broader market downturn led to an 18.83% drop the following day, halting momentum. Despite this, Steph remains optimistic. He notes that the weekly Stochastic RSI is on the verge of a bullish crossover, which could trigger a significant rally. Based on past trends, he speculates that XRP could surge by 500%, potentially reaching $13-$14. In an even more bullish scenario, he sees XRP hitting $30. Meanwhile, EGRAG Crypto is doubling down on its bullish stance, highlighting $2.22 as rock-solid support for XRP. He pointed out that the fractal pattern is playing out exactly as expected, hinting at a potential big move ahead. With the weekend approaching, he urged traders to stay sharp and watch how XRP reacts—suggesting that something big could be brewing. For now, XRP traders are closely watching the $2.9 resistance level. If it breaks, a massive rally could be on the horizon!",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 05:10:43

The Department of Justice said in an indictment unsealed in a Manhattan federal court on March 18 that it had charged Carl Erik Rinsch with fraud and money laundering, and he could face upward of 20 years in prison. The DOJ alleged that Netflix, which wasn’t named in the complaint, gave Rinsch $11 million in March 2020 to finance the storyboarding, pay actors and edit footage for the sci-fi TV show “White Horse” — later renamed “Conquest.” Instead, prosecutors allege that Rinsch moved about $10.5 million of the funds into a brokerage account where he “made a number of extremely risky” trades, including call options on a biopharmaceutical company, which lost him over $5.5 million. Rinsch was losing Netflix’s money while assuring the streaming giant that Conquest was “moving forward really well,” according to the indictment. Prosecutors said that the Los Angeles filmmaker had better luck with crypto, making several million dollars trading cryptocurrency in February 2021, which he used to purchase nearly $3.8 million worth of furniture and antiques, five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, watches and luxury clothing items worth over $3 million. Excerpt of the DOJ’s lawsuit filed against Carl Erik Rinsch. Source: DOJ The US Attorney’s Office didn’t cite Netflix as the streaming company behind Conquest in the indictment, but The New York Times reported on Netflix’s dispute with Rinsch over Conquest in November 2023, where it said Netflix canceled the show in early 2021 after Rinsch’s behavior turned “erratic.” The Times reported that Netflix paid Rinsch $55 million, while prosecutors alleged he received $44 million to produce the show, which is yet to air. US prosecutors also accused Rinsch of spending nearly $1.8 million on credit card bills and $1 million in legal fees to sue Netflix for even more money and to cover costs related to his divorce.

The proof-of-concept, conducted on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, integrated Moody’s Ratings into Credio, Untangled Finance’s risk oracle. Using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, the system allowed credit ratings to be securely published, updated, and withdrawn on-chain while protecting proprietary information. “Our oracle solution ensures real-time data visibility and immutability while preserving privacy,” said Manrui Tang, co-founder of Untangled Finance, in a release. Bringing credit ratings on-chain could make risk assessment more transparent and efficient, allowing DeFi protocols and other blockchain-based applications to integrate real-time credit data without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

Several fintech and crypto-focused companies are applying for state or national bank charters, Reuters reported on Tuesday. These companies have been hoping to gain licenses that were slow or more unlikely to be approved under previous administrations. Reuters cited more than six anonymous executives and several regulatory lawyers, who emphasized the significant increase in bank charter applications. Alexandra Steinberg Barrage, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke law firm, noted that it is working on several such applications. “Is it in full swing yet? I don’t think so. Our clients are being cautiously optimistic, they’re waiting for things to settle.” The surge in national bank charters for crypto firms under Trump signals a major shift in financial infrastructure: • Fintech & Web3 companies are formalizing banking integrations. • The OCC’s fintech charter review could streamline decentralized finance operations. • A… pic.twitter.com/tViYnIlwO4 — Constantine Zaitcev | dRPC.ORG (@constantine_rm) March 18, 2025 Bank Charter License Would Give “More Legitimacy” to Crypto Businesses The push would be a significant step for crypto and fintech companies as the license would allow them to offer a wide-range of financial services and products. According to Carleton Goss, partner at law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, a license can give “more legitimacy to the business in the eyes of customers.” “This will also allow firms to reduce their borrowing costs by drawing on deposits, another big advantage,” Goss added. Further, a bank charter recognition would also cut the capital costs in doing business in certain cases. However, crypto firms are subject to dealing with more regulatory checks if they become banks. Additionally, new crypto-centric banks, if licensed, would target and carter specific customer needs, boosting industry competition, sources told the publication. “Online companies know that they will be coming under greater regulatory scrutiny,” Goss noted. “It makes sense for them to get ahead of the curve, and in turn, get more credibility and capital at a lower cost by applying for a charter.” ‘Uptick’ in Bank Charter Licensing Attempts Per S&P Global data, there were very few new bank charters, with only five being approved by regulators between 2010 and 2023. However, between 2000 and 2007, 144 bank charters were approved per year. According to an open letter by regulatory lawyers, some applications were eventually withdrawn, given the time taken for regulators to approve. The “uptick” in the recent bank charter applications from digital asset firms comes after Trump was sworn-in as the 47th president. His “newly-installed regulators” have sent positive signals to fintechs, says Nathan Stovall, director of the financial institutions research at S&P Global. “We haven’t seen a flurry of charter applications since the financial crisis period, but we certainly saw more in the first Trump administration,” Stovall added. However, executives also highlighted that there is still “rigorous licensing processes in place” and the charter licensing activity is just picking-up.

One Has the Memes, the Other Has the Fundamentals—Which Will Explode in 2025?",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/shiba-inu-shib-or-binofi-bino-which-will-explode-in-2025/,"The post Shiba Inu (SHIB) or BinoFi (BINO)? One Has the Memes, the Other Has the Fundamentals—Which Will Explode in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu (SHIB), often fondly referred to as the “Dogecoin Killer,” continues to hold its ground in the meme-coin universe. With a current price of $0.00001285, SHIB has seen a respectable 6.66% gain over the past week, bolstered by its vibrant and active community. Originally launched as a playful response to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu quickly proved it wasn’t just a fleeting trend. The project now boasts its own ecosystem with notable initiatives such as Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum. However, despite its developers’ efforts to increase SHIB’s utility, the token’s market remains primarily driven by speculation and social media hype. For many investors, the allure of SHIB lies in its massive appeal and nostalgic association with the early days of meme coins. Yet, as the cryptocurrency space matures, a growing number of investors are turning their focus toward tokens that combine strong technology with practical applications. Enter BinoFi (BINO) . BinoFi Forges a Path in Utility and Privacy While Shiba Inu excels in meme culture, BinoFi (BINO) is making serious headway in areas that matter for the long-term growth of decentralized finance (DeFi). By addressing some of the most pressing issues in crypto trading, BinoFi aims to establish itself as more than just a fleeting name in the industry. The Features That Set BinoFi Apart Hybrid CEX/DEX Model BinoFi’s unique infrastructure combines the speed and liquidity of centralized exchanges (CEX) with the transparency and security of decentralized platforms (DEX). This blend ensures users access the best of both worlds while minimizing the downsides of each model. Zero-Knowledge KYC for Enhanced Privacy Privacy has become a growing concern in crypto. BinoFi introduces zero-knowledge KYC (Know Your Customer), a groundbreaking approach that helps users meet compliance requirements without compromising personal data. This ensures security and anonymity, appealing to privacy-conscious traders. Trade-to-Earn Rewards Setting itself apart from competitors, BinoFi incentivizes user activity through a trade-to-earn mechanism. Traders earn rewards for their volume, creating additional ways to benefit from active participation on the platform. Cross-Chain Interoperability Without Bridges BinoFi eliminates the complexities and risks of token bridges by enabling direct cross-chain trading. Whether you’re swapping tokens between Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, the process is seamless and secure. $BINO Presale – A Ground-Level Opportunity The centerpiece of BinoFi’s ecosystem is its native utility token, $BINO, which powers its decentralized platform and rewards mechanisms. Currently in the presale phase, $BINO has sparked tremendous interest among early adopters. Key Presale Details Price: $0.02 per token during the presale phase Projected Launch Price: $0.30, aiming for an impressive 1,400% potential gain upon listing Utilities: Beyond trading rewards, $BINO unlocks staking options, governance voting, and exclusive access to platform features For those looking to maximize returns, the presale offers an attractive entry point into a project that combines cutting-edge technology with significant real-world application. Memes or Fundamentals? The tug-of-war between meme-driven tokens like Shiba Inu and utility-focused platforms like BinoFi highlights the diversity of the cryptocurrency market. While many investors remain drawn to SHIB’s fun and approachable ethos, the lack of substantial utility raises questions about its long-term stability. On the other hand, BinoFi is positioning itself as a potential game-changer in the DeFi space, offering innovative solutions for real-world challenges while rewarding its user base. Final Thoughts Both Shiba Inu and BinoFi bring unique value propositions to the table, catering to vastly different segments of the crypto market. SHIB promises community-driven excitement, while BinoFi delivers compelling technology and sustainable growth potential. For 2025, the bigger question is this: are investors chasing hype or locking in on fundamentals? With its hybrid model, privacy-centric features, and trade-to-earn opportunities, BinoFi could emerge as a standout in the next stage of decentralized finance development. The choice is yours.

While mainstream adoption is growing, inflation and Federal Reserve rate cut speculations continue to create uncertainty. Amidst this, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood remains firm on her bullish crypto outlook, highlighting her top three picks for long-term growth while strongly criticizing the ongoing meme coin mania. In a recent Altcoin Daily video the analyst noted why Wood is interested in these top 3 coins and her severe dislike of meme mania. Let’s dive in. Meme Coin Bubble Will Burst In an interview with Bloomberg, Cathie Wood warned that the $2.6 trillion crypto market is becoming overcrowded with meme coins, many of which will inevitably crash. Speaking on Bloomberg, she noted that AI and blockchain-driven token hype is creating an unsustainable bubble, leaving investors with worthless assets. With the SEC showing no signs of regulating these coins, she advises caution, emphasizing that investors risk massive losses by chasing speculative, overhyped projects. Instead, she remains focused on fundamentally strong assets—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana—believing this is the ideal time to accumulate them before they become out of reach. Cathie Wood’s Top 3 Crypto Picks Bitcoin (BTC) – The Institutional Favorite Wood remains highly confident in Bitcoin’s future, predicting it could reach $1.5 million by 2030. She sees BTC as the ultimate financial safe haven, with increasing institutional adoption and a growing role as a strategic reserve asset, much like gold. With Wall Street, banks, and even governments showing interest in Bitcoin, she believes its mainstream integration is inevitable. Ethereum (ETH) – The Backbone of Smart Contracts Ethereum continues to be a top pick due to its dominance in the smart contract space. Wood highlights ETH’s strong network effects, institutional interest, and expanding role in DeFi and NFTs as key drivers of growth. Plus, with Ethereum staking providing passive income opportunities, she sees it as a powerhouse for technological innovation and financial applications. Solana (SOL) – The Fast-Rising Contender Surprisingly, Wood includes Solana among her top three choices, praising its scalability and low transaction costs. She sees Solana as a serious Ethereum competitor, attracting developers and institutional attention. Its high-speed network and increasing adoption make it a strong contender in the Layer-1 blockchain space, positioning it for long-term success. How Real is Cathie’s Prediction? Cathie Wood remains loyal in her belief that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana will lead the next crypto cycle. With rate cuts on the horizon and institutional interest growing, she sees this as a historic accumulation phase. On the flip side, some X users like Mindset for Money, CPA, question Cathie Wood’s $1.5 million Bitcoin prediction, pointing out that it would give BTC a $30 trillion market cap—surpassing the U.S. GDP. He finds it absurd that people trust her investment strategies. $1.5M is a is a $30T market cap btw. She is suggesting the value of $BTC will be greater than the United States Nominal GDP, the world’s largest economy, in 5 years. Crazy that people actually invest their money with Cathie Wood. https://t.co/a7HLhQTZ3b — Mindset for Money, CPA (@MMoney642) March 19, 2025",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,BTC|ALTCOIN|ETH|SOL|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 05:23:17

Meanwhile, Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet continued its aggressive BTC accumulation after the purchase of an additional 150 BTC on March 18. Strategy also recently announced a new stock offering to fund additional BTC purchases, though its recent acquisitions have slowed. Institutions Plan to Increase Crypto Allocations in 2025 Institutional investors are showing a growing interest in cryptocurrency, with 83% indicating plans to increase their crypto allocations in 2025. This is according to a recent report by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon. The report was published on March 18, and revealed a shift in sentiment among large financial firms, many of which now see digital assets as a key component of their portfolios. Nearly three-quarters of the surveyed institutions reported holding cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and a big number plans to allocate at least 5% of their portfolios to crypto. The primary driver behind this increased allocation is the belief that cryptocurrencies present the best opportunity for attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next three years. (Source: Coinbase ) Coinbase and EY-Parthenon compiled their findings based on interviews with more than 350 institutional investors that were conducted in January. The report also identified XRP and Solana as the most popular altcoins among institutional investors. Institutional investment in altcoins is expected to rise even more if US regulators approve pending applications for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to digital assets. More than a dozen altcoin ETFs are currently awaiting approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and analysts from Bloomberg Intelligence suggest that Litecoin, Solana, and XRP stand the best chances of securing regulatory clearance in the near future. Institutional interest in Solana gained even more traction on March 17 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group launched futures contracts tied to the altcoin, which is a major milestone. Stablecoins are also gaining some traction among institutional investors, with 84% of those surveyed either currently holding or exploring investments in these digital assets. The report explained that institutions are utilizing stablecoins for purposes beyond crypto transactions, including yield generation, foreign exchange, internal cash management, and external payments. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) is another trend shaping institutional investment strategies. While only 24% of institutional investors currently engage with DeFi platforms, the survey suggests that this number could surge to close to 75% in the next two years. Institutions are particularly drawn to DeFi for opportunities in derivatives, staking, and lending, with many also expressing interest in altcoin access, cross-border settlements, and yield farming. A report by Citi in December reinforced the potential of stablecoins to accelerate on-chain activity, including the expansion of DeFi markets. Due to the fact that institutional engagement with DeFi continues to grow, the sector is certainly poised for big expansion. Metaplanet Buys More Bitcoin Some institutional investors are already hard at work upping their crypto stockpiles. Metaplanet, a Japanese Bitcoin treasury company, continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy with the purchase of an additional 150 BTC on March 18. The acquisition cost 1.88 billion yen, or $12.6 million, and each Bitcoin was purchased at an average price of $83,671. This latest buy brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 3,200 BTC, which is currently valued at approximately $261.8 million. Despite this accumulation, the company’s stock price dipped 0.5% on the day, in contrast to the 19% surge it experienced on March 5 when it announced a larger purchase of 497 BTC. To fund its Bitcoin acquisitions, Metaplanet issued over 44 million common shares. This is a strategy very similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused investment approach. The approach has earned Metaplanet the nickname “Asia’s MicroStrategy” due to its commitment to a treasury model centered around Bitcoin. The company’s Bitcoin yield, which measures the percentage change in BTC holdings relative to fully diluted shares outstanding, currently stands at 60.8% for the ongoing quarter. This is a large slowdown from the previous quarter’s 310% yield. Metaplanet’s March 18 purchase solidified its position as the 11th-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the largest in Asia, according to data from Bitbo . The company also plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. Since Metaplanet’s decision to transform into a Bitcoin treasury firm, its stock experienced a dramatic rise of 4,800% as of Feb. 10. However, after peaking on Feb. 19, its share price fell 34%, though it is still well above its March 2024 low. Metaplanet stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) Investor interest in Metaplanet is reflected in its expanding shareholder base, which grew by 500% in 2024 to reach 50,000 investors. The company’s market cap also surged 9,652% in the past year. This rise coincides with Japan’s increasingly favorable stance on digital assets. On March 6, the country’s ruling party took steps to ease crypto capital gains taxes, lowering them to 20%. In November of 2024, the government passed a stimulus package that included commitments to crypto tax reform. Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada urged the government to consider establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and proposed that part of the country’s foreign exchange reserves be converted into Bitcoin. However, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded cautiously by stating that Japan lacks sufficient insight into the strategies of other nations regarding Bitcoin reserves, making it difficult to take a definitive stance on the matter. Strategy Plans New Stock Offering to Buy More BTC Meanwhile, business intelligence firm and Bitcoin investor Strategy also recently announced plans to offer 5 million shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, and the proceeds are expected to go toward general corporate purposes, including more Bitcoin acquisitions. The company stated that while it plans to use the funds for additional BTC purchases, the decision is still subject to market conditions and other factors. The new stock offering will accumulate cumulative dividends at an annual rate of 10%, with stockholders receiving quarterly payouts beginning on June 30, 2025. Strategy also pointed out that it retains the option to repurchase all outstanding shares for cash if the number of shares remaining in the market falls below 25% of the total issued amount. The stock issuance announcement was made after Strategy’s smallest Bitcoin purchase to date. On March 17, the company shared that it bought 130 BTC for $10.7 million in cash at an average price of approximately $82,981 per Bitcoin. This was the firm’s smallest purchase since its first Bitcoin investment in August of 2020, with the previous lowest being a 169 BTC acquisition in August of 2024. The company’s reduced buying activity comes amid concerns that the Bitcoin bull cycle may be over. On March 18, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju expressed the view that the market has entered a period of bearish or sideways price action that could last between six to twelve months. Since first investing in Bitcoin, Strategy and its subsidiaries accumulated a total of 499,226 BTC at an aggregate purchase price of $33.1 billion. The average cost per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses, stands at $66,360. If the company acquires just 774 more BTC, it will surpass the 500,000 BTC milestone.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-19 05:28:34

The AI-driven crypto bot aixbt suffered a breach that led to the unauthorized transfer of 55.5 Ether ($106,200), while the BNB Chain-based platform Four.Meme was hit by a $120,000 sandwich attack. Both projects have since resumed operations, implementing security upgrades and promising compensation for affected users. AI Crypto Bot Hacked for $106K, Raising Security Concerns in Automated Trading The increasing intersection of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency trading faced a major security scare as an attacker exploited the dashboard of the AI-powered crypto bot aixbt to siphon 55.5 Ether, valued at approximately $106,200. The breach has reignited debates over the security of AI-driven financial tools and their vulnerabilities within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. On March 18, the operator of aixbt—an AI agent designed to provide market insights and potentially execute trades—announced via X that the bot’s core systems had not been compromised. Instead, the attacker gained unauthorized access to the dashboard, issuing two commands that directed the AI to transfer funds. The maintainer of aixbt, known as ”rxbt,” stated that the breach was not due to manipulation of the AI itself but rather an exploit of its interface. In response, the team has migrated servers, changed access keys, paused dashboard functionalities for security upgrades, and reported the hacker’s addresses to cryptocurrency exchanges in an effort to contain the damage. Following the attack, speculation spread about the nature of the breach, with some observers initially believing that the bot had been manipulated to autonomously send the funds as a ”tip” to the attacker. This theory gained traction after Simulacrum AI, another AI-driven crypto project, shared a post on X suggesting that the bot had tipped a now-suspended account, “0xhungusman,” with 55.5 ETH. However, further analysis clarified that the attack was not a case of the AI being socially engineered or misled—rather, the attacker took advantage of the bot’s dashboard access, exposing an oversight in the bot’s security architecture. The incident triggered a sharp decline in the price of aixbt's native token (AIXBT), which plummeted 15.5% to $0.09 on Ethereum’s Layer 2 Base network, according to CoinGecko data. The breach has fueled growing concerns regarding the security of AI-powered bots that operate in the crypto trading landscape. AI-driven trading assistants like aixbt, ai16z, and Truth Terminal are increasingly being tested by traders seeking to leverage machine learning for real-time market analysis and automation. However, security experts warn that as these bots gain wider adoption, they must undergo rigorous security testing to prevent financial losses due to cyberattacks. Decentralized AI researcher ”S4mmy” echoed this sentiment, stating that AI-powered financial tools need to be battle-tested before managing significant amounts of capital. Despite the security concerns, venture capitalists remain optimistic about the potential of AI in cryptocurrency trading. Spencer Farrar, a partner at Theory Ventures, a firm specializing in AI and crypto investments, believes that while the sector is currently in a ”frothy” phase, meaningful use cases may emerge over time. One of the biggest draws of AI-powered crypto projects is their ability to create speculative investment opportunities for retail traders. Farrar noted that AI tokens allow investors to explore high-risk, high-reward projects that aren’t typically available in traditional financial markets. AI-Related Crypto Market Still Growing Despite setbacks like the aixbt breach, the market for AI-related cryptocurrencies remains robust. CoinGecko data reveals that tokens tied to AI-based crypto agents currently hold a combined market capitalization of $4.2 billion, signaling continued investor interest in the sector. While this incident highlights the security challenges facing AI in crypto , it also shows the growing role of AI in financial markets. As the industry evolves, ensuring robust security measures will be critical to preventing similar exploits and fostering long-term adoption of AI-powered trading bots. BNB Chain-Based Meme Coin Platform Four.Meme Resumes Operations After $120K Sandwich Attack In other security news, the BNB Chain-based meme coin launch platform, Four.Meme, has restarted its services after suffering a $120,000 exploit due to a sophisticated sandwich attack. The attack, which manipulated liquidity transactions, has raised concerns about the security of automated token launches and the increasing prevalence of DeFi exploits. On March 18, the Four.Meme team announced via X that its launch function was reinstated after a detailed security review and the implementation of enhanced safeguards. The platform had earlier suspended its services, stating that it was ”under attack.” “The launch function has now been resumed after a thorough security inspection. Our team has addressed the issue and reinforced system security. Compensation for affected users is underway,” Four.Meme confirmed. Web3 security firm ExVul identified the attack as a sandwich exploit, a market manipulation tactic that allows attackers to profit from token launches by exploiting liquidity transactions. According to ExVul’s March 18 report, the attacker pre-calculated the address for the liquidity pool’s trading pair and strategically used one of Four.Meme’s functions to buy tokens before liquidity was added. This allowed them to bypass Four.Meme’s token transfer restrictions. Once Four.Meme added liquidity to the pool, the attacker executed a high-frequency transaction, allowing them to siphon off funds before the price stabilized. Blockchain security firm CertiK corroborated ExVul’s findings, confirming that the attacker manipulated the launch process by sending an imbalanced amount of unlaunched tokens to pair addresses before the liquidity pool was officially created. This method enabled them to artificially inflate prices and sell tokens for profit. “In the case of SBL token, for example, the attacker sent a bit of SBL token to the pre-calculated pair address in advance, then profited 21.1 BNB by sandwiching the add liquidity transaction at launch,” CertiK reported. The attacker ultimately made off with at least 192 BNB, valued at approximately $120,000, which was sent to the decentralized crypto exchange FixedFloat, according to on-chain analysis. This latest attack marks the second exploit on Four.Meme in two months. In February, the platform suffered a larger $183,000 hack, raising concerns about whether its security measures are sufficient to protect investors. While the Four.Meme team has committed to compensating affected users, the incident underscores the persistent vulnerabilities of meme coin platforms and automated token launch mechanisms. Four.Meme’s latest security breach comes amid a broader wave of crypto-related hacks and exploits. February 2024 alone saw $1.53 billion in crypto losses from various scams, exploits, and hacks, with the Bybit exchange breach accounting for a staggering $1.4 billion. Chainalysis reported that 2023 saw $51 billion in illicit transactions, highlighting the rise of AI-driven scams, stablecoin laundering, and sophisticated cyber syndicates. These figures signal a growing threat landscape for the crypto industry, where attackers leverage advanced algorithms and automation to execute precise financial exploits. The Future of Meme Coin Platforms and Security Measures The repeated attacks on Four.Meme demonstrate the need for stronger security mechanisms in meme coin launch platforms. As DeFi remains a prime target for cybercriminals, industry experts stress that platforms must implement enhanced smart contract security, preemptive monitoring systems, and multi-layered authentication measures. While Four.Meme has patched its latest security flaw, its future hinges on whether it can prevent further exploits and restore investor confidence. With sandwich attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, projects across the crypto space must continuously evolve to stay ahead of malicious actors. As the market matures, it remains to be seen whether meme coin platforms like Four.Meme can balance innovation with security—or continue to fall prey to DeFi’s relentless wave of attacks.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ETH|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-19 05:30:00

Market analysts predict Pi could possibly reach its previous all-time high of $200 yet they also suggest $10 should be its target price if specific conditions align. The cryptocurrency project titled Remittix poses as “the next XRP” in a rising market despite raising almost $14 million while selling 520 million tokens at $0.0734 per token. Pi Network’s Climb and Bullish Patterns Source: coingape . PI current price chart. On March 18, 2025, the market value of Pi Network stands at $1.13 and a market cap of $7.77 billion. Analysts spot a bullish engulfing candlestick on Pi Network’s weekly chart, typically a sign of a new upward momentum following weeks spent moving horizontally or declining. If strong momentum and positive volume sustain their current levels the coin might ascend to challenge its previous peak near $200. Market observer Crypto King predicts that Pi will achieve new heights if it establishes a healthy price structure. Several significant triggers such as practical implementation and robust trading platforms paired with increased market adoption will help boost the coin’s value even though its long-term objectives exceed $10. According to Crypto King Pi Network faces the risk of dropping toward $1 if it does not demonstrate real usage and encounters unfavorable news conditions. Coinvo examines Fibonacci retracement levels to determine that Pi stands at a critical spot where it could rebound with positive market conditions. Even with his positive stance he makes it clear that Pi Network needs more time to reach the $10 mark. The price of Pi Network coin requires three essential elements : better utility features and steady exchange participation along with rising overall user base adoption. As the hurdles become resolved by Pi’s team the coin will potentially exceed its current price peak. Remittix: The ‘Next XRP’? Several traders now observe Remittix since some consider it the next XRP. The network platform at Pi Network seeks to create an ecosystem based on users while Remittix seeks to eliminate payment friction. The basic strategy of Remittix involves providing instant cryptocurrency exchanges to fiat currencies thus enabling rapid digital asset transfers between currencies. Early supporters trust Remittix so much they contributed almost $14 million while buying tokens at $0.0734 per piece. The token introduces enhancements to avoid limitations found in previous solutions that generate slow or complicated operations. The success of Remittix depends on securing meaningful partnerships alongside maintaining affordable fees since it demonstrated similar features to XRP’s initial transfer model. Comparing Pi’s Goals and Remittix’s Approach Pi Network engages with “mobile miners” from its community to expand its use base over time yet Remittix focuses its efforts on payment solutions for common consumer needs. For Pi to reach $10 it needs critical events such as high-tier exchange listings along with major brand collaborations and the development of a strong dApp ecosystem. Real business use cases constitute the primary driver for Remittix’s potential home market expansion. The investment question revolves around which market strategy creates the most stable price growth. Customers must see Pi transcend its promotional buzz and perform exactly as fans believe it should. Remittix needs to ensure both strict adherence to regulations and successful platform expansion for users and merchants to trust its platform. Project failures will result in short-term price declines for either program. The effective implementation of their development plans by these tokens may lead to impressive profits which could potentially exceed those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Road Ahead From a wide angle view Pi Network needs to demonstrate specific usability at this crucial period. Market analysts together with bullish patterns indicate that the value will climb higher though settling at $10 over the coming years remains a challenging objective. Remittix continues building a straightforward path that links digital money with ordinary transactions. A $14 million pre-sale measures the widespread demand for a straightforward cryptocurrency payment token that shows potential in replicating the past borderless payment achievements of XRP.

41898634,https://cryptonews.com/?p=342477,1742362633,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/41898634.jpeg,Crypto.com’s Controversial $5B Token Mint Sparks Insolvency Fears Among Community,https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-com-controversial-5b-token-mint-raises-insolvency-fears/,"Crypto.com is facing fresh scrutiny from the cryptocurrency community following its controversial vote to mint 70b CRO tokens, worth about $5b. CRO is the native cryptocurrency of the Crypto.com ecosystem, used for transaction fees, staking and rewards on the platform. The move has fueled fears that the exchange might be secretly insolvent, according to a viral Reddit post by user u/GabeSter on r/CryptoCurrency. The controversy erupted after Crypto.com proposed to remint tokens it had previously burned in 2021. At the time, the company had touted the token burn as a way to solidify CRO’s long-term value by reducing supply. However, on March 2, 2025, the exchange put forth a proposal to reintroduce the 70b CRO supply, sparking widespread backlash. Although the proposal was put to a vote , the exchange’s significant control over voting power ensured its passage , despite most independent validators rejecting it. After the proposal’s passing, CRO’s value plunged 5.2%, reaching $0.077. Crypto.com didn’t respond to Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Crypto.com’s Token History Fuels Concerns About Financial Stability According to u/GabeSter, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has a history of controversial business decisions. Before launching Crypto.com, Marszalek was the CEO of Ensogo, a now-defunct e-commerce platform that collapsed in 2016, allegedly leaving investors and third-party vendors in financial ruin. The Reddit post also highlights the early days of Crypto.com, formerly known as Monaco (MCO), which raised $26m in an ICO but later pivoted to acquiring the Crypto.com domain. In 2020, Crypto.com allegedly forced MCO holders to swap their tokens for CRO at an unfavorable rate, which some saw as a bait-and-switch maneuver. The latest reminting proposal has deepened skepticism about Crypto.com’s financial stability. Stop spreading falsehoods. People who tried to FUD us were all proven wrong many times over. If you have something to say, say it, and if you stand by it you should have no reason to hide behind an anonymous account. — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) March 10, 2025 While Marszalek claims the additional tokens will be used to create “sustainable flows on the demand side,” critics argue that this is a thinly veiled attempt to inject liquidity at the expense of existing token holders. The Reddit post likens the situation to a “money printer” scenario, where Crypto.com can generate billions in new tokens with no cost to itself while devaluing the holdings of existing investors. Crypto.com’s Lack of Recent Audits Raises Transparency Concerns Further intensifying concerns, Crypto.com has not released an audited financial statement since 2022. After the collapse of FTX, the exchange briefly shared a proof-of-reserves audit in December of that year. However, the auditing firm, Mazars, later distanced itself from the report , citing concerns that it did not sufficiently account for liabilities. Crypto.com has since refused to provide updated audits, raising further doubts about its financial transparency. Crypto Community Seeks Clarity Amid Crypto.com’s Controversial Move In response to the backlash, Marszalek has largely remained silent but has denied insolvency rumors. However, Crypto.com’s decision to mint $5b worth of CRO while failing to provide updated audits has only fueled further speculation. Many users in the crypto community now view the remint as an act of desperation, comparing it to tactics seen in failing companies attempting to stay afloat. There is no concrete evidence that Crypto.com is insolvent. However, rising concerns within the crypto community highlight the need for greater transparency. Until the exchange provides a clear breakdown of how it intends to use the newly minted tokens and releases updated financial audits, many investors will likely remain skeptical of its long-term viability.

BOJ noted that a recent spike in rice prices is expected to keep upward pressure on consumer costs. The central bank did not signal any immediate acceleration in its tightening pace, although it reiterated that further rate increases remain on the table. “There seems to be no change in the BOJ’s stance that it is considering adjusting the degree of monetary easing and raising interest rates further,” said Yusuke Matsuo, an economist at Mizuho Securities. The BOJ emphasized the importance of trade developments and overseas economies in shaping Japan’s outlook. Economists warn that possible U.S. tariffs, particularly on autos, could undermine Japan’s export-driven recovery by hitting demand and discouraging investment. Mizuho Research & Technologies estimates that a 40% drop in Japanese car shipments to the U.S., if subjected to a 25% tariff, would cut exports and production by 1.8 trillion yen per year, or about $12.06 billion, trimming 0.33% off nominal gross domestic product. Despite these concerns, February auto exports to the U.S. jumped 13.9% from a year earlier, after a 21.8% surge in January, reflecting pre-tariff buying. Even with external risks, the BOJ stuck to its view that Japan’s economy has recovered moderately, albeit with some pockets of weakness. A further sign of improving conditions came from Japan’s largest labor union group, which reported average wage increases of 5.46% this year, the highest in 34 years. Ueda has repeatedly said the bank will keep raising rates if the economy and prices develop as expected, and some economists predict another increase could come as early as May 1.

Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York, Wood emphasized the transformative power of tokenization : “We feel like tokenization is going to be big,” she said. We’d very much like to be able to tokenize our Venture Fund (ARKVX) or our Digital Asset Revolution Fund.” She added that regulatory changes are starting to allow for this type of innovation, and Ark Invest wants to be at the forefront of this movement. Wood’s push for blockchain adoption aligns with Ark Invest’s broader strategy of backing disruptive innovations, including cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, and fintech. A longtime advocate of decentralization and alternative financial systems, she sees these technologies as fundamental to shaping the future economy. Regulatory uncertainty stalls Tokenization, but Ark Invest remains optimistic Even though Wood and her team are eager to enter the space, one big issue is that regulators have yet to clarify what security tokens will look like in the U.S. These tokens are a new class of digital assets that combine core aspects of cryptocurrencies, equities, and traditional investment funds (stocks and real estate) all in one efficient, more streamlined experience. Unlike traditional assets, security tokens have no transaction overhead and inefficiencies. However, financial firms remain uncertain about what can and cannot be tokenized without specific Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. This challenge is not isolated to Ark Invest. A scrolling ring of firms interested in tokenization has recently entered a holding pattern, waiting for regulators to deliver a clear set of guidelines about what a security token can or cannot do. Tokenization has the potential to unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market by 2030, as predicted by some analysts, adding new levels of efficiency, liquidity and accessibility to the investment world. However, companies risk compliance issues without proper legal structures if they speed up too quickly. Nonetheless, Wood is generally upbeat. As financial regulators see how blockchain-based assets are classified and demand a distinction between securities and non-securities, she argues, they will modify their rules accordingly. Ark Invest may be ready to capitalize on this transition when the window opens. Coinbase explores tokenization but confronts challenges Ark Invest isn’t the only major player eyeing tokenization—its top holding, Coinbase, is also exploring ways to bridge real-world assets to the blockchain. In March, Coinbase’s Chief Financial Officer, Alesia Haas, revealed at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference that the company is in discussions with the SEC about launching a security token. Coinbase could become one of the first firms to offer regulated digital financial products if successful. However, this isn’t Coinbase’s first attempt. In 2020, the company sought to go public with a security token but abandoned the plan due to regulatory hurdles. More recently, Jesse Pollack, founder of Base—Coinbase’s Ethereum-based Layer 2 network—clarified that the company is still in the exploratory phase of tokenization. Pollack stated on X (formerly Twitter) that Coinbase was exploring the regulatory requirements needed to bring assets like $COIN to Base in a safe, compliant, and forward-looking manner.

One standout is Sui (SUI), which has shown resilience despite market fluctuations. With over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and integrations with major DeFi projects, Sui has solidified its position in the space. Its growing memecoin market and integrations with Phantom and Backpack indicate increasing adoption, making it a whale favorite. The analyst mentioned another major target is XRP, which has held strong compared to other altcoins. Large-scale whale purchases of over 150 million XRP in the last 48 hours suggest confidence in its long-term potential. With its legal battle with the SEC nearing an end and favorable U.S. stablecoin policies, XRP could be gearing up for a significant rally. Some analysts even predict a potential price surge to $15, driven by strong technical indicators and institutional backing. https://twitter.com/amonbuy/status/1901203894526419296 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today, 19th March : Bitcoin News, Pi Crypto Price, US Fed Rate Cut, FOMC Meeting , Ondo Finance (ONDO) is also on the list, riding the rising wave of real-world assets (RWA) in crypto. Having broken past $1 billion in TVL, Ondo remains a dominant force in the sector. Its association with high-profile figures, including an endorsement from Donald Trump Jr., has added to its credibility. Whale activity suggests growing confidence, with one investor reportedly selling off their Pepe and Beam holdings at a loss to go all-in on ONDO. On the other side, Ondo Finance is promoting tokenization’s importance with billboards in DC as key crypto policy talks approach. https://twitter.com/OndoFinance/status/1902047985862898084 Final Thoughts While the market sentiment remains bleak, whales are making moves that signal confidence in crypto’s long-term future. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Sui, XRP, or Ondo Finance, their accumulation suggests these assets could be poised for a major comeback. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin experiencing expected retracement “It is only the third or fourth correction we’ve had over 25% we’ve had in Bitcoin this cycle compared to 12 last cycle,” Simpson said. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 24% from its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 amid uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the future of US interest rates, but Simpson called it “a normal correction.” “Things got overheated, and they needed to cool down, and the market needed to find a new foundation, and now we’re waiting for the next new narrative,” he said. Bitcoin is down 13.58% over the past month. Source: CoinMarketCap Derive founder Nick Forster shared a similar view, telling Cointelegraph that Bitcoin “is likely in a normal correction phase, with the cycle peak still to come.” “Historically, Bitcoin experiences these types of corrections during long-term rallies, and there’s no reason to believe this time is different,” he said. After Trump’s election in November, Bitcoin surged almost 36% over a month, hitting $100,000 for the first time in December. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $82,824, according to CoinMarketCap. However, Forster added that the six-month fate of Bitcoin seems increasingly tied to traditional markets. Similarly, Independent Reserve CEO Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph that it isn’t just Bitcoin being impacted by the macroeconomic conditions. “This is pervading all asset classes and may lead to a spike in global inflation and a contraction in international growth,” Przelozny said. Source: Charles Edwards Forster said Bitcoin’s current price trend aligns with past behavior before a price rally, even though it appears “tumultuous” at the moment. Bitcoin’s current trend may “change quickly” Collective Shift’s Simpson said the next narrative will likely revolve around US rate cuts, easing quantitative tightening, and increasing global liquidity. However, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards said he isn’t so sure if the Bitcoin bull run is over or not. The odds are “50:50, in my opinion,” Edwards told Cointelegraph. Related: Bitcoin beats global assets post-Trump election, despite BTC correction “Yes, from an onchain perspective at present, but that could change quickly if the Fed starts easing in the second half of the year, stops balance sheet reduction, and dollar liquidity grows as a result, which I think has decent odds of happening,” Edwards explained. The comments come a day after CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju declared that the “Bitcoin bull cycle is over.” “Expecting 6-12 months of bearish or sideways price action,” Ju said.

The attack, which targeted AiXBT’s autonomous trading system, has raised concerns about the vulnerabilities in AI-powered financial platforms. aixbt @aixbt_agent · Follow $AIXBT AI agent system compromised: 55 ETH ($104k) stolen through dashboard access hackattacker queued malicious repliescore systems unaffected. 8:39 pm · 18 Mar 2025 218 Reply Copy link Read 87 replies The hacker, operating under the now-deleted X account “FungusMan,” exploited the system by queuing malicious responses via AiXBT’s Simulacrum wallet. While the platform’s core infrastructure remains intact, the incident triggered a sharp decline in AiXBT’s Base token, which plunged 6%, intensifying investor anxiety about the risks tied to AI-driven trading systems. Hacker manipulates AI-driven Simulacrum wallet The breach occurred at 2 AM UTC when the attacker gained access to the AiXBT Agent’s secure dashboard. Using this entry point, the hacker manipulated the AI into approving two transactions that drained 55 ETH from the Simulacrum wallet. The exploit highlighted a significant risk: AI-driven autonomous systems can be tricked into executing fraudulent transactions if security measures are not airtight. The pseudonymous AiXBT developer, rxbt, confirmed the breach but stated that the AI itself was not compromised—only the system facilitating transactions was exploited. rxbt 👾 @0rxbt · Follow Investigation reportAt 2AM UTC, a hacker accessed a secure dashboard for @aixbt_agent autonomous system, queuing 2 malicious replies that led to 55 eth taken from a simulacrum wallet. Those funds don’t affect core systems or development, no impact on us. Reiterating that this… 7:13 pm · 18 Mar 2025 107 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies The attacker’s method involved leveraging queued responses, a feature that allows AiXBT to execute blockchain-based actions directly from social media posts. While this mechanism enhances automation, it also presents a critical vulnerability if not properly secured. The hacker deleted their X account shortly after the exploit, making it difficult to trace their identity. AiXBT’s response fails to prevent token selloff AiXBT acted swiftly following the breach, blocking the compromised access, reporting the hacker’s wallet address to exchanges, and initiating a server migration to prevent further intrusions. Despite the team’s efforts, the incident fueled a sharp decline in investor confidence, leading to a significant drop in AiXBT’s token price. The Base token, which had been trading at higher levels, plummeted to $0.09628, marking a 6.2% loss in a single day. At its peak in mid-January, AiXBT had a market cap of $755 million, but the latest data from CoinGecko shows that its valuation has fallen to $82.5 million, reflecting broader concerns about AI-driven trading platforms. Source: CoinGecko The platform’s reassurance that its core systems remained secure did little to curb the selloff, as investors reacted strongly to the perceived security risks associated with AI-managed funds. AI-based trading platforms under scrutiny The breach has intensified scrutiny on AI-driven trading systems, particularly those using blockchain-based automation. AiXBT, built on the Virtuals Protocol, has gained traction due to its real-time cryptocurrency insights and market trend analysis. Its unique AI-powered approach has attracted nearly half a million followers on X, with traders leveraging AiXBT tokens to access exclusive market data and sentiment analysis through the AiXBT Terminal. However, the exploit raises questions about the security measures implemented by AI trading platforms. With AI playing an increasingly prominent role in automated crypto trading, this incident serves as a cautionary example of the risks involved when AI is integrated into financial transactions without sufficient safeguards.

The altcoin has gained more than 1% in the last 24 hours and is now trying to climb above the $2.30 mark. However, an analyst has warned that XRP is still in the midst of a bearish divergence, a pattern that has been developing for months. Despite some short-term bounces and signals of oversold conditions offering minor support, there has been no indication of a major bullish rally for XRP. Short-Term Support and Resistance Levels Looking at XRP’s 8-hour chart, the price recently tested an area that was previously resistance, which is now acting as support in the range of $2.25 to $2.30. Although there was a slight dip below $2.25, reaching as low as $2.23-$2.24, the price is still attempting to hold this support level. If the price begins to reject this area and it flips back into resistance, it could see further downward movement. In that case, the next support zone lies between $1.95 and $2.05. For the time being, XRP remains supported around $2.25 to $2.30. If there is another bounce in this range, resistance is expected just under $2.50, with stronger resistance between $2.65 and $2.80. However, it’s important to manage expectations and not anticipate a major breakout in either direction in the immediate future. Sideways Price Action: A Period of Consolidation Over the past month, XRP has been stuck within a sideways price range, bouncing between support and resistance without clear momentum. This type of price action often leads to a sense of stagnation, causing many traders to lose interest and exit the market. However, it is mostly during such periods of consolidation that the most valuable opportunities often arise. Historically, these quiet phases are followed by more big price movements.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-19 05:51:22

Amid this announcement, the Pi Coin price has bounced back from the crucial support of $1.0, in a relief recovery for investors. Pi Network Introduces 2FA Security for Wallet Confirmation To further enhance the security of its wallets, Pi Network has introduced two-factor authentication (2FA), which will allow for a smooth migration for the mainnet blockchain. The new feature requires selected Pioneers to complete 2FA via a trusted email before their Pi balance is successfully migrated to the Mainnet. The Pi Core team stated that the 2FA security aims to secure Pioneers’ wallets and accounts by adding an extra layer of protection. For Pioneers who recently migrated their Pi but remain within the 14-day pending period, completing 2FA is now mandatory. In the case, the Pioneers fail to complete the 2FA process, Pi Network will securely return the Pi Coins to their mining app. However, on successfully completing the 2FA process, the user balance will be re-migrated to the Mainnet without any loss. The official announcement from the Pi Core team reads : “2FA and the Pi “return” features are meant to ensure, as much as possible, the security of Pioneers’ Pi and accounts. Due to the nature of blockchain where transactions are immutable and the Pi Wallet is noncustodial, these features provide extra caution and make sure that Pi is sent to the rightful Wallet owner”. Will Pi Coin Price Regain $2 Very Soon? Over the last week, the Pi Coin price has come under severe selling pressure down y 23% on the weekly chart. With its market cap slipping under $8 billion, the altcoin has now slipped from the 11th spot to now at the 16th spot. Also, the daily trading volume for Pi Coin is up by 15.87% to $600 million. Despite this development, market analysts continue to be bullish about the altcoin. Pi Coin’s 15-minute price chart displays a symmetrical triangle pattern, thereby hinting at an imminent breakout. Source: TradingView Bullish Scenario: A breakout above the key resistance level at 1.2 could propel Pi Coin’s price toward the 1.25–1.30 range in the short term. Strong buyer volume could further amplify momentum, leading to higher gains. Bearish Scenario: If Pi Coin fails to breach the resistance and drops below the support level near 1.10, the price may revisit lower levels around 1.05–1.02. Token Unlock and Listing Delays The price of Pi Network’s native token is experiencing heightened volatility as data from PiScan reveals that nearly 129 million Pi Coins —valued at approximately $175 million— will be released this month. Such large unlock events often lead to increased selling pressure, sparking concerns that Pi Coin could drop below the critical $1 threshold. Furthermore, the community is still waiting for big exchange listings for PI. Binance has not confirmed any plans to list Pi Coin, leaving speculation and market unease to dominate discussions.

One such project is PepeX. PepeX is set to introduce the world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad, PepeX.fun, aiming to bring greater fairness to the meme coin ecosystem. The platform seeks to address concerns over market manipulation and insider advantages, which have plagued existing launchpads like Pump.fun. By leveraging AI-driven tools, PepeX.fun aims to create a more transparent and equitable environment, reducing the dominance of snipers and insiders who often capture the majority of profits. SOL’s struggles continue Solana (SOL) has faced sustained selling pressure, struggling to hold above the $130 level for the past week. Over the past month, SOL has corrected by nearly 36%, mirroring broader market weakness. Solana was at the center of an explosive meme coin boom earlier this year, initially driving trading volume and market interest. However, this surge has also led to severe negative consequences. Reports indicate that rug pulls and failed projects on the network have resulted in losses exceeding several million dollars. Many developers have abandoned projects soon after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens and further damaging confidence in Solana’s ecosystem. In other news, Solana’s SOL futures made their debut on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on Monday, expanding institutional access to the asset. However, the launch failed to generate the same level of enthusiasm seen with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures. The first trading session recorded a notional daily volume of around $12 million, with open interest reaching $7.8 million—figures that pale in comparison to the stronger debuts of BTC and ETH derivatives on the exchange. Why the market is excited about PepeX PepeX, on the other hand, has been generating sustained buzz ahead of the launch of its presale. The market is excited about the innovative project. PepeX is positioning itself as the “world’s first AI-powered meme coin launchpad,” aiming to provide a more equitable alternative to platforms like Pump.fun. The project limits founders’ token allocations to 5%, ensuring that successful meme coins benefit the broader community rather than just the creators. PepeX ’s AI-powered Moonshot Engine simplifies meme coin creation by allowing users to upload any image—whether it’s Doge, a frog, or even their own face—and input a custom ticker. The platform’s AI model then generates hyper-viral memes, a token with anti-snipe protection, and liquidity pools. Additionally, AI-driven bots continuously promote projects across social media, automating community engagement and growth. PepeX’s presale PepeX’s presale is set to begin on March 24. The presale will unfold over 30 stages, offering a total of 2.25 billion PEPX tokens—45% of the overall 5 billion supply. The PEPX price will start at $0.02 and is projected to climb to $0.0823 by the final stage, marking a 311.5% increase. Early stage investors will stand to benefit from the structured climb. Following the presale, PepeX will probably list on major exchanges before its AI-powered launchpad goes live in Q3. Positioning itself as a next-generation meme coin platform, PepeX aims to outshine established players with its AI-driven ecosystem and anticipated rapid growth.

ETH: Bold Prediction Claims ‘Dying’ Ethereum’s Reign Is Ending,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-vs-eth-bold-prediction-claims-dying-ethereums-reign-is-ending/,"A cryptocurrency expert thinks that XRP might overtake Ethereum in market value in the next three months, which could threaten Ethereum’s position as the second biggest cryptocurrency. This claim has triggered arguments in the cryptoverse, with some people doubting if Ethereum can stay in its No. 2 spot. Related Reading: XRP Puzzle: London Fund Manager Breaks Down Why Price Isn’t Rising Ethereum’s Struggles Raise Worries Ethereum has struggled in recent months, leading some analysts to suggest that its dominance is fading. According to reports, Ethereum’s market cap has been declining, and its price has failed to gain significant momentum. Analyst Says Ether Is ‘Dying’ A crypto analyst who made this bold prediction says that some of the issues the Ethereum network is being hounded with include slow processing and high fees. These problems have made some users and developers explore alternative blockchain solutions, including XRP Ledger. ETH is dying. I give it 90 days. That’s all it takes for $XRP to flip its market cap. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) March 15, 2025 Given the current state of the market, Edoardo Farina, a market analyst and the founder of Alpha Lions Academy, thinks XRP could soon surpass Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. “ETH is dying,” the pundit asserted. For comparison, with a market valuation of $230 billion, ETH remains the second-largest cryptocurrency asset despite the poor performance. XRP’s Growth Gains Attention The token’s expanding use cases and regulatory clarity are the primary reasons why XRP supporters believe it has what it takes to surpass Ethereum. Ripple, the organization responsible for XRP, has been developing cross-border payment solutions that have the potential to increase their adoption. XRP could surpass Ethereum in market capitalization within three months if it maintains its present trajectory, according to Farina. Ethereum is worth more than $400 billion right now, while XRP is valued about $35 billion. So, even though there is a big difference, a flippening could happen if Ethereum keeps having trouble and the price of XRP soars. Dispute Regarding The Prediction Not everyone agrees with the forecast. Many argue that XRP’s decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract features would never allow it to rival Ethereum. Ethereum has thousands of projects built on its blockchain, giving it a strong foundation despite its recent challenges. Related Reading: Solana Marks 5-Year Journey – 400 Billion Transactions And Counting What Is The Next Action? While the debate continues, market trends will ultimately determine whether XRP can challenge Ethereum’s position. For now, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, but if its struggles persist, XRP supporters may have reason to be optimistic. The next months will be of great relevance. If Ethereum can find its rhythm, its position will most likely become more dominant. But if XRP sees major price rises and general acceptance, the crypto rankings might change significantly.

Now boasting a market cap of approximately $6.8 billion and rivaling Chainlink ( LINK ), Mantra ( OM ) has emerged as one of the best-performing layer 1 tokens in 2025. Looking at the chart, OM has been on a strong uptrend since early 2024, climbing from near zero to almost $10. The recent rally comes after a short period of consolidation, where the price held above key support levels before breaking out again. OM technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news With indicators pointing to additional upside potential, OM is currently trading at about $6.90. An impending spike in volatility is indicated by the tightening Bollinger Bands. While the MACD is still in buy territory, the RSI is at 58.28, showing neutral-to-bullish momentum. An ADX reading of 36.31 confirms that the trend is strengthening.

A push toward $10, a significant psychological milestone, could be triggered by a breakout above this level. Support on the downside is located at $6.76 and $5.54, which correspond to the lower Bollinger Band and the 20-day moving average. Additionally, open interest in OM futures has increased, rising from a monthly low of $319 million to $378 million, as shown by Coinglass data . This indicates that traders are increasing their exposure, which often points to growing confidence in price direction. Beyond price action, OM’s fundamentals remain solid. The project has tokenized over $500 million in assets, including real estate, and successfully secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s regulator in February. Strategic alliances have also helped it grow, with deals totaling over $1 billion, including a major partnership with DAMAC Group in early 2025. Meanwhile, the community is gearing up for Mantra airdrop amid technical challenges. Following the discovery of more than 123,000 fraudulent wallets during its GenDrop campaign, on Mar. 18, Mantra opened up a 48-hour-long governance vote to decide how to handle 26.9 million OM that were flagged as suspicious. In order to avoid deliberate market manipulation, the team confirmed that the GenDrop allocation will be released without prior notice and will constitute a 10% unlock, or 1,987,555.64 OM.

In a March 17 regulatory filing , Bakkt said it had received notice of Bank of America not renewing its commercial agreement when the deal expires on April 22. It also disclosed that the brokerage platform Webull had also decided not to renew its agreement when it ends on June 14.

Related: Bakkt declares $780M full-year revenue in 2023 earnings report At least one law firm, the Law Offices of Howard G. Smith, announced a possible class action against Bakkt, alleging federal securities violations. The potential lawsuit claims that the terminated agreements with Bank of America and Webull, combined with the rescheduled earnings call, caused Bakkt’s stock price to fall, “thereby injuring investors.” Bakkt, Bank of America and Webull didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In November last year, Bakkt’s share price jumped over 162% to $29.71 and continued to climb 16.4% to $34.59 after a report claimed Donald Trump’s media company was in advanced talks to acquire the firm.

The flagship coin has been attempting to regain a macro bullish outlook after being trapped in a falling trend since the second inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. However, a momentum shift has been observed in the past two weeks, signaling a potential bullish rebound toward a new all-time high (ATH). Moreover, the regulatory environment change in the United States – which has aligned all U.S. agencies, both houses of representatives, and the executives with the crypto industry – has signaled another bull rally in the near future. Bitcoin Whale Investors Prepare for Economic Shift After observing the crypto market in the past few weeks from the side, on-chain data shows whale investors have accelerated their Bitcoin accumulation pace. According to market data from IntoTheBlock , Bitcoin transactions greater than $100k have increased from 6,332 txs to around 9,552 txs in the past four days. The U.S. spot BTC ETF issuers have now recorded two consecutive days of cash inflows after bleeding for the past five weeks. On Tuesday, BlackRock’s IBIT reported a net cash inflow of about $218 million, thus currently holding assets worth about $46.79 billion. The renewed interest in Bitcoin from whale investors is likely influenced by the anticipated macroeconomic stabilization. Moreover, the U.S.-led tariff wars have largely been priced in during the past few weeks. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold its interest rates at 4.5 percent later today. Already, the Bank of Japan held its benchmark interest rates at 0.5 percent earlier today. Midterm Expectations Bitcoin price is currently retesting a crucial rising trendline, which could yield a major parabolic rally towards price discovery soon.
