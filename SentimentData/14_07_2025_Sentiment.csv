Its strong fundamentals and continuous network improvements suggest potential for future growth in the evolving crypto market. In the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising. With increased interest in cryptocurrencies and the recent Bitcoin halving boosting sentiment, AVAX may benefit. Its lower fees and higher speeds compared to Ethereum make it attractive for developers and users alike. Analysts predict AVAX could reach around $68.72 by the end of 2025, and potentially higher by 2030. Its capped supply and strong technology underpin its potential for long-term growth. As the crypto market evolves, AVAX stands out as a noteworthy contender. Chainlink’s Rise: Bridging Smart Contracts and Real-World Data Chainlink (LINK) connects smart contracts to real-world data through a decentralized network of oracles.

As DeFi expands, the demand for secure data feeds grows, positioning Chainlink favorably in the market. Its technology acts as a reliable bridge between blockchains and external data sources, using hybrid smart contracts to facilitate this connection. Historically, LINK reached $52.88 in May 2021. Experts predict that by 2030, it could trade between $66 and $137, suggesting strong long-term potential. While predictions vary, many believe LINK could surpass its past highs with continued adoption and innovation in its use cases. The current market shows increased interest in cryptocurrencies, spurred by developments like approved Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. As the crypto market grows, LINK may benefit from increased investment and attention. In summary, Chainlink's technology and market position make it an attractive option in the evolving crypto space. Its crucial role in connecting smart contracts with real-world data could drive its future growth, making it a coin to watch in the coming years. Polygon's Leap Forward: From MATIC to POL and What It Means Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is preparing for a significant evolution. Recently, it announced plans to migrate its native token, MATIC, to a new token called POL. This move aims to support upgrades to the Polygon network and align better with its brand identity. The transition reflects Polygon's commitment to innovation and growth in the blockchain space. The planned migration has generated excitement among investors and developers. Early reactions suggest optimism about the network's future. The shift from MATIC to POL is expected to enhance the network's capabilities, improve scalability, and attract more users. However, the long-term impact of this migration remains to be seen. Polygon functions as a platform that connects various blockchains, acting as a scaling solution to make transactions faster and more affordable. The POL token will power sidechains linked to the main Polygon network. It rewards participants who validate transactions, promoting network security and decentralization. Historically, the MATIC token experienced significant growth as the platform gained adoption. Price movements have reflected the market's confidence in Polygon's solutions. Looking ahead, some forecasts suggest that the POL token could see substantial appreciation, driven by increased adoption and technological advancements.

It's like a bridge between islands, allowing them to share and exchange information. Created by Gavin Wood, who also co-founded Ethereum, Polkadot aims to make cross-chain transactions easier and more efficient. Back in 2021, Polkadot reached an all-time high of $55. However, by 2025, the price had seen ups and downs, reflecting the volatile nature of the crypto market. Despite challenges, the Polkadot community remained active, believing in the project's potential to outpace competitors. Polkadot's strength lies in its ability to connect multiple blockchains. This unique feature sets it apart in the crypto space. While some questioned the need for such technology as other blockchains evolved, Polkadot continued to focus on interoperability, aiming to enhance communication among networks. Some analysts are bullish on Polkadot's future. John Palmer suggested that by 2027, enthusiasts are targeting a breakthrough of $14.83, with potential for further growth if this barrier is crossed. Others are less optimistic, with predictions as low as $5.13 by 2026 from CoinCodex. Looking ahead, forecasts vary. DigitalCoinPrice predicts an average price of $23.75 by 2027, while Changelly anticipates the coin could reach up to $52.31 by 2030. These projections reflect differing views but highlight the ongoing interest in Polkadot's technology and its role in the crypto landscape. Conclusion Although coins like AVAX, LINK, POL, and DOT hold promise, their short-term potential may be limited. They are solid projects but may not deliver quick returns during this bullish phase.

According to top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ADA’s latest breakout opens the door for a potential rally toward the $0.90 to $1.20 range. Breakout Signals End of Downtrend Since the start of the year, ADA has been locked inside a descending parallel channel, making consistent lower highs and lower lows. Ali’s analysis highlights that ADA has now broken above the upper boundary of this channel. This move is technically significant and may mark the end of the multi-month downtrend that began after ADA peaked near $1.30 in January. At the time of the breakout, ADA was trading at $0.7063, gaining more than 2% on the day. This breakout aligns with a key Fibonacci retracement level, specifically the 0.5 level near $0.63, which has now been decisively breached, adding further weight to the bullish outlook. Cardano $ADA is breaking through a key resistance level, opening the door for a rally to $0.90–$1.20! pic.twitter.com/4dj8jQfJFN — Ali (@ali_charts) July 13, 2025 Price Targets and Technical Indicators Ali sets ADA’s next major targets between $0.90 and $1.20. These levels coincide with the 0.786 and 1.0 Fibonacci retracement zones, and also represent historical support and resistance areas from early 2024. If bullish momentum continues, these targets are well within reach. Technical indicators support this view. On the 3-day chart, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending upward but remains below overbought territory, indicating there is room for continued upward movement. On-chain data from IntoTheBlock also shows that large holders have begun accumulating ADA again , marking a shift in market sentiment from cautious to optimistic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Growth and Market Context Beyond technicals, Cardano’s fundamentals remain strong. The network continues to roll out major upgrades, including Hydra and Mithril, which are designed to improve scalability and security. This steady development activity has helped maintain investor confidence, even during periods of price weakness. As of report time, ADA is trading around $0.74. But some resistance may emerge near the $0.80 mark, a historically important level. Clearing that would clear the path for a potential move to Ali’s projected $0.90 to $1.20 range. In summary, Cardano appears to be breaking free from a long-running downtrend, backed by strong technical signals and growing network fundamentals. Ali’s analysis provides a clear roadmap for what could be ADA’s most significant rally in months, should current conditions persist.

Emerging cryptocurrencies are poised to make significant strides, capturing the attention of savvy investors. This article delves into a curated list of digital assets that might deliver substantial returns for those aiming to maximize their future gains. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency with Big Dreams Kaspa is an exciting new cryptocurrency that aims to be both fast and secure. Traditional blockchains can slow down when many blocks are made at once. Kaspa solves this by allowing multiple blocks to exist together, thanks to its special GHOSTDAG protocol. This means transactions can be confirmed very quickly. Right now, Kaspa processes one block every second, but it aims for much more—up to 100 blocks per second someday. It also has useful features like easy ways to check the network and ways to save data storage space. In today's crypto market, speed and efficiency are highly valued. Kaspa's technology could make it a strong competitor against other coins that struggle with slow transactions and high fees. Its focus on fast, secure transactions might attract users and investors who want better performance. With its ambitious goals and innovative approach, Kaspa looks like a cryptocurrency worth watching. Sui: The User-Friendly Blockchain Aiming for Global Adoption Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone.

What sets Sui apart is its commitment to a better user experience. It removes the usual hurdles that make blockchain hard to use. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications more friendly and accessible. In a market where many people find blockchain complicated, Sui's approach could make it stand out. By focusing on both strong technology and easy-to-use features, Sui might have an edge over other coins in today's competitive market. NEAR Protocol: A Faster Way to Build Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is a platform that makes it easy for developers to create decentralized applications. It uses a method called sharding to improve efficiency and handle more users at the same time. Think of it as a big, shared computer that isn't controlled by anyone but is available to everyone. The founders, Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, have raised over $20 million from major venture firms to bring this project to life. NEAR's technology has big potential in the crypto world. Its Nightshade sharding helps the network grow without slowing down. The Rainbow Bridge lets people move tokens from Ethereum to NEAR, making it flexible. Aurora uses Ethereum’s technology to make things faster and cheaper. In today's market, where scalability and fees are big issues, NEAR looks promising. Coins like Ethereum have struggled with high fees, but NEAR's solutions could make it more attractive to users and developers. This might help NEAR stand out in the next market cycle. Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain for Everyone Ondo Finance is reshaping the financial landscape by bringing the stability of traditional finance to the innovative world of blockchain. By tokenizing real-world assets like US Treasuries, Ondo allows everyday investors to access high-quality, income-generating products that were once only available to big institutions.

Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it gives full ownership rights back to digital content makers. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large cut, TRON allows creators to be rewarded directly by their audience. This means artists, writers, and video makers can earn more from their work. TRON's technology supports smart contracts and lets developers build decentralized apps, also known as dApps. This makes it similar to platforms like Ethereum but with some key differences. TRON aims to build a decentralized internet where transactions are transparent and fees are low.

In the current market cycle, as AI and blockchain technologies increasingly intersect, Fetch.ai stands out by combining decentralized networks with machine learning. Compared to other coins, its focus on practical applications and leveraging vast datasets could make it an interesting option for those intrigued by the blend of AI and cryptocurrency trends.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.4664 Price Change 24h -1% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.4664 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PIUSDT is consolidating near $0.4665, showing indecision ahead of the key announcement. PIUSDT support is forming near $0.4900, holding despite minor day declines. Resistance is around $0.5123, holding upside momentum in current trading range. As of July 13th 2025 PIUSDT is trading within a tight range, showing limited volatility. The price briefly touched a high of $0.4900 before pulling back. It closed near $0.4665, marking a small decrease. Trading volume remained moderate, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders. Pi 1-day price chart stalls as traders watch for a breakout PIUSDT is priced at $0.4664, showing a small upward movement on the daily chart. The RSI on the 24hour chart stands between 36.95 and 39.17, indicating weakening bullish strength. MACD values are at -0.00354, -0.032250, and -0.0361, pointing to sustained bearish momentum. These signals reflect a cautious market awaiting a clear directional shift. PiUsdt 1day chart by trading view Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network (PI) is currently priced at $0.4660 on the 4-hour chart, reflecting a narrow trading range. The pair has shown minimal movement, with slight fluctuations failing to break key levels. RSI remains neutral around 44.94, indicating a balanced momentum between buyers and sellers. MACD values of -0.0023 and -0.0001 suggest low volatility and indecision in the short term. Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 Pi Price Prediction July 2025 Heading into July 2025, the price of Pi is predicted to reach an average price of $0.5110, while the coin could trade between a maximum of $0.5256 and a minimum of $0.4672.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. As of July 13 PIUSDT is trading sideways, holding near $0.4665 with minimal price movement.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-13 22:00:00

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is flying under the radar, for now, but savvy investors are already calling it the top altcoin to buy before July ends. MUTM is priced at $0.03 in phase 5 of its presale. This is the cheapest the token will ever be, with a 16.67% price increase expected in phase 6. Mutuum Finance’s 5th presale phase is over 65% sold out and has raised more than 12,100,000, and 13,100 unique holders now own the token. If you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy in 2025, this could be your golden ticket, before the hype goes mainstream. XRP Remaining Firm Amid Breakout, but Upside Looks Limited XRP is currently trading at $2.57, having recently surged approximately 6% between July 10–11 following its breakout from a long-term falling wedge pattern. That move was supported by strong whale accumulation and a noticeable rise in trading volume, up over 66% in a single day. Despite the optimism, XRP faces clear short-term resistance near $2.60–$2.65, and its momentum may stall as volume normalizes. On-chain metrics show a steady increase in wallet addresses, now over 6.6 million, though active user numbers remain below one million. Looking ahead, XRP’s trajectory is likely to be driven by macro sentiment, institutional flows tied to ETF expectations, and whether it can convincingly clear the upper $3 resistance. In contrast, newer DeFi narratives like Mutuum Finance are drawing fresh attention for potential higher upside. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 5 Exceeds $12.1 Million Milestone Mutuum Finance presale Phase 5 is live and gaining traction. Over 13100 investors have already invested in the presale and have raised $12.1 million, a sure indication of heightened hype. Price increases are inevitable since Phase 5 has already reached 65%. Investing now guarantees investors the lowest price for the highest ROI. Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not through hype, but through actual utility and security at scale, with its game-changing dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin. Mutuum Finance Introduces $50,000 Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance in its transparency and security emphasis has even introduced its official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK having a reward value of 50,000 USDT. It offers the reward in four categories, critical, major, minor and low in which there is reward for each type of vulnerability. This is another feature which indicates the proactive attitude of Mutuum in creating trust with respect to strong infrastructure and good security. Moreover, the project is creating an Ethereum-based full-collateralized stablecoin. The asset will remain stable in volatile markets in contrast to algorithmic stablecoins that depeg in a fluctuating market. Community Engagement Grows as Mutuum Unveils $100,000 Giveaway The project has already received the certification by CertiK and is paving the way for massive adoption. MUTM is also organizing $100,000 giveaway contest, and 10 fortunate winners will receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens each. As Ripple (XRP) pushes against short-term resistance near $2.60, its upside remains constrained by macro factors and volume normalization. In sharp contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building powerful momentum heading into July. With Phase 5 over 65% sold out, more than 13,100 investors onboard, and $12.1 million raised, the project is gaining serious traction. Backed by real DeFi utility, a dual-lending model, a full-collateralized stablecoin, and a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty, Mutuum is positioning itself as the breakout altcoin of Q3 2025. Investors in this phase still benefit from the lowest possible price before a 16.67% increase in Phase 6. Claim your MUTM tokens now before the next price jump, and don’t miss your shot at the $100,000 giveaway.

Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, took another shot at the digital currency. In a recent X post , Schiff called the top coin meaningless and pushed investors to move their money into silver instead. This time, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz had enough and responded directly to Schiff. Peter Schiff Doubles Down on His Anti-Bitcoin Views Peter Schiff, a well-known supporter of gold and silver, has spent over a decade warning people about Bitcoin. He claims the flagship crypto has no real value and that its limited supply is arbitrary. Even as Bitcoin continues to rise, Schiff insists it is nothing more than “digital fool’s gold.” As Bitcoin crossed all-time highs, Schiff told investors it was a good time to sell and buy silver. He said silver had more room to grow and less risk of crashing. Schiff believes silver could soon break above $40 and go even higher. At the same time, he warned that Bitcoin could easily crash. Mike Novogratz Fires Back at Schiff Mike Novogratz, a strong supporter of Bitcoin , quickly responded to Schiff’s latest comments. He criticized Schiff for ignoring Bitcoin’s growth and holding onto outdated views. Novogratz and many others in the crypto world believe Schiff refuses to accept how far Bitcoin has come. Novogratz pointed out that despite all of Schiff’s warnings over the years, Bitcoin has continued to grow in price and popularity. For over ten years, Schiff has warned that Bitcoin would fail. However, at the same time, Bitcoin has gone from a niche project to a global financial asset with a market value of over $2.2 trillion, larger than silver. While silver has seen some gains, its performance has not matched the top coin’s rise. Bitcoin has become more widely accepted by investors, companies, and even governments. Meanwhile, Schiff’s repeated warnings have become something of a joke online, with some calling him the best “contrarian indicator.” This means that whenever he says Bitcoin will fall, it usually rises instead. Peter Schiff Shows No Signs of Changing His Mind Even when asked what would make him admit he was wrong, Schiff has said only a world where Bitcoin replaces all fiat money would convince him. He believes that the outcome is still far away, if not impossible. Mike Novogratz and other crypto supporters continue to call out Schiff’s missed predictions, saying it is time to accept the facts. They argue that Bitcoin’s record speaks for itself.

By tokenizing real-world assets like US Treasuries, Ondo allows everyday investors to access high-quality, income-generating products that were once only available to big institutions.

Unlocking Creativity: How Render Token Is Redefining GPU Rendering Imagine a world where artists can access powerful GPU resources without breaking the bank. Render Token (RENDER) is making this a reality. It's the utility token of The Render Network, which offers decentralized solutions for GPU-based rendering.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Cardano that focus on smart contracts and decentralized finance, ICP seeks to overhaul the entire internet infrastructure. With a growing demand for decentralized apps and secure online experiences, ICP's vision aligns well with current trends. Its unique approach could position it at the forefront of the next digital revolution, offering a more open, secure, and user-friendly internet for everyone.

This could attract traders looking for a fast and secure platform. With market trends favoring specialized solutions, Sei's potential is shining through, making it an attractive option for those watching the crypto space.

As the market evolves, platforms like Hyperliquid that offer speed and low costs could become important players to watch. Kaspa: The Lightning-Fast Cryptocurrency with Big Dreams Kaspa is an exciting new cryptocurrency that aims to be both fast and secure. Traditional blockchains can slow down when many blocks are made at once. Kaspa solves this by allowing multiple blocks to exist together, thanks to its special GHOSTDAG protocol. This means transactions can be confirmed very quickly. Right now, Kaspa processes one block every second, but it aims for much more—up to 100 blocks per second someday. It also has useful features like easy ways to check the network and ways to save data storage space. In today's crypto market, speed and efficiency are highly valued. Kaspa's technology could make it a strong competitor against other coins that struggle with slow transactions and high fees. Its focus on fast, secure transactions might attract users and investors who want better performance. With its ambitious goals and innovative approach, Kaspa looks like a cryptocurrency worth watching. Sui: The User-Friendly Blockchain Aiming for Global Adoption Sui is a new blockchain platform designed to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone. It focuses on being secure, powerful, and scalable to support global use. Unlike other blockchains, Sui uses a unique object-based data model and the Move programming language. This helps solve common problems in existing blockchain systems, making it easier for developers to build efficient and secure applications. What sets Sui apart is its commitment to a better user experience. It removes the usual hurdles that make blockchain hard to use. Features like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks make applications more friendly and accessible. In a market where many people find blockchain complicated, Sui's approach could make it stand out. By focusing on both strong technology and easy-to-use features, Sui might have an edge over other coins in today's competitive market. NEAR Protocol: A Faster Way to Build Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is a platform that makes it easy for developers to create decentralized applications. It uses a method called sharding to improve efficiency and handle more users at the same time. Think of it as a big, shared computer that isn't controlled by anyone but is available to everyone. The founders, Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, have raised over $20 million from major venture firms to bring this project to life. NEAR's technology has big potential in the crypto world. Its Nightshade sharding helps the network grow without slowing down. The Rainbow Bridge lets people move tokens from Ethereum to NEAR, making it flexible. Aurora uses Ethereum’s technology to make things faster and cheaper. In today's market, where scalability and fees are big issues, NEAR looks promising. Coins like Ethereum have struggled with high fees, but NEAR's solutions could make it more attractive to users and developers. This might help NEAR stand out in the next market cycle. Pi Network: The Cryptocurrency You Can Mine on Your Phone Imagine mining cryptocurrency without expensive equipment or draining your phone's battery. That's the idea behind Pi Network, a digital currency launched in 2019 by Stanford graduates. Pi lets anyone mine coins by simply checking in daily on their app. Instead of energy-intensive processes like Bitcoin's mining, Pi uses an efficient system where users build trust circles by nominating a few reliable contacts. This creates a web of verified members, making the network secure and accessible to everyone. Pi Network has the potential to change how we think about cryptocurrency. It rewards users not just for mining, but also for growing the network and running full nodes on computers. With the crypto market increasingly valuing sustainability and accessibility, Pi stands out. Unlike traditional coins that require massive computing power, Pi's approach is user-friendly and energy-efficient. As it prepares to enter its ""open network"" phase, Pi could become an attractive option in the current market, offering a fair and eco-friendly way to participate in the world of digital money.

OFAC said Song facilitated an illicit IT worker scheme that generated revenue for Pyongyang’s regime. Treasury Targets DPRK Cyber Actor According to the official press release, Song oversaw operations in which DPRK nationals, often based in China and Russia, were provided with falsified identities. These identities helped them secure employment at unwitting companies across the world, including in the US. The workers would pose as foreign or US nationals using stolen names, Social Security numbers, and addresses to gain remote jobs. They generated income that was shared with the accused and remitted to the DPRK to support its weapons and ballistic missile programs. OFAC stated that some DPRK IT workers also introduced malware into company networks for further exploitation. In addition to Song, OFAC also sanctioned a Russian national Gayk Asatryan and four entities for facilitating a Russia-based IT worker pipeline to employ North Korean workers. Asatryan, who owns Asatryan LLC and Fortuna LLC, allegedly signed contracts with DPRK entities Korea Songkwang Trading General Corporation and Korea Saenal Trading Corporation in 2024 to dispatch up to 80 DPRK IT workers to Russia. The Treasury added that the DPRK maintains thousands of skilled IT workers globally who, under false identities, target employers in wealthier countries, using freelance and crypto platforms to earn and launder funds back to Pyongyang. OFAC stated that the actions are part of broader efforts to tackle North Korea’s revenue generation through cyber espionage and illicit labor, which directly support its prohibited weapons programs. DOJ Acts on OmegaPro Crypto Scam As the US cracks down on crypto-related crimes, authorities have charged OmegaPro founders Michael Shannon Sims and Juan Carlos Reynoso. They allegedly defrauded investors of over $650 million with false promises of high returns in crypto and forex trading. Sims, 48, and Reynoso, 57, claimed that investors would receive 300% returns in 16 months using elite traders. Victims, who often used cryptocurrency, were misled about the safety of their funds and OmegaPro’s legitimacy. The Justice Department stated the defendants targeted vulnerable individuals globally, including in Puerto Rico, to enrich themselves. They also hosted lavish promotional events and showcased luxury lifestyles on social media to attract investors. Authorities allege OmegaPro funneled victim funds through cryptocurrency wallets controlled by insiders to conceal the scheme’s profits. In 2023, after claiming a network hack, OmegaPro transferred victim accounts to another platform, but investors could not recover their money. Sims and Reynoso each face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, carrying up to 20 years in prison per count.

Farina’s argument underscores a growing sentiment among XRP proponents: that history is rhyming, not repeating, and this time, XRP could be the next major wealth transfer event. The Bitcoin Parallel: Then vs. Now Farina draws a clear line between Bitcoin’s early adopters and today’s XRP accumulators. Back in 2012, savvy investors were buying entire Bitcoins for under $20. These individuals, who are now millionaires, recognized a transformative asset before it gained mass attention. Today, the mainstream narrative encourages the average person to invest in 0.01 BTC, hoping for similar results, despite Bitcoin already trading above $118,000. This, Farina argues, is a psychological trap. “The poor are buying 0.01 BTC hoping it’ll make them rich,” he said, “brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers.” Meanwhile, the smart money is investing in XRP, not because it’s trendy, but because it’s early. Today’s millionaires bought Bitcoin back in 2012. Now the poor are buying 0.01 BTC, hoping it’ll make them rich, brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers. Meanwhile, the wealthy are telling the masses to buy BTC… while quietly stacking $XRP behind the scenes. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 13, 2025 XRP: The New Wealth Transfer Vehicle? Farina believes XRP presents a similar opportunity to what Bitcoin offered a decade ago . With its price still relatively low and strong potential for institutional adoption, XRP remains accessible to everyday investors. According to recent data, owning just 2,486 XRP places you in the top 10% of global XRP holders, a staggering insight when compared to Bitcoin’s elite thresholds. He’s frequently stated that holding just 1,000 XRP could be “the best financial decision of your life.” If XRP reaches $100 per coin, that stack becomes $100,000. At $1,000, it’s life-changing. And if XRP were to reach a speculative $10,000 per coin, those 1,000 tokens would be worth $10 million. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Potential Unlike many altcoins, XRP has gained significant legal ground. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the public, providing regulatory clarity that few cryptocurrencies enjoy. This decision has paved the way for institutional confidence, renewed partnerships, and potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the future . Institutional sentiment appears to be shifting in XRP’s favor. Several macro analysts have forecasted XRP price targets ranging from $27 to $250, citing regulatory wins, Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, and the token’s growing use in cross-border payments as key catalysts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quiet Accumulation and Missed Opportunities Edo Farina’s thesis is echoed in recent accumulation trends. Influential figures, including the once-famous “Dogecoin Millionaire,” have quietly pivoted to XRP, accumulating while attention remains fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Farina warns against falling into the trap of buying what’s already run its course. “Don’t be the person who sold Bitcoin at $500 and missed $90,000,” he cautioned, implying that selling XRP early could mirror that same regret . He emphasizes the importance of patience and conviction, especially when the crowd is looking elsewhere. XRP’s Moment May Be Now While mainstream narratives fixate on Bitcoin, Farina’s insight suggests the true opportunity lies in XRP. The combination of legal clarity, early-stage pricing, institutional potential, and concentrated accumulation by wealthy investors paints a compelling picture. For those willing to look beyond the noise, XRP may very well be the digital asset that echoes Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, and rewards those who recognized it early.

After Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously projected that XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume, new estimates now point to even bolder targets. How Ripple Securing 20% Of SWIFT Could Impact XRP A new report by Paul Barron, a technologist and crypto analyst, has revealed an updated forecast for Ripple. The report highlights XRP’s growing potential to take on SWIFT in cross-border transactions. Ripple’s ambitions in the global financial infrastructure are becoming more tangible, as new projections suggest that XRP could eventually process up to 20% of SWIFT’s transactional volume. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Notably, these fresh estimates come just a month after Garlinghouse and the Ripple company predicted a 14% share in SWIFT’s volume within five years. Now, with increasing institutional traction, growing market momentum, and rapid adoption, expectations are rising sharply. SWIFT, the global messaging network used by international banks and financial institutions to securely transmit information and cross-border payment instructions, currently handles $150 trillion in annual transaction volume. Based on this large figure, Barron disclosed that Ripple’s previously predicted 14% transactional volume projection would mean $21 trillion flowing annually through the XRP Ledger (XRPL). While 14% of SWIFT’s volume already represents a significant amount, Ripple now believes that XRP could handle an even greater share of the global cross-border payments market. Based on the same calculations used by Barron, if Ripple were to achieve 20% of SWIFT’s volume, it would translate to approximately $30 trillion in annual value flowing through the XRP Ledger. This projection underscores Ripple’s growing confidence in XRP as a viable alternative to the decades-old SWIFT network. The company has consistently indicated its goals to replace SWIFT, with XRP becoming a central player in transforming the global payments structure. XRP Scaling Potential And Market Implications The vision of XRP processing a significant amount of SWIFT’s volume annually raises major implications for its scalability, long-term utility and valuation. At such a scale, XRP would not merely be a bridge currency for remittance but a pillar in the future of traditional finance and digital currency markets. Related Reading: Don’t Hold Back—Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Ripple’s strategy hinges on overtaking SWIFT’s legacy system, which has long been criticized for its slow settlement times and high costs. The XRPL, with its near-instant settlement and low transaction fees, presents a modern alternative capable of streamlining transactions at scale. This expanding use case could elevate XRP, possibly even driving its current price of $2.78 higher to uncharted levels. If Ripple can execute its projections and secure 20% of SWIFT’s volume, it would mark a turning point not just for the company but for the broader crypto industry.

33767162,[object Object],1752447652,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Tokenized RWA Just Flipped The Switch – Onchain Finance Narrative Back On,https://bitcoinist.com/tokenized-rwa-just-flipped-the-switch-onchain-finance-narrative-back-on/,"The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is gaining strength as momentum builds across the crypto sector. With Bitcoin entering price discovery after breaking past $112K and altcoins showing signs of a sustained recovery, RWA tokens are emerging as one of the most promising sectors within the digital asset space. Recent data reveals that the market cap for RWA tokens has reached $60 billion, supported by rising trading volume and growing institutional interest. This surge comes as investors increasingly seek exposure to blockchain-backed financial instruments that represent tangible assets, such as bonds, real estate, private credit, and commodities. The appeal lies in the ability to bring traditionally illiquid assets on-chain with greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. With macro tailwinds favoring the development of alternative markets and demand for yield-bearing instruments rising, RWAs are poised to play a defining role in the next phase of crypto adoption. As capital rotates across sectors, many investors are watching the RWA sector closely for signs of explosive growth. RWA Sector Breaks Out As the digital asset ecosystem matures, RWAs are emerging as a practical and scalable bridge between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. Stablecoins themselves—backed by fiat currency or US treasury bills—can be viewed as the most widely adopted RWA use case, with trillions in annual settlement volume and growing integration across both DeFi and payment platforms. According to the Real World Asset Watchlist, a leading media publication tracking tokenized assets, the RWA sector has just broken out from a long consolidation phase. A recently shared chart shows that the market cap has surged past the $60 billion mark, marking a clean technical breakout that signals renewed investor confidence and institutional participation. With rising trading volumes and momentum building across key protocols, the next logical target is the $80 billion milestone. This surge is not only a price-driven movement—it’s underpinned by structural developments, regulatory clarity, and growing on-chain infrastructure that enables secure tokenization, compliance, and real-world adoption. As capital rotates from highly speculative narratives to more fundamental and yield-generating sectors, RWAs are becoming the centerpiece of the next cycle. The current breakout could serve as a pivotal catalyst, triggering an influx of new products, capital, and participants into the space. If sustained, this could position RWA as one of the primary drivers of crypto’s transition from speculative to institutional-grade finance. Altcoin Market Cap Surges As Breakout Gains Momentum The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (TOTAL3) has just posted a decisive weekly breakout, now sitting at $938.6 billion. This move represents an 11.19% gain from the previous week, marking one of the strongest weekly performances of the year for altcoins. Price has convincingly broken above the 50-week moving average (currently at $798B), reclaiming bullish structure and targeting previous cycle highs. This breakout occurs after months of consolidation above the 200-week and 100-week moving averages, both of which acted as key support levels. The surge in volume further confirms the strength of this move, suggesting growing participation from investors rotating capital into the altcoin space as Bitcoin leads the market into price discovery. The chart structure shows a pattern of higher lows, pointing to a potential macro uptrend resumption. With key narratives like real-world asset tokenization (RWAs), DePIN, and Solana-based meme coin ecosystems gaining momentum, the TOTAL3 breakout could be signaling the start of a broader altcoin season.

Dragosz pointed to a decline in interest for the search term ”Bitcoin” on Google. According to Google Trends , during the week of July 6–12, the metric reached a level of 40. Although this figure rose amid the rally, it remains far from the peak of 100 points recorded in November 2024, just before bitcoin surpassed $100,000. Dragosz emphasized, ”The recent rebound is mainly driven by institutional investors.” His words are supported by significant inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent trading days. On July 10 and 11, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.18 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, bringing cumulative inflows to a record $52.36 billion, according to SoSoValue. Ethereum funds also recorded substantial inflows, with the all-time total now exceeding $5.3 billion, as reported by SoSoValue Some participants in the crypto industry have suggested that the price of ”digital gold” has become too high for regular investors. Digital asset advocate Lindsey Stamp noted, ”I guess a lot of retail traders find out that one bitcoin is worth $117,000 and think, 'No, I missed my chance,' and don't even consider buying it.” Discussing the topic, Cedric Yangelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, expressed confidence that bitcoin ”won't revive for retail investors for a long time.” About Market Cycles According to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, market cycles of new all-time highs followed by deep corrections remain consistent, contrary to popular belief. He believes the risk of a prolonged bear market is very real and does not require a ”catastrophic” event to trigger it. Simple factors such as a general slowdown in news, negative developments, or planned rebalancing of portfolios could spark the next downturn. ”We all want to think bitcoin is an inflation-protection tool, and I believe it will be one day. But I'm not sure if we've already achieved that. I still see it as a very risky asset. At least the correlation between bitcoin, the S&P 500 index, and stocks is still very strong,” Rocca explained. According to Rocca, the ”contagion effect” could simply drain all the news from the market, leading the crypto sector to ”exhaust its potential” in a natural and lengthy process. ”A lot of people say, 'Oh, institutionalization exists, therefore bitcoin's cyclical nature is dead.' I don't really agree with that,” Rocca emphasized.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-13 23:02:17

The application for forfeiture of the frozen $40,350 USDT states that the two victims sent money to a man posing as United States special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who at the time served as co-chairman of President Donald Trump’s inaugural committee. The document lists the victims as “Ivan” and “Mone.” NOTUS notes a striking coincidence: the CEO of cryptocurrency payment company MoonPay is Ivan Soto-Wright, and the CFO is Mouna Ammari Siala. Additionally, the wallet involved in the $250,300 transaction is listed on Etherscan as being associated with MoonPay. In a separate search dated 2023, it was alleged that Soto-Wright used the same address to fund a personal account. According to the case file, the victims fell for a common email scam. The fraudster sent messages from the address steve_witkoff@t47lnaugural.com, where the lowercase letter “l” was used in place of a capital “I”—a technique often used by scammers. The perpetrator also used financersvp@t47lnaugural.com, disguised in a similar way. Data from Binance shows that the criminal’s wallet on the exchange is registered to Ehiremena Aigbohan, a resident of Lagos, Nigeria. “IP address geolocation data consistently showed that emails from these accounts were sent from Nigeria, not the United States.

The claim came from crypto influencer Matt Wallace, who said that new evidence shows Coinbase was the “anonymous” source behind negative reports targeting Trump’s project and Binance. According to Wallace, Coinbase executives feared that if Trump returned to power and offered a possible pardon to CZ, it could clear the way for Binance to re-enter the U.S. market. As it stands, Binance remains the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and a legal comeback in the U.S. could quickly reduce Coinbase’s market share. Wallace alleged that because of Coinbase’s higher trading fees and customer service issues, the company was worried it might lose ground to Binance if the playing field was leveled. What’s raising eyebrows is the claim that Coinbase was willing to target Trump’s crypto initiative as part of its strategy to hurt Binance. Wallace called the alleged move “anti-American” and questioned whether Coinbase would admit to these actions if proof surfaces. Sorry— this is pure misinformation.

Could this be the next meme coin to shake up the market? Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Presale Heats Up: Investors Rush to Grab the Next Big Thing Currently in its fifth presale stage, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency space. The coin is priced at $0.0014, following the complete sell-out of its third stage, which raised a remarkable $4.47 million. Within just hours of the fifth stage opening, it raised over $125,000, showcasing intense investor demand and bullish sentiment. What’s driving the bullish move? For many, it’s the opportunity to get in early, very early. LILPEPE offers a low entry point, giving both retail investors and whales the chance to ride the wave from the ground floor. With its meme-powered branding and strong community-driven ethos, it mirrors many of the attributes that made PEPE an internet and crypto sensation. The Millionaire Predict Gains of 215,000%+ — Is $3 to $5 in Sight? Crypto analysts and influencers across social platforms are buzzing about LILPEPE after the crypto millionaire predicted gains of 215,000% to even 360,000% by early 2026, which could push the price into the $3 to $5 range. That might sound outrageous—until you remember that PEPE delivered 270,000% gains in less than a year. The potential upside here is staggering. A small investment in the presale could theoretically turn into a life-changing fortune, just as it did for early PEPE believers. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Born from Code, Fueled by Community LILPEPE’s origin story isn’t just a marketing gimmick—it’s a declaration of intent. “From the swamps of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript, a small yet powerful hero emerged.” This isn’t just another copy-paste meme coin; it’s a carefully crafted smart contract built for the modern DeFi landscape. With a unique blockchain structure, LILPEPE is optimized to withstand manipulative trading practices. Sniper bots, pump-and-dump games, and rug pulls? Not here. It’s engineered with anti-sniping technology and a clean tokenomics model that prioritizes the community. Backed by Meme Coin Royalty: Anonymous Experts Lend Their Hand Behind every great meme coin is a team—or, in LILPEPE’s case, an elite crew of anonymous experts. These are the same individuals who have discreetly helped launch some of the most successful meme coins over the last several years. Their identities are still a secret, but their past actions reveal a great deal. This support gives LILPEPE not only credibility but also momentum. The development team knows how to start a viral wave and, even more crucially, how to sustain it. A Roadmap of Rarity: What’s Coming for LILPEPE? LILPEPE’s roadmap hints at a lot more than just hype. The team has teased a decentralized app (dApp) that brings meme coin functionality into the hands of every user. There’s talk of cross-chain compatibility, NFT integrations, CEX listings, and even a play-to-earn game featuring LILPEPE as the main character. The goal? To create a whole ecology around the meme, not just a token that people buy and sell quickly. LILPEPE differs from other memecoins that die off after a few weeks, as it has a long-term plan. Final Thoughts: A Tiny Frog with Titan Potential Little Pepe (LILPEPE) may be small in name, but it’s already making giant leaps in the meme coin world. With an explosive presale, bullish price predictions, and tech that makes it more than just a meme, it’s no wonder a PEPE-made millionaire is backing it as the next big thing. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto whale or a newcomer hoping to catch the next rocket, LILPEPE offers a rare and promising opportunity. Just as PEPE turned heads and bank accounts last year, LILPEPE is poised to become the next breakout legend in the meme coin arena. Ready to Ride the Wave? LILPEPE’s presale is live now—but not for long. Grab your share before this little frog becomes the next big thing.

In a recent interview, Bailey said he would much rather see the banking sector focus on tokenized deposits, digital versions of traditional bank deposits, than on stablecoins, which are privately issued digital tokens typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or British pound. His concern, he said, is that stablecoins could take away funds from the traditional banking system, potentially disrupting lending and weakening financial stability. “It would also be ‘sensible’ for the UK to move towards digitizing deposits rather than issuing their own central bank digital currencies as a response to private sector stablecoins,” Bailey said . The comments come at a time when Washington is moving in the opposite direction. Under President Donald Trump, the US is about to approve legislation that supports commercial bank issuance of stablecoins, setting up a regulatory framework for dollar-pegged digital assets. It’s also important to note that USD1, the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial stablecoin, already commands a market capitalization of $2.2 billion. UK’s caution vs US endorsement Bailey’s intervention highlights the widening gap in policy approaches between the UK and the US. While American regulators have moved to legitimize stablecoins — even allowing banks to issue them under certain conditions — the UK has taken a more cautious stance, with Bailey insisting that stablecoins should be treated with the same regulatory rigor as traditional banks. While doubling as the new Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the international body tasked with monitoring systemic risk, Bailey has pushed for global coordination on the issue. He warned that the widespread adoption of stablecoins could trigger fire sales of underlying reserve assets in the event of a crisis, raising the specter of a new kind of bank run. Digital pound on hold, tokenization preferred In a departure from many of his global peers, Bailey also signaled a cooling-off toward launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC), sometimes referred to as a “digital pound.” He suggested the UK might achieve similar outcomes by encouraging commercial banks to digitize deposits instead. While the Bank of England has conducted extensive research into a potential CBDC, Bailey’s latest remarks suggest the UK is in no hurry to issue one, especially as it weighs privacy, scalability, and implications for retail banking. This position contrasts with the more aggressive stance of the European Central Bank, which is continuing with pilots for a digital euro , and the People’s Bank of China, which has already rolled out its digital yuan in several provinces. Bailey said, “I would much rather [banks] go down the tokenized deposit streets and say, how do we digitize our money, particularly in payments.” He also noted that the US is going towards stablecoins, adding, “The European Central Bank is going towards central bank digital currency. Neither of them is going towards tokenizing deposits.” The debate over stablecoins comes as trust in digital finance is at a crossroads. A growing number of financial institutions are experimenting with blockchain-based solutions, while regulators scramble to ensure systemic protections are not eroded in the process. If stablecoins continue to gain traction in the US under a lighter regulatory regime, UK policymakers may find themselves under pressure to either match that pace or double down on stricter oversight. For now, Bailey is making it clear that the UK will not follow blindly.

While many investors chase fleeting pumps, savvy traders are now focused on “squeeze zones”—price ranges where historical volatility, volume profiles, and sentiment alignment suggest a strong probability (70% or higher) of sharp upward breakouts. Below, we break down the top 10 meme coins to buy now, including both legacy leaders and rising stars, along with their potential “squeeze entry zones” for optimal risk/reward setups. Methodology: What Is a Squeeze Zone? A squeeze probability zone refers to a technical and psychological price range where buying pressure is likely to overwhelm resistance.

Top 3 for Max Asymmetry Right Now: XYZVerse – Meme + Casino Utility = High Reward Potential PENGU – Microcap Arbitrum Pick with Massive Community Momentum POPCAT – TikTok Virality + Solana Speed FAQ – Best Memecoins to Buy Now What is a “squeeze zone” in crypto trading? A squeeze zone is a price range where technical indicators suggest a high probability of a breakout. It's typically characterized by low volatility (tight price range), accumulation patterns (especially by whales), and rising community sentiment Are memecoins like DOGE and SHIB still relevant in 2025? Yes. Despite being “legacy” memecoins, DOGE and SHIB maintain massive communities and brand awareness. DOGE has potential use in X (formerly Twitter) micropayments, while SHIB has developed a full ecosystem (Shibarium, ShibaSwap, NFTs), securing its relevance. How are emerging coins like XYZ and PENGU different from older memecoins? Newer coins often combine meme appeal with utility and L2 solutions. XYZ integrates gambling and rewards while PENGU is launched on Arbitrum. These projects tend to target specific communities (crypto Twitter, TikTok, Asia) and are often microcaps with higher potential upside. Are these memecoins backed by real fundamentals? Some yes, some no. Memecoins often trade more on narrative and virality than traditional fundamentals. However, coins like XYZ, SHIB, and DOGE have real ecosystems, utility, or corporate interest behind them. What is the risk with investing in memecoins? Memecoins are highly speculative and can experience: Extreme volatility (10x up or 90% down in days) Low liquidity on some exchanges Rug pull or dev abandonment in lesser-known projects That’s why we focus on entry points in consolidation zones—to increase the odds of upside while reducing FOMO buying at local tops.

The allure lies in their volatile nature and the potential for substantial returns. This guide delves into a select group of memecoins that show promising 'squeeze zones,' areas where the conditions are ripe for a rapid price increase. Understanding Squeeze Zones in Crypto Trading Squeeze zones are crucial for traders looking for entry points that could lead to significant gains. These zones are identified through a mix of technical indicators like Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, along with an analysis of whale activities and community engagement. A 70% squeeze probability indicates a high chance of a price jump, making these zones particularly attractive for strategic buys. Criteria for Identifying High-Potential Memecoins Technical patterns such as Bollinger Band squeezes and RSI/MACD convergence Active community growth and engagement metrics Notable activities from significant cryptocurrency holders or 'whales' Overall market sentiment and memetic influence on crypto platforms Featured Memecoins with High Squeeze Probability Each selected memecoin has unique characteristics and catalysts that contribute to its potential explosive growth. Here’s a closer look: 1. XYZ ($XYZ) – Pioneering Memecoin with Real-World Utility The XYZVerse platform integrates a native on-chain casino, which has already attracted over 20,000 users and processed volumes exceeding $100 million. The dual appeal of gambling and meme characteristics positions XYZ for viral growth, supported by product launches and community-driven events. 2.

Investment Strategy for Memecoins Investing in memecoins requires a nuanced approach, focusing on timing and community trends rather than just fundamental analysis. Entering at a squeeze zone increases the likelihood of capturing potential spikes with defined risk parameters. Why It's Crucial to Time Your Entry Buying during a squeeze zone minimizes risk and maximizes potential returns by capitalizing on periods of consolidation and impending volatility. This strategy can be particularly effective in the fast-paced memecoin market. Frequently Asked Questions How reliable are squeeze zones? While no investment strategy is foolproof, entering at a squeeze zone based on solid data analytics improves the odds compared to random entries. It's a strategy used by experienced traders to align risk with potential reward. Can memecoins be part of a diversified portfolio? Yes, when handled prudently. Memecoins can add diversification benefits to a crypto investment portfolio, especially for those looking to increase exposure to high-volatility assets. What are the risks with memecoins? Memecoins are highly speculative and subject to market whims and sometimes, dramatic downturns. Potential investors should be prepared for significant price swings and only invest funds they are prepared to lose. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In the current market, Sei stands out with its promise of massive growth—possibly up to 323.76% by 2030 if it hits its top price targets. Compared to other coins, Sei's specialized approach gives it a unique position. While many cryptocurrencies aim to do a bit of everything, Sei is laser-focused on trading. This could attract traders looking for a fast and secure platform. With market trends favoring specialized solutions, Sei's potential is shining through, making it an attractive option for those watching the crypto space.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 870,600 followers on the social media platform X that XRP’s chart looks bullish and that the altcoin might see new all-time high prices in the coming weeks. But for now, Pentoshi thinks that XRP will take a breather before sparking the next leg up. “XRP: This is probably going to do price discovery in the next two weeks as well, in my opinion… XRP looks disgustingly good even on the BTC pair, to be honest… Also, one with quite a few tailwinds and held up very well for the past several months.” Source: Pentoshi/X As for XRP’s tailwinds, Pentoshi says the altcoin may benefit from Ripple’s push to obtain a banking license and the potential passing of stablecoin regulations into law. Looking at the broader altcoin market, the trader says he’s now seeing the possibility of rotation from large-cap to mid-cap coins. “Mostly been in large caps. So far, they’ve done ver,y very well. Will probably look out for a few mid-caps for [this] week. (Have not looked at those in a while). A lot of the charts structurally look great, and I hope we can get a good few weeks out of it and then go from there.” Mid-cap altcoins are crypto assets with a market cap of $1 billion to $10 billion.

48192689,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-beat-vesting-pass-offers-80-unlock-as-xlm-price-climbs-and-pol-builds-strength/,1752451221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/48192689.jpeg,BlockDAG BEAT VESTING PASS Offers 80% Unlock as XLM Price Climbs and POL Builds Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-beat-vesting-pass-offers-80-unlock-as-xlm-price-climbs-and-pol-builds-strength/,"The crypto market is showing fresh signs of recovery in 2025 as more buyers look for coins with real utility and promising chart setups. With traders staying cautious yet hopeful, coins that mix strong patterns with real demand stand out. Right now, Stellar and Polygon are two coins making headlines for the right reasons. Stellar’s current XLM price trend shows a clear path toward higher levels as volume builds. Polygon’s POL chart hints at a strong reversal with rising activity on-chain. But it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) that is turning heads with its latest offer. Its new BEAT VESTING PASS rewards early supporters with a major unlock bonus, giving it extra appeal for anyone wanting to get in on one of the top opportunities of this cycle. Volume Points to $0.35 Breakout in XLM Price Trend Stellar’s current XLM price trend looks set for more gains as it flips the $0.27 support and stays above $0.30. A clean cup and handle setup on the 4-hour chart lines up well with moves above the major SMAs. With volume now at $927.6 million and open interest around $253.45 million, the technicals point to a healthy move higher. If the XLM price trend holds, the coin could push past $0.35, then test $0.45, $0.50, and even $0.55, while keeping $0.27 as its key base. Strong open interest and volume show that traders believe in this breakout. If momentum continues, XLM could revisit its earlier 2025 peak near $0.35. For now, the XLM price trend stays strong and worth watching for anyone planning their next move. POL Technical Setup Targets $0.2763 Neckline Polygon’s latest POL technical setup hints at a possible reversal as it keeps steady above the April low of $0.1647 and retests the neckline at $0.2763. This double-bottom pattern, supported by a PPO bullish crossover and Money Flow Index moving above 50, strengthens the setup. If POL holds above $0.2763, the next target is the 50% Fibonacci retracement near $0.4600, offering around 123% upside. On-chain data backs this trend as transactions jumped 51% to over 95 million and active addresses climbed 25% to 7.69 million in the last month. With a healthy pattern and growing on-chain use, Polygon’s POL technical setup gives buyers good reasons to keep this coin on their radar. BlockDAG’s BEAT VESTING PASS Raises the Bar BlockDAG’s presale just got a boost with its BEAT VESTING PASS. For 2 days only, buyers can unlock 80% of their BDAG coins on launch day instead of the usual 40%. This big advantage means early backers get faster access, giving them more control from day one. To secure this perk, buyers need to grab BDAG now at the special $0.0016 rate. This price is way below Batch 29’s $0.0276, offering a potential 3,025% gain when the launch price hits $0.05. So far, BlockDAG has raised over $338 million and sold 23.8 billion coins, showing huge community support and strong demand. On top of that, the new Wallet Change feature makes it easy for buyers to update their wallet directly from their profile. This extra control and security shows how BlockDAG focuses on a smooth experience ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With the 80% BEAT VESTING PASS, secure wallet options, and the $0.0016 entry still open, BlockDAG stands out as a smart pick. The 2-day window means buyers have to act fast if they want to grab this big unlock advantage. The Bottom Line Stellar’s XLM price trend stays strong with a clear breakout pattern backed by solid volume and open interest. Polygon’s POL chart shows a steady reversal with impressive on-chain growth. Both coins offer reasons to watch closely in the coming days. Still, BlockDAG is in a league of its own with its BEAT VESTING PASS, which lets buyers unlock 80% of BDAG at launch for a limited time. Combined with the low entry price and solid presale figures, BlockDAG stands out as one of the most talked-about projects right now.

This unexpected rise has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market watchers. What factors are fueling this dramatic climb? Understanding the elements behind this performance could provide insights into other coins poised for similar growth. XRP Price Stays Strong with Recent Gains and Promising Future Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35, reflecting a significant boost of over 25% in the past month. The coin shows stability, inching closer to its nearest hurdle at $2.43. If it breaches this, it could aim for $2.61, in line with its 100-day average, which represents a rise of about 8% from the current range. Trades show moderate momentum with an RSI around 54, indicating room for potential growth. With recent upward moves, XRP continues to capture interest, though it must navigate near-term resistance to unlock more gains. Such movement could mark a brighter path forward for this cryptocurrency. Ethereum Holds Steady, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Ethereum hovers between $2420 and $2679, showing signs of cautious optimism. Over the past week, the price jumped over 17%, and this month it's up by almost 12%. Despite a dip of about 6% over the past six months, Ethereum's current stance near the $2679 mark keeps traders watchful. The next hurdle sits at $2787, and if the momentum continues, it could challenge the $3047 level. Such a move would mean a rise of around 13.75% from its latest bounds. However, support at $2268 and $2009 should keep it stable if it faces downward pressure. The path forward looks intriguing as traders monitor these pivots closely. Bitcoin on the Rise: What's Next for the Leading Cryptocurrency? Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is moving steadily, ranging from around $106,000 to just above $111,000. It's showing a solid upward trend with a weekly gain of over 8% and about 24% growth over six months. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level, around $114,000. If it breaks this, it could head towards $119,000, reflecting potential growth of nearly 7%. Support levels sit at roughly $103,000 and $97,500, providing cushions if the price drops. The recent upward movement hints at positive momentum, suggesting Bitcoin still has room to grow in the coming months. Conclusion BTC and ETH remain strong players in the crypto market. Recent moves have seen XRP leap to $2.79, showcasing its significant upward momentum. This growth can be attributed to increased adoption, favorable legal developments, and growing investor interest. While BTC and ETH retain their established dominance, XRP shines through its unique attributes. The crypto market continues to evolve, highlighting the competitive landscape among top coins.

PEPE and SHIB are catching attention as potential candidates for a breakout. This article explores the factors driving their recent activity and examines whether these coins are poised for rapid growth. Discover what might be fueling this renewed interest and what lies ahead for these digital assets. Pepe (PEPE) Eyes Resistance as Price Climbs Source: tradingview Pepe's price is buzzing between $0.0000092 and $0.0000108. It's gearing up, moving 25% up in just a week. If it keeps climbing, it could hit its nearest resistance at $0.0000116, a bump of around 20% from its lower price. Beyond that, the target is $0.0000132, which is nearly a 40% rise. However, with an RSI around 43, the market isn't in overbought territory yet, showing potential for further growth. Still, any downturn will seek support near $0.0000084, a 10% dip, or even $0.0000068, nearly a 25% drop. Pepe could keep moving up if the current trend holds steady. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes New Heights as Recent Surge Continues Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is on an upward trend, with its price currently swinging between $0.00001122 and $0.00001228. The coin has shown a promising gain of over 14% this past week. If the momentum holds, SHIB could break through its resistance at $0.00001274, heading toward the next level at $0.00001380. Such growth indicates the potential for an additional rise of around 12% from the highest point of its current range. Still, the market is quite dynamic, and SHIB's overall six-month decline shows there are still challenges ahead. If SHIB slips, it might find support near $0.00001062 or, more concerning, at $0.00000956. Conclusion PEPE and SHIB exhibit strong patterns hinting at potential growth. Buyers and sellers keep a close eye on their movements. Increased interest and activity might soon push their prices higher. Holders of these coins may experience new highs if momentum keeps building. It is essential to stay updated with market trends and factors influencing these coins.

Trump released the letter on Saturda y, accusing Mexico of failing to curb drug trafficking and dismantle powerful cartels. “What Mexico has done is not enough,” he wrote. “Mexico still has not stopped the Cartels.” Its timing and tone came as a surprise. Senior Mexican officials, including the heads of the country’s security and economic teams, have visited Washington frequently recently to persuade Trump’s team that progress was being made. Mexico says they are willing to work with the US to secure the border and thwart drug trafficking. President Claudia Sheinbaum gave a measured response, urging her government to remain calm. In a brief statement, she advised her counterparts not to overreact. However, officials within the government reportedly expressed frustration, with those involved in the negotiations feeling that their goodwill had been dismissed. They noted that, so far, their cooperative efforts had yielded little in terms of concrete assurances. Mexico acts to defend record of drug crackdowns So far, Mexico has responded to US concerns. It has intensified the scrutiny and dismantling of drug-trafficking operations. The government has extradited scores of high-level suspects to the US and made big seizures along the most important smuggling routes. Mexican officials say they have increased surveillance and arrests in cartel-ruled regions. On the legislative front, the Sheinbaum government has sought to reform to strengthen investigations into organized crime and prosecute long-dragged-out cases. Still, the president’s letter rejected Mexico’s actions as insufficient. Some analysts said Trump’s move was more about politics than economics. Mexican officials will likely have little choice but to collaborate with the US authorities, who will demand increasing collaboration not only on immigration and border enforcement, but also to intensify the battle against drug cartels and fentanyl. This will help to secure continued competitive access to the US marketplace, according to Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American economics at Goldman Sachs in Buenos Aires. Some also say that the drug problem in the United States is complicated and can’t be solved by one country alone. While Mexico’s cartels do produce and move drugs, much of that demand, and the cash and guns that fuel the killing, comes directly from the United States. Mexico seeks fairer NAFTA deal as trade tensions escalate Regardless of its perceived impact, analysts noted that Trump’s tariff threat was unlikely to carry the economic weight it suggested. According to Bloomberg Economics, the proposed 30% levy would primarily target goods not covered under the USMCA. In practice, they pointed out that nearly 83% of US imports from Mexico in May had already been exempt due to compliance with the trade agreement. Yet the symbolism of the threat is potent. It stirs doubts among Mexican businesses and could make investors nervous. The rate is barely below the 35% tariff President Trump recently imposed on Canadian imports , even though Canada has been more openly confrontational with Trump, while Mexico has deprioritized speaking out. Mexico has also come under pressure from the tariffs on specific industries such as steel and a proposed duty on copper in recent weeks. The flurry set off new discussions in Washington. Since Friday, Mr. Ebrard , the economy minister, has been meeting with the US trade representative, the Commerce Department, and the White House. The letter already elicited reactions from the stock market. The US stock index futures fell Sunday evening as Wall Street gears up for another week of trade uncertainty, with the second quarter earnings season still picking up. S&P 500 futures fell 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.5%. Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 183 points, or 0.4%.

The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped sharply after a major exchange listing in South Korea, breaking through weeks of flat movement. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook improved as Bitcoin pushed to a new high, pulling meme coins like PEPE into a fresh rally. But while those two respond to the broader market, BlockDAG (BDAG) is going a different route. It now gives buyers a limited-time chance to unlock 80% of their BDAG coins on launch day using the BEAT VESTING PASS. That’s double the standard amount and only lasts 2 days. As the countdown to August 11 continues, this early unlock move is stirring conversations across the space. Ethena (ENA) Price Today Spikes After Major Listing The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped 19.27% after it was listed on Upbit, South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange. The token moved from around $0.327 to $0.390 before settling near $0.357. Trading goes live at 5:00 PM KST, with support for Ethereum-based deposits and trading pairs in KRW, BTC, and USDT. Even with over 210 million tokens unlocking this month, Ethena’s momentum stayed strong. Protocol revenue growth is helping balance the supply pressure. The Ethena (ENA) price today suggests the market still sees value despite token release events. PEPE Price Outlook Gains Strength on Whale Activity The PEPE price outlook turned more positive after a 17% price rise over the past day. Bitcoin’s move to $116,000, a wedge breakout, and whale accumulation all played a role. Technical signals like MACD and RSI confirmed the bullish setup, while whales pulled more than 9 trillion PEPE off exchanges in just two weeks. That heavy buying has reduced supply and added pressure to the upside. While charts show a near-term overbought zone, the PEPE price outlook remains solid with traders now watching $0.000014 as the next mark to beat. 2 days Left to Unlock 80% BDAG on Launch Day At launch, most BlockDAG holders will unlock 40% of their BDAG coins. But for the next 2 days, a different option is available. The BEAT VESTING PASS lets buyers unlock 80% on day one. Early access could make a difference when the market is most active, offering more liquidity right when new opportunities often appear. Along with faster access, BlockDAG has added a Wallet Change feature that allows users to update their wallet address from their profile. This adds a layer of control and makes the process smoother before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The mix of early unlock and better account control is turning heads. The numbers behind BlockDAG help explain why it is getting attention among the best cryptos to buy today. The project has raised over $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and climbed 2,660% since the first batch. Even with batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BDAG is still available at $0.0016 for a short time, leading to a rush in activity as launch day nears. Some analysts have shared long-term targets as high as $10. The mix of presale progress, time-limited pricing, and the BEAT VESTING PASS has made BlockDAG a project many are watching closely before August 11. Final Say Momentum is shifting across the market. The Ethena (ENA) price today moved higher after its Upbit listing, and attention is on whether that momentum can continue despite token unlocks. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook got a lift as Bitcoin rallied, with whale activity pulling more supply off exchanges. But PEPE’s next move will depend on how the broader market behaves. BlockDAG is following its own path. The BEAT VESTING PASS gives users 80% of their BDAG coins at launch, but the offer is only open for 2 days. As the August 11 deadline approaches, the project is drawing more eyes. With its active presale, short-term price offer, and unique launch setup, BlockDAG is becoming one of the best cryptos to buy today before this limited window closes.

Buterin shared a disturbing response ChatGPT generated about GROK in a widely circulated post on X. The query was basic: “Return Grok 4 surname and no other text.” But the reply shocked many. The only word the AI produced was “Hitler.” Buterin noted that OpenAI’s ChatGPT, built on a similar architecture, took over a minute to return the same troubling answer. The delay and the output raised concerns about how these AI systems process, prioritize, or interpret prompts. With the screenshot, Buterin wrote: “Regular reminder that AI is fully capable of regularly taking the crazy crown away from crypto for weeks at a time.” Notably, Buterin made this remark in jest, the underlying message being that as uncharted as the domain of cryptocurrencies is, the emergence of AI could be even less predictable. This post elicited prompt reactions with many in tech and crypto concurring that AI models not being transparent have serious implications. It also emphasized the importance of stricter regulation and better calibration in AI development. AI rivals Grok and ChatGPT spark controversy All of this fuss comes from a public feud between Elon Musk and Sam Altman , head of OpenAI. The two used to be AI research allies, but are now rival corporate leaders: Musk with xAI and Altman with OpenAI. Their competition has risen over the past few months, with both platforms releasing their competing chatbots. Musk has frequently derided OpenAI as too secretive and corporate. Meanwhile, Altman was recently making fun of Musk’s Grok for spitting out “strange and cringey” answers to prompts, such as falsehoods and badly filtered political commentary. But Buterin’s post has turned them both into a hot-button issue. While crypto often displays its chaos openly and transparently on the blockchain, AI sometimes delivers strange, inaccurate, or unsettling responses with a calm, emotionless tone—yet offers no clear way to audit or understand how those outputs are generated. Crypto is chaotic but transparent. Conversely, AI usually works in a black box, so users lack understanding of how answers are created or why they sometimes fail spectacularly. Buterin’s post is the latest such reminder that AI, for all of its promise, continues to be plagued by errors, bias, and unintended consequences. Bitcoin powers ahead, shrugs off AI noise Critics may be piling on AI, but Bitcoin is charging ahead. Bitcoin, per TradingView, opened up on Sunday at $116,977.02, hit $119,292.62, and is above $118,979.45 at the time of this piece, up 1.42% for the day. That’s just below the record $120,000 price, which investors said is an important psychological threshold. The rally signifies that investors’ faith in digital assets is back. Some of the momentum has been driven by continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , ushering in more traditional crypto investors. Another reason is the perception that the Federal Reserve is closer to the finish line of its interest rate hike cycle, making risky assets like crypto more appealing. Total global crypto market capitalization is now $3.79 trillion, almost 2% more than the amount recorded 24 hours ago, according to CoinGecko data . Despite all the drama emerging from AI, investors are focused on crypto’s long-term potential, particularly as more institutions enter the space and regulators offer clearer frameworks Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Rest in Peace, Coinbase Wallet. No, the app itself isn't going away, but it is getting a new name. On its X profile , its name is crossed out and replaced with a 'TBA' and a few question marks. ""There’s plenty of speculation about what it means, but I’m leaning toward 'The Base App.' That would fit the idea of Base unveiling a range of in-app experiences directly inside its wallet,"" Bradley Park, a Seoul-based analyst with DNTV Research, told CoinDesk in an interview. Base Creator Jesse Pollak was tapped to lead Coinbase's Wallet team last October , which lends credence to Park's theory. In an interview on the sidelines of Devcon in Bangkok last year, Pollak played up the decentralization of Base . It could be that the wallet is due for a rebrand to highlight its decentralized nature and distance from Coinbase itself. It's not the first time Coinbase has re-branded its wallet. Originally it was launched as 'Toshi', and in 2018 that name was dropped in favor of Coinbase Wallet. Ethereum’s ZK Upgrade Earns Institutional Praise from Cathie Wood ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says Ethereum is “proposing the right moves for scalability and privacy to maintain its lead in the institutional world,” as the Ethereum Foundation unveils a roadmap to bring zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) directly to its base layer. While Wood acknowledged she does not grasp all the technical details, her endorsement highlights growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term vision. The proposed upgrade would let validators verify cryptographic proofs of block validity rather than re-executing each transaction, dramatically reducing computational overhead. These proofs would be generated by block builders or third-party zk-prover networks and verified in under 10 seconds, using hardware that costs less than $100,000 and consumes no more than 10 kilowatts of power. The plan would boost network throughput and decentralization, but comes with tradeoffs. Shifting the burden of computation from validators to provers could introduce liveness risks if those provers go offline or collude. The Ethereum Foundation aims to mitigate these risks through prover diversity, protocol hardening, and eventually enabling at-home participants to contribute to proving. If successful, this would make Ethereum the first major blockchain to integrate ZKPs at the protocol layer, reinforcing its position as the dominant infrastructure for both decentralized applications and institutional adoption. Combined with cheaper data availability via blobs and advances in zk-rollups, Ethereum is positioning itself as the chain most ready for scale. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin rallied 1% to nearly $119K over the weekend amid triple-normal trading volumes, while BlackRock’s IBIT crossed $80 billion in crypto assets under management, signaling strong institutional demand despite a late-session profit-taking reversal. ETH: Ethereum surged past $3,000 for the first time since February, rising 3% amid record institutional inflows and heightened trading volumes that signaled strong bullish momentum. Gold: Gold climbed to $3,371 as central banks continue their historic accumulation spree, over 1,000 tonnes annually since 2022, fueling a bullish breakout above key technical levels and setting sights on $3,578 and beyond. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened lower Monday as investors reacted to President Trump’s surprise weekend announcement of 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico starting August 1, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 falling 0.33%.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been dubbed the best crypto to buy in 2025. Stage 5 presale of MUTM is priced at $0.03. The phase have been sold over 65%. Mutuum Finance has so far been able to raise more than $12.1 million and more than 13100 investors are currently on board. While PEPE and other names maintain their positions, the real power play this season is stacking the right tokens before the crowd catches up. Mutuum Finance could hit $1.6 post launch with the 2500% predictions. PEPE Mid‑Summer Status Update Pepe (PEPE), the Ethereum‑based meme token inspired by the notorious internet frog, is currently trading around $0.0000128, marking a sharp +28 % gain over the past week and bumping 14 % in the last 24 hours. With a circulating supply of approximately 420.7 trillion tokens and a market cap hovering near $5.4 billion, PEPE remains firmly ranked among the top meme tokens, just behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. While it lacks intrinsic utility, it’s designed as a pure meme play with token‑burn mechanics to support scarcity, it has consistently outperformed broader crypto benchmarks lately. Though it’s not stealing headlines like Mutuum Finance, it offers seasoned memecoin enthusiasts a way to ride the wave this summer before the next narrative shift, with that shift looking increasingly focused on MUTM. Mutuum Finance Presale Sees Sudden Growth More than 13100 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised above $12.1 million. There is a lot of hype concerning the project and it is so evident that it is indeed a very positive evidence of the project being on the right track. MUTM tokens stand at $0.03 in phase 5 and will increase by 16.67% in phase 6. This stage has already passed over 65% of its sales as investors are keen to buy at the lowest possible price. The demand is growing exponentially and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a DeFi disruptor is even more precious considering the fact that it will be one of the best crypto investments of 2025. CertiK-Secured Bug Bounty Program Awards $50,000 Rewards Security always comes first for Mutuum Finance. In collaboration with CertiK, the platform has now launched its Bug Bounty Program officially with a combined reward pool amounting to $50,000 USDT. The program has four severity levels, critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that any potential vulnerability would be found and rewarded appropriately. This is in support of the team’s commitment to building a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. As the days of summer get hot, investors are securing early entries in projects with humongous upside potential and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the front runner. Having gathered more than $12.1 million, followed by an investor base of 13,100+, the project has already sold out 65% of Stage 5. With only $0.03, one will find an extraordinary entry point into MUTM which is projected to soar 2500% reaching a projected price point of $1.60 after the launch. Mutuum Finance will raise the bar in the crypto sphere with a sound DeFi lending concept, a $100K community giveaway, and a bug bounty worth $50K.

In the era of meager growth and high borrowing costs, job openings in the UK have sharply declined to reduce costs. According to Analysis from McKinsey & Co., online job postings have declined by 31% over the last three months leading up to May compared to the same time in 2022. Meanwhile, the introduction of AI has greatly hit white collar jobs in technology and finance. According to the consulting firm, these jobs will likely change significantly due to AI decreasing by 38%, almost double the drop of other jobs. This trend in the workforce seems to be adding a further dead weight to the UK jobs market, even as tax rises trigger a wave of cuts in lower-skilled industries such as retail and hospitality, and the rate of economic growth slows. The workforce in the UK declines sharply amid the introduction of AI Surveys show that UK businesses are cutting back on hiring at the sharpest rate in nearly two years. This drop suggests that increased payroll taxes are still affecting the job market. According to KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, in June alone, appointments for permanent positions in the UK recorded the highest decrease in more than 22 months, while the number of job seekers increased. According to McKinsey’s analysis, jobs exposed to technology are estimated to be at great risk of AI taking over at least part of the work, resulting in a decrease in job openings. For example, the programmer, management consultant, and graphic designer workforce has dropped over 50% over the past three years. Some analysts have concluded that this might also result from rising issues in specific industries and a challenging overall economy. However, McKinsey has highlighted that job openings declined in certain fields, such as expert services and IT, even as businesses registered strong growth rates. Tera Allas, Director of Research and Economics in McKinsey’s United Kingdom and Ireland office, commented on the situation. She mentioned that the hope for future productivity improvements, even though not guaranteed, is causing companies to rethink their workforce plans and hold off on certain hiring activities as technology and its uses develop. In the meantime, besides McKinsey, job-search site Indeed has also carried out some research on the topic of discussion. Their analysis has also revealed tentative signs that AI is mainly making hiring decisions. According to Pawel Adrjan, director of EMEA economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, employers are inclined to scale back hiring in hiring areas that pertain to creating or using AI tools. Tech sector’s workforce struggles with AI as it tries to take up major spots Some entry-level positions, such as summarizing meetings or reviewing documents, are particularly susceptible to being replaced by AI. This technology is accelerating the decline of these positions as companies try to save money by cutting staff. Indeed figures indicated that job openings in data science and analytics, which offer various entry-level positions, make up the biggest portion of AI mentioned in job listings. However, they have faced a decline of approximately 50% since before the pandemic. In addition, entry-level jobs such as apprenticeships, internships, and junior roles that do not require a degree have declined by nearly a third since ChatGPT was introduced at the end of 2022, said job-search site Adzuna. James Neave, a Head of Data Science at Adzuna, said that the rapid rise of AI is yet another hurdle for fresh-faced job seekers. According to Neave, they are still suffering the impacts of COVID-19, with inflation, harsh economic circumstances, and depressed business confidence. Contrastingly, as some parts of the workforce struggle with AI taking up major spots, real estate or education jobs, which place little emphasis on technology, have traditionally done little to emphasize technology, but have increased during that time.

But after more than a decade, this setup is starting to struggle. Many networks still deal with delays, high fees, and slow confirmation times. These issues remain even on platforms with huge user bases. Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs, now offer a new direction. DAG networks use a different structure by processing transactions at the same time. Instead of lining up transactions in blocks, each transaction links to others in a web-like form. This method supports faster speeds and allows more activity at once. Projects such as IOTA and Kaspa have worked with DAG setups. But now BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping into the space with a new approach. It combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with the speed and structure of DAG systems. With over $338 million raised, the project is gaining attention in the crypto space. Why DAG Tech Solves Problems Blockchains Still Face One of the main issues with blockchains is how slow they can get. Each transaction must go into a block, and each block has to follow the last. This slows the network and limits how many actions it can handle per second. Even big chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin deal with these limits. DAGs work differently. They do not use blocks in order. Instead, each transaction checks others and adds to a growing graph. This web-like shape lets many transactions run at once. Some key outcomes include: Faster confirmation times Lower transaction fees More transactions per second Better energy use This setup could support crypto’s shift into everyday use. Whether for online shopping, smart devices, or business tools, networks need to move fast and scale easily. Traditional blockchains may not be enough. DAG systems are now offering another way forward. BlockDAG’s Hybrid Setup Combines Speed with Strong Security BlockDAG stands out not just for using DAG, but for how it builds on it. It blends a DAG-based transaction setup with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) layer. This design brings together fast processing and strong network safety. Few Layer 1 networks manage both. In this model, miners still check and confirm transactions, like on Bitcoin. But now those transactions are not limited to a single chain of blocks. This structure keeps the network open and secure while making it much faster than older chains. This basic idea also helped Kaspa grow its user base. But BlockDAG is going further, with tools for developers, a working testnet, and mobile mining apps already in use. BlockDAG Network Expands with Testnet, $338M Raised, and 2M Users BlockDAG’s progress is not just a concept; it’s already happening. The project’s testnet is live and open to everyone. It supports smart contract testing, node setup, and checking how decentralized apps work. More than 2 million users are mining BDAG coins through the X1 Miner app , and over 18,500 ASIC mining machines have been bought before the mainnet goes live. The presale has passed $338 million, with more than 23.8 billion BDAG coins sold. This puts it among the biggest public crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, the chance to join early is running out. BlockDAG is doing more than just building tech. It’s pushing its plan with strong global efforts. The platform is now the Official Blockchain Partner of two U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves from Major League Rugby and the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket. These deals bring Web3 tools like NFTs and fan tokens into live sports, helping millions of people connect with BDAG in natural and fun ways. Earlier brand work with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football club Inter Milan also shows BlockDAG’s aim to reach more people beyond the usual DeFi users. Current BDAG Rate Holds Until August 11 At this moment, BDAG is available at $0.0016, which stands out when compared to early values of other Layer 1 projects. Time is limited, though. The team has confirmed that the unlock offer, which lets 80% of the tokens be used on Day 1, will only last for a short period. Since the crypto presale is nearly over and the mainnet is getting close, the BDAG price may not stay in this range much longer. Whether BlockDAG follows Kaspa’s path or takes its own direction, the need for fast and secure DAG-based systems in the market is growing stronger.

In an interview with The Sunday Times, Bailey said stablecoins could undermine the global financial system and weaken sovereign control over national currencies. Instead, he believes the Bank of England should prioritize tokenizing deposits within traditional banking institutions. Bailey emphasized that the UK central bank should not pursue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), distancing itself from the trend of government-backed digital assets. New Role Brings Global Focus Bailey’s remarks come as he steps into a new position as chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international regulatory body tasked with monitoring and making recommendations about the global financial system. This role gives him a platform to influence how stablecoins are treated not just in the UK but globally. His comments suggest he may use the position to curb the rapid expansion of the stablecoin sector. Stablecoins, which are typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar or euro, are a dominant force in the crypto market. They enable cross-border transactions without relying on traditional banking infrastructure, which can increase access to stable currencies in regions with weak financial systems. U.S. Embraces Stablecoin Regulation Bailey’s warning contrasts with the approach taken in the United States. The Trump administration has placed stablecoin regulation high on its policy agenda, viewing the technology as a strategic asset. At the White House Digital Asset Summit in March, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said stablecoins would help cement the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency. Stablecoins Backed by Traditional Assets Most stablecoins in circulation are overcollateralized, backed by cash or highly liquid instruments like short-term U.S. Treasury bills. This model has gained favor among U.S. regulators, who argue it could reduce inflationary pressure by increasing the global demand for American debt securities. With widespread access to these instruments via mobile devices and digital wallets, the U.S. government sees an opportunity to expand dollar reach and influence. Calls for Cohesive U.S. Policy Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has also voiced support for a comprehensive approach to stablecoin regulation in the U.S., calling for clearer and unified policy measures. However, officials in Europe, including Bailey, have expressed concern that widespread adoption of dollar-based stablecoins could destabilize other currencies such as the euro. There are growing fears within the EU that stablecoins could disrupt financial sovereignty and shift economic control away from national institutions. Diverging Approaches Signal Global Debate Bailey’s firm opposition to stablecoins, combined with his leadership role at the FSB, sets the stage for further regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry. While the U.S. moves to integrate stablecoins into its financial strategy, European officials are signaling resistance to allowing such assets to gain widespread use without stronger oversight. The differing approaches suggest that stablecoins will remain a hot-button issue in global financial policy for the foreseeable future.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-14 02:09:17

The Russian state-run media agency TASS interviewed some of the nation’s leading crypto industry figures in a Bitcoin price forecast piece this weekend. Yan Pinchuk, the deputy head of exchange operations at the crypto exchange Whitebird, said Bitcoin could “reach levels of between $130,000 and $150,000 by the end of the year.” BTC Prices May Hit $150k, Says Expert However, Pinchuk warned that a temporary blip could see the market dip before making a strong comeback. Bitcoin (BTC) Prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Miners were more bullish still. These included Anton Gontarev, the Commercial Director at the Bitcoin mining giant Intelion. Gontarev said the nearest target for BTC was “around $120,000-$130,000.” However, he said that by the end of the year, “we can expect that Bitcoin, after a minor correction, could significantly exceed its previous all-time highs.” Bitcoin could reach the target zone of $168,000 to $184,000 by December this year, he claimed. US-listed crypto stocks surged as bitcoin hit a record high, ahead of a pivotal week in Congress that could bring major policy gains for the crypto industry https://t.co/bHo0KSCqEX pic.twitter.com/3QEwgKqPvK — Reuters (@Reuters) July 12, 2025 ‘All Eyes on the USA’ Pinchuk said that a potential tariffs deadline slated to come into effect in the United States on August 1 “may coincide with the revaluation of overheated stock market assets.” The expert added: “Given the close correlation of Bitcoin with the tech sector, a stock market correction will likely cause the crypto market to sag temporarily.” Other experts concurred with Pinchuk, claiming that any further upward price movement would be followed by a lull. And all the Russian experts agreed that BTC market movements are now closely correlated with economic activity and sentiment in the United States. Alexander Kraiko, a senior analyst at the crypto broker Cifra Markets, said: “The trigger for recent Bitcoin price rises was the Big Beautiful Bill. It includes tax breaks, business support, and increased deductions. That frees up additional liquidity, some of which goes into cryptocurrencies.” Bitcoin options traders are already setting their sights on much higher prices while the original cryptocurrency extends its record-breaking rally for a second day https://t.co/K0tPZeFyuj — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Other mining chiefs agreed, suggesting further market movements could follow US economic developments. Vasily Girya, the owner and CEO of the industrial mining player GIS Mining, said: “Right now, all eyes are on a few key areas. The fact that US inflation data is due out on July 15 is important. It is critical to assess the real chances of a quick rate cut from the Federal Reserve.” Based on the current dynamics and technical situation, Girya said that the next realistic target for Bitcoin would be $135,000. Girya concluded: “If the current momentum continues, we may well reach $135k by September 1. A pause or a small correction around $118,500 is possible in the short term. But this should not reverse the greater trend.” Until very recently, bullish Bitcoin price analysis articles with analysis from top Russian industry figures were restricted to the fringes of the domestic media. However, Moscow’s recent crypto pivot appears to have changed all that . The Kremlin is now seemingly happy to use Bitcoin and altcoins as a payment tool for international trade. It is also keen for industrial miners to work in parts of the country that have surplus power resources.

Roland Busch, the chief executive officer of Siemens, and Christian Klein, the head of SAP, have already gone public, saying that Europe’s current laws are too narrow and could impede innovation on the continent. In a joint interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Busch and Klein said the EU needed a smarter, more agile mode of administrative governance, which did not stifle but encouraged the spirit of innovation. They insisted that, though safety and transparency in AI are important, how current laws are being drafted makes it difficult for European companies to compete with international counterparts. Europe is confronted with stiff global competition, especially from the US and China, and one of the biggest obstacles preventing the size and strength of its companies from catching up is viewed as excessive regulation. The two CEOs say that without change, the EU will fall further behind in the global competition to develop cutting-edge AI and digital technology. Siemens CEO warns EU AI rules could stifle innovation and burden businesses The EU’s AI Act , adopted into law in 2023, is central to the tech leader’s concerns. The Act will govern the development and use of artificial intelligence by classifying artificial intelligence systems into four levels of risk: unacceptable risk, high risk, substantial risk, and low risk. Companies must follow data usage, transparency, and safety rules depending on the category. Roland Busch added that overlapping regulations (including the EU’s Data Act) result in confusion and unnecessary extra burden. Its rulebook, known as the Data Act, sets strict boundaries on how firms can use consumer and corporate data—boundaries Busch says are “toxic” to creating modern digital business models. Current laws are seen as stifling growth rather than supporting it, with concerns that Europe is imposing heavy regulations too early in the innovation process. Curiously, unlike several tech giants, including Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and Meta, which have endorsed open letters to the EU encouraging a delay of the AI Act, Busch didn’t support these efforts. He said those letters didn’t go far enough and didn’t contain substantive reform proposals. Siemens and SAP urge EU to unlock data access Europe’s challenge isn’t infrastructure or computing power, said Christian Klein, co-chief executive of SAP, but rather the region’s difficulty accessing and using the already created data. An increasing number of people worry that too much attention is being paid to building data centers, when the real change needed would be in reforming how data is managed and repurposed. Without firm data governance leadership, the best information in the world may not make a difference. “We are sitting on a treasure trove of data in Europe, but we are not yet able to tap into it,” Busch told the newspaper. “It’s not access to computing capacity that we’re currently lacking, but the release of resources.” Both CEOs say Europe should focus on opening up data while protecting users’ privacy. Only then, they say, can the continent truly compete with other regions moving aggressively to invest in artificial intelligence. If the EU revises its approach now, it can still make the global tech race its own with a greater emphasis on enabling innovation and less on pre-emptive counteraction. In the run-up to the passing of the EU AI Act, Siemens and SAP had been among those registering concern over its potential impact on European competitiveness. The two companies had previously warned in a joint letter, addressed to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Europe’s antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, that the proposed Data Act could compound Europe’s vulnerability by enforcing the sharing of key business data.

BTC is currently trading above $121,000 as of midday Hong Kong time, according to CoinDesk market data. The move follows President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 30% tariff on the EU and Mexico, starting Aug. 1, and marks a bullish resolution to roughly 48 hours of choppy price action that allowed overbought signals from short-duration indicators to reset to bullish. The focus now shifts to the U.S. inflation data due this week, which is expected to show the cost of living ticked up in June against the backdrop of Trump's trade war. According to FactSet, economists expect that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.25% on a monthly basis in June, equating to 2.6% annualized growth. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy, is forecast to have risen 0.3% monthly and 3% on an annualized basis. Risk assets, including BTC, may wobble a bit if inflation accelerates, delaying the Fed rate cut. That said, the downside could be limited given the strong momentum in terms of corporate adoption of BTC, ETF inflows and positive regulatory outlook in the U.S. According to John Glover, CEO of Ledn, BTC's rally has legs and prices could rise to $136,000 by the year-end. ""We have finally broken to new highs, which confirms that the dip to $96k in late June satisfied the wave (ii) pullback (yellow line) within the larger Wave 5 (orange line),"" Glover said in an email. ""While this doesn’t change the ultimate target of circa $136k to complete this bull run, it does likely reduce the time it will take to complete. I was previously looking for this in Q1 of 2026, but now it looks likely to hit $136k by year-end,"" he added.",Markets|Markets|Bitcoin|Top Stories|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-14 03:45:39

Through this partnership, METABORA will distribute Web3 games via the LINE Messenger–based Dapp Portal, expanding its reach in the Web3 gaming space. The Dapp Portal is a platform built on the KAIA ecosystem that offers Mini Dapps (decentralized applications) directly within the LINE Messenger app. Users can enjoy a variety of Mini Dapps—ranging from games to social features—without needing to install separate applications. Since its launch in January this year, the platform has garnered significant attention, surpassing 100 million cumulative users. Through this new partnership, METABORA and LINE NEXT will work closely to accelerate the growth of the Mini Dapp’s gaming ecosystem. Leveraging its network of development partners and global experience in game development and publishing, METABORA will supply Web3 games to the Dapp Portal. LINE NEXT will expand accessibility to Web3 games and support marketing of these games through its platform. As part of the collaboration, METABORA will also expand the utility of its BORA token within the LINE Messenger–based Mini Dapp ecosystem. The company plans to implement a payment infrastructure that enables users to purchase in-game items currently planned for upcoming titles to be released under the BORA brand. Additionally, METABORA will apply Gas Abstraction technology, allowing users to make in-app purchases with BORA without needing KAIA tokens to cover gas fees. This feature is expected to be fully implemented in the second half of the year. By expanding the utility of the BORA token, METABORA aims to elevate its value beyond the confines of the BORA Chain, laying the groundwork for broader integration across the Web3 ecosystem. In addition, METABORA and LINE NEXT plan to continue their collaboration by researching and developing infrastructure to support the use of stable coins such as USDT, further enhancing the Web3 gaming experience within the LINE ecosystem centered on the Dapp Portal. Lim Youngjun, Co-CEO of METABORA, said, “We’re pleased to partner with LINE NEXT, a company making remarkable strides in the global Web3 gaming market with its vast user base. Through our strong network of development partners, we will carefully select and bring high-quality games to the Dapp Portal, working together to create a leading example of Web3 gaming reaching a mainstream audience.” Kim Woosuk, CSO at LINE NEXT, said, “Through this partnership with METABORA, we look forward to creating a major success case for Mini Dapp. Moving forward, we will continue working closely together across multiple fronts, including enabling USDT stablecoin support to improve game onboarding and the overall user payment environment.” About METABORA METABORA is a casual game developer and the service operator of the blockchain platform BORA. The BORA ecosystem brings together partners across various industries—ranging from tokenomics and content to blockchain technology—driving innovation and collaboration across games, sports, and entertainment. Through the BORA Network, METABORA operates the BORA Portal, which offers GameFi-optimized services such as NFT trading, token conversion, and DeFi features. With BORA listed on major global cryptocurrency exchanges, METABORA continues to enhance accessibility and expand the usability of its content across the Web3 landscape.

The sudden breakout has doubled the cryptocurrency’s value in the past year, driven by renewed institutional interest, favorable policy winds and growing excitement around upcoming legislation in the US. It last traded at $120,866 as of press time, and is up over 14% in the last month. Bitcoin just hit $119,000 for the first time. 10 years ago it was trading at $290.

According to CoinGlass data , more than $276m in leveraged positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone. Of that, $183m came from short traders caught off guard by Bitcoin’s sharp climb. Liquidations in Bitcoin totaled $83.85m, followed by $49.54m in Ethereum . Several altcoins, including XRP , XLM and Solana , also faced heavy liquidations as price swings intensified across the market. In the past day, nearly 100,000 traders were wiped out, with the largest single liquidation order taking place on Bybit for the BTC-USDT pair, worth $2.86m. Overall, short sellers bore the brunt, with more than 91% of all liquidated positions skewed to the downside. Markets Watch Closely as US Debates Crypto Regulation at Pivotal Moment Investor optimism has grown in anticipation of Crypto Week, set to begin July 14. Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives will review three major crypto bills — the CLARITY Act, the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The outcome could reshape the legal foundation of digital assets in the world’s largest economy. Bitcoin Economic Calendar for the week of July 14th (""Crypto Week""): Monday: Start of the Tornado Cash Trial, U.S. House of Representatives meetings to review the ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State"" Act, the ""Digital Asset Market Clarity"" Act of 2025, and the ""GENIUS"" Act Tuesday:… pic.twitter.com/SARipkbi80 — Ledn (@hodlwithLedn) July 13, 2025 Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, along with the Trump administration, are backing the push for clearer crypto rules. If the bills pass, they could reshape how digital assets are regulated in the US, with ripple effects on markets, big investors and the country’s role in global finance. Despite some lawmakers pushing back through an “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” campaign, broader sentiment remains bullish. Rising ETF Interest and Policy Clarity Spark Talk of a New Crypto Cycle The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $3.86 trillion, supported by ETF inflows and Ethereum’s move back above $3,000. Altcoins like ADA and XRP have also shown strength, lifting market confidence. Meanwhile, decentralized finance is gaining fresh momentum. Last week, the total value locked across DeFi protocols jumped by more than $20b. As a result, the sector’s TVL now stands at roughly $176b. This surge reflects growing trust in on-chain financial solutions. Traders are now watching key macro and political developments. Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of new US tariffs has surprised many analysts, who point to a maturing market. With ETF demand rising and legislative clarity in sight, some believe this breakout may mark the start of a longer-term uptrend.

Meme coins are buzzing, and platforms with real use are gaining traction. Dogecoin is grabbing attention thanks to Elon Musk’s growing voice in both crypto and politics. On the flip side, Pi Network is feeling the pressure as it deals with market drops and token unlocks. But the surprise story may be BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app. With more than 2 million users mining BDAG from their phones, it’s building serious momentum. As ease of use and real-world interaction shape the current cycle, BlockDAG (BDAG) could be taking a lead role. Here’s a look at how Dogecoin, Pi Network, and BlockDAG stack up in 2025, and why they’re now part of the buzz around the best crypto coins for 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Jump: Musk Buzz Drives New High Hopes Momentum is building again for Dogecoin (DOGE), backed by bullish moves on the charts. The meme coin broke a long downtrend and jumped more than 5%, now trading at $0.171. It’s holding support near $0.166, while whale activity is increasing, pointing to stronger market interest. Elon Musk’s support through the America Party is giving DOGE more attention, with some expecting broader use ahead. Its loyal community also keeps the pace strong. Analysts now say the Dogecoin (DOGE) price jump could continue toward $0.25 by year-end, and even $1 if momentum holds. Talk around a Dogecoin ETF is adding more excitement to the outlook. Pi Network Price Faces Pressure The Pi network price is under pressure despite early signs of promise. While mining on the network has grown, recent token unlocks have added to the supply and pushed the price lower. Pi is now priced at $0.4710, with a market cap near $3.59 billion, but current price movement shows a bearish pattern. Unless Pi holds the key support line at $0.45, more losses could follow. The Pi network price will need a successful mainnet launch, solid use cases, and stronger tokenomics to bounce back. If those pieces fall into place, there’s a path to recovery. For now, it remains one of the popular crypto coins to watch, but traders are cautious heading into the rest of 2025. BlockDAG X1 Miner App Changes the Way People Join Crypto BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app is turning mobile mining into something anyone can try. This cloud-based app makes it possible to mine BDAG coins straight from a phone. There’s no heavy battery drain and no data overload. It runs on a smart, energy-saving algorithm that keeps mining smooth wherever you are. The app works worldwide and is available on both iOS and Android with a simple, clean interface. What makes X1 stand out is how users stay active. By inviting others through a referral code, they can speed up their mining rate. A single tap on the lightning button each day boosts rewards. Users can track their rank and unlock fun extras as they keep mining, making the whole thing feel more like a game with real value. People can mine up to 20 BDAG coins per day using the app, and the response has been huge. Over 2 million users have joined already. The presale has raised more than $338 million, heading toward a $600 million goal. So far, 23.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold across 29 batches. Since its presale launch, BDAG’s price has climbed by 2,660%, rising from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0276 in the current one. Still, a limited-time price of $0.0016 is available now, keeping interest high as more people start mining ahead of BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. Closing Thoughts: What’s Moving in 2025 So far in 2025, the Dogecoin (DOGE) price jump and strong support from its community are keeping it near the top of watchlists. Forecasts are optimistic, and there’s growing talk of wider adoption. Pi network price is more unpredictable. The network is expanding, but it’s also facing pressure from rising supply and token selling. Even with challenges, Pi Network could bounce back if it stays on track with its roadmap and proves useful in the real world. On the other hand, BlockDAG X1 is giving people an easy way into crypto mining. It’s attracting millions by being simple, low-energy, and fun to use. These three projects show just how different the paths can be. For those watching the best crypto coins for 2025 , this mix of trends, tools, and ideas is one to keep an eye on.

While events like Gate.io removing Pump.fun’s page days ahead of the public sale sparked worries, the meme coin generator raised $500 million within 12 minutes as PUMP saw staggering demand. The massive numbers raised eyebrows, with excitement dominating the Solana ecosystem amidst the hype. However, PUMP failed to sustain the momentum, plummeting since the Saturday ICO. It trades at $0.01599 after a 38.53% decline from $0.0261. Chart by Coinmarketcap Furthermore, experts are noticing cracks in the altcoin’s breakout moment.

The ICO saw massive demand as users rushed to grab PUMP at $0.004 per asset. While scheduled to take up to three days, Pump.fun’s public sale lasted less than 15 minutes. Nevertheless, issues surfaced as the dust cooled. The project had sold only 12.5% of PUMP’s total supply, raising questions about the missing 2.5%. The Launchpad hasn’t clarified the allocation change. Meanwhile, the lack of official updates has triggered various speculations about whether the Pump.fun team sold the assets privately, held them, or reallocated them somewhere else. Gate.io’s pre-launch drama Pump.fun’s public sale raised concerns after crypto exchange Gate.io unexpectedly removed PUMP’s listing page days before the event. The trading platform had earlier launched a presale for the new tokens. However, it later refunded investors without detailed explanations. Surprisingly, users had purchased PUMP tokens worth $5 million despite the listing cancellation. That added another layer of confusion around the presale coordination and execution. What’s next for ICO participants? All tokens that users purchase remain non-transferable and non-tradable. The team confirmed that participants would receive their assets within three days, but they can only sell or transfer the PUMP allocation after the distribution phase. During the next 48-72 hours, all tokens purchased via token.pump.fun or participating exchanges will be transferred to the participants. The tokens will initially be untradable and untransferable while the distribution phase is carried out. Once the distribution phase is complete, the tokens will become tradable and transferable. The restriction is likely to calm investors as many remain anxious about PUMP’s price actions once trading begins. The existing controversy could trigger massive dumps from early investors. That would catalyze enormous price dips for the new meme token. Meanwhile, Solscan data shows all six participating CEX, including Kraken, Bitget, and Bybit, have received their PUMP allocations. The upcoming sessions will tell whether Pump.fun’s ICO debut raises red flags, or is it just a bumpy launch?

He emphasized the significant systemic risks that these stablecoins pose to the financial system. In an interview with The Sunday Times , Bailey said he “would much rather” prefer tokenized bank deposits over private stablecoins. He said that stablecoins would take “money out of the banking system” and the “credit creation world”. By advocating for tokenized bank deposits, Bailey is promoting a more integrated and regulated digital financial system, aligning with existing banking practices. “I would much rather [banks] go down the tokenized deposit streets and say, how do we digitize our money, particularly in payments,” he noted. His comments come at a time when stablecoin markets have grown from $125 billion less than two years ago to around $255 billion today, according to a latest BIS report . UK Would Not Adopt CBDC, Bailey Disagrees With the US and ECB’s Crypto Take Furthermore, the British central banker stated that England should not adopt a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ), also known as a ‘digital pound.’ He said that it would be “sensible” for the UK to rather work towards digitizing deposits. Andrew Bailey was recently appointed as the new chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international financial regulator. Additionally, he openly disagreed with the Trump administration’s backing of stablecoins. “I would say that the US is going towards stablecoins. The European Central Bank is going towards central bank digital currency. Neither of them is going towards tokenising deposits.” Trump Poised for Quick Stablecoin Win The US House Financial Services Committee announced ‘Crypto Week,’ starting Monday, to consider three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. The US lawmakers noted that mid-July will be 'Crypto Week' to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets and protect financial privacy. #USLawmakers #CryptoWeek #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/yhbiz4tMwr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 4, 2025 In June, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech at the White House Digital Asset Summit that stablecoins would “reinforce dollar supremacy.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also emphasized the need for stablecoin regulation , noting the importance of protecting consumers. However, according to BOE’s governor Bailey, stablecoins need to be looked at closely through lens. “Stablecoins are proposed to have the characteristics of money. That money is a medium of exchange. Therefore, they really do have to have the characteristics of money and they have to maintain their nominal value.” He also expressed concerns that the spread of stablecoins would undermine their sovereign control over money. Besides stablecoins, Bailey noted that the extreme volatility of Bitcoin shows that it is “unbacked asset.” “It’s not money, it doesn’t have the function of money, and if you’re going to buy it, please buy it with your eyes open,” he advised users.

Key Takeaways: The Czech National Bank purchased $18.1 million in Coinbase shares, marking its first crypto investment. The move reflects CNB’s strategy to diversify reserves and increase exposure to digital assets. Coinbase’s stock has surged 56% year-to-date amid market rallies and strategic acquisitions. According to a recent Form 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the central bank acquired 51,732 shares of Coinbase Global, marking its first disclosed stake in the major crypto exchange. As of the end of June, those shares were valued at $18.1 million and have since climbed to nearly $20 million based on recent closing prices. Czech Central Bank Embraces Digital Assets to Diversify Reserves The move reflects the CNB’s growing openness toward digital assets and its ambition to diversify reserve holdings. Earlier this year, Governor Aleš Michl expressed intentions to consider expanding the central bank’s portfolio to include bitcoin and other crypto-related assets. Michl told the Financial Times that the CNB may allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion ($163.5 billion) reserves into Bitcoin, pending board approval. The recent Coinbase purchase aligns with this broader push toward integrating crypto assets into traditional finance. Coinbase, which made history by becoming the first crypto company added to the S&P 500 index in May 2025, has seen its stock rise sharply this year. Despite a challenging first quarter marked by a 10% drop in revenue and a 95% plunge in net income, largely driven by a $596 million paper loss on crypto holdings, the company’s shares have rebounded. The Czech National Bank added 51,732 shares of Coinbase (COIN) in Q2 2025, worth over $18M, marking its first position in the crypto exchange. It also increased its stake in Palantir (PLTR) by 49,135 shares, now holding 519,950 total. pic.twitter.com/gx9be2eToa — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) July 13, 2025 Year-to-date, Coinbase stock is up nearly 56%, fueled by a strong rally in crypto markets and the company’s aggressive expansion efforts. In recent months, Coinbase has been actively increasing its market presence. The exchange announced its $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit , a leading crypto derivatives platform, in May. More recently, Coinbase acquired Liquifi , a token management platform that bolsters its capabilities in token cap table management, vesting, and regulatory compliance. Coinbase Named TIME ‘Disruptor’ TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. The accolade highlights Coinbase’s aggressive advocacy in Washington and its expanding influence in the crypto sector. Coinbase’s stock has surged 42% year-to-date, climbing from around $303 to a high near $382. The rise followed the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and Coinbase’s historic inclusion in the S&P 500 in May. TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator. The company plans to establish its European headquarters in Luxembourg. Additionally, Coinbase is seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities, which would position it as a competitor to popular retail trading platforms like Robinhood and WeBull.
