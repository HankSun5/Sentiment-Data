Lise has secured a DLT TSS license from the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, a regulatory sandbox allowing blockchain-based financial infrastructures to operate within traditional legal frameworks. The milestone, achieved in coordination with the Banque de France, ESMA, AMF, and the European Central Bank, positions Lise as the first French market infrastructure to merge the roles of a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) and a Central Securities Depository (CSD) on a single distributed ledger. This integration allows trading and post-trading operations to occur instantly, eliminating settlement delays, reducing counterparty risk, and potentially allowing 24/7 trading, something unprecedented in European capital markets. Lise Open Tokenized IPO Path for Small and Mid-Cap Firms Lise seeks to open the public markets to small and mid-cap enterprises (SMEs and midcaps) that have traditionally faced barriers to going public. “This is a true breakthrough for capital markets,” said Mark Kepeneghian , CEO of Lise. Backed by major institutions including BNP Paribas, Bpifrance, and CACEIS, Lise is a subsidiary of Kriptown, a French fintech that has long described itself as a “neo-exchange” for startups and growing firms. Analysts say Lise’s approval could make France a European leader in tokenized securities, setting the stage for a future where IPOs, equity trading, and investor participation happen entirely on-chain. Additionally, the exchange plans to host its first IPOs in early 2026, setting the stage for a new model of digital public offerings that merge traditional finance with blockchain efficiency. The launch arrives amid a broader wave of tokenization in global finance. Data from RWA.xyz shows that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has surged past $33.9 billion, up over 10% in the past month. Private credit leads the sector with $17.5 billion, followed by U.S. Treasury debt at $8.3 billion and commodities at $2.8 billion, boosted by strong growth in tokenized gold markets. Source: RWA.xyz Ethereum dominates the RWA space, hosting $12.1 billion in tokenized assets, about 57.5% of the market, compared to $686 million on Solana, which is growing quickly but still far behind. The rising adoption of tokenized assets reflects growing institutional interest, particularly as traditional financial players seek to modernize infrastructure. Can Lise’s Tokenized Exchange Rewrite How Europe Does IPOs? Lise’s model seeks to integrate trading and settlement within a unified blockchain system. Transactions occur instantly, bypassing the traditional multi-day clearing and settlement process. For issuers, especially small and mid-sized enterprises, this structure drastically lowers the costs of going public and simplifies shareholder management, dividend distribution, and governance. The platform also allows retail and institutional investors to invest directly in European businesses, both during IPOs and in the secondary market. By combining regulated market oversight with blockchain efficiency, Lise hopes to make investing in the real economy more transparent, liquid, and continuous. For decades, IPOs have relied on intermediaries such as underwriters and investment banks to handle risk assessment, pricing, and distribution. Source: The European Securities and Markets Authority These processes are often expensive and time-consuming. Lise’s model seeks to “rewrite how IPOs work” by removing many of those barriers, replacing legacy systems with blockchain technology that supports instant issuance, settlement, and custody. The platform’s DLT foundation also aligns with the European Union’s DLT Pilot Regime , which took effect in March 2023. The regime provides a legal framework for trading and settlement of financial instruments using blockchain technology under MiFID II rules. Lise’s Approval Adds to Global Push for Tokenized Markets Lise’s licensing follows a broader wave of traditional financial exchanges experimenting with tokenization. In September, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) launched its Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI) , a blockchain-based platform developed with Microsoft, to support tokenized fund issuance and settlement. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has launched a blockchain-based infrastructure platform for private funds, marking a significant step. #London #Crypto https://t.co/SYbuYmTdWz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Around the same time, Nasdaq submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval to trade tokenized versions of stocks under equivalent regulatory protections as traditional equities. Meanwhile, crypto firms such as Robinhood , Kraken, and Gemini have already begun offering tokenized stock trading in Europe , while others, including Coinbase and Dinari, are pursuing U.S. regulatory clearance . The retail-focused tokenized stock market has grown rapidly, reaching $412 million in value, up from just a few million last year. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) warned global regulators that tokenized stocks “mimic” equities without offering shareholder rights or market trading safeguards. #WFE #TokenizedStocks #BlockchainTokens https://t.co/3UxpywsfMs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 26, 2025 However, regulators remain cautious. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) recently urged global watchdogs , including the SEC and ESMA, to tighten oversight on tokenized equities, warning that many of these instruments lack shareholder rights or proper safeguards.

The move gives the altcoin access to Coinbase’s user base of over 105 million investors, positioning it for major U.S. market exposure. Assets added to the roadmap today: BNB (BNB) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets (@CoinbaseMarkets) October 15, 2025 Coinbase follows Kraken’s recent BNB listing, extending an olive branch to a rival chain in a testament to growing market demand for the Binance-native utility token. Commenting on the trend, ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao noted that “not listing it is a loss for the exchange themselves,” citing BNB’s strong liquidity, volume, and ecosystem. The move does appear to be strategic. Binance Smart Chain has processed over 500 million transactions in the past 30 days, marking a 151% month-over-month increase. Exchanges seem eager to capture a share of that momentum. Binance is having its own “supercycle” moment, driven by a boom in its native meme coin market. BNB Price Prediction: Binance Coin Eyes New Highs on Fresh Demand Deepened exposure in U.S. markets could drive the demand Binance Coin needs to realize a 15-month ascending triangle pattern breakout. While the post-breakout momentum had stalled with last week’s market crash, momentum indicators put the structure back in play. BNB / USDT 1-day chart, 15-month ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. While the MACD histogram’s wide gap below the signal line suggests the downtrend persists, the RSI has found a strong footing with a higher low above the signal line. Buy pressure remains strong. If this strength persists, a decisive trend shift could put the patterns $1,650 breakout target back in focus, continuing into new price discovery in a 40% move. In not, a retest of psychological support around $1,000 stands as a credible local bottom. Long-term, U.S. interest rate cuts could stimulate risk appetite into 2026. With growing capital rotation into meme coins, BNB could extend another 150% to $3,000 under stronger demand conditions. PepeNode: You Don’t Need to Pick the Right Coin to Profit This Cycle While the Binance supercycle is shining a spotlight on meme coins again, volatility is making them unpredictable. But what if you could mine them instead of rolling the dice on the perfect entry? With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, stack virtual rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is accelerating fast. The presale has already topped $1.8 million, with early stakers still earning up to 700% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. With capital flowing back into high-risk assets, PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture meme coin upside, without the risk.

Together with XRP, it is the top presale funding raiser project garnering institutional interest. As we observe XRP’s bullish trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a strong contender for investors seeking high returns in this uncertain market. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Demand and Retail Fear Catalyst XRP is finding solid support around the $3 mark as investor interest grows. Most importantly, its potential to get approved for ETFs is behind the price surge. The above developments indicate a shift from retail-driven fear to institutional-driven demand, which is often a strong driver for significant price increases. At present, the XRP price is hovering around $3.00. Furthermore, the coin has the capacity to overcome key resistances. Moreover, analysts are projecting the price of XRP to skyrocket to $5.00. The bullish case for XRP is strengthened by growing expectations of XRP ETF approvals, which could unleash large amounts of liquidity and institutional inflows. Market experts believe that a successful authorisation of the XRP ETF could lead to the XRP token’s price soaring to about $5.00 by 2025. Institutional Demand and XRP’s Future XRP is poised to attract growing interest from institutions, with some investors speculating that it could become a primary target for large-scale institutional investment. It is due to its usefulness in cross-border payments and growing adoption by the financial establishment. Institutional players are considering adding XRP to their portfolios, and experts are awaiting approval of XRP ETFs. A Promising Presale Opportunity Amid Market Uncertainty Along with XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE has adopted the successful presale strategy that brought significant growth to various projects in the past. MAGACOIN FINANCE recently held its presale, which raised over $16 million in funds. Thousands of investors, including whales from established coins, purchased MAGACOIN tokens. Due to its deflationary tokenomics and the demand for its Ethereum-based DeFi offerings, this early-stage project is gaining traction. Experts believe returns between 10x and 100x post listing. A few even predict even more significant growth if the project continues to expand as it already has. Conclusion XRP is likely to see a substantial price surge and could move towards $5 or more by 2025 due to institutional interest and ETF approval. The bearish trend has shifted from retail-driven fear to institution-driven demand. This paves the way for a hefty recovery. So, XRP is one of the top altcoins to track in the coming months. Likewise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be one of the strongest presales of 2025, with solid institutional backing, deflationary tokenomics, and a safe and secure project, audited and trusted. With vibrant activity emerging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, it is now a good investment to add to your crypto portfolio. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as major proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

Binance Secures Regulatory Sign-Off Based on reports , South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit approved the change of major shareholder on October 15, 2025. The deal gives Binance control of a majority stake it first bought in February 2023 — a 67% holding — which had been held up by what turned into a near two-year regulatory review. The purchase was originally framed as a way to stabilize Gopax after the exchange ran into trouble tied to its GoFi product and fallout from the collapse of a US counterpart. For users who had limited access to funds, the takeover was presented as a fix to help restore withdrawals and overdue interest payments. What The Approval Means For Gopax And Users Reports have disclosed that the FIU’s decision came after regulators reviewed Gopax’s revised business plan and Binance’s responses to anti-money-laundering concerns. The US regulatory action against Binance, including a reported $4.3 billion settlement over past compliance failures, was cited by local officials as a factor that had to be considered during the review. With the approval, Gopax is expected to move more quickly to rebuild customer confidence and to meet domestic rules that apply to exchanges operating in South Korea. Market Reaction And Competition Local exchanges are watching closely. Upbit and Bithumb dominate trading volume in South Korea, and both will likely compete harder on fees and services now that a Binance-backed platform is officially back. Traders reacted with a mix of caution and interest. Some investors said they welcome added choice. Others said they plan to wait and see how Gopax implements corporate governance and compliance steps before moving funds. Why It Took Time Reports show the approval process dragged on because regulators were focused on governance, executive changes, and how funds and KYC systems would be handled under Binance’s control. The gap between the initial purchase in February 2023 and the October 2025 sign-off stretched over more than two years. That delay reflected both local caution and the broader scrutiny Binance has faced in multiple countries. Next Steps And Oversight According to officials familiar with the matter, Gopax will now need to implement the specific compliance measures it pledged to regulators. The exchange will be monitored, and further checks could be applied as part of ongoing oversight.

Analyst Says The Clock Is Ticking,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fate-sealed-october-31/,"Bitcoin slipped below three-day Ichimoku cloud support on Wednesday, prompting market technician Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) to flag the first decisive warning for bulls while outlining a tight sequence of conditional signals into month-end. Sharing a chart on X, he wrote: “Bulls finally lost the 3D kumo support which is the first clear red flag to look for.” He cautioned that the breakdown does not guarantee a straight-line slide, adding that “the kumo is very thick here which means the price can be very spiky/turbulent and even further down moves may be ‘bumpy’ for bears with bounces etc…” Why Bitcoin’s Next Bull Window Opens October 31 The analyst framed the next tests through the lens of Ichimoku’s time-price structure and the weekly baseline. “Probably the clearest indication for now to watch for would be the time cycles and whether the weekly Kijun Sen will hold,” he said, specifying levels at $105.700 for the current week and “$109,559” for next week. In Ichimoku methodology, the weekly Kijun Sen functions as a mean-reversion axis; sustained closes below it typically confirm momentum deterioration, while defenses of the line can reassert trend control without requiring an immediate new high. Dr Cat’s near-term line in the sand on daily closing conditions is clear: “If today closes above $113K we don’t have an indication for an immediate danger of a bearish continuation.” That threshold sits alongside his broader stance that separates time horizons. He reiterated that his “Long term = Bullish with the same targets I’ve shared many times,” but recast the shorter outlook as “Short to mid term = Neutral, range between ~$100K and prev ATH.” Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Now Control 44% Of Realized Cap, Highest Ever Rather than declaring a hard bottom, he now views sentiment as a risk factor in its own right: “I said recently that the bottom should be put by the 13th of October — and even already in. But today after observing the sentiment I have strong concerns about red flags… I haven’t seen in a very long time so much mass bullish confidence and even arrogance across Twitter. So at this point I will simply not try to guess whether the bottom is in or not.” He mapped out escalation points if downside resumes. “Short term bearish triggers would be a renew of the crash low briefly after the 13th of October, mid-term bearish trigger: the same but after the 19th, even better after the 26th of October.” In other words, a swift retest immediately after October 13 would raise short-term alarms, while fresh lows registered after October 19 or October 26 would strengthen the case that the corrective phase has more to run. He also downplayed the odds of a straight snapback, warning that “even if the bottom is in, a V-shaped recovery remains extremely unlikely.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Reset Complete? Ostium Foresees Explosive Move To $133,000 Against that caution, Dr Cat still identifies a specific window for bullish validation. Anchoring to Ichimoku’s Chikou Span alignment on the daily and three-day timeframes, he said “the earliest window of opportunity for a bull breakout above ATH is the 31st of October.” That timing caveat is critical: the October 31 marker is a first possible opening, not a guarantee, contingent on price stabilizing around or above the weekly Kijun and avoiding those date-based bearish triggers. The shared chart underscores the nuance: price slipping beneath the three-day cloud is a mechanical negative, but the thickness of the cloud and proximity of higher-timeframe supports imply choppy discovery rather than a clean trend resolution before the end of the month. Taken together, Dr Cat’s framework is binary but conditional. A daily close back above $113,000 would blunt “immediate” continuation risk and keep the weekly Kijun defenses in play at $105,700 this week and $109,559 next week. Failure to hold those rails — particularly if accompanied by renewed lows after the 19th or 26th — would harden the corrective bias and defer any credible breakout attempt. As the calendar tightens, the market now has a clear checklist into October 31, when, per his model, the first “window of opportunity” opens for a move that could credibly threaten and surpass the previous all-time high. At press time, Bitcoin stood at $111,479.

The deal throws Ripple right into the heart of the $120 trillion corporate treasury market, giving it direct access to some of the largest companies on Earth and their global capital operations through GTreasury, which has reportedly been building treasury management systems for more than 40 years. This is a full-blown takeover paid entirely in XRP. GTreasury is known for running complex cash forecasting, risk management, and compliance tools for major corporations. Ripple now owns all of that. And instead of tweaking the current system, the company is trying to replace it with something faster and programmable. No more waiting days for cross-border settlements. No more capital locked in silos. Ripple says it’s building a system where money moves instantly, and corporate treasurers can actually use their funds when and where they need them. Ripple adds GTreasury’s enterprise clients to its crypto rails Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, said the existing infrastructure has been a bottleneck for far too long. “For too long, money has been stuck in slow, outdated payments systems and infrastructure, causing unnecessary delays, high costs, and roadblocks to entering new markets—problems that blockchain technologies are ideally suited to solve.” Brad believes this merger is about freeing trapped capital. He said combining Ripple’s crypto infrastructure with GTreasury’s treasury systems gives teams the tools to process payments in real time and find new ways to grow. GTreasury’s boss Renaat Ver Eecke called the move a “watershed moment” for corporate finance. “We have focused on providing the most compliant and feature-rich solutions to corporations around the globe,” Renaat said. “Now, by joining Ripple, we are accelerating our vision from managing capital to activating it.” Renaat pointed to the mix of their forecasting and risk tools with Ripple’s speed, global crypto network, and digital asset tools as the reason treasurers will now be able to handle liquidity, payments, and risk across the digital economy. With the deal, Ripple is giving corporate finance teams new tools to hold, move, and invest crypto assets across borders and time zones. One of the first key integrations will allow clients to route capital into the global repo market using prime broker Hidden Road, which Ripple also acquired earlier this year. That gives companies a way to actually earn on short-term idle capital, which is a massive pain point in traditional systems. Ripple accelerates crypto push with third acquisition in 2025 This is Ripple’s third major acquisition in 2025, following its takeovers of Hidden Road and Rail, a platform that focuses on stablecoin infrastructure. The goal here is to absorb the existing stack and wire it directly into Ripple’s crypto rails, the press release said . The deal with GTreasury is expected to close in a few months, pending regulatory approvals. Until then, both teams are already starting to work on the technical integration needed to merge systems and bring real-time liquidity to the enterprise. Brad later posted on X to hammer the point home: “Today, Ripple is breaking into the $120T corporate treasury payments market with the $1B acquisition of GTreasury. The past few years have reminded this industry why payments, first and foremost, is THE primary use case for crypto and blockchain. Payments are where Ripple first started for exactly these reasons—the infrastructure is complex, siloed and inefficient, but as we know, perfectly positioned to benefit from decentralized financial technologies.” He added that “astounding amounts of cash are trapped in outdated payments systems, creating friction, unnecessary costs, and barriers to entering new markets. GTreasury has been serving some of the most well known brands for decades—and now together with Ripple, we’ll be able to help CFOs manage all their assets, include stablecoins, tokenized deposits, etc at scale around the world, as well as put their idle capital to work with repo markets via Hidden Road. The opportunity is here, and we’re diving right in. It’s happening.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to BNY’s Q3 earnings report, net income rose to $1.34 billion, while earnings per share reached $1.88, up 25% from last year. The bank said total revenue hit a record $5.1 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year, with both Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services contributing to the growth, while the pre-tax margin came in at at 36%, and return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) surged to 25.6%. Chief Executive Officer Robin Vince said the company’s strategy is delivering measurable progress. “BNY delivered another quarter of strong results,” he said, adding that record revenue came from “broad-based growth across our platforms” and that its two core transformation programs are “showing results.” Robin pointed to a new commercial model that is helping the firm boost sales momentum and expand client solutions. He also said the company is integrating artificial intelligence across its operations, describing the latest version of BNY’s AI platform, Eliza, as “smarter, faster and easier to use.” BNY increases revenue, invests in efficiency Total fee revenue reached $3.64 billion, up 7%, driven by stronger client flows, higher market values, and a weaker U.S. dollar that benefited international operations. Investment and other revenue came in at $208 million, helped by disposal gains and other investment profits. Net interest income surged by 18% to $1.24 billion, supported by the reinvestment of maturing securities into higher-yield assets and balance sheet growth, though changes in deposit mix offset some of the gain. The bank reported a $7 million benefit from credit losses, driven by a more favorable macroeconomic outlook that outweighed higher reserves linked to commercial real estate exposure. Noninterest expense increased 4% to $3.24 billion, mainly from staff merit raises, investment spending, and a weaker dollar. These expenses were partly offset by efficiency savings, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%, said BNY. BNY’s average deposits reached $299 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while capital levels stayed strong. The Tier 1 leverage ratio held at 6.1%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stood at 11.7%, compared to 11.9% a year ago. The bank returned $1.2 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $381 million in dividends and $849 million in share repurchases, with a 92% payout ratio year-to-date. BNY faces lawsuit over Epstein-linked claims BNY’s assets under custody and administration surged by 11%, while assets under management totaled $2.1 trillion, flat from last year as inflows were offset by outflows. The earnings report claims that BNY’s liquidity remains stable, with an average liquidity coverage ratio of 112% and a net stable funding ratio of 130%, both exceeding regulatory minimums. But alongside the strong quarter, BNY did acknowledge that it now faces new legal pressure. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit against BNY and Bank of America, alleging they knowingly provided financial services that enabled Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street , Robin said, “We don’t think the suit has any merit, and we’re going to contest it vigorously.” Jane Doe is represented by Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, the same firms that previously secured $75 million and $290 million settlements from Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over similar claims.

Alongside its Solana product, Volatility Shares now oversees $781 million in AUM , showing that institutional demand for crypto-based investment vehicles is rising fast. As more financial giants roll out products like this, the case for higher XRP valuations continues to strengthen. XRP Price Prediction: Ongoing Accumulation Favors Big Upcoming Push to $10 XRP is down 13% over the past week , yet trading activity remains high, with $6 billion in volume over the past 24 hours, representing 4% of its circulating supply. Despite the pullback, XRP continues to hold within a key range between $2 and $3.65 , still awaiting a breakout while Ethereum and BNB Coin push into new all-time highs. This consolidation phase could be a sign of accumulation , not weakness — and all it may take is the right catalyst to send XRP soaring. A bullish RSI crossover above the 14-day moving average could be the early signal that a new leg up is coming. In the near term, a move to $10 looks realistic as institutional adoption gains pace. Over the longer term, a $100 XRP price prediction is still in play as Ripple expands its ecosystem and utility. At the same time, altcoin season has sparked major interest in early-stage presale plays like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Solana-powered Bitcoin Layer-2 that has already raised $23 million from investors eager to catch the next wave of breakout potential. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Kickstart a New Era for BTCFi BTC holders have waited for a long time for a project that solves the issues that have prevented Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem from further expanding. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first layer-2 scaling protocol for the top crypto, leveraging the efficiency and low transaction costs offered by the Solana network, along with smart contract support. Through the Hyper Bridge, BTC holders can safely send their tokens to a designated Bitcoin wallet and get the corresponding amount in the Hyper L2 to stake, lend, and earn yield on their assets through a suite of dApps built on this side chain. As top wallets and exchanges progressively embrace this solution, the demand for its native asset, $HYPER, should skyrocket, making Bitcoin Hyper one of the most attractive presales of the year. To buy $HYPER before its next price increase, head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

These three coins are all in a strong position fundamentally and technically, with Tether Gold in a particularly strong position to rise as traders seek safer havens. We look at the prospects for these coins in the article below, while we also take a look at one up-and-coming token that’s winning over lots of new investors. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Could Explode As Soon As ETFs Begin Launching XRP has declined by 2% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.45 representing a 13% loss in a week and a 19% drop in a month. On the other hand, XRP can still point to a 350% increase in the past year, during which it has made strong headway on the back of Ripple’s renewed growth. This annual gain gives it a great launchpad for further increases towards the end of the year, especially if the numerous XRP ETFs in waiting receive the go-ahead from the SEC. XRP ETFs would result in an explosion of demand for the altcoin, which is already popular among institutions, according to CoinShares data . And given its strong fundamentals, its oversold chart looks very bullish right now, in that it indicates that a big upwards correction could come soon. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both hit bottoms recently, signalling that XRP is trading at a big discount relative to recent levels. So sooner or later, buyers should swoop back in, something which they’re likely to do as and when the first ETFs launch. We could therefore see the XRP restore to $3 in November, while ETF volumes could push it beyond $5 by the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Tether Gold ($XAUT) – Waning Dollar Will Continue to Push Gold-Linked Token to New Highs In contrast to most other top-100 tokens, Tether Gold has risen today, moving to $4,254 and confirming a 5% increase in a week. XAUT has also risen by 15% in a month and by 59% in a year, with its rise coming as tariff uncertainty, inflation, and a declining dollar push more investors towards the safe haven of gold. And because XAUT is pegged 1:1 with gold, the token has risen accordingly, with more gains likely to come in the near and more distant future. Its chart today highlights how much momentum it has gathered over the past few weeks, particularly in September and October. Source: TradingView Normally, its elevated RSI and MACD would indicate overbuying, predicting that a correction may be coming soon. However, Tether Gold is not a normal asset, given its pegging to gold itself, so it will rise for as long as gold continues to rise. And given the ongoing instability of the global economy, there’s no immediate end to gold’s current rally. XAUT could reach $5,000 by the end of the year, while a longer-term target would be $7,000. Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whales Continue to Accumulate Oversold Meme Token Pepe has taken a 3% hit today, with its drop to $0.00000723 also marking a 21% decline in the past week and a 33% decline in the last 30 days. Worryingly, PEPE has also suffered a 31% drop in the past year, unlike most major tokens, which have risen (often substantially) in this period. This would suggest that Pepe may be experiencing a long-term decline, possibly as traders concentrate more on newer meme coins. That said, whales continue to buy Pepe every now and again , indicating that it has an enduring appeal as a vehicle for profits. Assuming that this trend will continue, its chart today would suggest that it could recover strongly soon, given its oversold indicators. Source: TradingView Its MACD has been declining over the past few days and looks like it could bottom out very soon, announcing the onset of a rebound. Because Pepe is a meme token, it will depend on a market-wide recovery to make its own recovery. Such a recovery may arrive with the launch of altcoin ETFs towards the end of the year, which could incite a bull rally. In this kind of context, PEPE will return to $0.000010 in November and will push towards $0.000030 by the end of the year. PEPENODE Raises $1.8 Million As Market Prepares for Launch of First Mine-to-Earn Token The crypto price prediction for the 3 coins above does look very promising, yet traders may also want to diversify into newer tokens, since these can often outperform during bull periods. One possibility may be to look at presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally hard when they list for the first time. One of the most interesting presale coins available right now is PEPENDOE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its increasingly popular sale. It's always where you least expect it.. But with PEPENODE you can ALWAYS expect bigger and better nodes https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/2TYP9c3cJv — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 16, 2025 The main reason for the growing interest in PEPENODE is that it’s the market’s first-ever mine-to-earn token. What this means is that its platform provides users with the ability to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, from which they can earn rewards in other tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. By using the PEPENODE token to buy more virtual nodes, users can earn greater rewards. As such, there’s a real incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, which could rise consistently in price as a result of sustained demand. Holders of PEPENODE will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, while investors can buy it now by going to the coin’s official website. It’s currently selling for $0.001105, although there’s every chance that it will eclipse this price once it lists.

He emphasized that Binance has consistently listed all digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, suggesting that XRP’s strength and size warranted continued support despite regulatory pressures. Strong Projects Do Not Need to Pay for Listings CZ’s comments follow recent debates about Binance’s listing requirements. In a separate post, he stated that solid blockchain projects do not need to pay to get listed, arguing that teams focused on innovation and long-term value creation are more likely to attract exchange support. Need a listing fee (sarcasm) I believe Binance listed all top coins over $100 billion market cap. Never delisted XRP (when they were attacked) either. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 15, 2025 His remark came after Limitless Labs CEO CJ Hetherington publicly criticized Binance’s alleged conditions for securing an early “alpha listing”, a form of preliminary access to spot trading on the exchange. Hetherington claimed that Binance demanded a 4% token allocation for user airdrops, an additional 1% for marketing, a $250,000 security deposit, and a further $2 million in BNB as collateral for listing. According to Hetherington, these terms were unreasonable and gave preference to wealthier projects. He added that launching a token on Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain, might be a better alternative. Base creator Jesse Pollak also weighed in, stating that token listings should not come with high financial barriers, and suggesting that Binance’s approach undermines accessibility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Binance’s Response CZ dismissed Hetherington’s claims as misleading, describing the criticism as an example of “loser mentality.” He clarified that Binance’s listing process is designed to prioritize user safety and transparency. The deposits, he explained, apply only to listings that carry a higher risk and are refundable under standard conditions. Binance co-founder He Yi also addressed the controversy, confirming that the exchange does not charge listing fees for reputable projects and that the refundable deposits function as safeguards rather than hidden costs. CZ’s reaffirmation that Binance stood by XRP during its legal battle reinforces the exchange’s reputation for supporting established crypto assets. While regulatory scrutiny continues to shape exchange policies, Binance’s approach underscores the importance it places on liquidity, stability, and user protection. At present, XRP remains a top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintaining a strong trading presence on major exchanges, including Binance , which has continued to facilitate its trading pairs without interruption.

Interoperability framework Legacy Mesh has integrated Solana, exposing the altcoin to $175 billion in cross-chain liquidity from native USDt and Tether Gold (XAUt). Since its debut, USDT0 has already processed over $25 billion in bridge volume across twelve chains. Now, Solana users can tap that same unified liquidity to support dApps, payments, and institutional-grade use cases like treasury management, remittances, and collateralized lending. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Matt Hougan, Solana is positioned to win over Wall Street and become banks’ preferred network for stablecoin transactions. “Solana is the new Wall Street” – @Matt_Hougan , CIO @BitwiseInvest pic.twitter.com/gNfEu8Pbdr — Solana (@solana) October 3, 2025 Tether integration only strengthens the argument, alongside protocols such as Splyce and Chintai that allow retail investors to access tokenized securities directly on the network.

The altcoin is now retesting a key demand zone around $180. Recovering this level could confirm a higher low and signal the start of a new uptrend, setting up for a potential breakout.

The RSI is trending back toward the neutral line, while the MACD histogram is converging on the signal line, both signs of building buy pressure. The key breakout threshold sits at $300, the early-year Solana price all-time high. Once flipped to support, SOL could enter new price discovery, targeting $500 for a potential 160% gain. But with deepening TradFi exposure through stablecoins, corporate treasury accumulation, and upcoming spot ETFs, fresh demand could see the rally extend 415% to $1,000.

Large holders have been rapidly exiting their positions. Net position change data shows an aggressive sell-off trend, with whale wallets offloading 360 million DOGE , worth approximately $74 million . This likely coincided with the broader flash crash across the market, but the scale of Dogecoin-specific selling is hard to ignore. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Key Trend Line Bounce Still Favors Bullish Outlook Dogecoin (DOGE) just bounced off a key trend line, signaling strong buyer support even as whales continue to sell. The token is holding steady at $0.20, with volumes spiking to 10% of its circulating supply. If DOGE clears the $0.22 resistance, it could be the start of a major rally to $0.45 or higher. That said, if large holders keep dumping, a break below trend line support could open the door to $0.14 or even $0.12. Still, history shows that dog-themed tokens have outperformed across multiple cycles.

The cryptocurrency’s rising correlation with equities lessens bitcoin’s role as a diversification tool. Gold, by contrast, is shining this year as a safe-haven asset, effectively flipping the “digital gold” narrative promoted by cryptocurrency advocates on its head. By James Picerno Bitcoin may or may not become a global standard for digital payments in the years ahead, but it looks like a good proxy for assessing the financial market’s appetite for risk. That’s good news for investors looking for an alternative read on equity risk sentiment, but it could be problematic for using bitcoin as a hedge against stock market risk. Back in March we noted that comparing the most popular cryptocurrency with US shares (S&P 500 Index) suggests an increasingly tighter connection between bitcoin and sentiment on Wall Street. Seven months later, the connection between the two asset classes looks even tighter. The latest example: When stocks tanked last Friday (Oct. 10), so did bitcoin, which lost substantially more that day vs. the S&P 500. Gold, by contrast, was up 1.0%. One day could be noise, of course, but a review of bitcoin vs. stocks over the last several years confirms a tighter connection between the assets in recent history. For example, over the past three years, the daily returns for bitcoin and the S&P 500 posted a moderately positive 0.33 correlation, up from a slightly negative correlation in the previous three-year period. Note: Perfect correlation (no diversification benefit) is indicated by 1.0; no correlation (random behavior) is 0.0; and -1.0 is perfect negative correlation (always moving inversely). Although the cryptocurrency still exhibits a fair amount of return independence from stocks, the degree of low/negative correlation is fading as the asset moves into the mainstream of financial markets. Monitoring risk sentiment The upside of a higher correlation: there are times when bitcoin appears to offer contemporaneous, or early, signals of a change in risk sentiment for stocks. The digital asset’s downturn in early 2025, for instance, foreshadowed the subsequent slide in equities. Coincidence? Maybe, but something similar occurred again in April, when bitcoin bottomed around the time that the decline in stocks started to reverse. These two events suggest that this crypto asset sometimes confirms, if not predicts, a change in investors’ risk appetite for stocks. By contrast, bitcoin in its early days was seen as an independent asset, disconnected from traditional financial markets and the economy. That perception was largely attributable to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which, historically, operated outside the mainstream of finance through a network of independent and predominantly offshore exchanges. But the growing embrace of the cryptocurrency by institutions and easier access for individuals via publicly traded bitcoin funds have tightened the ebb and flow between the two asset classes. Correlation and Diversification The rising correlation between bitcoin and stocks suggests that the digital currency has become somewhat less useful for diversifying equity risk, if only on the margins so far. Consider how a rolling 3-month window for daily returns has evolved. The linear trend shows the correlation approaching 0.4 (black line in the chart below). That’s still well below correlations between, say, US large-cap stocks vs. small-caps, or US stocks and foreign equities. But if recent history is a guide, bitcoin and stocks look set to become even more closely aligned in the future. Bitcoin’s moderately positive correlation still offers a degree of independence from stocks, but the connection between the two assets is showing stronger alignment in periods of elevated stock market stress, such as during the spring correction. Bitcoin’s story as an investment class has continually evolved, from digital cash to a store of value, and later to a volatile, high-return vehicle. As its correlation with equity markets deepens, it is beginning to resemble a speculative asset more than the alternative store of value it was once touted to be. It’s too soon to write off bitcoin as a diversifying force for stocks. Even if it’s more closely aligned with equities going forward, it may still be useful as a complement for diversifying stock market risk vis-a-vis other asset classes, such as bonds, commodities and property shares. But if 2025 is a guide, it seems that the crypto’s success in going mainstream is starting to conflict with its earlier image as an asset apart from the financial system’s status quo.

The case is the first legal challenge the Chamber has brought against Trump this term, according to court filings lodged on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Chamber the fee as “not only misguided policy” but “plainly unlawful,” and asked the court to strike down the rule as an abuse of executive power. Before this change, H-1B visa costs were usually below $5,000, excluding attorney fees. But under Trump’s new rule, companies would have to pay $100,000 per visa, a twentyfold increase. For industries like technology, manufacturing, education, health care, and finance, the Chamber warned, this could shut off access to specialized workers altogether. Chamber warns the new fee will hurt U.S. businesses “The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber, said in a statement. The Chamber’s decision to sue is striking because it has mostly stayed silent on other controversial Trump policies, like the nasty tariffs that have caused turmoil for small manufacturers. This time, however, the group said the new H-1B structure would hurt American competitiveness and block innovation. The White House announced the rule in mid-September, triggering confusion across companies that sponsor H-1B workers and among the visa holders themselves. Many feared losing their legal status, until the administration clarified that current H-1B holders were exempt from the change. Each year, the government issues about 85,000 new H-1B visas, selected through a lottery from roughly 425,000 applications. Universities are exempt from that cap, but the rest of corporate America must compete fiercely for those limited slots. White House defends the move and introduces gold card option Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, defended the new fee, calling it “lawful” and “a necessary, initial, incremental step toward reforms.” She said, “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H-1B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had said last week the $100,000 price was chosen to stop companies from using H-1B visas for entry-level hires and instead target “the great engineers” and “impressively detailed executives.” At the same event, Trump signed an executive order allowing wealthy foreigners to pay $1 million for a “gold card” giving them U.S. residency, and corporations to pay $2 million for a “corporate gold card” letting them sponsor one or more employees. Despite its lawsuit, the Chamber still acknowledged some of Trump’s economic achievements. Bradley said, “President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth.” But he noted that long-term expansion “will require more workers, not fewer.” Bradley added that Trump has repeatedly said he wants to “educate, attract, and retain the world’s best and brightest in the U.S.,” and the Chamber “shares that goal.” The organization maintains that the H-1B program, when priced fairly, is essential for keeping America’s workforce competitive and ensuring that U.S. companies don’t lose access to the specialized talent needed to stay ahead in global markets.

Mining stocks have shown resilience in the past year, jumping from a market cap of $28 billion to $94 billion. That’s an increase of around 235% in only 12 months. Investors have shown massive interest in mining companies. Last week, IREN Limited signed multi-year cloud services contracts for deploying Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. MARA Holdings has agreed to acquire a stake of 64% in Exaion, the company that specializes in operating high-performance computing (HPC) data centers. Despite the positive sentiment, mining stocks have dropped sharply after a Bitcoin slide to under $108,000. Miners sell Bitcoin Bitcoin miners have been showing signs of selling pressure. Based on a report by Cryptopolitan, around 51,000 BTC, worth around $5.6 billion, were moved from miner wallets to exchanges starting October 9. Two days ago, Bitcoin mining stocks reached double their value to $94 billion but dropped to $86.91 billion, based on data from Bitcoin Mining Stock. IREN Limited leads in the Bitcoin mining stock market with a market cap of $16.76 billion. The stock dropped by 9% and currently trades at $61.83. The second spot is reserved for Applied Digital Corporation, with a market cap of $10.25 billion. The company stock, APLD, witnessed a slight reduction of around 3% to trade at $36.64. MARA Holdings is in the third position with a market cap of $7.51 billion. Its stock, MARA, has dropped significantly by 11.25% and currently trades at $20.27. Marketcap Heatmap.

The crypto market fails to recover Earlier in the week, the crypto market tried to recover from last Friday’s market crash, which caused the liquidation of over $19 billion. On October 10, Bitcoin was trading at $121,741. Traders were expecting a new all-time high, but the following day, the market crashed, and Bitcoin dropped to as low as $104,000 on some exchanges. The crypto market tried to recover during the week. Bitcoin reached a top of around $115,000, while Ethereum hovered around $4,200. However, the momentum failed. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,938, while ETH dropped to $3,870, based on real-time data from CoinGecko.

While BTC’s price movements are notorious for their sudden, dramatic swings, history shows that the 200 WMA technical indicator has stood out with remarkable consistency. How The 200 WMA Has Defined Every Bitcoin Cycle Luke Broyles, an observer of Bitcoin’s market cycles, has noted on X that BTC has been screaming buy all 5 times that it hit the 200 WMA. This track record leads many to ask if they should hold a lump sum on the sidelines until that hits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Wobbles — Is A Sharp Downside Move On The Horizon? Broyles acknowledges that while BTC has been trending down, that hasn’t been the worst idea in the world. Although it isn’t a magic bullet. As Broyles explains, 3 out of the 5 times it has hit the 200 WMA, it was there for mere days. The worst part is that when BTC trends upward, the 200 WMA rises with it, making the ideal entry a constantly moving target. However, Broyles provided a vivid example from recent history. In April 2023, BTC was $31,000, and the 200 WMA was $25,000. Before that, BTC was $16,000 months ago, and many thought a pullback into the $20,000 range was likely. Meanwhile, the analyst advocates for a buy at 31,000. During that time, 200 WMA was so close, and they cared more about bragging rights of I bought at the 200 WMA instead of simply accumulating BTC. By the time BTC briefly dipped below the line again, it was already at $28,000, and that was the last chance. Currently, the 200 WMA sits comfortably above $50,000, and if BTC’s uptrend continues, that line could climb to $70,000 or even $100,000 before price ever revisits it. Why Bitcoin Remains Bullish On Higher Timeframes An analyst known as Scient has emphasized that BTC is on the higher timeframes. The blue zone remains a must-hold area for bullish continuation, with price consolidating above $108,000 for nearly three months. This range could be setting up a clean flip of that level into support before a major expansion phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? Furthermore, all liquidity below the range lows (RLs) has been swept. The recent drop followed a higher high (HH) on the 3-day chart, and now BTC sits right at the RLs, an ideal zone where a higher low (HL) could confirm a continuation pattern. Scient pointed out that it’s the candle body that matters for divergence, the wicks don’t count. He’s watching closely for hidden bullish divergences to develop on the 3D timeframe, which would confirm the bullish setup. According to the analyst, this week looks relatively slow, but the next volatile move will likely come next week.

53250778,607523,1760659243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53250778.jpeg,Bitcoin SOPR Shows Market Nearing Post-Correction Levels,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sopr-shows-market-nearing-post-correction/,"Bitcoin is once again testing investor conviction as it fights to stay above the $110,000 level following last Friday’s sharp correction that triggered a massive leverage wipeout across the market. After one of the most volatile sessions of the quarter, traders are watching closely to see whether BTC can stabilize or if more downside pressure will emerge. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are continuing to exert significant pressure on the market. Their Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) — a key metric tracking realized profits — currently stands at 2.32, showing that this group is selling coins at an average gain of over 130%. Such elevated profitability levels often coincide with phases where long-term investors take profits after extended rallies, contributing to selling pressure and short-term weakness. Despite this, Bitcoin’s ability to defend its current range suggests underlying demand remains resilient. Long-Term Holders Still Taking Profits, But Signs of Exhaustion Emerge Analyst Darkfost points out that while the Long-Term Holders’ (LTH) SOPR currently sits at 2.32, the shorter-term averages are starting to soften. The weekly SOPR (7-day moving average) has fallen to 1.82, and the monthly SOPR (30-day) sits at 1.79, both trending downward since the summer. Although these figures remain below the annual average of 2.25, they indicate a gradual cooling of realized profits — a sign that selling pressure may be easing. This dynamic reflects a crucial transition point for Bitcoin’s market structure. As long-term holders continue to realize profits above 1.0, they’re selling coins at a gain, effectively capping momentum and weighing on price recovery. Yet, the current decline in SOPR averages hints that this wave of profit-taking may be nearing exhaustion. Historically, such drops in realized profit levels have preceded market stabilization and, eventually, recovery phases. Darkfost highlights that the current setup closely resembles the October 2024 correction, when Bitcoin’s SOPR bottomed near similar levels before the next major upswing. If history rhymes, the ongoing contraction in LTH profitability could signal that the worst of the correction is behind us. Still, further moderation in SOPR remains key for the market to fully reset and for sustainable upside momentum to re-emerge. Bulls Defend $110K Zone Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin continues to hover around $111,500, showing signs of stabilization after last Friday’s steep sell-off. The 8-hour chart highlights a fragile recovery structure, with BTC struggling to regain key moving averages and momentum fading below the $117,500 resistance, which remains a major supply zone. The 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) moving averages are beginning to converge — a sign of compression that typically precedes a strong directional move. For now, BTC is trading below all three, suggesting that sellers still dominate the mid-term trend. Holding above $110,000 is crucial; a decisive break below could open the door to retesting the $105,000–$106,000 range, where strong demand previously emerged. Reclaiming $114,000–$115,000 would be the first sign of strength, potentially triggering a push toward the $117,500 barrier. However, volume remains muted, implying that traders are cautious as the market digests recent volatility. Bitcoin’s price action points to a consolidation phase, with buyers and sellers in temporary equilibrium. If bulls can protect the $110K region and momentum rebuilds, BTC could attempt a gradual recovery, but failure to do so risks extending the correction further.

The asset, which experienced a sharp decline earlier this month, remains unable to regain the crucial $3.00 level despite a partial rebound. XRP dropped to the $1.50 range on October 10 during the broader market downturn but quickly stabilized above $2.00. Since then, however, it has struggled to build the momentum required to break through major resistance points. According to TraderJB, this behavior fits within a larger corrective structure that may now be nearing completion or could extend for several more months. Completion of the W–X–Y Correction In his latest technical assessment, the analyst described XRP’s recent trend as a ten-month corrective phase made up of three main waves labeled (W), (X), and (Y). Each of these phases lasted between three and four months and reflected alternating periods of decline, recovery, and consolidation. $XRP Beautiful 10-month flat-zigzag-zigzag combination formed. Two scenarios from here: 1. The correction is already done (or days from being done), forming a double-three. 2. Two more corrective waves are left, turning it into a triple-three. Given that the (W), (X), and (Y)… pic.twitter.com/JjerZp3LFi — TraderJB (@TraderJBx) October 15, 2025 Historical data aligns with this interpretation. The first wave (W) spanned from January to April, taking XRP from its January peak near $3.40 to around $1.80 by April. The subsequent (X) wave occurred between May and July, as the token rebounded to roughly $3.60. The final (Y) wave unfolded from August through October, characterized by sideways movement that culminated in the October market crash. That sudden selloff pushed XRP to $1.50, which TraderJB identifies as the completion point of the (4) wave within the larger cycle. He also noted that the drop cleared out a significant number of leveraged long positions, which could help set the stage for a potential recovery. Two Possible Directions for XRP From this point, the analyst envisions two main paths. The first possibility is that the correction phase has already ended, completing a “double-three” structure that would allow for a renewed upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The alternative scenario assumes that XRP still has two smaller corrective legs remaining, labeled (X) and (Z), which would form a “triple-three” pattern and delay any substantial recovery until mid-2026. Although both scenarios remain viable, TraderJB leans toward the first outcome, suggesting the market could soon shift in favor of buyers once short positions begin to unwind. Currently, XRP trades around $2.38 . A decisive move above $2.80 to $3.00 would indicate growing bullish strength and confirm the start of a new rally . Conversely, a drop below the recent $1.50 low would suggest that the corrective structure is not yet complete. While XRP’s recent performance has been marked by volatility and hesitation, the broader technical outlook suggests a decisive move could be approaching. For now, investors continue to monitor the $2.80 to $3.00 range as the critical zone that may determine XRP’s next major direction.

The announcement came during Oracle’s AI World conference in Las Vegas, where the company outlined how its AI-driven database business will expand sharply in the coming years. The database giant now expects its AI-powered data platform revenue to surge to $20 billion by fiscal 2030, up from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2025 and $3 billion in 2026. This rally, Oracle executives said, will be driven by surging demand for computing capacity and easier access to hardware supplies over the next few years. Speaking to analysts, Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle’s two new CEOs, explained , “You see the change in these numbers that it’s a little bit easier for us to find supply, not this year or next year, but in subsequent years. So as we’re able to find that supply, customers contract for it, we see immense demand, and then we go about delivering that to customers.” Oracle confirms Meta deal and $65 billion in new contracts During the same presentation, Clay revealed that in just 30 days of the current quarter, Oracle secured $65 billion in new cloud infrastructure commitments, spread across seven different contracts with four major customers. Clay stressed that none of those clients were OpenAI, addressing speculation that Oracle’s recent growth was overly dependent on the ChatGPT maker. “None of those customers are OpenAI,” he said. “I know some people are questioning sometimes, ‘Hey, is it just OpenAI?’ The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.” Among those customers is Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram. Reports from Bloomberg in September said the two companies had been negotiating a $20 billion cloud deal, which Clay confirmed is now in motion. This comes as Meta continues one of the tech industry’s largest AI spending sprees, with its capital expenditures for 2024 expected between $66 billion and $72 billion. The partnership gives Oracle a massive boost as it competes directly with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud for a slice of the AI infrastructure market. The company has been expanding its cloud infrastructure division, while also allowing its database software to run on other clouds, which has helped attract diverse clients. Back in July, Oracle even secured a $300 billion commitment from OpenAI, showing just how aggressively the company is scaling its footprint in high-end AI compute. Oracle sets bold targets for 2030 with focus on profit margins Despite its explosive growth, Oracle disclosed that AI infrastructure carries a gross margin of 30% to 40% after accounting for land, data center, power, and computing costs. Yet, according to a report from The Information, Oracle earned only 14% on renting out Nvidia AI chips in the August quarter, evidence that costs are still tight as AI hardware demand outpaces supply. Chief financial officer Doug Kehring pushed back against the idea that Oracle is chasing revenue at any cost. “I’ve read a lot of stories that are speculating that Oracle is chasing revenue for revenue’s sake,” Doug said, adding that:- “But let’s be crystal clear: we only pursue opportunities where we have a clear line of sight to attractive market margins that reward us for intellectual property and the activity we bring to customers.” After the market closed, Oracle announced new long-term targets; $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in revenue for fiscal 2030, representing a 31% compound annual growth rate. That’s above the $18.92 EPS and $198.39 billion in revenue that analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting. Still, the stock slipped 2% in extended trading as investors digested the forecast and its ambitious timeline.

A growing row between China and the Netherlands over the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has put the continent’s car production at risk. Industry leaders have also warned that the row could bring assembly lines to a standstill across Europe if it is not resolved soon. The crisis was triggered after the Dutch government announced it would take over Nexperia, a semiconductor firm based in Nijmegen that China’s Wingtech Technology fully owns. The move, announced on October 12, was described as “exceptional” and aimed to safeguard national security and technological sovereignty. The Netherlands stated that it took the action out of concern that Nexperia’s technology could fall into its Chinese parent company’s hands and be modified without oversight. The action followed months of pressure from Washington, which had warned European allies about the security risks associated with Chinese ownership in key technology sectors. In court filings, which went largely unnoticed at the time, U.S. officials had privately pressured Dutch regulators to oust the Chinese leadership of Nexperia and tighten controls. That came on top of new American export control rules that expanded restrictions to subsidiaries 50% or more owned by sanctioned Chinese entities. Late last year, Wingtech was placed on the U.S. “entity list,” effectively severing its access to American chipmaking equipment and software. Beijing didn’t take long to retort. On October 4, before the Dutch announcement but as tensions were escalating, China’s Commerce Ministry issued an order preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished products and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. In a statement, Nexperia said it was in discussions with officials in China regarding an exemption and was working with its European clients to mitigate the disruption. Carmakers scramble to contain fallout Once again, the European automotive industry finds itself at the center of a global trade and technology war . The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warned that if deliveries of the Nexperia chip were to cease, parts of Europe’s car production may shut down. Nexperia’s chips are critical to rudimentary automotive systems — everything from sensors and lighting to braking controls and battery management. Among its customers are Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Bosch. Last week, Nexperia informed several customers that it would no longer be able to guarantee delivery times. The announcement set off emergency reviews across the sector. Volkswagen, which does not yet count among companies suffering production delays, said it’s monitoring the situation closely. BMW said that some of its supplier network is already feeling the effects, and they are in active conversations with their partners to ensure stability. Bosch, one of Europe’s largest providers of auto parts, cautioned that even short-term disruptions could send shock waves through the supply chain. Stellantis, whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat, and Opel, stated that it is collaborating with Nexperia and other suppliers to assess the potential implications and develop contingency plans. Carmakers brace for a new chip shortage Europe’s carmakers are bracing for a recession. The industry is still recovering from the 2021–2023 semiconductor shortage, which resulted in tens of billions of dollars in losses and led to plants halting or suspending production. Analysts caution that this standoff could lead to similar chaos, but this time, it would be geopolitical rather than pandemic-induced. Xuezheng Zhang, the company’s chief executive, has even gone so far as to say that systems designed by Nexperia are responsible for 10 percent of the world’s electricity consumption — all by making transistors that can switch off rapidly but don’t turn on particularly well. Factories in Germany, France, and Italy would be most affected by this, as many of their suppliers rely on just-in-time delivery of chips from Nexperia. Europe’s chipmaking ecosystem is fragile already. Although efforts have been made to increase local production under the EU Chips Act, much of the packaging and assembly work continues to occur in Asia, particularly in China.

This deal will be the most significant private capital agreement ever recorded in history. Under this agreement, Meta and Blue Owl Capital Inc. will share ownership of the tech company’s Hyperion data center based in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The tech giant will retain only 20% of the shares for Meta, according to individuals knowledgeable about the situation. Financial institutions join forces with tech firm amid AI boom era Meta and Blue Owl Capital Inc.’s deal highlights growing interest in the AI ecosystem as tech companies join forces with financial institutions to make significant investments in the industry. Morgan Stanley plays a crucial role in this agreement. To illustrate, the bank arranged for approximately $27 billion in loans and around $2.5 billion in investments via a special purpose vehicle to finance the construction. This kind of arrangement is becoming more common for substantial initiatives. The bank began embracing this deal at the start of the year with a strategic approach to attracting several asset managers and infrastructure lenders who wanted to be part of it. After careful consideration, a reliable source suggested that Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl emerged as the winners. This funding approach is established to encourage tech firms with innovative ideas to develop massive data centers, allowing them to continue this initiative without negatively impacting their credit scores. As a result, data from sources has pointed out that many companies are taking significant debts to cover their escalating expenses. Additionally, it allows tech firms to maintain low debt levels and grants Wall Street investors an opportunity to make investments in physical assets considered safer. On the other hand, Meta opted for a completely different approach in this financing setup. The tech giant revealed that it is not taking on the debt directly, but the financing institution is doing so. Meta’s role in the deal is to act as the developer, operator, and tenant of the initiative. Notably, this project is scheduled for completion in 2029. In the meantime, tech companies in the US bond markets managed to raise about $157 billion by late September. This reflects a 70% increase compared to last year. When reports requested representatives from Meta, Morgan Stanley, Pimco, and Blue Owl to comment for more information on the topic of discussion, they declined to respond. Elon Musk’s xAI 20 billion fundraising marks a significant deal in the tech industry Recently, structured investments have gained more interest as insurers and other investors seek debt linked to tangible assets. An example of a company that has adopted this strategy is Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, in its recent $20 billion fundraising round. In this approach, the company leases chips rather than owning them outright. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the new round is more significant than initially expected. It is tied to xAI’s plan to utilize Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its largest data center, located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that approximately $7.5 billion is in equity, while as much as $12.5 billion is in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that purchases Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for five years, providing financiers a path to recover their investment without exposing themselves to company-level risk. On October 16, the parties involved in the funding round completed the last step. Under this deal, they intended to price the bonds in a 144A format with Pimco as the primary lender, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because this information is private. The individuals also highlighted that a few other investors are set to receive some shares of the debt, which matures in 2049 and will be fully repaid over time. Another source stated that the bonds are likely to price at approximately 225 basis points over Treasuries. Morgan Stanley was the sole bookrunner on this deal, the sources said.

But though Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals remain solid, new Ethereum-built DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a top crypto to invest in this year. In phase 6 presale, the project is valued at $0.035 and already sold out more than 65%. Mutuum Finance has already generated $17.4 million in funds and gained over 17,200 investors. Its expanding network and utility-focused model have experts terming it the next big DeFi phenomenon on Ethereum, and possibly one of the standout performers in 2025 across the altcoin space. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Bounces Back Towards $4,500 as Bulls Maintain Momentum After temporarily dropping below the $3,800 mark, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a solid reversal signal, popping back above $4,150 and closing out the key bearish trend line at about $4,100. The action also took ETH through the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the $4,758 top and $3,423 low, which suggests newfound momentum to the upside within the marketplace. Primary upside targets in this situation lie at $4,250, then $4,320, and potentially a breakout to the $4,400–$4,500 region, levels which may bolster broader investor confidence. A reversal at $4,250 may, on the other hand, begin the short-term correction back into $4,120–$4,100 region with deeper support near $4,020 and $3,950. Although speculative traders remain focused upon Ethereum’s technical recovery, long-term investors also eye new projects within the burgeoning DeFi space such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which suggests capital again is going into innovation throughout the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance Attracting Greater Presale Hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to trend in the DeFi sector and headlines in crypto news with strong interest building among investors. The sixth presale phase of the project is already 65% subscribed, which indicates strong market momentum.

53250781,607397,1760662801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53250781.jpeg,World Bank Publishes Report Talking About Ripple And XRP – Here’s What It Says,https://bitcoinist.com/world-bank-on-ripple-and-xrp/,"The World Bank has published a report discussing Ripple’s Interledger and XRP . They indicated that the payment solutions involving XRP were promising, as they enable the exchange of currencies across different networks. World Bank Talks About Ripple And XRP Crypto influencer SMQKE shared a World Bank report on ‘Blockchain Interoperability’ that considered Ripple’s Interledger , noting how anyone can receive any currency of their choice using XRP. The bank described this as being “very promising” for the payment domain, as it enables the exchange of value across different payment networks. The bank further stated that the Interledger routes packets of value in the same way as the Internet routes packets of information. The World Bank report highlighted how the Interledger is addressing interoperability, as the team has developed several settlement rails for both crypto and non-crypto payments, with XRP a major part of this solution. Notably, Ripple also continues to adopt several payment standards, including the ISO 20022 standard , to ensure that its payment solution can be adopted for cross-border transactions. XRP is known to serve as the bridge currency, enabling users to transfer and receive any currency of their choice. The report highlighted the functions of nodes on the Interledger, in which XRP acts as the router , connecting the sender of USD and the receiver of another currency like Bitcoin. This also applies to non-crypto payments, as one can send USD and receive another currency with XRP serving as the router. Meanwhile, SMQKE had mentioned how the payment firm had previously collaborated with the World Bank to advance the modernization of global payment clearing and back-end infrastructure. Ripple’s partnerships with several banks are one of the reasons why members of the XRP community envisage that XRP could make headway in the global financial ecosystem. SMQKE recently shared documents that showed Ripple’s integration into the European financial system. The Firm Makes Headway In Africa Ripple announced that it has partnered with South Africa’s Absa to provide crypto custody services for the financial institution. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan indicated that this development may represent a major win for XRP. He noted that the collaboration between Ripple and the bank is not only about custody but seems to be connected to the broader demand for Ripple’s payment solutions in Africa. Morgan further remarked that with announcements such as that, there is more to know behind the announcement. Notably, the company earlier this year partnered with the African fintech giant Chipper Cash to integrate its payment technology into the platform.

The increase in online activity is an indication of increased retail participation, which is usually the beginning of a bullish sentiment across major altcoins. On-chain activity also reveals an increase in wallet activity, which means that both new and current holders are accumulating. With the resurgence of interest in altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is mentioned by analysts as one of the top projects to watch , due to its structured presale, verified audits, and potential of 500x returns, alongside ADA, SUI, and HYPE. Layer-1 Tokens, ADA, SUI and HYPE on The Spotlight Cardano has experienced social and search performance, and analysts have found sharp increases in retail queries after recent ecosystem developments. Santiment data indicated that ADA has achieved its highest social dominance since May and this could be an indication of a sentiment change with investors returning to long-term plays. The increased DeFi activity and numerous layer-2 integrations of the network have also helped to spark a new wave of optimism, as developers continue to expand the ecosystem of the Cardano project at a gradual rate. In the meantime, analysts reported that following a sharp decline, Cardano price has resumed testing the trendline support, which may act as a catalyst for the price target of $1. ADAUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X In the meantime, on-chain statistics of SUI indicate growing volumes of transactions and increasing rates of staking, indicating the formation of a solid base of long-term holders. Technical analysts observe that the SUI/USDT pair had a bullish reversal trend at the end of its multi-month support zone, which may have an upward momentum, should the market conditions improve. Even more so, HYPE also took the stage, with both search and social volumes increasing at a rapid pace. The recent performance of the coin and campaigns by communities have assisted in maintaining the interest of investors at a time when major cryptos are experiencing declining volatility. Analysts think that the concurrent upsurge of ADA, SUI, and HYPE can signify the beginning of an altcoin rotation phase. Among this trend, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the more prominent contenders due to its verified smart contracts and rapidly expanding investor base, making it in the same conversation as these high-performing names. Market Sentiment Turns Cautiously Optimistic Despite the volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum, analysts say the altcoin market is showing early signs of recovery. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that mid-cap altcoins have started outperforming major assets, driven by retail inflows and renewed speculative appetite. As global liquidity conditions improve and interest in decentralized applications rises, assets such as Cardano and SUI are regaining momentum. Technical setups also support the bullish reversal narrative. Cardano has reclaimed its 200-day moving average, which often signals the beginning of a medium-term uptrend. SUI crypto, on the other hand, has been trading within a tightening wedge pattern, a structure that historically precedes an expansion of volatility. Recent data showed that SUI volume rallied 69% in just 7 days, signaling an increased bullish trend for the top altcoin. Traders are watching for breakout confirmations that could trigger multi-week rallies across the broader market. SUIUSD 1-Week Chart | Source: X Amid this backdrop, speculative capital continues to flow into early-stage presales, where investors see higher risk-adjusted returns. One project capturing this momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale token that has already raised over $16 million. With its ongoing audit by CertiK and previous verification by Hashex, the project stands out for its security qualities that have become critical for presale participants in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Big Presale Opportunity Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to a successful early-stage project that produced gains after launch. However, unlike traditional meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE integrates functional tokenomics with transaction-based burn mechanisms. This hybrid model gives the project real-world utility, a rare combination in the current market. The project’s capped supply and liquidity-lock mechanism create built-in scarcity, while its deflationary design ensures steady upward pressure once trading begins. Early projections estimate a 500× upside if listings on exchanges materialize after the presale. The final presale phase is scheduled for Q4 2025, followed by exchange listings by early 2026. Market strategists believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE success so far lies in its transparency and structure. Unlike many unverified presales, the project provides regular progress updates, community engagement through Telegram and X (Twitter), and open audit reporting. Its steady presale growth positions it as the best altcoin to buy among 2025’s emerging tokens, especially as investors diversify beyond layer-1 projects like Cardano and SUI. In recognition of continued momentum, the project is extending a 50% EXTRA bonus to investors—exclusive for a limited time with PATRIOT50X. Final Take The rising interest in Cardano, SUI, and HYPE signals growing confidence that the crypto market could be entering a new recovery phase. On-chain data and technical setups support the possibility of an altcoin rotation as investor sentiment improves. At the same time, structured presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining ground as investors look for early, high-upside opportunities in a cautious market. With its verified audits, presale momentum, and deflationary token model, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands among the top altcoins to buy alongside ADA, SUI, and HYPE.

The token plunged nearly 40% intraday before rebounding, now hovering between $2.20 and $2.60 as traders assess what’s next. Related Reading: Is The XRP Bottom In? Top Crypto Analyst Turns Ultra-Bullish Despite heavy whale selling and lingering volatility, market analysts insist that “this week could change everything” for XRP, with key ETF decisions and regulatory milestones approaching that could redefine its long-term outlook. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Flash-Crash Fallout: Liquidations, Whale Flows, and Key Support XRP was swept up in the Oct. 10 crypto “flash crash,” sliding intraday by 40% before rebounding to a monthly loss near 20%. The trigger wasn’t a protocol flaw but a leverage washout tied to tariff headlines that jolted risk assets. Heavy forced deleveraging slammed both CEX and DEX liquidity, pulling most majors sharply lower in minutes. Since then, XRP has steadied in the $2.20–$2.60 band, with the 200-day EMA near $2.62 now a pivotal pivot. On-chain flows show mixed positioning as large holders sent sizable tranches to exchanges during the drop (a classic profit-taking/hedge tell), yet the torrent slowed after Oct. 11, helping price stabilize. Technically, bulls need a daily close back above $2.80–$3.00 to neutralize the short-term downtrend; lose $2.20, and the next magnet sits near $1.80. Notably, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin held its peg through the chaos, an institutional-friendly datapoint that underscores XRPL’s operational resilience under stress. Derivatives Heat Up as XRP ETF Window Nears Currently, futures open interest eased, but options activity surged triple-digits, signaling traders are bracing for larger moves. Long/short ratios remain skewed long on major venues, fertile ground for volatility if support cracks. That backdrop meets a dense ETF decision window (Oct. 18–25) for issuers including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares. Pundits point out that the SEC’s shortened 75-day review is a sign of an accelerated process, even as macro cross-currents (tariffs, growth jitters) complicate risk appetite. Legal clarity also looms large as courts have affirmed XRP isn’t a security on secondary markets, removing a structural overhang that kept many institutions sidelined last cycle. What Would Flip the Trend With the XRP price below the 20/50/100-day EMAs and the Supertrend still bearish, momentum remains fragile. Bulls need: Price confirmation: Reclaim $2.80–$3.00 with rising spot volume to target $3.50–$3.80. Flows confirmation: Net ETF inflows and calming options skew to validate dip-buying. Macro calm: Softer tariff rhetoric and benign data to reopen risk windows. These absent, a break below $2.20 risks a deeper corrective leg toward $1.80, with tail-risk bears eyeing $0.75 in a severe macro shock. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash Nonetheless, the institutional narrative is intact as RLUSD’s stability, CBDC/RWA conversations tied to XRPL, and a maturing compliance toolset all support longer-term adoption. That’s why some analysts insist “this week changes everything”, if regulatory catalysts align, XRP’s next leg higher could begin.

The proposed legislation, House Bill 183 (HB 183), would authorize the state’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. If approved, HB 183 would allow the state CFO to allocate up to 10 percent of any funds in certain state-held accounts into digital assets. The Trust Fund of the Florida Retirement System, which the State Board of Administration administers, would be subject to similar guidelines and would allow up to 10 percent investment in accordance with those criteria. The Bill clarifies what constitutes a digital asset, such as Bitcoin or tokenized securities , but could also encompass non-fungible tokens. It also imposes tight controls on how those investments can be held and directed. Under the proposal, the money could either be held directly by a chief financial officer, placed in an account managed by a qualified custodian, or invested in SEC-registered exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Supporters of the Bill say it is an effort to keep Florida’s financial institutions on the cutting edge and allow for insurance against inflation and loss of confidence in traditional fiat money. The law describes Bitcoin as a store of value, or a potential long-term savings vehicle for public funds, much like the way governments have used gold. If passed, the new policy will take effect on July 1, 2026. The bill also promotes digital integration by permitting Floridians to pay some taxes and fees with digital assets. Those payments, in turn, would be automatically converted into U.S. dollars before being deposited into the state’s general fund, allowing government accounts to remain dollar-based while eliminating any rigidity that may hinder the use of cryptocurrency payments. States rush to build Bitcoin reserves as federal momentum grows The action by Florida also comes as several U.S. states are experimenting with how to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems . Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas all passed laws in early 2025 to hold Bitcoin as part of their states’ portfolios. Lawmakers in Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Missouri also introduced such proposals, with scores failing after legislative sessions concluded. Industry observers view Florida’s proposal as a reflection of a growing state-versus-federal race to determine the future of digital finance. If Florida’s bill passes, it could motivate other states to follow suit, particularly those with well-developed tech sectors or large cryptocurrency communities. The measure would also bolster Florida’s image as a blockchain-friendly state, following Governor Ron DeSantis’ previous efforts to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) while introducing regulations that are friendly to Bitcoin. Lawmakers weigh risks and readiness But despite mounting excitement, critics caution that the move could subject public dollars to volatility and potential legal wrangling. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate by more than 10% in a week, and it could put taxpayers’ money at risk if states invest in the digital currency. Several financial watchdogs have also raised concerns about whether public dollars should be invested in an asset class that is largely unregulated and vulnerable to market manipulation. Defenders argue that Bitcoin’s long-term perspective is bullish and safe, and custody of the asset through SEC-regulated ETFs would provide sound risk management. They also contend that the small exposure, limited to 10%, will enable Florida to dip its toe in the water without risking its finances. HB 183 is waiting for assignment to a committee in the Florida House. It will undergo hearings and debate before being moved to the Senate. If approved by both chambers, the bill would be sent to the governor for signature. As the legislative process continues, Florida’s proposal will serve as a test case for whether digital assets can become a legitimate tool of public finance and whether U.S. states are prepared to manage Bitcoin like a sovereign wealth fund for the digital age.

Analysts see this pullback as a chance to spot the best crypto to buy now and rotate into stronger altcoins. While top names like Solana and Dogecoin remain under the spotlight, rising players such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as fresh contenders for long-term growth. Solana Price Prediction 2025: Can It Rebound From Market Weakness? The Solana price prediction 2025 continues to be one of the most debated topics in the market. Recently, Solana lost its $200 support, dipping into the red zone and sparking concerns among traders. Institutional movements have been a big driver of sentiment. For example, Galaxy Digital transferred $51 million worth of SOL to Binance, fueling speculation about potential sell pressure. ETF excitement also plays a role in shaping sentiment. Bloomberg analysts forecast near certainty for a Solana ETF approval, which could mark a turning point for demand. On social platforms, technical experts remain confident. SOL price analysis Analyst Jelle noted that SOL broke an 18-month reaccumulation range and retested it successfully. This aligns with broader expectations that top altcoins to watch in 2025 include Solana, given its strong ecosystem and possible ETF boost. Some traders see the dip as a shakeout before a bigger run. Analyst Matt suggested $240 could still be realistic once Bitcoin stabilizes. These outlooks support the idea that Solana’s downturn may simply set up longer-term gains, making it one of the best altcoins amid market dip phases. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Is $1+ Still Possible? The Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 remains ambitious despite the latest pullback below $0.20. DOGE charts show a gap between $0.19 and $0.07 that many analysts believe will close, adding further volatility. DOGE analysis by Ali Long-term forecasts, however, continue to point higher, with some analysts suggesting that DOGE could reach over $1.50 by Q1 2026 based on past cycle trends. Dogecoin has a history of sudden moves fueled by both retail enthusiasm and influencer backing. With technical patterns resembling earlier bull cycles, many view the token as one of the top cryptos for 2025 bull run potential.

The consistent performance of Bitcoin at above $110,000, Ethereum at above $3,900 and XRP below essential resistance indicates a building strength of the key assets. As analysts seek fresh rallies, investors are now looking at early-stage tokens that would outperform in Q4. Out of the 5 best altcoins to buy before the October reversal, MAGACOIN FINANCE can be highlighted due to its organised presale, whale involvement and analyst support. Bitcoin Price Catch-Up With Gold Bitcoin is not as strong as Gold in October, but analysts believe that Bitcoin is resilient due to its stability around $111,000. Quinn Thompson, CIO at Lekker Capital, told attendees at the Digital Asset Summit that Bitcoin’s move could soon catch up to Gold. Analysts from 21Shares share similar optimism. Matt Mena emphasized that structural demand, ETF inflows and the prospect of rate cuts continue to anchor the strength of Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Beige Book signaled labor softness, reinforcing expectations of policy easing, a condition that is historically bullish for digital assets. Consequently, Bitcoin remains among the best crypto to buy before the October rebound. Analysts project that a break above $115,000 could ignite a move toward $150,000 by year-end as global liquidity expands. Its steady base near $111,000 offers investors technical and psychological support amid macro uncertainty. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Ethereum Price Builds Toward Parabolic Rally Ethereum is still consolidating around $4,000, holding strong above its major support of $3,900. Crypto analyst Ali believes that this level is important to the next parabolic phase of Ethereum. According to his MVRV Extreme Deviation Bands model, ETH may soar to $5,000- $6,000 when support holds. This was echoed by analyst Mister Crypto, who had estimated a potential parabolic move as Ethereum follows past accumulation patterns that resulted in historic breakouts. In the meantime, 21Shares analyst AltcoinGordon observed that the structure had changed, though the plan had not, pointing to consistent bullish setups despite slight corrections. The future of Ethereum enhances the mood of the entire market and preconditions the rise of new assets. Of these, MAGACOIN FINANCE received significant attention from investors. Analysts believe it is currently among the best altcoins to buy before the October rebound , as whales and analysts position early for post-presale gain. XRP Price Consolidates Below Resistance XRP has reached a period of consolidation just below the resistance zone of $2.50-$2.60, following a strong recovery from $2.30. Technical charts show that there is a major bearish trendline around $2.50 and breaking this price would lead to a surge towards $2.75 or even $2.80. The Relative Strength Index is still intact and thus there is the opportunity to see a momentum swell when the buying power increases. According to market analysts, XRP is structured in a manner that is similar to pre-breakout conditions in prior cycles. The break of the resistance at $2.60 would signal a bullish reversal trend, which is consistent with the general crypto narrative of recoveries. Moreover, the capacity of the asset to sustain higher lows indicates investor confidence before the possible institutional inflows. Although XRP is still in consolidation, analysts are still indicating altcoins that have potential for short-term increases. Other projects with high growth potential in Q4 2025 include MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has an authentic presale structure and whale accumulation. Final Take The slowdown of the crypto market in October has a bigger story behind it. The strength of Bitcoin around $111,000, Ethereum around $3,900 and XRP coiling pattern are all signs of a fresh wave of momentum. With macro conditions improving and Fed policy relaxing, traders are shifting to early-stage opportunities with high ROI. Of the 5 best altcoins to buy before the October rebound , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out, with analyst coverage and whale involvement. Its organization, reputation and timing make it one of the best investment options for investors who expect the next crypto market boom.

Governing Council members say the situation is still too unpredictable for the bank to rush into fresh monetary easing. ECB leaders study tariff impact before making next move ECB Governing Council member Edward Scicluna stated that the central bank should take its time before adjusting interest rates, as the global economy is still grappling with the full impact of the new U.S. trade tariffs . He explained that inflation in Europe might increase if the tariffs raise the prices of imported goods. But at the same time, prices might also fall if the tariffs slow down global trade and reduce demand for goods and services. Scicluna said it would be a mistake to make any rash decisions because no one can tell for sure which way this will go. “It’s not so straightforward whether higher trade tariffs will be disinflationary or inflationary,” he said in an interview on Thursday. “The jury is still out, and we shouldn’t jump to conclusions as this is crucial.” Scicluna also advised people not to expect significant changes at the next meeting by the ECB on October 29–30 in Florence, Italy. He said the central bank will likely maintain its current rates because the economic situation hasn’t shown any significant improvements in recent weeks. The December meeting will be more important because, at least, the ECB will have a clearer picture of how the economy is performing by then. He added that anyone inside the ECB must present strong and convincing reasons for another rate cut. “For me, it would need convincing arguments to support another cut,” he said. “The onus is on those who want to cut further to convince the rest of us.” Policymakers see a stable outlook but fear political and trade risks The European Central Bank released its latest projections in September, which expect inflation to remain closer to 1.7% in 2025 and rise slightly to 1.9% in 2026. The bank also expects moderate but steady economic growth across the 20 countries that use the euro. These numbers show that inflation is slowly moving towards the central bank’s 2% target. Governing Council member Edward Scicluna stated that the most recent economic data indicate there is no urgent need for the ECB to adjust its interest rates or implement new measures at this time. Scicluna explained that it would take months for the effects to spread throughout the economy if the central bank were to change its interest rates at the next meeting. For this reason, he said the bank should not make any sudden changes that could offset the balance that currently exists. The United States recently increased tariffs on imported goods, and analysts said prices would rise because companies and consumers would have to pay more for imports. However, some economists now argue that the same tariffs could have the opposite effect, lowering inflation by slowing trade and demand. Scicluna said this is why the ECB must monitor the situation carefully and avoid reacting too soon. He also said global industries could face shortages and production would become more expensive if China goes through with its plan to limit the export of rare earth minerals. Head of Estonia’s central bank, Madis Müller, said the supply issues could “reignite price pressures” across Europe and make inflation harder to control if they spread through global markets. The head of Germany’s Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, said the current interest rate feels right for the economy because it’s not too low to cause overheating, and not too high to choke off growth. The central bank can utilize this “neutral rate” to observe how the economy performs without introducing new pressure. Scicluna concurred, but also cautioned that global geopolitics can change the economic environment more quickly than it can be predicted in financial models. He advised European leaders to concentrate on domestic reform, invest in innovation, and improve productivity — not “spend so much energy worrying about what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic.” Get seen where it counts.

The transaction reportedly happened quietly with the Fed acting as the Treasury’s fiscal agent, part of an emergency $20 billion swap-line under negotiation between Washington and Buenos Aires. Behind that line, the Treasury is scooping up pesos from and through major banks as it tries to slow the sell-off that’s gutted confidence in the local currency. Officials from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America are in talks with the Treasury for $20 billion in short-term loans to Argentina, backed by domestic assets. A report from Bloomberg said Citigroup has been off-loading pesos to the Fed repeatedly, not just this week but during earlier trading sessions. Banco Santander SA has been buying pesos onshore for the Treasury as part of the same effort. None of the banks, the Fed, or the Treasury commented publicly. Peso weakens as Bessent pushes rescue deeper The peso crashed to 1,424 per US dollar mid-session Thursday before a late recovery to about 1,410–1,400 when fresh dollars were offered locally. No one confirmed which institutions stepped in, but traders say the support came just as the panic peaked. The Treasury’s goal is to absorb dollar demand from households and investors rushing for safety ahead of the October 26 election. Many Argentines don’t believe any level of US funding will stop another brutal devaluation. Trump’s Scott insists the peso is “undervalued” and is already weighing a plan to double the package to $40 billion through private bank deals. President Donald Trump said that US support would vanish if Milei’s party loses the midterms, spooking investors who already watched the libertarian’s candidates wiped out in key provincial races. That message rattled markets that see Milei’s free-market plan as the only economic framework left. “Bessent’s announcements have diminishing marginal returns: each one lasts less and less,” said Ezequiel Asensio, portfolio manager at Valiant Asset Management, who added that: “The market doesn’t believe Bessent, not even with the cash he’s putting in.” Market disbelief grows as bailout strains system The Treasury hasn’t revealed the scale of its peso purchases, and traders say each operation sparks only a brief rally before sellers pile back in. Lucio Arrocha, strategist at StoneX, warned that “a devaluation is inevitable” and that a Milei defeat would only accelerate capital flight. “There’s not enough dollars in the country to face the capital flight that will take place,” he said. For Scott, the drama feels like déjà vu. Early in his career under George Soros, he was part of the 1992 bet that forced the U.K. to abandon defense of the pound, a trade that earned Soros about $1 billion. Now Scott is on the opposite side, trying to prevent a collapse instead of profiting from it. Javier Timerman, managing partner at AdCap Grupo Financiero, called the comparison a warning shot: “All Argentines, investors and analysts believe the exchange rate has to adjust and that there won’t be economic activity while rates and the exchange rate stay where they are.” Analysts say the peso still hasn’t dropped enough to match 12 percent inflation since April, leaving it overvalued even after the latest plunge. The official rate is now roughly where the black-market rate was before partial FX-control easing earlier this year. The US-led buying spree is drying up liquidity inside Argentina, driving loan costs above 100 percent and leaving the government rolling over less than half of its maturing peso debt. “This can’t go on much longer,” said Miguel Kiguel, a former Argentine finance secretary. “People still think the intervention lasts until the election, and after that no one knows how it continues.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Argentina|Citigroup|Federal Reserve|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-17 01:50:42

The gap is expected to prompt the Communist Party to push for higher domestic spending at its key conference next week. The slowdown stems from escalating US-China trade tensions , which have sharply reduced investment, industrial output, and retail sales, weighing on overall global sales growth. Sources say the National Bureau of Statistics’ data, due Monday, October 20, will likely show GDP grew 4.7% in the third quarter year-on-year, down from 5.2% in the previous quarter. Economists call for a shift towards promoting consumption to enhance China’s economy China’s economy has struggled in the last quarter, sparking endless debates among economic analysts. They anticipate that a discussion may be held among party officials concerning this situation at the upcoming fourth plenum in Beijing. This meeting will outline their adopted strategies for the country’s development between 2026 and 2030, as governments and investors call for a shift towards increasing domestic consumption. Examples of analysts who weighed in on the topic of discussion include Michelle Lam and Wei Yao from Societe Generale SA. They shared a report highlighting that several policymakers believe stimulating consumption is crucial to counterbalance the risks associated with US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and declining returns on investment in traditional industries. The analysts believe embracing a consumption goal will demonstrate a stronger commitment to this policy. Meanwhile, after Trump was re-elected as president, high-ranking officials pledged to shift their focus toward promoting consumption by applying strategic approaches, such as increasing spending on education and job creation. Contrastingly, they have been too cautious in their moves and have not yet created a specific target. In China, household consumption accounts for approximately 40% of the country’s GDP. This percentage is less than the global average of 56%, according to data from the World Bank. Additionally, it lags behind the nearly 60% observed in wealthier countries. Regarding the situation, economists from Morgan Stanley, including Robin Xing, stated in a report last week that they anticipate the main focus for policies will be technological self-sufficiency, innovation, and national security. At the same time, there might be some support for gradual reforms to social welfare. China undergoes nine consecutive quarters of deflation Overall, China’s economy appears strong this year, growing near the government’s target of about 5%. This has resulted from the strong performance of industries such as high-tech manufacturing, with exports reaching new highs. Still, beneath the surface, economic vulnerabilities are mounting. Declining prices and intense competition are eroding company profits, while consumer demand is waning. The housing market, on the other hand, remains weak, and investment is plummeting. New data next week will likely confirm that China has experienced nine consecutive quarters of deflation, a streak of falling prices not seen since the market-based reforms began in the late 1970s. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:5bacff32-abaf-4591-a7eb-259f581c4786-65"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> In related news, the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to present a united front and coordinate a short-term response to China’s export controls on rare earths. They also plan to diversify their supply chains, European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis announced Thursday. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, Dombrovskis stated that China now dominates the global supply chains for rare earths, with 80-90% of them sourced from China. “It was clear that G7 partners have shared concerns about those new extensive Chinese export controls, expanding both the scope of minerals covered, but also in terms of covering the value chain and having quite extensive extraterritorial provisions,” Dombrovskis said. He noted that they agreed on one hand to coordinate this work and their engagements with Chinese counterparts to seek some short-term solutions. Still, he added that they needed to continue the work, which is not new, on diversifying and enhancing the resilience of our supply chains. Get seen where it counts.

The value of the seized Bitcoin—around $15 billion—marks the largest forfeiture action in the DOJ’s history, underscoring the scale of global crypto-related financial crimes and the US government’s growing role in tracking and recovering digital assets. The indictment against Chen Zhi was unsealed this week in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, revealing details of a complex international fraud operation that targeted thousands of victims worldwide through sophisticated investment scams. Prosecutors allege that Chen and his associates laundered billions in stolen funds through cryptocurrency exchanges and shell companies before the assets were traced and frozen. This latest seizure adds to the already significant Bitcoin reserves held by the US government from past enforcement actions, including those tied to the Silk Road, Bitfinex hack, and other major cases. In total, US holdings now exceed 316,000 BTC, valued at nearly $36 billion at current prices, making the government one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. US Government’s Bitcoin Holdings Grow After Historic Seizure CryptoQuant reports that the US government now controls 316,760 BTC, worth roughly $35.9 billion, following its latest seizure from Chen Zhi’s “pig butchering” scam. The 127,195 BTC confiscated in this case alone—currently valued at $13.2 billion—marks the largest single Bitcoin seizure ever conducted by the Department of Justice. At Bitcoin’s peak earlier this year, those same holdings were worth around $15.5 billion. This operation cements the US as one of the largest known Bitcoin holders, with its wallet comprising assets from several major law enforcement actions over the past decade. The most significant components include: Bitfinex Hack (2016) — Law enforcement recovered 106,910 BTC stolen from the crypto exchange after a multi-year investigation. The funds were linked to Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, who laundered billions before being arrested in 2022. Silk Road (2013) — The government confiscated 81,988 BTC from the dark web marketplace operated by Ross Ulbricht. This remains one of the earliest and most famous crypto seizures. Potapenko/Turogin (2022) — A smaller seizure of 667 BTC connected to Estonian nationals accused of running a $575 million crypto fraud through shell mining services. Together, these seizures highlight how the US has quietly become a major Bitcoin whale—a position gained not through investment, but through relentless enforcement and asset recovery in the digital age. Bitcoin Holds Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $111,142, showing signs of stabilization after last week’s flash crash that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The 12-hour chart reveals that BTC has found temporary support near the $110,000 zone, which has acted as a key demand area multiple times since mid-September. This range now serves as a battleground between cautious buyers and sellers capitalizing on market weakness. However, BTC remains below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, both currently converging around $114,000–$116,000, creating strong short-term resistance. The 200-day (red) moving average sits near $112,000, slightly above current levels, signaling that the broader trend is still fragile. A clean break above these levels could open the path toward $117,500, but failure to regain momentum may expose BTC to another test of $108,000–$110,000. Trading volumes remain elevated but slightly cooling compared to last Friday’s capitulation event, suggesting consolidation rather than panic. Overall, Bitcoin appears to be in a recovery phase, though the lack of directional conviction indicates that traders are waiting for stronger catalysts — whether from macro data, ETF flows, or on-chain signals — before taking decisive positions.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Done Some Net Distribution According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin’s key investor tier is starting to show signs of slight profit-taking. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures the total amount of the supply that investors belonging to a particular wallet segment are currently holding. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Now Control 44% Of Realized Cap, Highest Ever Addresses or holders are divided into these groups based on the number of tokens present in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all investors owning between 1 and 10 BTC. In the context of the current discussion, a broad range of 10 to 10,000 coins is of focus. It converts to $1.1 million at the lower end and $1.1 billion at the upper end. Given this scale, the range would naturally cover some of the key Bitcoin investor cohorts like the sharks and whales. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the range over the last few months. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 coins group saw a drop of 17,554 BTC (about $1.9 billion) between October 12th and 14th. Before this decline, the metric had been in an uptrend since late August. The cryptocurrency’s recovery attempt has fizzled out since this selloff occurred, so it would appear possible that the profit-taking from the sharks and whales could, in part, be behind the bearish action. On a more long-term scale, though, this latest distribution spree from the key investors isn’t too significant, as their wallets have still grown since the start of 2025 by 318,610 BTC, worth a whopping $35.5 billion. A similar light profit-taking event took place in late August, following which the sharks and whales quickly corrected course and resumed accumulation. This buying then supported BTC’s bullish push. Wallet balance is just one way to classify holders. Another popular methodology in on-chain analysis is using holding time to separate investors between short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). The cutoff between the two cohorts is 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? The STHs may be considered to represent the fickle-minded side of the market, while the LTHs are resolute diamond hands. These HODLers have been selling recently, however, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared in an X post. A net 265,715 BTC has exited the wallets of the Bitcoin LTHs over the past 30 days, which is the largest monthly outflow since early January.

This deep split in sentiment comes after a volatile start to what is support to be a bullish month, with Bitcoin struggling to find footing after a steep plunge triggered by escalating trade fears. The beloved ‘Uptober’ kicked off with strength as buyers rushed into Bitcoin while uncertainty loomed over a possible U.S. government shutdown. But last Friday out of anywhere, everything flipped. Prices fell hard (from $121,000 down to $104,000) after President Donald Trump last out at China’s Xi Jnping and vowed 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods. That single headline nuked the rally and sent crypto markets spiraling. Whale shorts $192M as Bitcoin crashes to $104K Bitcoin’s collapse came just as gold was breaking past $4,300 to hit fresh all-time highs. While the yellow metal surged more than 17% in the last month, Bitcoin has fallen 8%, unable to claw back Friday’s losses. Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, explained the shift in capital, saying: “Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile.” He added that central banks are acting as structural buyers, giving gold a backstop that Bitcoin currently lacks. Sean still expects investors to rotate into Bitcoin eventually, but for now, the capital is riding gold’s momentum. On Thursday, Bitcoin was trading near $108,000, but the earlier collapse exposed deeper cracks. In a market note, Ed Yardeni, a longtime Wall Street strategist, broke down the chaos: “The crypto derivatives ecosystem exacerbated Bitcoin’s recent fall,” he wrote. “During the abrupt drop, liquidity dried up, with over $19 billion in liquidations across crypto futures and leveraged positions.” And the whales were watching. One wallet scooped up nearly $192 million by shorting Bitcoin before the crash. That same wallet made another bearish move late Sunday, adding even more weight on the downside. Analysts stick to $165K calls as gold passes $4,379 Bulls had reasons to be hopeful at the start of October. Over the past 12 years, Bitcoin has gone up in 10 of them during this month, based on Compass Point Research data. Plus, it had just hit a fresh high above $126,000. Alongside metals, it was part of the so-called “debasement trade”—a play against fiat currencies losing value. But that trade has now flipped, with gold stealing the spotlight. Despite all that, banks are still holding onto bullish forecasts. JPMorgan expects Bitcoin to reach $165,000 by year-end. Citi projects $133,000 in that same timeframe, and $181,000 by 2026. But on the charts, none of that optimism has shown up yet. Meanwhile, gold keeps making new all-time highs. The precious metal topped $4,379 yesterday before easing slightly back to $4,350. Year-to-date, gold is up up over 50%, which is more than double Bitcoin’s 20% return in 2025. This gap made Ed call gold the “new bitcoin,” claiming it’s the better safe haven and predicting that the precious metal will hit $5,000 in 2026, and even $10,000 before the decade ends. HSBC raised its gold forecasts, now predicting an average price of $3,355 in 2025, and $3,950 for 2026, pointing to strong buying from central banks and growing macro uncertainty. In any case, the market-moving influence of a worsening trade conflict between China and America makes it harder to declare the sell-off a turning point for crypto or a peak bitcoin moment. If the dispute over critical minerals restrictions leads to a massive escalation in tariffs come Nov. 1, investors — crypto and otherwise — are in for more pain. And bitcoin and its lesser altcoin peers don’t have the corporate earnings to cushion a deteriorating macroeconomic picture.

A team of analysts led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou claimed in a note released on Thursday that evidence suggests a significant deleveraging event is underway within perpetual futures, a favored tool among native cryptocurrency investors. Traditional market participants trading regulated products, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs or CME futures, didn’t panic as much. The data from JPMorgan depicts the resilience of investors in exchange-traded funds. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 220 million in outflows between October 10 and October 14, or 0.14% of their assets under management. Withdrawals from Ethereum ETFs were a little higher, at $370 million (1.23% of AUM). JPMorgan analysts said the figures suggested that ETF investors, typically retail and institutional players with longer-term horizons, did not engage in panic selling during the market downturn. Futures numbers proved that CME Bitcoin futures, a popular trading ground for institutional investors, experienced minimal liquidations during the week. Selling was a bit heavier in CME Ethereum futures, but this was due more to algorithmic and quantitative traders (not large funds) cutting risk in response to increased volatility, JPMorgan said. Those trends, the analysts said, underscore a critical shift in the market’s structure: Institutional and regulated investors are no longer driving violent price swings. Instead, that role has fallen back on “crypto-native” players operating in offshore and unregulated markets. Perpetual futures signal sharp deleveraging Although ETFs and CME futures were holding up, perpetual futures—an instrument that enables continual leveraged betting on cryptocurrency prices—tumbled significantly. Open interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures decreased by around 40% in dollar terms, exceeding the actual decline in the spot price, according to JPMorgan. That sharp drop implies that traders had been forced to unwind positions as prices fell, adding momentum to the selloff. The analysts said the trends suggested large-scale deleveraging by so-called crypto-native investors, many of whom trade on offshore platforms with high leverage. This crew, rather than ETF or CME traders, was the principal driver of the liquidation cascade, they added. The correction on Friday, October 11, resulted in the liquidation of more than $20 billion in long positions from over 1.5 million traders, according to Coinglass data. The selloff was the largest liquidation event in crypto’s history, surpassing even the May 2021 crash. Some of the catalyst was geopolitical news. Markets were in turmoil after President Donald Trump announced that he would impose 100% tariffs on Chinese tech imports, triggering a wave of selling across risk assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins all fell as traders sought to cover losses. By the following Monday, Bitcoin had briefly fallen below $106,000 before rebounding partially. It was trading near $108,500 on Friday, approximately 2.5% lower than its value over the previous 24 hours. Analysts reaffirm crypto fundamentals amid shaky sentiment Still, with the record-setting liquidation, JPMorgan said the damage is concentrated more on speculators than on longer-term investors. Institutional flows from an ETF lens are steady, and on-chain data show no major outflows from cold wallets or custodial platforms, where large long-term holders typically store their holdings. However, market sentiment remained fragile. The episode showed that leverage funding and momentum trading were still driving crypto markets, JPMorgan said, and that volatility was likely to remain high until more institutional engagement and oversight of offshore exchanges became common. Investors and analysts are now watching to see if Bitcoin can establish a foothold above $100,000, a key psychological level for many traders, and whether leveraged positions start to accumulate again in the weeks ahead.

The CNBC host warned that a wave of bad bank loans is now pushing Jerome Powell into a corner, one where cutting rates fast might be the only way to stop the bleeding. “Today got real ugly, but at least we finally have something that can make the Federal Reserve itchy to cut interest rates sooner rather than later: bank loans gone bad,” Jim said. “Nothing motivates the Fed to move faster than credit losses, because they’re a definitive sign that the economy is going south.” US stock markets sink as bank losses pile up Thursday’s market session was a bloodbath for the trading floor, led by a brutal selloff in bank stocks as earnings seasons kick off with beats across JPMorgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.7%, the S&P 500 plunged by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped by 0.5%, led by a brutal selloff in bank stocks, as shown by data from TradingView. The sell pressure came after investors panicked over the health of regional banks’ lending businesses, which are suddenly looking way shakier than anyone expected. The biggest shock came from two auto-related firms, Tricolor and First Brands, both of which filed for bankruptcy this week. Then came the dominoes. Zions Bancorporation reported a $50 million loss tied to two commercial loans on Wednesday night, and by Thursday, Western Alliance was claiming a borrower had committed fraud. So its been a week packed with red flags, and as Jim put it, “the banking system has provided us with enough questionable credits in one week’s time” to make Powell’s hand tremble over the rate-cut lever. Lower interest rates usually spark the economy back to life, but Jim reminded everyone that they also help borrowers avoid default, something the Fed can’t ignore right now. He’s convinced these credit cracks are the exact kind of pain that forces policymakers to act fast, no matter how loud the inflation hawks scream. The tone across Wall Street was fear and frustration. Investors are tired of watching the same credit risks reappear in new forms, especially in the private lending space. Those markets have been ballooning for years, and now that some of their loans are going sour, everyone’s realizing just how deep the rot might go. Jim also pointed to Jamie Dimon’s earlier warning that the bankruptcies in the auto sector were “like cockroaches – when you see one, there are probably more.” Dimon’s prediction aged fast. The sudden collapse of First Brands has already set off questions about how such a small auto-parts supplier managed to entangle billions of dollars across global banking and fund-management firms. Jim didn’t sound panicked, though. “Now, it’s possible there’s foul play involved in that multi-million problem of First Brands,” he said.

Machines that let people turn cash into crypto have grown fast, and regulators say the surge has put older and vulnerable users at particular risk. Regulators Tighten Rules Authorities have introduced a set of new controls aimed at cutting abuse. Based on reports, a cash cap of AUD5,000 per transaction is now in place for many ATMs. Operators are being told to strengthen identity checks, add clear scam warnings on the machines, and file more reports when activity looks suspicious. AUSTRAC has set up a task force to inspect providers and press compliance where it is missing. Scams Hit Older People Hard The harm is already real. Reports have disclosed that around 150,000 transactions flow through crypto ATMs each year, moving roughly AUD275 million in total. About 99% of those are cash deposits. In Tasmania, police say 15 people lost a combined AUD2.5 million in recent schemes and one person lost about AUD750,000; the average age of victims in that case was about 65. Many of the cases involve callers who pressure or trick victims into sending cash to a machine and then transferring the funds overseas. Enforcement And Gaps Police and AUSTRAC have been refusing renewals for noncompliant operators and running targeted investigations. Still, enforcement faces limits. The number of machines has ballooned — estimates put them at roughly 1,600–1,800+ across the country — and some providers were found not to be doing proper identity checks or transaction monitoring. That makes it hard to police every kiosk, and it leaves room for criminals to move quickly. Risks For Victims And The System Once cash is converted and moved on-chain, it is often hard to reverse. Funds can be mixed, sent through multiple wallets or routed abroad. That makes recovery difficult, especially when recipient addresses tie into overseas services that do not cooperate with Australian authorities. Regulators warn that while ATMs have legitimate uses — for people who prefer cash or lack access to online services — the machines’ anonymity and instant transfers create a high abuse risk.

Verified Audit and Analyst Reports Say It’s Legit,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/magacoin-finance-scam-or-real-verified-audit-and-analyst-reports-say-its-legit/,"With numerous new crypto projects emerging, investors are increasingly asking: Is this token genuine or just another short-term hype? People are now talking about MAGACOIN FINANCE – a fast-rising altcoin – which is an impressive project with substantial presale numbers and a buzzing community. MAGACOIN FINANCE does not appear like many early-stage tokens, which either vanish quickly or raise alarm bells. Backed by an audit that verifies its legitimacy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is supported by a firm conviction from analysts who follow new coins with potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming more and more recognized as a credible project. This article will explore why that is the case, what the audit shows and how MAGACOIN FINANCE is building trust in arguably the most difficult market in crypto history. What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE? MAGACOIN FINANCE is a community-driven digital asset project that has been growing steadily since the launch of its presale. The structure of this project is focused on transparency, accessibility and long-term community value. This formula appeals to new investors in an uncertain market. The project stands out for building an ecosystem reliant on verifiable credibility. The public audit of ongoing presale updates on its official website is cleverly designed to instil confidence in investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is neither a speculative meme coin nor an unaudited DeFi project. Instead, its transparency was intentional, to grow gradually. Verified Audit Confirms Transparency and Security One of the clearest signs that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a legitimate project is its independent audit verification. The project secured an audit from Hashex, a well-known and respected smart contract auditing firm that has previously audited many serious projects. The audit established that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract is safe, appropriately configurable, and free from vulnerabilities that could compromise user funds. This part is valuable for presale investors, as it demonstrates that the team implemented security measures earlier to ensure the proper safety of funds. Crypto audits are a crucial process for building trust in a cryptocurrency. MAGACOIN FINANCE has chosen to undergo auditing, setting it apart from many unverified presales that opt for transparency to save time. The analysts who looked over the report said that the contract had no significant problems and worked as investors expected. Growing Market Confidence and Analyst Endorsements Crypto analysts and community trackers have continued to cover MAGACOIN FINANCE for one key reason: consistency. Since the beginning of the presale, the business has provided public and verifiable data on its progress and fundraising. According to the most recent report, the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has surpassed $16 million, attracting both retail and larger investors and diversifying from established assets like Ethereum and Solana. Analysts describe the project as a credible early-stage investment that reflects many of the features common in legitimate, long-term crypto ecosystems: Transparent communication through verified channels. Real-time tracking on its official presale dashboard. Active social communities that engage in meaningful discussions rather than hype. Moreover, experts suggest that the project’s measured marketing and audit-backed foundation position it among the few early-stage altcoins maintaining positive market sentiment amid volatile conditions. Community Growth and Ecosystem Engagement The MAGACOIN FINANCE community has become a significant strength of MAGACOIN FINANCE beyond audits and analyst opinions. The project is followed by thousands of users on several social media platforms, where most engagement concerns shared excitement, presale milestones, and long-term vision. The team has always encouraged transparency, responding to investor queries in public settings and updating users on presale status in real-time. Very few early-stage crypto projects allow customers to reach out to the CEO with queries, making MAGACOIN FINANCE’s accessibility rare. The reports from the community reveal that presale participants have found the process of purchasing easy and secure. This is possible due to the connection to the wallet built in the official website and its compatibility with multiple devices. How MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Investor Trust Trust in crypto doesn’t come from hype — it comes from verified steps that show a project is committed to long-term value. MAGACOIN FINANCE builds that trust through a combination of factors: Verified Audit: The Hashex audit confirms the project’s code security and smart contract reliability. Official Website Transparency: The presale dashboard at MAGACOINFINANCE.com provides live fundraising data, real-time stage updates, and secure wallet connections. Community Accountability: Open communication through social platforms keeps users informed and engaged. No Hidden Promises: Unlike scams that rely on unrealistic projections, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on steady community growth and verifiable development milestones. These attributes together form a blueprint for credibility that separates legitimate crypto projects from those built purely for speculation. Why Analysts Consider It Legit When evaluating potential “scam or real” tokens, analysts often focus on three primary pillars: transparency, third-party verification, and execution. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all three boxes. Transparency: All presale information, wallet details, and stage progress are publicly available. Verification: The Hashex audit acts as a third-party validation of its smart contract. Execution: The project has delivered consistent updates and achieved measurable progress toward its roadmap goals. Because of this structured approach, analysts are increasingly categorizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a legit project , especially compared to the wave of unaudited presales that frequently collapse post-launch. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different from Typical Presales The crypto space is full of presale projects that promise an almost immediate return on investment, but few have the data and accountability behind the claims. MAGACOIN FINANCE is less focused on speculation but on sustainability. Its early fundraising success, combined with a clear commitment to investor safety and transparency, demonstrates a roadmap grounded in fundamentals, not hype. With good security, open communication and developer verification, the project is creating the conditions for its longevity while many other projects fail to survive their first cycle. Is MAGACOIN FINANCE a Scam? The Verdict Following an audit, community engagement and consistent presale milestones, there is no evidence proving MAGACOIN FINANCE is a scam. The project’s confirmed audit, visible presale activity, and growing analyst recognition all add to its legitimacy. All crypto investments come with risk. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the characteristics of a genuine, transparent, and secure project. As with any venture, due diligence is always critical, but all the signs so far indicate authenticity and not a scam. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project striving to earn trust, a rare commodity in the industry. Step by step, it’s growing credibility, as confirmed by an independent audit, which is backed by analysts and has an active community. Investors are wondering whether MAGACOIN FINANCE is real or a scam. We have all the data available for you. The project audit and updates are also available. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as major proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

In addition to these established coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a low-cap presale worth considering, as it continues to gain momentum from investors and community-driven fundamentals. XRP Holds Institutional Ground Although there was a drop from $2.49 to $2.41 as the leverage got unwound and institutions sold, XRP held firm. Institutional investments via ETFs and long-term acquisitions support the asset’s bullish structure. XRP has the potential to recover towards $3.80 to $4.20 as long as the market volatility is reduced. XRP Price Chart: CoinMarketCap XRP’s strong catalyst is regulatory certainty. There are increasing filings for the ETF and continued inflows from institutional investors, which highlight Ripple’s emergence as a go-to option for institutions when it comes to cross-border payments globally. As a result, analysts still see XRP as one of the best-performing institutional-grade cryptos heading into 2025. Cardano (ADA) Maintains Technical Strength Cardano remains very steady and fundamentally very strong, currently trading at $0.80 – $0.87. Experts note that whales have recently increased their ADA holdings, while on-chain data indicates that staking participation continues to rise. The future governance, along with scaling changes under the Hydra plan, multiples the long-term potential of ADA. Many strategists belonging to the market are listing Cardano among the most undervalued large-cap cryptos that can outperform – if and when institutions start looking for cheap altcoins that have a viable ecosystem. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Market Resilience Avalanche (AVAX) is holding strong at around $22.81 amid recent fluctuations. There’s a strong institutional interest that continues with liquidity injection to its DeFi and gaming ecosystem. Avalanche’s features help developers create customised blockchains. This enhances scalability and adoption of this network. Market analysts expect AVAX to once again test the $30 level if the broader market sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Low-Cap Presale Gaining Market Attention Apart from the established players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting market attention as one of 2025’s best low-cap presale opportunities. The project has garnered significant interest from investors, with thousands worldwide having purchased more than $16 million worth of tokens. According to analysts, following the exchange listing, there is a possibility of 75x to 100x returns on investment due to Scarcity-Based Tokenomics and its verified smart contract, along with dual audit by Hashex. These validations strengthen the trust of investors, making it one of the top low cap presale launches this year Conclusion XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche have shown persistent resilience, supported by long-term investor confidence and institutional inflows, as well as technical strength. The booming ETF of XRP, along with developments on the ADA ecosystem and the growing use cases of AVAX in DeFi, affirm their potential as foundational assets for a diversified portfolio. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the leading low-cap presale for 2025 — a promising project combining verified security, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and rising investor engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review.

Traders are watching closely to see if the bulls can defend this level and set the stage for a potential comeback. Solana Begins A Healthy Pullback After Recent Rally In a recent update, BitGuru highlighted that Solana (SOL) appears to be entering a healthy pullback phase following a sharp rally and partial recovery. This retracement is part of a natural market rhythm, allowing the asset to cool off after its recent burst of bullish momentum. Such pauses often serve as a foundation for more sustainable future growth, rather than signaling weakness. Related Reading: Historic Liquidation Event Highlights Solana Resilience Against Ethereum, Which Is Leading? While SOL’s price is hovering around the $203 mark, it is also facing strong resistance near $210. The market structure remains constructive, with buyers still active, though slightly cautious after the recent volatility. Should bulls manage to hold their ground and push through $210, BitGuru suggested that Solana could target the $225–$230 region in the short term. Conversely, if the price fails to clear resistance and loses support, a brief consolidation between $190 and $210 could follow. Short-Term Bearish Momentum Takes Hold Below Key Averages In a recent post, crypto analyst BeLaunch shared insights on Solana’s current price action, noting that the asset is showing signs of a short-term pullback following its strong rally. At the time of analysis, SOL’s price was trading around $199.45, marking a 1.84% gain, though still below its daily high of $208.91. The move reflects a mild cooling period after an upward surge. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher Again – Has It Finally Found Its Short-Term Bottom? From a technical perspective, the price of Solana has dipped below key moving averages, indicating a shift toward short-term bearish momentum. The asset is currently testing a key support zone near $195.53. However, BeLaunch observed that the recent decline came on lower trading volume, suggesting that selling pressure might be easing rather than intensifying. According to the analyst, Solana’s structure points to a phase of consolidation rather than a full reversal. The price action appears to be forming a base after its breakout run, giving the market room to breathe before its next move. BeLaunch concluded that a sustained hold above $195 could trigger a rebound, potentially setting the stage for Solana to retest higher resistance levels near $210 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below this level could lead to a deeper retracement. However, in the broader outlook, the current weakness may represent a healthy reset within a larger bullish structure rather than a bearish trend reversal.

The company is creating what it calls a digital-asset treasury, or DAT, which will be stacked with XRP. The money will come through a SPAC deal, and Ripple also plans to put in some of its own XRP tokens, according to a report by Bloomberg. This plan hasn’t been finalized yet.A few details, including Ripple’s full contribution and the structure of the fundraising, are still being discussed. But the end goal is clear: Ripple wants to bulk up its XRP reserves fast and on its own terms, while the industry is still struggling to recover. Ripple buys GTreasury, pushes ahead with SPAC while markets drop The fundraising comes just days after a market crash that triggered massive liquidations. The sell-off, which was worsened by the growing U.S.–China trade tensions, caused serious panic across altcoins. Even Bitcoin dropped more than 3% on Thursday, showing the market isn’t done bleeding. That hasn’t stopped Ripple from moving forward. If the plan works, this would be the largest XRP-focused treasury ever created. At the same time, Cryptopolitan reported on Thursday that Ripple is buying GTreasury for $1 billion. GTreasury is a company that builds tools for finance teams to manage crypto holdings like stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and other assets. Ripple said the deal will help it work more closely with corporate treasurers who want better crypto infrastructure. Still, investors don’t seem too excited about DATs lately. Shares of big crypto-holding firms like Strategy Inc., run by Michael Saylor, and Metaplanet in Japan have dropped sharply in recent months. Most people are backing off after watching Bitcoin and altcoins get hammered. That makes Ripple’s timing all the more unusual. But XRP has held up better than most. So far in 2025, the token has risen 13%, while Bitcoin is up 16%. Ripple already holds 4.74 billion XRP in its wallets, worth around $11 billion, based on recent prices. The company also has 35.9 billion XRP locked up in on-ledger escrows, which release on a monthly basis. Crypto treasuries slow down as Ripple builds its own stash This year, more than 300 public companies are holding Bitcoin through crypto treasury vehicles, many of which were created using SPACs or reverse mergers. But the buying is slowing fast. In August, firms bought just 14,800 Bitcoin, down from 66,000 in June. The average purchase size dropped to 343 Bitcoin, a huge fall from earlier highs. Back in March, Bitcoin accumulation was growing at 163%, but by August, that number was just 8%. So far, XRP hasn’t seen that kind of institutional action. Few companies have taken major stakes in the token. One rare case is VivoPower International Plc, a clean-energy firm that raised $121 million in May to move into XRP. Most treasuries remain focused on Bitcoin. While Ripple prepares its SPAC-driven fundraising push, others in the space are trying new strategies. Some crypto lenders and derivatives firms have been building out creative financing tools like Bitcoin-backed loans, convertible token deals, and structured crypto payouts. These setups offer more speed and freedom than banks can, but they’re also risky. In fact, some of these strategies have become dangerous games. Traders are now betting on short-term yields, giving up long-term upside just to stay afloat. It’s turned into a tightrope walk for some treasury managers; they’re stacking volatile assets on top of even riskier structures, with barely any room for error.

G20 Watchdog Warns of Global Crypto Regulation Gaps The G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB) has warned that major gaps remain in how countries regulate cryptocurrencies, despite the market’s value doubling to $4 trillion over the past year.

FSB Secretary General John Schindler emphasized the need for global cooperation, citing the ease of cross-border crypto transfers and the growing link between digital assets and traditional finance. While risks are limited for now, the FSB cautioned they could rise as adoption deepens. G20 risk watchdog warns of ‘significant gaps’ in global crypto rules https://t.co/aACigdhMyB — The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) October 16, 2025 Bitcoin traded near $108,690, largely unaffected by the report. Analysts viewed the FSB’s call for unified oversight as a positive step toward establishing clearer global standards for cryptocurrency regulation. Babylon Labs Unveils Trustless Bitcoin DeFi on Ethereum Babylon Labs has introduced a new system that allows users to borrow on Ethereum using native Bitcoin as collateral, without relying on centralized bridges or intermediaries. The mechanism, powered by BitVM3 technology, secures BTC in cryptographically verified vaults. We've completed the first Trustless Vaults experiment. We successfully borrowed USDC against native BTC on Ethereum Mainnet with @MorphoLabs . BTC is the largest capital pool in crypto and has been cut off from DeFi. We solved this. This is a historic moment. The experiment https://t.co/Lgj0x8nCEM pic.twitter.com/sJftfNJihX — Babylon (@babylonlabs_io) October 16, 2025 An experimental version, VaultBTC, is currently being tested on the Morpho lending protocol. While the system is largely trustless, analysts note that its liquidation process still depends partly on authorized liquidators and trusted oracles. The launch reflects growing efforts to integrate Bitcoin into decentralized finance. Analysts say expanding Bitcoin’s role beyond payments and storage could strengthen long-term demand, as BTC held steady near $108,690. Zeta Network Raises $230M with BTC-Backed Private Sale Zeta Network, a Nasdaq-listed company, has raised $230.8 million through a private share sale, accepting both Bitcoin (BTC) and SolvBTC, a wrapped BTC token from Solv Protocol. The firm issued new shares and warrants while adding Bitcoin-based assets to its treasury, reinforcing confidence in BTC’s long-term value and scarcity. Solv Protocol CEO Ryan Chow said more public companies are finding innovative ways to hold Bitcoin, aligning with the growing demand for BTC yield products such as Coinbase’s Bitcoin yield fund and BlackRock’s proposed Bitcoin income ETF. Zeta’s Bitcoin-backed fundraising boosted market sentiment, with BTC trading near $108,700 as investors viewed the move as another sign of accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Descending Channel Hints at Drop Toward $103,500 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remains range-bound below $110,000, facing difficulty regaining upward traction after multiple failed attempts above $109,600. The chart outlines a potential triple-bottom formation, but persistent rejection near $110,500 and a descending triangle breakout highlight weakening buyer momentum. A bearish crossover between the 20- and 50-period EMAs adds pressure, signaling continued downside risk. The RSI near 42 stays below its midpoint, indicating a lack of buying strength. Price action shows lower highs and no clear bullish engulfing candle to confirm a reversal. If BTC fails to break above $110,500, a move toward $107,300 appears likely, followed by deeper supports at $105,200 and $103,500 key levels where buyers have historically stepped in. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin continues to trade below a descending triangle pattern, with TradingView projections suggesting a possible retest. A decisive close above $112,700 would invalidate the bearish bias, opening a path toward $114,600 and $117,600. Traders may look for short setups below $109,500, targeting $107,300, while long positions are better placed above $112,700. Despite near-term weakness, analysts expect Bitcoin’s broader uptrend to hold, with a potential Q4 rebound once consolidation resolves. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013115 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

XRP remains among the top in PayFi (payment-focused finance), but new players like Remittix (RTX) are beginning to make some noise with fresh tech and useful payment options. Since investors are looking beyond hype to real-world use cases of a project, the competition for control of global crypto payments is becoming tangible, and Remittix’s rapid progress is difficult to ignore. XRP Price Movement and Market Position As of writing, XRP currently trades for $2.45, down 1.44% for the day. Market cap is $147.04 billion, and volume 24 hours is around $5.83 billion, down 3.06%. Ripple still dominates the institutional payment networks and retains partnerships across the banking sector but has growing competition in the PayFi space on the horizon. Many traders still view Ripple as a leader among payment-focused cryptos. However, newer DeFi projects with integrated crypto-to-fiat solutions, such as Remittix (RTX), are demonstrating that faster, more accessible on-chain payments could reshape how the next generation of global transfers operate. Why Remittix Is Drawing PayFi Attention Remittix (RTX) is one of the best crypto presales of 2025, already raising over $27.5 million and selling more than 678.8 million tokens at $0.1166 each . The project offers an advanced crypto-to-fiat bridge that enables users to send assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. It positions itself as a cross-chain DeFi project targeting the $19 trillion payments industry. Remittix has reached multiple key milestones, including verified listings with BitMart and LBank coming soon, and a CertiK verification that ranked it #1 globally for pre-launch tokens. The Remittix wallet is already in beta testing, showing real product progress before token launch, a major contrast to many speculative projects. Key Factors Driving RTX Momentum CertiK Verified: Team fully verified and ranked #1 for pre-launch tokens $27.5M+ Raised: One of the fastest-growing crypto presales live now Global Payments Utility: Send crypto to fiat bank accounts instantly 50% Bonus Returns: Use code RTX50 before the $30M milestone $250,000 Giveaway: Ongoing community reward program Remittix is also fueling community expansion through its referral program, where users earn 15% of referred purchases in USDT, claimable every 24 hours. This incentive, paired with its real-world payment use case, has strengthened RTX’s reputation as a crypto with passive income potential and a low gas fee DeFi project built for scalability. The Road Ahead : Will Ripple or Remittix Lead PayFi in 2025? The XRP price continues to anchor Ripple as a reliable PayFi giant, but the ecosystem is facing fresh competition from newer models like Remittix, which combines DeFi accessibility with mainstream usability. With exchange listings and wallet beta already active, RTX is showing signs of becoming a next big altcoin of 2025. Whether Ripple maintains its lead or Remittix becomes the next 100x crypto, investors are clearly shifting toward crypto projects with real-world payment value. The race for PayFi dominance in 2025 is tightening, and Remittix’s rapid momentum suggests that the gap between established players and innovative newcomers may close sooner than expected.

The “Bitcoin for Signal” campaign suggests integrating the crypto through the Cashu protocol and its “Chaumian Ecash.” BTC developer Cashu shared the movement on X, and Dorsey reposted, saying, “@signalapp should use Bitcoin.” Bitcoin supporters push Signal to use BTC for private payments Many people already use Signal every day because it protects their conversations from being spied on and their data from being collected . Now, the campaign also aims to enable these users to send and receive money privately and securely. Supporters say people will be able to send money to each other instantly across the globe, without banks, middlemen, or extra apps, if the messaging app adds Bitcoin payments through the Cashu protocol. The message on the Bitcoin for Signal website says, “Bitcoin belongs in Signal. Cashu ecash enables truly private BTC payments inside the world’s most trusted encryption messenger.” People argue that the leading digital asset could also help the service become financially independent, as it currently relies on donations and external funding. With BTC payments, users can directly send small donations or “tips” inside the app to help Signal stay free and open. Co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, drew more attention to the campaign when he reposted Cashu’s message to his millions of followers and commented, “@signalapp should use Bitcoin.” Other popular figures, like Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, co-founder of Satoshi Labs, Pavol Rusnak, and the anonymous developer behind Cashu, Calle, have also expressed their support for the campaign. Peter Todd even criticized the app’s current payment option, MobileCoin (MOB), and said, “I’ve been wanting to try MobileCoin. But it’s such a failure I can’t even buy any. Signal App needs to accept reality and just add Bitcoin support.” The encrypted messaging service tested MobileCoin in April 2021 to see if people could send money privately through the app, but users and experts found problems with the system over time. MobileCoin is not as decentralized as BTC or other cryptocurrencies because it relies on a small group of computers, known as validators, to process transactions. Critics also argue that MobileCoin is difficult to purchase or use in most countries because it isn’t available on many exchanges. For this reason, most people believe it won’t grow or reach the large global audience that Signal already has, so they believe that replacing or adding BTC would address these problems. The app has approximately 70 million active users each month. According to analysts, it will instantly become one of the largest platforms for private, peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions if even a small portion of its users start sending the crypto through the app. Critics warn Bitcoin may weaken Signal’s privacy goals Some privacy experts, digital rights groups, and blockchain engineers say adding the crypto could actually weaken Signal’s strong reputation for privacy and security . According to them, BTC’s public blockchain could expose information that conflicts with the app’s main goal of keeping users completely anonymous. An engineer at Aztec Network, José Pedro Sousa, responded to Jack Dorsey’s post with a sharp question: “Jack, why use a fully public blockchain for a privacy chat? The digital rights group Techlore also warned that combining BTC payments with Signal could unintentionally create new privacy risks that the app was never designed to handle. They suggested that the messaging service consider using digital currencies like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), as they already have built-in privacy features. Other privacy-focused developers noted that anyone can analyze Bitcoin’s blockchain. However, privacy coins utilize advanced cryptographic techniques, such as “zero-knowledge proofs,” to conceal transaction details while still verifying that payments are valid. They say this technology would better align with Signal’s mission than relying on Bitcoin’s open and transparent system. Those who support the Cashu protocol defended their design, stating that it utilizes a system of BTC-backed “ecash” tokens to hold and send Bitcoin without their transactions appearing on the public blockchain. They added that people will be able to make payments privately inside Signal without their crypto addresses being exposed. However, many experts say Cashu and other ecash systems are still new and have not yet been tested on a large scale. Privacy researchers also warn that it takes years to build, test, and prove the safety of such systems. Signal might face bugs, scalability issues, or weaknesses that attackers could exploit if it rushes to integrate BTC through Cashu.

UPXI's value is heavily tied to its 2 million SOL holdings and staking yields, but dilution risk from 48 million registered shares limits upside. Legacy consumer product business continues to decline, raising concerns that future operations may require selling SOL or using staking rewards for expenses. I cautiously upgrade UPXI to 'hold,' as a potential mNAV re-rating could occur if SOL surges, but dilution and operational risks remain. Back in May, I initiated coverage of Upexi, Inc ( UPXI ) and called the stock a 'sell' due to its inflated valuation relative to the combo of its legacy business and its Solana ( SOL-USD ) themed DAT strategy. Since that 'sell' call, UPXI shares have fallen by as much as 70%. Currently, UPXI shares are just 40% off that mid-May sell call: Data by YCharts Given the fact that SOL is actually up 5% over that same stretch, I think it would be fair to call UPXI's performance as a SOL-proxy considerably poor over these last 5 months. As I said at the end of that May piece, good assets can be purchased at a bad price. And even though Upexi paid a great price for its SOL earlier this year, $10 for UPXI in May was a bad deal. At a price currently under $6, prospects look a lot better. Solana Strategy and mNAV Just as (Micro)Strategy ( MSTR ) had been able to do for the last several years, Upexi quickly scaled up its Solana holdings through various financial instruments like common stock and convertible note issuance. According to data tracked by Blockworks Research, Solana DATs hold roughly 15.8 million SOL combined. Solana DAT Supply (Blockworks) Of that combined SOL position through DAT companies, Upexi holds a little over 2 million SOL and is the fourth largest Solana-themed DAT in the market. The table below breaks down the value of Upexi's Solana relative to its current market capitalization and its post-share registration diluted market capitalization: mNAV Calculation Prior To Offering Offering Completion Shares 58,888,756 94,457,980 UPXI Price $5.61 $5.61 Solana 2,018,419 2,018,419 Solana Price $185 $185 Solana Value Per Share $6.34 $3.95 mNAV 0.88 1.42 Source: Upexi, Analyst's Calculation, $185 SOL price at article submission Utilizing a basic calculation alone, UPXI arguably looks cheap relative to its SOL holdings based on a $5.61 closing price and a $185 SOL price on October 16th. Things get a bit more murky due to the recent offering registration that could see as many as 48 million shares sold from buyers of Upexi's PIPE and convertible note. The problem for UPXI shareholders is the proceeds from the offered shares go to the selling stockholders rather than the company. Thus, this would be expansion of the float that wouldn't lead to SOL purchases for UPXI shareholders. Not included in that offering is roughly 5 million in additional shares through options, warrants, and other instruments: Excluded From Share Count UPXI Shares Options ($3.39 ex) 621,353 Warrants ($4.20 ex) 1,848,735 Debt Converts 186,667 Preferred Converts 138,889 RSU from Incentive Plan 2,250,000 Total 5,045,644 Source: Upexi Given those shares, we can calculate a fully diluted mNAV for UPXI at closer to 1.5. The justification for a fully diluted mNAV premium this large is debatable, in my view. The company has the ability to raise capital through its $500 million equity line. Raising capital in this way makes sense in a world where mNAV premium is extended. But I suspect as long as the stock trades at a discount to basic mNAV, diluting existing shareholders through that $500 million equity line is less likely. Especially considering such a large cohort of shareholders have registered their shares for sale, including CEO Allan Marshall - though he would retain the majority of his equity. As I see it, Upexi's immediate path to acquiring more SOL is likely limited to its staking strategy. Solana Staking Yield vs Staked SOL (StakingRewards) In Upexi's last earnings report, the company noted an 8% annualized yield from staking SOL. This yield has come down quite a bit since the end of Upexi's last reported quarter. Investors can think of the relation between staked assets and staking yields similarly to the way they would bonds or dividends; the more demand there is for yield, the lower the yield goes. Upexi's Staked SOL 2,018,419 Annual Yield as of 10/16 6.5% Annualized Return at $185 $24,271,488 Source: Analyst's calculations The good news is even at the current annualized SOL staking yield of 6.5%, 2 million staked SOL at a value of $185 per coin generates over $24 million in staking rewards. This would actually flip Upexi to a profitable company, all else being equal. Legacy Business It's important to remember that even though the company's equity valuation is now largely tied to the daily performance of Solana, Upexi continues to operate its legacy consumer product business. Even with roughly $1 million in digital asset revenue during the year ended June, Upexi still saw top line revenue decline year over year by 43% and lost $13.7 million during the fiscal year: 10-k (Upexi) $9.8 million of Upexi's $11.2 million decline in revenue year over year was due to its divesting of its re-commerce business. Still, this implies that even adjusting for the re-commerce portion, Upexi's owned-brand consumer product business looks to have contributed roughly $1.4 million to that year over year revenue decline. The point is, if Upexi continues to operate its consumer business, it could come at the expense of SOL holdings in the future either through liquidated staking rewards or capital raised through equity offerings going toward opex. Closing Thoughts As I see it, the potential headwind of 48 million shares coming into the float without leading to direct SOL purchases limits the upside of the stock. At a basic mNAV discount, Upexi theoretically has an incentive to sell Solana and buy back common shares if doing so could generate greater returns than the staking yield from the SOL. But I largely view such a strategy as unlikely. My expectation is UPXI will perform in correlation with SOL for the foreseeable future, but may continue to lag the underlying in the event large quantities of the registered shares are sold. I'll cautiously upgrade UPXI to a 'hold' due to the possibility that basic mNAV could re-rate from a discount to a premium in the event SOL surges in price. But I still don't personally have any interest in buying shares of UPXI at this point in time.",SOL-USD|UPXI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-17 03:41:00

Analysts now suggest that the contrast could mean that while markets are expanding rapidly, mainstream participation may still be in its infancy. Social Media Debates Whether the Bull Market Has Truly Begun Debate erupted on X after the official account of the crypto polling platform Kalshi noted that searches for “buy Bitcoin” have not matched the 2017 or 2021 highs, asking, “Has the bull market even started?” Indeed, data from Google Trends shows that interest in the search term in the U.S. is currently at a low level of 11, based on incomplete data for October 2025. This is nothing compared to the record high of 100 set in December 2017 or the reading of 45 during the bull run in February 2021. However, Google’s FAQ makes it clear that the data is based on a sample of searches and does not include low-volume terms. This means that it may not accurately reflect real-time interest, especially considering the shift in how users now search. Nonetheless, The Kobeissi Letter, a financial commentary account, still pointed out the paradox : “The market cap of crypto just exceeded a record $4 trillion. Yet, 75% of investors have zero exposure to crypto right now. We are still early.” Their post met a little pushback, with some people saying that search data might not be the best way to measure true adoption. One user mentioned that even 0.05% of ChatGPT’s estimated 2.5 billion daily prompts about crypto could equal 1.25 million Bitcoin-related queries, which traditional metrics might miss. BTC advocate “BitcoinVoter” added that a lot of people now know how to buy the OG cryptocurrency without needing Google. Meanwhile, market tracker “StockStormX” called search volume a “lagging indicator,” suggesting it often peaks when retail euphoria is at its highest. Bitcoin Outlook Looking at the market, CoinGecko data shows BTC trading at $111,053 at the time of this writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours and nearly 9% lower over the past seven days. This drop was triggered by a historic liquidation event on October 10, which saw over $19 billion in positions wiped out as Bitcoin fell from above $126,000 to around $101,000. The leading cryptocurrency remains about 12% below its all-time high set earlier this month, but despite the shakeout, the asset has demonstrated some resilience, maintaining a trading channel above $108,000 since mid-July. At the same time, the broader crypto market has rebounded to a total capitalization of $3.87 trillion, with BTC dominance steady at 57.3%.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the funds will be raised through a special purpose acquisition company structure, with Ripple contributing part of its own XRP. The treasury would become one of the largest corporate vehicles focused on XRP accumulation. Digital asset treasuries, or DATs, have become a growing trend among public companies seeking to diversify corporate reserves into cryptocurrencies. Over 200 of these entities now collectively hold more than $464b in digital assets, signaling a broad institutional shift toward crypto as an alternative balance-sheet asset. According to Bloomberg, Ripple Labs is leading a fundraising initiative of at least $1 billion, aiming to establish a new digital asset treasury to accumulate XRP. The funds will be raised through a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), and Ripple will also contribute a… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 17, 2025 Ripple’s $1B Bet Signals a Shift From Survival to Strategy in the Post-Selloff Era Ripple’s initiative comes despite fragile market conditions following a wave of liquidations that wiped out some $19b in leveraged positions . Its decision to press forward suggests confidence in XRP’s long-term utility across payments and liquidity solutions. Separately, Ripple agreed to acquire treasury management software provider GTreasury for $1b. The deal, announced Thursday, will give Ripple access to tools used by large corporates to manage tokenized deposits and stablecoins. The acquisition also strengthens Ripple’s relationships with finance chiefs looking to integrate digital assets into treasury operations, bridging traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Ripple Eyes Institutional Adoption, Positioning XRP Beside Bitcoin in Corporate Treasuries In July, Ripple held about 4.74b XRP in its wallets, valued near $11b at current prices. Another 35.9b coins remain locked in on-ledger escrow, set to release gradually each month. If successful, Ripple’s DAT would mark a milestone for XRP. While Bitcoin dominates corporate treasuries, XRP has yet to see similar institutional accumulation. Ripple’s move could reshape that narrative. Japan’s SBI Holdings is one of the few major institutions to use XRP within its internal treasury operations, leveraging it for cross-border liquidity. Other companies have followed suit with smaller funds, but none rival the scale Ripple now envisions. Its initiative could make XRP one of the first altcoins to achieve meaningful corporate treasury adoption. Bold Treasury Bid Challenges the Notion That Crypto Reserves Are Losing Steam The effort comes as investors debate the sustainability of digital-asset treasuries. Shares in crypto-heavy firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet have slipped amid volatility. Yet Ripple’s expansion signals that some players remain undeterred by short-term swings. If executed, the plan could cement Ripple as the largest institutional holder of XRP and potentially reshape how digital assets function as strategic reserves for corporations worldwide.

The purchases will begin “soon,” with future acquisitions depending on how the crypto market behaves. That announcement instantly sent Newsmax shares up 4.1% in after-hours trading, landing at $11.27. The decision makes Newsmax the first New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)-listed company to officially hold Trump Coin in its balance sheet. Chief Executive Christopher Ruddy explained that Trump Coin’s value “should track the success of the Trump presidency, which so far has been impressive.” Ruddy said the initiative aims to diversify corporate holdings and align with the growing crypto adoption taking place across U.S. institutions. Trump expands his wealth through massive crypto gains Last year, Donald Trump told a court he was nearly out of money. He warned that unless a $500 million civil penalty was reduced to around $100 million, he would have to liquidate his real estate empire to stay afloat. But in less than a year, everything has flipped. Trump is now both President of the United States and one of the wealthiest officeholders in modern history, his businesses booming both at home and abroad. While past presidents often gave up income for public service, Trump has used his position to generate extraordinary profits through business ventures. He has made tens of millions from selling branded bibles, sneakers, autographed guitars, and even cologne. Several social media and news outlets have also paid him hefty legal settlements, cases that most legal experts dismissed as weak. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, has reportedly signed a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, surpassing the going rate for similar projects in the streaming industry. The real story, though, lies in Trump’s growing crypto empire. According to a Financial Times investigation, the Trump family has made over $1 billion in pre-tax profits during the past year, largely fueled by the crypto rally that has defined his new term. And the $1 billiob doesn’t even include his unrealized gains, which have boosted his net worth on paper by billions more. His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social and a Bitcoin treasury business, is now worth roughly $1.9 billion. When asked by the Financial Times if those estimates were accurate, Eric Trump allegedly said the family’s total was “probably more,” hinting that the full scale of their crypto operations remains unknown. The Trump ecosystem spans memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, tokens, and even a DeFi platform, all wrapped in the family’s branding. Crypto-friendly policies reshape Washington Inside Washington, Trump has kept his campaign promise to become the “first crypto president.” He has ordered the formation of a national Bitcoin reserve, and installed crypto-supportive regulators across federal agencies. Under Trump’s new SEC chairman Paul Atkins, many investigations into major crypto companies like Kraken, Binance, BitMEX, Coinbase, Gemini, Tether, and Circle have been quietly dropped. The administration has also encouraged crypto companies that fled the U.S. under Joe Biden to return and restart operations there, aiming to beat China, as the president puts it. Over the past nine months, Bitcoin has broken about ten all-time highs, energizing markets and cementing the new administration’s influence on the global crypto sector. Executives from the largest crypto exchanges and blockchain firms have been seen visiting Trump’s White House, in what is seen as a deep integration of politics and crypto finance. “We’re going to be growing it even more. More than people thought,” said Trump about the crypto sector this summer. “It’s a really hot industry.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

53257027,607565,1760673620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53257027.jpeg,Ethereum Founder Buterin Stirs Up Bitcoin Core Vs. Knots Debate,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-bitcoin-core-vs-knots/,"Vitalik Buterin has waded into Bitcoin’s long-running dispute over “spam” policy and node software philosophy, amplifying a blistering post by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell that frames the controversy as a clash between open, market-driven neutrality and what he calls populist calls for censorship. “Greg Maxwell defends a principled commitment to freedom and open market-based resource allocation against the populist desire to censor the Current Hated Thing,” Buterin wrote on X, quote-tweeting BitMEX Research’s summary of “fighting talk” in the “Core v Knots” debate. Buterin Takes A Stance: Supports Bitcoin Core The immediate spark was a fresh message from Maxwell—posted “Today at 06:40:27 PM” on Bitcointalk—responding to pressure on Bitcoin Core maintainers to ship code perceived as filtering or degrading disfavored transaction types. Maxwell argues that Bitcoin Core’s position, “going all the way back to Satoshi , AFAICT,” is that “Bitcoin is a system secured by economics and self interest.” In his telling, proposals associated with Bitcoin Knots and its advocates amount to building “weapons that can be used against Bitcoin,” a direction he insists Core contributors will not take. Maxwell’s post is unsparing about both the substance and tone of the current push to constrain on-chain activity. “The knots vision of Bitcoin seems to be a system (in)secured by altruistic hope and populist theocracy—by cancel culture and paper straw bans,” he writes, adding that such campaigns “are really popular on social media and (I expect) a big fail in the real world.” He acknowledges widespread distaste among Core regulars for “NFT/shitcoin traffic,” but says that commitment to permissionless use must override aesthetic preferences: “Core’s commitment to individual freedom, self determination, and related principals is great enough that they recognize that some wasteful or stupid traffic is the cost of an open system, and that speculative small improvements related to ‘spam’ aren’t worth risking properties that underlie Bitcoin’s entire reason for existence.” The through-line of Maxwell’s argument is that the project must not bend to “would-be censors” merely because they are “loud and obnoxious,” deploy legal threats, or invite government action. Instead, contributors will “route around them by using and improving Bitcoin just as they would with the weapons of any other attacker.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin Core is not a vendor optimizing for customers, but a group building a network they themselves want to use: “The people who work on Bitcoin do so for themselves— to create and protect a system they want to use. They’re not making a product for customers… Everyone is invited to share in the benefits of their work if you want what they’ve created, sure. But they’re not going to work against their own interest in a open system secured by economics and resistant to human influence because of popular outcry.” That “not a product for customers” line quickly became a flashpoint. “Everyone who runs Core IS a customer. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read,” X user BaconBitz objected. Buterin, who had elevated the exchange earlier, pushed back on that framing with a terse aesthetic defense: “No, it’s a paragraph written by someone who understands that a good protocol is a work of art.” Maxwell also ties today’s agitation to a broader cultural reaction against the popularity of on-chain experiments. In his post, he argues that “filter fundamentalism is a thing at all” largely because of “the popular success of NFT/shitcoin bullshit,” and offers a pointed aside about Luke Dashjr’s long-standing advocacy for what Maxwell characterizes as “personal transaction morality police.” In a characteristically caustic turn, he suggests that advocacy recently “picked up a little traction” not just because of sentiment shifts but also funding dynamics, alleging “he got handed millions in charity investment after becoming an involuntary no-coiner, and now can pay people to work with him and promote his positions since few would previously do it voluntarily.” The backdrop to all of this is the practical question of what, if anything, Bitcoin Core should do at the code level to address surges in block space demand stemming from inscriptions, NFTs, or other fads that critics label “spam.” Maxwell’s answer is unequivocal: permissionless design and economic incentives are the defense, not discretionary filters . “It’s nothing new that there is a sizable portion of the population that understand ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it’ and a sizable (and vocal!) portion that don’t understand it or don’t agree with it.” In that spirit, he warns against meeting censors “half way” and rejects the idea that threats of state action should steer protocol stewardship.

Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash After touching an all-time high above $126,000, the world’s largest crypto asset has shed nearly 9% on the weekly charts, reflecting waning momentum amid broader market uncertainty and renewed U.S.–China trade tensions. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Momentum Fades Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $111,300, down roughly 1% in 24 hours, after briefly dipping to an intraday low of $110,292. Technical indicators show the asset under pressure, with the 20-day and 50-day moving averages turning lower and a bearish crossover emerging on the MACD. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to the mid-40s, signaling cooling buying strength and the potential for further downside if support fails. Analysts are eyeing $107,000–$110,000 as the crucial short-term demand zone. A decisive break below this area could open the path toward $100,000, while a bounce above $115,000–$123,000 would be needed to restore bullish sentiment. “Bitcoin’s structure suggests fatigue at the top, with a potential double-top formation visible around $126,000,” one market analyst noted. “A weekly close below $110K would likely trigger broader profit-taking.” Whales Turn Cautious, Bitcoin ETF Inflows Slow On-chain data indicates that BTC whales have increased short exposure, signaling caution among large holders. This aligns with reports of falling ETF inflows, which declined by over $223 million this week after surging more than $2.7 billion the week before. Analysts suggest this cooldown reflects a pause in institutional demand following months of aggressive accumulation. Meanwhile, traders are closely watching macro developments, as gold’s rally to a record $4,200 has drawn some capital away from Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. Weak U.S. data and tariff-related volatility have added pressure, pushing some investors back toward traditional safe havens. Analysts Warn of Rising Wedge Breakdown Technically, Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a rising wedge pattern, often a bearish setup. If BTC closes the week below $110,000, the structure projects a potential downside target around $74,000, representing a 34% correction. However, long-term metrics such as hash rate and network activity remain strong, suggesting that any deep retracement could offer a buying opportunity for patient investors. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash For now, Bitcoin’s next move hinges on whether bulls can defend the $110K floor. A strong rebound from here could set the stage for another attempt toward $126K, but failure to hold support risks ushering in a much sharper correction before the next major rally begins.

Republican Representative Webster Barnaby filed the new proposal, known as House Bill 183, after his previous bill was withdrawn earlier this year. Expanding Florida’s Investment Scope HB 183, introduced Wednesday, would authorize the State Board of Administration and other public entities to invest up to 10% of their portfolios in digital assets. These could include Bitcoin, crypto securities, exchange-traded products, NFTs, and other blockchain-based investments. Barnaby’s new version strengthens rules around custody, documentation, and fiduciary duties, ensuring secure management of any digital holdings. The lawmaker also broadened the scope of eligible assets beyond Bitcoin-only exposure, aiming to give Florida greater flexibility in diversifying its reserve strategy. If approved, the measure would take effect on July 1, 2026. Crypto Reserve Bills Face National Challenges Despite the growing interest in crypto reserves, only three U.S. states — Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas — have successfully passed similar legislation. New Hampshire’s HB 302 allows up to 5% of public funds to be invested in digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion, currently limited to Bitcoin. Texas’ Senate Bill 21 established a Bitcoin-only reserve, while Arizona’s HB 2749 permits digital asset reserves only from unclaimed property. Barnaby’s Florida proposal would make it the first major state economy to pursue a diversified crypto investment policy. Additional Bill Targets Stablecoin Regulation In a related move, Barnaby also filed HB 175 to simplify the regulatory landscape for stablecoin issuers operating in Florida. The bill specifies that stablecoin providers fully backed by U.S. dollars or Treasury securities should not require separate state licenses. It also mandates monthly audits to ensure reserves are fully collateralized and publicly verifiable. Like the crypto reserve bill, HB 175 is scheduled to take effect in July 2026. California Strengthens Crypto Property Rights Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation last week protecting unclaimed digital assets from being automatically converted to cash. Senate Bill 822 ensures that unclaimed crypto holdings remain in their original form under state custody. The law allows account holders to recover their assets by submitting valid claims with the California State Controller’s Office, further establishing digital property rights in the U.S.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-17 04:52:47

Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB), the largest altcoins, recorded losses of 10%, 17%, and 7%, respectively, in the weekly time frame. The events of October 10 led to total crypto liquidations exceeding $20 billion, with an alarming 208,864 traders liquidated in just the past 24 hours, amounting to approximately $691.63 million in losses as a result of the ongoing correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Below $108,000: Peter Schiff Anticipates ‘Brutal’ Bear Market, CZ Responds In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), MartyParty warned that the ramifications of this event would include lawsuits targeting the alleged manipulators behind the crash. He criticized the centralized exchange (CEX) systems, stating: The manipulators cleared all the longs to 1.8x illegally. This had nothing to do with crypto. This is centralized exchange and casino systems that are opaque and easily manipulated with no regulation. Despite the turmoil, MartyParty expressed some optimism, noting that the crypto liquidations have cleared out long positions, which he believes could pave the way for future price increases. He also added that those responsible for this alleged manipulation would face scrutiny, predicting that this incident could evolve into one of the most significant fraud cases in financial history. Binance’s Role Adding to the concerns, another expert, Crypto Emre, highlighted the ease with which crashes can be orchestrated on platforms like Binance. He explained that the tokens visible in a user’s wallet are essentially held in Binance’s wallets behind the scenes. Emre asserts that the exchange can open short positions on multiple trading pairs simultaneously using private trading bots, which can then quickly sell the tokens held by users. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency After closing the short positions at a lower price, the expert alleges that the exchange replaces the sold tokens with their own at a significantly reduced cost. Emre argued that as long as Binance remains operational, the potential for such manipulation will hinder the emergence of a robust crypto bull market. As the dust settles from the October 10 crypto crash, it remains uncertain whether regulatory bodies or individuals will take action against these alleged practices in the near future, as predicted by MartyParty.

According to records published by community burn tracker Shibburn, the wallet that carried out the transfer was newly created and had only that one visible SHIB transaction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sheds 25% As $57M Flees Market — Can The Memecoin Recover? Etherscan data shows the address was funded by a wallet tied to Coinbase, and it currently holds 0.002 ETH, worth roughly $9. Largest Single Burn In Months The 140 million SHIB moved on Wednesday stands out as the largest one-off burn in nearly three months. Reports show the last big single send happened on July 28, when an anonymous actor destroyed 600 million SHIB. Since that July event, most individual burns stayed below 100 million until this Coinbase-linked transfer. 🔥🔥 140,033,123 $SHIB -> transferred to dead wallet. https://t.co/EzSFusbkZa — Shibburn (@shibburn) October 15, 2025 Daily Burn Rate Jumps Based on reports from Shibburn, nine transactions that day totaled about 140 million SHIB destroyed, pushing the daily burn figure up by 222%. The tracker’s data also records a cumulative 410 trillion SHIB that have been sent to dead addresses over time. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s past transfers of around 410 trillion SHIB to a burn contract remain the largest single move toward deflation on record. Supply Still Vast Shiba Inu’s total supply remains enormous at roughly 589 trillion tokens. That scale means even large-sounding burns have only a tiny impact on the overall available supply. Market watchers point out that unless burn activity becomes sustained and much larger in scale, the supply math will not shift meaningfully. Wallet Details And Transparency Etherscan shows the burner address executed only that one outgoing SHIB transfer and nothing else. The funding trace to a Coinbase-associated wallet suggests a user on the exchange initiated the action, but the identity behind the address has not been disclosed. The post-burn balance for SHIB is zero, and the tiny ETH holding left behind makes the move appear deliberate and final. Price Action And Technical Levels Even after the large token send to the burn address, SHIB barely moved — it was trading around $0.00001049 when the burn happened, and it slipped only 0.15% over the prior 24 hours. The bigger picture hasn’t changed: roughly 589 trillion SHIB remain in circulation, so even headline-grabbing burns make only a tiny dent. This latest action is part of a string of deflation efforts, including Shibarium Layer-2 burns handled through Bone ShibaSwap, which together have removed billions of SHIB from circulation. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Market Impact Remains Limited This event looks significant in headline terms but small when compared with the huge SHIB supply. The transfer adds to an ongoing narrative of community-led burns that keep holders engaged, yet it is unlikely to change the market trend on its own. Traders and observers will watch whether similar, larger burns follow, or if this remains a one-off action tied to a single Coinbase-funded address.

Standard Chartered & OKX Expand Crypto Partnership To EEA As revealed in a press release , OKX is expanding its partnership with Standard Chartered . The two first came together in April to launch a first-of-its-kind collateral mirroring program in the UAE, allowing institutional clients to custody their assets with the bank while mirroring those balances into the crypto exchange for trading. Standard Chartered and OKX have now decided to expand this service to investors in the European Economic Area (EEA). “This innovation gives clients the best of both worlds: bank-grade custody and seamless exchange access, helping them reduce counterparty risk, strengthen asset security, and trade with greater confidence,” said the press release. Standard Chartered is a major multinational financial institution headquartered in the UK that’s classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). G-SIBs are considered institutions so core to the global economic framework that any instability related to them can have wide-reaching ripple effects. Earlier in the year, Standard Chartered became the first bank of this class to roll out a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk for institutional traders. With the OKX partnership, the bank has also become the first G-SIB to team up with a crypto exchange. OKX noted that the collaboration marks “a major step forward in aligning digital asset markets with the highest standards of traditional finance—bringing greater assurance and credibility for institutions and clients alike.” OKX, currently ranked the second largest crypto exchange in the world based on trading volume, is licensed under the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), the European Union’s unified framework for crypto assets. “MiCA provides clarity and certainty in regulation, which gives institutional clients the confidence to deploy capital securely,” read the press release. “By pairing this with innovative solutions like collateral mirroring, we’re helping clients trade more efficiently in a safeguarded environment.” Speaking of institutional crypto developments in the EU, nine big banks announced in late September a consortium aimed at launching a MiCA-compliant euro-based stablecoin. “Stablecoins” are digital assets that have their price pegged to a fiat currency. Currently, the sector is heavily dominated by USD-tied tokens, so this initiative intends to create a real European alternative. The initial list of participants included major European players, including two G-SIBs in ING and UniCredit. According to a Bloomberg report from last week, a tenth institution is joining the consortium: Citigroup, another G-SIB. The bank is the first non-European entity to take part in the effort. While no concrete date is known for when the banks will release the euro stablecoin, the initial announcement noted that they are aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,600, down more than 8% over the last week.",Crypto News|crypto|Cryptocurrency|OKX|Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SPONSORED|FIAT|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-17 05:00:48

It’s happening,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-to-xrp-investors-opportunity-is-here-its-happening/,"Ripple has announced a landmark acquisition of GTreasury, a leading provider of treasury and risk management software, in a $1 billion deal. The move positions Ripple to enter the $120 trillion corporate treasury payments market, one of the largest and most complex segments of global finance. This acquisition represents a major step in Ripple’s strategy to expand beyond cross-border remittances and into institutional-grade financial services. Reinforcing the Core Use Case for Blockchain Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, stated that recent years have reinforced the importance of payments as the foundational use case for blockchain technology. He emphasized that inefficiencies and fragmentation within the financial infrastructure drove Ripple’s early focus on payments. The integration of decentralized solutions, according to Garlinghouse, addresses long-standing issues of siloed systems, delays, and costs in global money movement. Combining Expertise and Infrastructure GTreasury, which has served major global brands for decades, brings with it a deep network in the corporate finance space. Through this merger, Ripple plans to provide chief financial officers and treasury departments with tools to manage diverse digital and traditional assets, including stablecoins and tokenized deposits. The collaboration aims to enable corporations to operate seamlessly across jurisdictions, reducing settlement times and optimizing liquidity management on a global scale. Ripple also revealed plans to enhance capital efficiency for enterprises by connecting idle corporate funds to repo markets through Hidden Road, an institutional liquidity provider. This feature will allow businesses to generate returns on dormant assets while maintaining accessibility and compliance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Step Toward the Future of Enterprise Payments The acquisition underscores Ripple’s ambition to become a dominant player in institutional payments, bridging traditional finance and blockchain-based ecosystems. With global corporations seeking more efficient ways to manage liquidity, risk, and payments, Ripple’s combined expertise with GTreasury could redefine how corporate treasuries handle digital value. This move also reflects the maturing role of blockchain in solving real financial problems rather than speculative ones. By entering a $120 trillion market, Ripple is aligning itself with the broader trend of tokenization and on-chain financial operations within the enterprise sector. Garlinghouse concluded that the opportunity to transform global treasury management through blockchain technology is already here, affirming Ripple’s commitment to scaling its solutions and delivering tangible value to the institutional market.

According to Kikvadze, it's “only a matter of time” before the price of Bitcoin reaches $1 million, and then $10 million. As an early Bitcoin investor, Kikvadze assessed the cryptocurrency's evolution over the past decade and detailed the macroeconomic and institutional factors behind the rise. Stating that he has always viewed Bitcoin as “an investment against the irresponsibility of governments and the money printing of central banks,” Kikvadze argued that it acts as a “digital gold” with anti-inflationary properties and an insurance. Related News: Tether (USDT) Co-Founder Explains Why Bitcoin Price Fell Stating that there is more than one reason for the dramatic rise in Bitcoin’s price, Kikvadze listed the most important driving forces as follows: Global Debt and QE: The rise in government debt worldwide, the continued spending of OECD countries, and the quantitative easing (QE) policies of central banks have increased the appeal of Bitcoin. Institutional Wave: He noted that the increased access to institutions, driven by the entry of giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, has had a profound impact on the industry. He attributed the beginning of institutional interest to Paul Tudor Jones' article supporting Bitcoin. Kikvadze also touched on competition in the mining sector, stating that the field is becoming more capital-intensive.

Lately, SHIB’s price action has stalled under heavy resistance zones. Some chart watchers see a descending triangle tightening, which could lead to a >30% drop if the support fails. Analysts pointing toward a bullish thesis note SHIB’s burn rate is soaring, showing that the community is actively trying to reduce supply. In fact, reports suggest the burn could push SHIB toward $0.0000254 in a favorable cycle. There’s also chatter about a classic inverse head-and-shoulders forming. Still, skepticism runs deep. With such a vast circulating supply, even large rallies will feel slow and noisy. Several projections model SHIB hovering near $0.000013 for much of 2025 — modest gains at best. Some warn the coin might underperform against leaner, more focused low gas fee crypto challengers. Remittix (RTX): The New Viral Crypto SHIB Holders Are Now Betting On Remittix is being whispered about as a true DeFi project with real utility — not just hype.

Investors also watched rising geopolitical risks, with Trump warning that the US is “in a trade war now” and threatening further tariffs on China. The third week of the US government shutdown added further uncertainty, delaying key economic data and contributing to a choppy market environment. President Trump announced Thursday plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, following what he called a ""very productive call"" with Putin. Silver hovered all-time highs above $54 per ounce on Friday and was poised to gain about 8% for the week. Gold climbed to around $4,360 per ounce on Friday, climbing back toward the fresh record it set earlier and on track for a sharp weekly advance, the strongest since March 2020. South Korea’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged down to 2.5% in September 2025 from 2.6% in August, returning to July’s level.

Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said Thursday the central bank will closely examine a range of data—including insights gathered during his Washington visit—before deciding whether to raise interest rates in October. On the domestic front, Japan’s two major political parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and the Constitutional Democratic Party, have reached a broad agreement to hold a parliamentary vote on October 21 to select the next prime minister, according to Kyodo News. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 1.17% to below 3,890, while the Shenzhen Component sank 1.9% to 12,840 on Friday, with mainland shares poised to end the week lower as escalating US-China trade tensions weighed on sentiment. In the latest update, China accused the US of exaggerating its rare earth export controls, calling the resulting “panic” unnecessary while signaling openness to trade talks. Traders remain cautious ahead of China’s fourth plenum (Oct. 20–23), where the 2026–2030 five-year plan will be unveiled. Markets are also bracing for upcoming data in China: September industrial output, retail sales, Q3 GDP, and a monthly fixing on LPR.

Meanwhile, investors weighed mixed signals in US-India trade developments. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.81% to below 9,035 in early Friday trading, retreating from the prior session's record high, as losses in energy, tech shares, and miners offset gains in gold stocks.

While advocates see it as a step toward making Bitcoin usable for everyday payments, critics argue that Bitcoin’s public ledger could compromise Signal’s privacy model. The initiative is being pushed forward as Europe also grapples with privacy concerns tied to the proposed “Chat Control” law targeting encrypted messaging platforms. Bitcoin for Signal Gains Momentum Several well known Bitcoin advocates, including Jack Dorsey, are backing a new initiative called “Bitcoin for Signal.” The goal of the initiative is to integrate Bitcoin payments into the privacy-focused messaging app Signal through the Cashu protocol. The campaign was launched by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Cashu , who wants to bring Bitcoin’s Chaumian Ecash technology to Signal, which will enable private and censorship-resistant payments in the app. Dorsey is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin adoption, and endorsed the initiative on X by reposting Cashu’s campaign message, stating that Signal should adopt Bitcoin. The idea also got some traction from well-known Bitcoin developers like Peter Todd, Calle, and Satoshi Labs co-founder Pavol Rusnak. Todd criticized Signal’s existing cryptocurrency payment feature, MobileCoin (MOB), by calling it a “failure” due to its centralization and limited accessibility. Signal integrated MobileCoin in 2021, but it has faced ongoing backlash from the Bitcoin community for relying on a small validator set and for lacking transparency. Supporters of Bitcoin for Signal argue that adding Bitcoin payments will align with the app’s privacy and independence ethos, and could potentially enable its 70 million monthly users to send peer-to-peer Bitcoin payments privately. Dorsey repeatedly said that Bitcoin must evolve beyond being just a store of value and should be used for everyday transactions, and this campaign wants to advance this vision. (Source: Bitcoinforsignal.org ) However, critics raised concerns that Bitcoin’s public ledger could undermine Signal’s privacy-focused design. Aztec Network engineer José Pedro Sousa questioned why a privacy app would use a transparent blockchain. Others, including digital rights group Techlore, warned that Bitcoin could compromise user anonymity. Some privacy advocates suggested alternatives like Monero and Zcash, which feature built-in privacy protections. While the Cashu protocol offers a privacy-preserving layer for Bitcoin, similar systems struggled to achieve mainstream success. The campaign comes during a time of growing tension over digital privacy in Europe. The European Union recently postponed a vote on the controversial “Chat Control” law, which would have forced encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp to scan private communications for child abuse material. Germany opposed the proposal by arguing it violated constitutional privacy rights. The vote is now expected to take place in early December.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 05:30:00

Both leading assets are now trading in narrow ranges, with lower volatility across major exchanges. Trading has weakened, and there are signs that many traders are re-evaluating their positions while the overall market stabilizes. At the same time, investors are turning their focus to promising new altcoins. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as a standout. Fuelled by transparency, audited contracts, and straightforward documentation, the Ethereum-based project has seen an exceptional 10,000% increase in presale hype. Its momentum underscores increasing demand for early-stage tokens with long-term upside potential. Bitcoin Holds Steady as Market Consolidates Bitcoin price today is down 1.39% past 24 hours, trading near $110,873 after briefly hitting $113,000 earlier this week. The asset has lost more than $4,900 in a month, which has reduced its market cap to $2.21 trillion. Source: TradingView Trading volume has declined by 20%, reflecting decreased momentum from retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin is now meeting resistance at $111,500 after multiple rejections in the 100-day EMA. Traders are evidently cautious after a series of lower peaks. Many are watching the $110,000 support level, along with modest downside levels near $108,000 if there is further selling pressure. Yet, there is still a triple-bottom pattern around $109,600 in which recovery can still occur. A break above $114,600 and $116,000 could open a way to $125,000 or $130,000 before the end of the year. Ethereum Moves Sideways Amid Cooling Market Activity Ethereum follows Bitcoin’s consolidation pattern and is struggling to break $4,220. Ethereum ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with its most recent price below $4,050 due to multiple unsuccessful efforts towards regaining more resistance. Source: TradingView ETH has formed a contracting triangle with support near $3,950 and resistance around $4,075. On-chain activity remains moderate, with RSI readings below 50 indicating limited buying strength. A close above $4,200 would likely lead to a move to $4,350 or $4,420 levels. On multiple technical factors, analysts warn of a dip to $3,750 if $3,880 holding fails. Despite low volatility, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem remains active, echoing investor patience during consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains 10,000% Hype in Early Presale Stage While major assets cool, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured market attention with explosive early-stage momentum. The project’s transparent audits, traceable wallets, and open communication have earned a strong level of investor confidence. Analysts call it one of the few presales for which execution matches published documentation. The token’s Ethereum foundation has supported safe transactions, while the deflationary model slowly lowers the total supply. Its staged presale system is rewarding early investors with fair pricing and balanced liquidity. These factors have fueled rapid community expansion and helped MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out from typical altcoin launches. Industry watchers think that this framework is the basis for its 10,000% hype growth . As Bitcoin and Ethereum trade sideways, traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fresh entry point with strong ROI potential before 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum have been consolidating as the broader market cools, creating a wait-and-see vibe from large investors. Volume is still low, but the technical formations are conducive to a return of volatility when key resistance threshold levels are taken out. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s verified audits, fair presale structure, and deflationary design have elevated it as a credible new entrant in the altcoin space. Its popularity in early-stage projects is a testament to the increasing demand for transparent and sustainable crypto projects designed for long-term value.

Community matters more than whitepapers, and sometimes a dog-themed token with zero utility outperforms venture-backed projects. BONK proved this when it airdropped to Solana users on Christmas 2022 and rallied over 2,000% in its first week. By December 2023, it became the third-largest meme coin behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu , with Coinbase and Binance listings making it legitimate. But here’s what nobody mentions. BONK succeeded despite having no revenue model, no institutional backing, and launching right after FTX collapsed. The token’s success was pure community will and perfect timing when Solana desperately needed a win. Fast forward to October 2025, and everything has changed. Institutional money is flooding back into crypto, regulatory clarity is improving, and projects launching with actual revenue models are commanding serious valuations. Astra Nova ‘s $RVV launches October 18th into this completely different market environment, and the contrast with BONK’s grassroots launch couldn’t be sharper. This one has NVIDIA backing, Alibaba Cloud infrastructure, Saudi Arabia’s NEOM support, and the team behind Shiba Inu’s billion-dollar ecosystem. More importantly, it launches with a proven revenue model that automatically buys back and burns tokens using platform fees. When Community Meets Infrastructure BONK’s December 2022 launch was beautifully simple. The team airdropped 50% of supply to Solana community members, NFT holders, and developers who survived the FTX disaster. No presale, no venture capital, just massive community distribution creating instant ownership across thousands of wallets. Within five months, the token delivered a 4,315% return and sparked a rally across the entire Solana ecosystem. The strategy worked because Solana needed positive momentum, and BONK gave the community something to rally around that wasn’t tied to FTX wreckage. By November 2024, BONK hit its all-time high of $0.00005916, driven entirely by community support and growing integration across Solana dApps. The token proved that in the right conditions, pure community energy creates billions in market value even without traditional metrics. Astra Nova takes that community-first approach and layers institutional infrastructure on top. The project is backed by the Shiba Inu founding team, which means they’ve already built one of crypto’s most engaged communities and know how to sustain that energy through market cycles. But instead of relying solely on community hype, $RVV launches with Shiba Inu and Simon’s Cat already building applications on TokenPlay AI, bringing millions of existing users into the ecosystem before the token goes live. Revenue Models Change Everything BONK’s tokenomics are straightforward. The team burns tokens periodically to reduce supply, with major burns like the 1.69 trillion token BURNmas event creating scarcity through governance decisions. Since launch, the ecosystem has burned approximately 12 trillion tokens representing over $340 million permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary pressure supports value, but burns depend on treasury decisions rather than automatic mechanisms tied to platform activity. $RVV’s approach is fundamentally different because buyback and burn is built directly into how TokenPlay AI generates revenue. Every application launched on the platform collects fees from user transactions, and a percentage automatically purchases $RVV tokens from the open market and destroys them permanently. More applications mean more transactions, more transactions mean more fees, and more fees mean constant buyback pressure scaling with ecosystem growth. Platforms using similar models already prove the revenue potential. Pump.fun generated $15.5 million in fees during a single day in January 2025 and has collected over $803 million cumulative. LetsBonk.fun generated nearly $800,000 in its first three days and now uses fees to buy and burn BONK tokens, creating the revenue model BONK itself never had. Institutional Backing That BONK Never Had BONK succeeded with anonymous developers and no institutional support, which was part of its grassroots appeal. $RVV launches with NVIDIA’s Inception program access, Alibaba Cloud infrastructure across 91 global availability zones, and NEOM backing from Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative. The Shiba Inu founding team brings expertise in building and maintaining crypto’s most active communities through multiple market cycles. The Timing Advantage BONK launched into terrible market conditions in December 2022, right after FTX collapsed. The token succeeded despite awful timing because the community needed hope. $RVV launches into October 2025 when institutional money is returning and markets reward projects with real business models. On October 18th, $RVV goes live with 250,000 creators ready to build immediately, major IPs already integrated, and buyback mechanics activating the moment transactions flow. BONK proved community matters. $RVV launches with community, infrastructure, and revenue model working together. The question isn’t whether BONK’s playbook still works, but whether combining all three creates something bigger.

The influx reinforces Ethereum’s dominance as the world’s most actively developed blockchain, supported by its expanding network of layer-2 solutions. Solana Trails Ethereum with 11,500 Developers Solana ranked second with roughly 11,500 new developers contributing code this year. However, the Solana Foundation noted that Electric Capital’s dataset may be outdated and undercounts actual figures. Bitcoin, in comparison, attracted around 7,500 new developers over the same period. According to Electric Capital’s developer tracker, Ethereum now hosts the largest active developer base across all blockchain ecosystems, with 31,869 active developers. Solana follows with 17,708, while Bitcoin trails at 11,036. Ethereum’s figure includes contributors to layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Unichain, as defined by L2Beat, without double-counting developers working across multiple layers. Despite Ethereum’s lead, Solana’s growth over the past two years has been far stronger. Full-time Ethereum developers grew by 5.8% year-on-year, while Solana recorded a 29.1% increase in the same period and a 61.7% surge over two years, one of the fastest expansions in the industry. 1/ New data confirms: @Ethereum is the #1 ecosystem for new developers in 2025. pic.twitter.com/ZThdbGDf0X — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 15, 2025 Still, Solana’s developer count may be higher than reported. The foundation’s head of developer relations, Jacob Creech, said around 7,800 developers are missing from the current dataset, urging the community to submit GitHub repositories to improve Solana’s tracking. Some analysts have also challenged Electric Capital’s methodology, arguing that ecosystems using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), such as Polygon and BNB Chain, should be grouped together, since their developers share tools and programming standards. Adding to the debate, Jarrod Watts, head of Australia for layer-2 project Abstract, suggested that AI-assisted code generation and hackathon projects could be inflating the overall figures. “This data likely includes a tonne of vibe coding slop and hackathon repos that are never touched again,” he said. Latin America’s Developers Flock to Ethereum and Polygon As reported, developers across Latin America are increasingly building on established blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon instead of creating new base-layer protocols, a report from Sherlock Communications found. Ethereum leads regional activity, accounting for more than 75% of blockchain transactions, while Polygon’s share nearly doubled to 20%. Developers cited transparency, ease of use, and regulatory clarity as key reasons for choosing mature ecosystems over newer ones. According to Sherlock researcher Luiz Eduardo Abreu Hadad, Latin America’s developer community shows “strong technical maturity” and a growing focus on solving real-world problems rather than reinventing infrastructure. On-chain data from 697,000 transactions in countries including Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru supports this trend. Local projects like Brazil’s Núclea Chain and RBB, however, highlight the region’s potential to build its own blockchain infrastructure.

The move signals the company’s intent to strengthen its presence in the digital-asset ecosystem, even as investors remain cautious following a market-wide selloff. The funds will be placed in a new digital-asset treasury (DAT), with Ripple contributing some of its own XRP to the effort. This comes at a time when the crypto market remains fragile, and investor sentiment toward such ventures has cooled. Ripple’s digital-asset treasury plan Ripple’s fundraising will reportedly take place through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), with discussions around the final structure still underway. The company’s DAT will serve as a long-term holding vehicle for XRP, the token closely associated with Ripple’s payment network. If successful, this will be the largest treasury initiative centred on XRP, which currently ranks as the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalisation of $140.57 billion. At present, XRP is trading at $2.34, down 2.63% in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data . While similar accumulators have faced declining confidence — with firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and Japan’s Metaplanet Inc. seeing share drops — Ripple appears committed to pushing forward. Its decision highlights a broader trend of established crypto players looking to reinforce their ecosystems despite volatility and shifting investor sentiment. XRP’s resilience compared to wider crypto losses The broader market downturn that followed tensions in the US-China trade war saw a wave of liquidations across exchanges, hitting both major and smaller digital assets. Even Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell amid renewed selling pressure. The pullback raised questions about the sustainability of speculative altcoins and their place in diversified crypto portfolios. Yet, XRP has shown relative resilience. It has gained substantially so far in 2025. Ripple’s treasury initiative could potentially stabilise XRP’s price and strengthen market confidence by signalling corporate commitment to long-term value accumulation. Ripple’s $1 billion GTreasury acquisition Ripple’s plans for the DAT coincide with its acquisition of GTreasury, a treasury management software provider, for $1 billion. The deal, announced on Thursday , aims to connect corporate finance chiefs and treasurers with blockchain-based financial solutions, including tokenised deposits and stablecoins. By integrating GTreasury’s platform, Ripple is positioning itself as a key bridge between traditional finance and the tokenised economy. The acquisition also suggests Ripple’s strategic pivot toward institutional adoption of blockchain finance tools — a segment expected to see substantial growth as businesses explore digital asset integration into everyday financial operations. Institutional participation in token accumulators grows Throughout 2025, the crypto industry has seen a proliferation of publicly listed token accumulators — entities that hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or XRP as part of structured investment vehicles. These are often created through SPAC mergers or reverse takeovers to give investors indirect exposure to digital assets. More than 300 entities now hold Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net, signalling growing institutional involvement in the space.

Ripple itself holds 4.74 billion XRP tokens, valued at approximately $11 billion, while another 35.9 billion tokens remain in escrow, set for gradual monthly release. Despite scepticism around new digital-asset treasuries, Ripple’s initiative could set a precedent for other projects aiming to consolidate value within their native tokens while diversifying corporate funding structures.

Canadian asset manager CI Global Asset Management just staked $130 million worth of ETH from its ETHX ETF, signaling renewed confidence among big funds, even as global markets remain cautious. The move, confirmed on-chain, represents around 21% of CI Global’s total $620.61 million ETH holdings, according to data from their Ethereum ETF portfolio. BREAKING: This Canadian ETF just staked $130M ETH CI Global Asset Management holds $620.61M of ETH in their ETHX ETF, and have just staked $130M. They still hold around $490.85M of unstaked ETH in their ETF. Will they be staking this as well? pic.twitter.com/8i68ti6wy0 — Arkham (@arkham) October 16, 2025 CI Global’s Bold Move into Staking The ETHX ETF currently holds approximately $620.61 million in Ethereum. Of that, $130 million is now staked, earning yield through network validation and rewards. That leaves $490.85 million of unstaked ETH still sitting idle in the ETF. The big question: Will CI Global stake the rest? If they do, it would push total staked ETF-held Ethereum to one of the highest levels among traditional funds, potentially influencing yields across liquid staking protocols and DeFi. This marks a significant shift, not just in ETF strategy but in institutional participation on-chain. Traditional funds are no longer holding ETH passively. They’re beginning to earn from the network itself Institutional Ethereum Demand Is Building CI Global’s move comes amid a wave of institutional ETH accumulation across exchanges. On-chain data shows large-scale withdrawals from centralized platforms, often the first sign of long-term holding or staking activity. Over the past 48 hours, roughly $415 million worth of ETH has moved off exchanges tied to institutional wallets. Tom Lee Reportedly Bought $415M in ETH The biggest headline of the week: Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, reportedly purchased $415 million worth of ETH through two separate entities. On-chain trackers identified two addresses withdrawing $185 million from Kraken overnight, matching known purchase patterns associated with Bitmine’s institutional flow model. This comes just a day after another $231.5 million worth of ETH was withdrawn from BitGo wallets. Combined, that’s $415 million in ETH bought over a 48-hour period. These are not retail moves. They mirror Bitmine’s historical accumulation strategy, large, timed withdrawals ahead of macro catalysts or liquidity shifts. TOM LEE BOUGHT $415M WORTH OF ETH Two addresses withdrew $185M ETH last night from Kraken. These movements are in addition to the $231.5M withdrawn from Bitgo that we reported yesterday – bringing the total to $415M. These withdrawals match known Bitmine purchase patterns. https://t.co/XrIFGG3LUL pic.twitter.com/YOjda3vkgl — Arkham (@arkham) October 16, 2025 $6 Billion in Shorts on the Line Ethereum’s open interest is now sitting on a knife’s edge. Analysts estimate around $6 billion worth of ETH shorts could face liquidation if the price pumps just 10% from current levels. That means a short squeeze could easily propel ETH into its next leg higher, especially with fresh inflows from ETFs and whale wallets. Add in BlackRock’s latest ETH inflow and Bitmine’s ongoing purchases, and market pressure is clearly building on the short side. $6,000,000,000 in shorts will get liquidated if $ETH pumps 10%. BlackRock had an inflow yesterday, while BitMine is also buying. The only uncertainty is around the US-China deal, which is dragging everything down. Any signs of trade deal could push Ethereum higher. pic.twitter.com/du0Of40aLD — Ted (@TedPillows) October 16, 2025 Macro Clouds, But Optimism Grows Despite the heavy buying, macro sentiment remains the biggest overhang. The ongoing uncertainty around the U.S.–China trade deal has weighed on risk assets across the board. Traders are holding their breath for any sign of progress. “Any indication of a trade breakthrough could send Ethereum flying,” one analyst noted, pointing to the combination of institutional inflows, ETF staking activity, and short exposure as a “perfect storm” setup. For now, the market remains cautious, but data points are stacking up in favor of a move higher. Ethereum’s Institutional Cycle Is Underway This latest wave of ETF staking and whale accumulation signals a clear shift in market structure. During previous cycles, institutional interest often lagged behind retail. This time, it’s leading. CI Global’s decision to actively stake ETH shows traditional finance is becoming more comfortable with on-chain yield, treating staking as a legitimate income stream rather than a speculative risk. That development could have ripple effects across the broader ETF landscape. If other funds follow suit, billions in idle ETH could transition into active validator participation, effectively reducing circulating supply and strengthening the network’s economic base. Ethereum’s On-Chain Story Strengthens Ethereum is now being treated less like a speculative token and more like an on-chain financial asset, one that yields, secures, and compounds. Institutional staking inflows could amplify ETH’s long-term scarcity dynamics. As more ETH is locked for yield, liquid supply tightens, making price reactions sharper during accumulation waves. Combine that with short-side risk and upcoming macro catalysts, and Ethereum sits on a high-tension coil that could unwind dramatically in either direction. For now, $415 million in new institutional ETH buys, $130 million staked by a major ETF, and $6 billion in shorts waiting to be squeezed are setting up one of the most asymmetric setups Ethereum has seen all year. The Bottom Line CI Global Asset Management staked $130M ETH, leaving $490.85M unstaked in their ETF. Tom Lee and Bitmine-linked addresses withdrew $415M ETH from centralized exchanges. BlackRock continues to record ETH inflows. $6B in shorts could be liquidated on a 10% price jump. A U.S.–China trade breakthrough remains the macro wildcard. Institutional capital is moving fast. Ethereum is once again the asset of choice, not for speculation, but for yield, exposure, and network participation. And if the next 10% move triggers the short cascade analysts expect, we may be watching the early phase of Ethereum’s next institutional leg. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This week, the investment firm announced a strategic investment in Temple Digital Group, a privacy-focused technology stack for trading capital markets built on the Canton Network. Alongside that, YZi Labs also led a $50 million funding round in Better Payment Network (BPN), a programmable, multi-stablecoin payment layer designed to connect CeFi and DeFi payments globally. Both moves mark a clear signal: YZi Labs is betting on the next evolution of compliant, enterprise-ready Web3 infrastructure. Temple Digital Group: Privacy Meets Compliance Temple Digital Group is building a new foundation for on-chain institutional trading, focusing on compliance and privacy. The company operates on the Canton Network, the world’s first privacy-configurable public L1 developed by Digital Asset, already processing over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo activity. Temple’s stack includes non-custodial wallets and API interfaces that enable 24/7 digital asset trading without compromising regulatory standards. With YZi Labs’ latest investment, Temple plans to expand its engineering and compliance teams and roll out new products such as: Asset issuance and management tools Perpetual futures Cross-network trade routing on Canton Network The company will also continue researching cryptographic interoperability between Canton and other blockchains, a step toward seamless multi-chain integration. https://t.co/dUioYxl4Mi — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 16, 2025 Institutional Momentum Around Canton Network Temple’s growth comes at a time when institutional participation in the Canton Network is accelerating. Major financial players like Goldman Sachs and Citadel are already active within the ecosystem, exploring tokenized securities and real-world asset (RWA) markets. Canton’s architecture is designed for regulated financial institutions, offering privacy, compliance, and interoperability within a single framework. For YZi Labs, the investment represents a broader push toward trusted DeFi infrastructure, where institutions can participate without regulatory friction. Privacy and compliance are the missing pieces for large-scale DeFi adoption, Canton and Temple Digital are solving exactly that. Expanding Product Lines and Market Reach With the new funding, Temple aims to broaden its product coverage to include more financial instruments and deeper cross-chain integrations. The focus is on bringing real-world assets on-chain, a sector expected to exceed $16 trillion in tokenized value by 2030, according to industry estimates. The firm also plans to establish cross-network trade routing, connecting liquidity between Canton and other major blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. In the short term, this could boost institutional adoption and enhance confidence in privacy-oriented DeFi infrastructure. However, regulatory hurdles still loom, particularly around global deployment timelines over the next 12–18 months. YZi Labs’ Broader Strategy: Building the Next Financial Stack This investment in Temple is just one piece of a broader strategy. YZi Labs is building a portfolio of infrastructure projects that merge DeFi efficiency with traditional finance compliance. Following its rebrand from Binance Labs, YZi Labs has shifted focus toward: Privacy-enabled blockchain infrastructure On-chain financial settlement tools Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization Developer-focused infrastructure for global markets Each move highlights the firm’s belief that the future of Web3 lies in institutional integration, not speculative hype. $50M Funding in Better Payment Network (BPN) In another major move, YZi Labs announced it has led a $50 million financing round in Better Payment Network (BPN), a programmable, multi-stablecoin payment layer built on BNB Chain. BPN is designed to bridge CeFi and DeFi, bringing stablecoin settlements into global enterprise finance. It offers a unified, on-chain layer for minting, swapping, and settlement of fiat-backed stablecoins, enabling regulated, low-cost cross-border transactions. The funding will be used to: Build on-chain liquidity pools for stablecoin-to-stablecoin corridors Develop an early market-making ecosystem Improve on-chain FX pricing and liquidity for institutional users https://t.co/Kr12b0OyTC — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 16, 2025 Connecting CeFi and DeFi BPN represents the growing trend of programmable money, where stablecoins can move freely across regulated networks without intermediaries. The system will allow enterprises, fintechs, and banks to settle multi-currency transactions instantly, bypassing traditional SWIFT channels and reducing operational costs. For example, a U.S. company could pay a supplier in Europe instantly using on-chain stablecoins, while both sides retain regulatory compliance through verified entities. With YZi Labs’ backing, BPN aims to become the go-to settlement layer for regulated global payments, directly competing with emerging on-chain systems like Circle’s CCTP and RippleNet. The Bigger Picture: Web3 Infrastructure Evolves Between Temple Digital and BPN, YZi Labs is shaping the next layer of Web3 infrastructure, one that is compliant, scalable, and institution-ready. Both projects target long-standing barriers in crypto adoption: Temple focuses on privacy and compliance in trading, while BPN addresses global payment interoperability. Together, they highlight the broader industry shift, from speculative DeFi to real-world, utility-driven ecosystems. As institutional confidence grows and frameworks like MiCA mature, investments like these could accelerate blockchain’s role in global finance. Conclusion: From Experimentation to Execution YZi Labs’ latest moves underline a clear narrative, Web3 is going professional. The focus has shifted from decentralized experimentation to enterprise-grade execution. With Temple Digital Group bringing compliance and privacy to capital markets and BPN bridging stablecoin settlements across borders, the foundation is being laid for a regulated, interoperable financial internet. In the months ahead, all eyes will be on how these platforms roll out real products and partnerships, and how institutions respond to the next evolution of blockchain finance.

Binance Funding Rates Signal ETH Surging To $6,800",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-correction-binance-funding-eth-6800/,"Ethereum (ETH) may be nearing the end of its price correction, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap continues to trade slightly above $4,000, following a strong sell-off last week when it almost crashed to $3,400. Ethereum Price Correction May Be Over According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Ethereum funding rates on Binance crypto exchange have remained positive, despite being in a narrow range. This shows that long positions on ETH still dominate the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Feels “Too Efficient” As Arbitrage Opportunities Vanish – What It Means For Price? ETH funding rates fluctuating normally on Binance – despite the digital asset’s recent extraordinary price appreciation – implies that futures traders are not exhibiting greed or euphoria, typically associated with the mid-phase of a healthy uptrend. For example, during the 2021-22 bull cycle, ETH funding rates often surged to 0.1% to 0.2%, aligning with local market tops. At present, these funding rates are hovering around 0.01% to 0.03%, implying that the market has not reached overheated levels just yet. In addition, the absence of negative funding rates confirms a decline in short positioning, and elevated risk appetite among investors. The CryptoQuant analyst added: The overall trend remains upward. Low funding rates combined with strong price momentum suggest that the correction is likely complete. In the short term, minor profit-taking or sideways consolidation between $3,600–$3,800 would be natural. If funding rates gradually rise above 0.05%, it could signal overcrowded longs and trigger a short term pullback. The current combination of moderate levels of leverage and gradually rising spot demand hints toward a potential ETH rally, eyeing the $4,500 to $5,000 range in the long term. The price target could be even higher with a favorable derivatives structure and funding dynamics. That said, a sharp increase in funding rates could be seen as an early warning of another price pullback for the cryptocurrency. However, ETH’s market structure still supports a potential surge to $6,800 by the end of 2025, the analyst concluded. ETH Ready For New Highs? Several indicators point toward ETH looking to resume its bullish momentum. For instance, ETH’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) trend recently hinted toward the digital asset rising to $5,000 in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest Further, ETH exchange reserves continue to tumble at a rapid pace. Recent exchange data shows that ETH reserves on exchanges have hit a multi-year low, raising the possibility of an impending “supply crunch” for the cryptocurrency. That said, there are several other factors that may fuel another sell-off in ETH, pushing its price again below $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,053, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

A new class of altcoins, including dominant names like Solana (SOL), HYPE, and SUI, has analysts bullish as sentiment improves across the board. Solana (SOL) Gains Strength Ahead of Market Recovery Solana is staying competitive due to strong technical and institutional momentum. The Alpenglow update of the network is coming soon, which will cut the transaction finalization from 12.8 seconds to milliseconds. Last week, Solana experienced a surge in on-chain activity, marked by significant transfers and the accumulation of it by whales. The use of Solana by firms like Visa, Stripe, and Franklin Templeton has increased institutional uptake, making it the blockchain of choice for scalable financial applications. Whale Accumulation Sparks Interest in HYPE Whales show great interest in HYPE token amid ongoing fluctuation in the markets. In November 2025, a team token unlock worth $11.9 billion is looming. This will undoubtedly cause some selling pressure in the short term. In order to counter this, large holders have been buying the dips. This accumulation reflects confidence in HYPE’s long-term outlook. Indicators of a bullish breakout appear on the higher time-frame charts. As per analysts, a breakout pattern is beginning to form. The key support levels are around $3.40. It may rally up to $4.50-$5.00. SUI (SUI) Shows Renewed Momentum Investor interest in SUI is also increasing, with the company trading around $4.23 and a market cap of $14.6 billion. Analysts say more substantial trading volume and buyer activity position SUI among the potential altcoins to keep an eye on as liquidity returns. The growing ecosystem of decentralised apps and gaming continues to attract developers and retail investors. If the crypto recovery broadens, SUI is likely to see upside to $5.00-$5.50 in the short to midterm, positioning it as a major benefactor in the next Layer-1 growth story. The Rising Low-Cap Opportunity to Watch In line with the large-cap recovery stories, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from investors looking for the next big thing in the early stage of the bull phase. The project has attracted the interest of retail and institutional investors. It is in very high demand. Hashex and audits add to the credibility and sustainability of its smart contracts. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing adoption reflects broader investor confidence in utility-driven crypto projects. With consistent community engagement and strong early-stage interest, it continues to emerge as a promising addition for investors seeking diversification beyond the established players. Conclusion Solana, HYPE, and SUI have captured potent market recovery narratives backed by whales and institutions with active development pipelines. All these projects show the ability to bounce back in the midst of uncertainty and are well-positioned to see growth in Q4. While MAGACOIN FINANCE grabs attention as a low-cap gem, what sets it apart is its double-verified security, scarcity-driven value, and surging presale momentum. As the markets transition from fear to optimism, these projects collectively illustrate the direction in which the smart money is moving in the next crypto cycle 2025. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as significant proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

Sentiment in equities also took a hit from rising trade tensions between the US and China. Beijing on Thursday accused Washington of stoking panic over its rare earth export controls and rejected a White House call to roll back the curbs, rattling already fragile market confidence. Altcoins Struggle as Market Pressure Builds on Weaker Momentum Bitcoin, which recently hit a record high of $126k on Oct. 6, has struggled to find a footing since last week’s sharp selloff. That downturn was triggered by a wave of liquidations exceeding $19b, compounded by jitters over US–China trade friction. The selloff swept across major tokens, leaving investors wary of further downside. Bitcoin has declined to ~$111K, dropping 11.8% since its $125.8K all-time high 9 days ago. With Trump's temporary tariff threats acting as a catalyst, gold has thrived, while equities chop. It can be argued $BTC 's drop is still in ""overreaction"" range. https://t.co/7WOMPa4RaT pic.twitter.com/DJQZatkqsY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 15, 2025 Ether dropped 2.2% to $3,931, while XRP slipped 2.7% to $2.36. Market watchers said momentum in altcoins remained weak as traders reduced exposure ahead of potential regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said XRP is facing near-term pressure due to whale transfers and exchange inflows. “Key support is forming between $2.10 and $2.30,” he said. “A breakout toward $3.00–$3.25 remains possible if ETF approvals materialize by late October, which would likely trigger renewed institutional inflows.” He added that Ripple’s recent $1b acquisition of GTreasury enhances XRP’s position in corporate finance, expanding its utility for settlements beyond speculative trading. Capital Rotates Toward Utility Tokens as Solana Leads Market Recovery In contrast, Solana is showing stronger momentum, Lee said, targeting a range between $210 and $250. Growth in DeFi activity and optimism around potential ETF approvals continue to support its performance. “Both assets are benefiting from a broader capital rotation into utility-driven tokens,” he said, noting that investors are focusing more on blockchain projects with real-world applications. Meanwhile, concerns in traditional markets have added to the cautious tone. The collapses of First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings revived fears of hidden credit losses, while accounting write-downs tied to fraud at Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance wiped out more than $100b in US banking market value in a single day. With credit worries mounting, gold and silver extended their rallies to fresh highs. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has yet to follow suit, falling 6.3% over the past week, its sharpest drop since March. As Bitcoin Matures, Its Price Action Mirrors Traditional Markets More Closely Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, said Bitcoin’s growing integration with mainstream finance could explain its closer alignment with broader markets. Harz added that institutional adoption will accelerate innovation in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance. “These institutions holding BTC will want to unlock Bitcoin’s utility and put their assets to work by securely deploying BTC natively into DeFi protocols,” he said. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $110,000 threshold will likely depend on macroeconomic catalysts. Traders remain cautious, watching for signals from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates and how trade tensions might influence risk appetite heading into the final quarter of the year.

The decision marks a climactic step in Kraken’s bid to bring regulated crypto derivatives trading onshore and strengthen its presence in the world’s largest capital market. Kraken Secures CFTC License to Build Regulated U.S. Derivatives Hub The acquisition gives Kraken ownership of a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license , enabling it to design and operate exchange derivatives directly under U.S.. Kraken says this structure will allow it to integrate spot, margin, and futures products into a single regulated liquidity system, a first for its American clients. “Kraken’s acquisition of a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market creates the foundation for a new generation of United States derivatives markets,” said Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO. He also added, “This step connects spot, futures, and margin products inside a single regulated system, reducing fragmentation and bringing onshore the kind of access and performance that has mostly existed offshore.” The transaction includes both cash and equity considerations, with IG Group receiving $32.5 million in cash and $67.5 million in Kraken’s parent company stock. IG reported a post-tax profit of £73.3 million from the sale and confirmed it will continue collaborating with Kraken through a product distribution partnership. Expanding Kraken’s Global Derivatives Network This purchase builds on Kraken’s recent acquisitions, including NinjaTrader , which provides U.S. clients access to CME-listed crypto futures, and Crypto Facilities, its U.K.-based derivatives venue regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Together, these platforms form a global derivatives infrastructure spanning the U.K., EU, and now the U.S., enabling institutional clients to move collateral in real time and manage risk efficiently across regions. Founded in 2011, Kraken now serves over 15 million users worldwide, offering more than 450 digital and traditional assets. With the addition of Small Exchange, the company gains the regulatory flexibility to introduce U.S.-listed crypto futures and options, potentially challenging offshore leaders like Binance and Bybit.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-reach-the-end-heres-what-it-means/,"Market analyst CryptoBull has presented a compelling technical setup showing XRP nearing the end of a large falling wedge formation against Ethereum on the daily chart. The chart, shared on the Binance pair (XRP/ETH), illustrates a gradual compression between lower highs and higher lows, forming a structure that typically precedes a directional breakout. The analyst noted that this setup often leads to an upward move, implying a potential phase in which XRP could outperform Ethereum in the weeks ahead. Over the past several months, XRP has steadily declined in relative strength compared to Ethereum , maintaining a downward trajectory within the wedge since early spring. However, the recent price action has brought XRP close to the lower support boundary, where many traders are now closely monitoring for confirmation of a reversal or a continuation of the current trend. #XRP is about to reach the end in this giant falling wedge against Ethereum. This is a structure that usually moves to the upside suggesting that XRP will outperform Ethereum in the coming weeks! pic.twitter.com/C3EwcUc6dB — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 15, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the Community Reactions to CryptoBull’s observation have been divided. A user named Jack Rio expressed skepticism, suggesting that XRP has temporarily lost its dominance against Ethereum and that the overall structure appears bearish rather than bullish. Another user, Elephant, maintained a similar view, predicting that XRP’s value could weaken further over the coming months, possibly extending losses toward lower valuation levels. In contrast, CFLOYD76 commented with a brief yet cautious remark, interpreting the analyst’s use of “usually” as an important qualifier, implying that while a breakout is statistically favored, it is not guaranteed. Evaluating the Technical Implications From a technical standpoint, a falling wedge pattern is generally viewed as a bullish formation, especially when appearing after a sustained downtrend. The decreasing volatility within the wedge suggests that selling pressure is subsiding and that buyers may be preparing to reclaim momentum. However, this interpretation depends on confirmation through a breakout above the wedge’s upper resistance line, supported by a significant increase in trading volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The daily chart also shows that XRP’s performance against Ethereum remains below its 200-day moving average, indicating that broader momentum continues to favor Ethereum in the short term. Until XRP can establish sustained strength above that moving average, any upward attempt might face resistance. Based on the chart structure, XRP could be approaching a decisive technical juncture. If XRP breaks above the descending resistance line accompanied by volume expansion, a notable recovery relative to Ethereum may follow, with potential targets near previous consolidation levels. However, failure to hold the lower boundary of the wedge would invalidate the bullish scenario, potentially leading to further underperformance. As the formation nears completion, traders and analysts alike are paying attention to whether this compression phase signals the beginning of a reversal or the continuation of XRP’s relative weakness.

53261254,https://finbold.com/?p=255605,1760681043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,SEC chair Atkins prioritizes innovation in crypto rulemaking,https://finbold.com/sec-chair-atkins-prioritizes-innovation-in-crypto-rulemaking/,"Enforcement and crackdowns have long characterized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) stance on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. After years of standoffs, its new willingness to engage with the crypto industry could mark the start of a genuine experiment in regulatory change. SEC Chair Paul Atkins designated crypto and tokenization as the agency’s “job one” priority, marking a move toward a pro-innovation stance. The agency’s previous chair, Gary Gensler, wielded enforcement as his primary tool. Under Atkins, however, the agency seems to be asking a different question: how to let innovation thrive while maintaining oversight. Gensler-led SEC: Enforcement as policy Gensler treated most cryptocurrencies as “securities” and centered his crypto regulation strategy on aggressive enforcement and litigation. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC filed over 125 crypto-related enforcement actions and obtained a total monetary settlement, according to the report . About 64% were non-fraudulent actions alleging unregistered securities offering violations, and 37% were unanimously approved by the Commissioners. Between late 2020 and 2024, the SEC filed a string of lawsuits against several high-profile crypto firms, including Ripple (December 2020), Bittrex (April 2023), Coinbase (June 2023), Binance (June 2023), and Kraken (November 2023), alleging violations such as unregistered securities offerings and operating unlicensed exchanges. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized Gensler “ prejudged crypto ,” pursuing lawsuits against crypto firms “without investigation,” stifling the industry’s growth in the US. The enforcement-heavy environment in the U.S. led some crypto businesses to exit the market. Some firms, despite being registered with the SEC, struggled to stay afloat under the strict regulations. Atkins-led SEC: Innovation as strategy Following Gensler’s departure in January 2025 and before Atkins’ arrival, Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda announced the creation of the Crypto Task Force, which is led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. The task force’s goal was to take a balanced approach to the cryptocurrency and digital asset sector rather than prioritizing only enforcement. A significant policy shift occurred in January 2025 when the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 . It eased barriers for financial institutions offering crypto custodial services. Since taking office in April 2025, Atkins has led the SEC to begin withdrawing or pausing select crypto lawsuits. In July 2025, the agency launched Project Crypto to “modernize the securities rules and regulations” and enable U.S. financial markets to operate on-chain. At DC Fintech Week on October 15, the pro-crypto SEC chair emphasized the objective of building a future-proof crypto framework “to actually attract people back into the United States who may have fled.” By jokingly dubbing the SEC a “Securities and Innovation Commission” at the Forum, he signaled the agency’s innovation-friendly agenda. Ultimately, the SEC, led by Atkins, plans to initiate rulemaking around its “innovation exemption” vision by the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on the status of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown .

The proposed legislation was introduced at the 2026 legislative session. The House Bill 183 authorizes the state’s chief financial officer to allocate 10% of public funds into Bitcoin and ETFs. The specific public funds include the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund. NEW: Florida files first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill of the 2026 legislative session. House Bill 183 would allow the state to invest 10% of public funds in digital assets, and permits retirement fund investment. pic.twitter.com/sI4bUBiiB3 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) October 16, 2025 Further, the state’s retirement system would be subject to similar allocation guidelines, subject to some limitations and conditions. Former Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis already advocated for the state to include Bitcoin in Pension Funds last year. He called Bitcoin “digital gold,” which would help diversify Florida’s portfolio. Strict Custody and Compliance Measures The detailed proposal stipulates stringent custody safeguards, mandating that crypto holdings be managed by the CFO and through qualified custodians. Florida legislators crafted these guardrails to align with federal compliance standards and institutional investment best practices. The legislation, if approved, would allow Floridians to pay certain taxes and fees in digital assets. These payments would then be converted to dollars and sent to the state’s general revenue fund, the proposal read. Besides, the bill clarifies that digital assets are not limited to Bitcoin or tokenized securities, but could also include non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Florida: From Stalling BTC Reserve Plans to Strategic Leap In May, Florida abandoned efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, placing the state alongside Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma, which have recently failed to pass legislation allowing Bitcoin-based investment strategies. The latest bill proposal aligns with similar frameworks enacted by Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas, per tracking platform Bitcoin Laws. Meanwhile, other states are preparing for new sessions in early 2026. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bills. Source: Bitcoin Laws “States are seeking to modernize their balance sheets,” said Julian Fahrer, founder of Bitcoin Laws. The House Bill 183 is awaiting further hearings in the Florida House.
