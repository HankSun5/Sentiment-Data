Lise has secured a DLT TSS license from the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR) under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime, a regulatory sandbox allowing blockchain-based financial infrastructures to operate within traditional legal frameworks. The milestone, achieved in coordination with the Banque de France, ESMA, AMF, and the European Central Bank, positions Lise as the first French market infrastructure to merge the roles of a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) and a Central Securities Depository (CSD) on a single distributed ledger. This integration allows trading and post-trading operations to occur instantly, eliminating settlement delays, reducing counterparty risk, and potentially allowing 24/7 trading, something unprecedented in European capital markets. Lise Open Tokenized IPO Path for Small and Mid-Cap Firms Lise seeks to open the public markets to small and mid-cap enterprises (SMEs and midcaps) that have traditionally faced barriers to going public. “This is a true breakthrough for capital markets,” said Mark Kepeneghian , CEO of Lise. Backed by major institutions including BNP Paribas, Bpifrance, and CACEIS, Lise is a subsidiary of Kriptown, a French fintech that has long described itself as a “neo-exchange” for startups and growing firms. Analysts say Lise’s approval could make France a European leader in tokenized securities, setting the stage for a future where IPOs, equity trading, and investor participation happen entirely on-chain. Additionally, the exchange plans to host its first IPOs in early 2026, setting the stage for a new model of digital public offerings that merge traditional finance with blockchain efficiency. The launch arrives amid a broader wave of tokenization in global finance. Data from RWA.xyz shows that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has surged past $33.9 billion, up over 10% in the past month. Private credit leads the sector with $17.5 billion, followed by U.S. Treasury debt at $8.3 billion and commodities at $2.8 billion, boosted by strong growth in tokenized gold markets. Source: RWA.xyz Ethereum dominates the RWA space, hosting $12.1 billion in tokenized assets, about 57.5% of the market, compared to $686 million on Solana, which is growing quickly but still far behind. The rising adoption of tokenized assets reflects growing institutional interest, particularly as traditional financial players seek to modernize infrastructure. Can Lise’s Tokenized Exchange Rewrite How Europe Does IPOs? Lise’s model seeks to integrate trading and settlement within a unified blockchain system. Transactions occur instantly, bypassing the traditional multi-day clearing and settlement process. For issuers, especially small and mid-sized enterprises, this structure drastically lowers the costs of going public and simplifies shareholder management, dividend distribution, and governance. The platform also allows retail and institutional investors to invest directly in European businesses, both during IPOs and in the secondary market. By combining regulated market oversight with blockchain efficiency, Lise hopes to make investing in the real economy more transparent, liquid, and continuous. For decades, IPOs have relied on intermediaries such as underwriters and investment banks to handle risk assessment, pricing, and distribution. Source: The European Securities and Markets Authority These processes are often expensive and time-consuming. Lise’s model seeks to “rewrite how IPOs work” by removing many of those barriers, replacing legacy systems with blockchain technology that supports instant issuance, settlement, and custody. The platform’s DLT foundation also aligns with the European Union’s DLT Pilot Regime , which took effect in March 2023. The regime provides a legal framework for trading and settlement of financial instruments using blockchain technology under MiFID II rules. Lise’s Approval Adds to Global Push for Tokenized Markets Lise’s licensing follows a broader wave of traditional financial exchanges experimenting with tokenization. In September, the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) launched its Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI) , a blockchain-based platform developed with Microsoft, to support tokenized fund issuance and settlement. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has launched a blockchain-based infrastructure platform for private funds, marking a significant step. #London #Crypto https://t.co/SYbuYmTdWz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 Around the same time, Nasdaq submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval to trade tokenized versions of stocks under equivalent regulatory protections as traditional equities. Meanwhile, crypto firms such as Robinhood , Kraken, and Gemini have already begun offering tokenized stock trading in Europe , while others, including Coinbase and Dinari, are pursuing U.S. regulatory clearance . The retail-focused tokenized stock market has grown rapidly, reaching $412 million in value, up from just a few million last year. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) warned global regulators that tokenized stocks “mimic” equities without offering shareholder rights or market trading safeguards. #WFE #TokenizedStocks #BlockchainTokens https://t.co/3UxpywsfMs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 26, 2025 However, regulators remain cautious. The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) recently urged global watchdogs , including the SEC and ESMA, to tighten oversight on tokenized equities, warning that many of these instruments lack shareholder rights or proper safeguards.

The move gives the altcoin access to Coinbase’s user base of over 105 million investors, positioning it for major U.S. market exposure. Assets added to the roadmap today: BNB (BNB) https://t.co/lyEugQo7Cv — Coinbase Markets (@CoinbaseMarkets) October 15, 2025 Coinbase follows Kraken’s recent BNB listing, extending an olive branch to a rival chain in a testament to growing market demand for the Binance-native utility token. Commenting on the trend, ex-Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao noted that “not listing it is a loss for the exchange themselves,” citing BNB’s strong liquidity, volume, and ecosystem. The move does appear to be strategic. Binance Smart Chain has processed over 500 million transactions in the past 30 days, marking a 151% month-over-month increase. Exchanges seem eager to capture a share of that momentum. Binance is having its own “supercycle” moment, driven by a boom in its native meme coin market. BNB Price Prediction: Binance Coin Eyes New Highs on Fresh Demand Deepened exposure in U.S. markets could drive the demand Binance Coin needs to realize a 15-month ascending triangle pattern breakout. While the post-breakout momentum had stalled with last week’s market crash, momentum indicators put the structure back in play. BNB / USDT 1-day chart, 15-month ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. While the MACD histogram’s wide gap below the signal line suggests the downtrend persists, the RSI has found a strong footing with a higher low above the signal line. Buy pressure remains strong. If this strength persists, a decisive trend shift could put the patterns $1,650 breakout target back in focus, continuing into new price discovery in a 40% move. In not, a retest of psychological support around $1,000 stands as a credible local bottom. Long-term, U.S. interest rate cuts could stimulate risk appetite into 2026. With growing capital rotation into meme coins, BNB could extend another 150% to $3,000 under stronger demand conditions. PepeNode: You Don’t Need to Pick the Right Coin to Profit This Cycle While the Binance supercycle is shining a spotlight on meme coins again, volatility is making them unpredictable. But what if you could mine them instead of rolling the dice on the perfect entry? With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, stack virtual rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is accelerating fast. The presale has already topped $1.8 million, with early stakers still earning up to 700% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. With capital flowing back into high-risk assets, PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture meme coin upside, without the risk.

Together with XRP, it is the top presale funding raiser project garnering institutional interest. As we observe XRP’s bullish trends, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a strong contender for investors seeking high returns in this uncertain market. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Demand and Retail Fear Catalyst XRP is finding solid support around the $3 mark as investor interest grows. Most importantly, its potential to get approved for ETFs is behind the price surge. The above developments indicate a shift from retail-driven fear to institutional-driven demand, which is often a strong driver for significant price increases. At present, the XRP price is hovering around $3.00. Furthermore, the coin has the capacity to overcome key resistances. Moreover, analysts are projecting the price of XRP to skyrocket to $5.00. The bullish case for XRP is strengthened by growing expectations of XRP ETF approvals, which could unleash large amounts of liquidity and institutional inflows. Market experts believe that a successful authorisation of the XRP ETF could lead to the XRP token’s price soaring to about $5.00 by 2025. Institutional Demand and XRP’s Future XRP is poised to attract growing interest from institutions, with some investors speculating that it could become a primary target for large-scale institutional investment. It is due to its usefulness in cross-border payments and growing adoption by the financial establishment. Institutional players are considering adding XRP to their portfolios, and experts are awaiting approval of XRP ETFs. A Promising Presale Opportunity Amid Market Uncertainty Along with XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE has adopted the successful presale strategy that brought significant growth to various projects in the past. MAGACOIN FINANCE recently held its presale, which raised over $16 million in funds. Thousands of investors, including whales from established coins, purchased MAGACOIN tokens. Due to its deflationary tokenomics and the demand for its Ethereum-based DeFi offerings, this early-stage project is gaining traction. Experts believe returns between 10x and 100x post listing. A few even predict even more significant growth if the project continues to expand as it already has. Conclusion XRP is likely to see a substantial price surge and could move towards $5 or more by 2025 due to institutional interest and ETF approval. The bearish trend has shifted from retail-driven fear to institution-driven demand. This paves the way for a hefty recovery. So, XRP is one of the top altcoins to track in the coming months. Likewise, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be one of the strongest presales of 2025, with solid institutional backing, deflationary tokenomics, and a safe and secure project, audited and trusted. With vibrant activity emerging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, it is now a good investment to add to your crypto portfolio. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as major proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

Binance Secures Regulatory Sign-Off Based on reports , South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit approved the change of major shareholder on October 15, 2025. The deal gives Binance control of a majority stake it first bought in February 2023 — a 67% holding — which had been held up by what turned into a near two-year regulatory review. The purchase was originally framed as a way to stabilize Gopax after the exchange ran into trouble tied to its GoFi product and fallout from the collapse of a US counterpart. For users who had limited access to funds, the takeover was presented as a fix to help restore withdrawals and overdue interest payments. What The Approval Means For Gopax And Users Reports have disclosed that the FIU’s decision came after regulators reviewed Gopax’s revised business plan and Binance’s responses to anti-money-laundering concerns. The US regulatory action against Binance, including a reported $4.3 billion settlement over past compliance failures, was cited by local officials as a factor that had to be considered during the review. With the approval, Gopax is expected to move more quickly to rebuild customer confidence and to meet domestic rules that apply to exchanges operating in South Korea. Market Reaction And Competition Local exchanges are watching closely. Upbit and Bithumb dominate trading volume in South Korea, and both will likely compete harder on fees and services now that a Binance-backed platform is officially back. Traders reacted with a mix of caution and interest. Some investors said they welcome added choice. Others said they plan to wait and see how Gopax implements corporate governance and compliance steps before moving funds. Why It Took Time Reports show the approval process dragged on because regulators were focused on governance, executive changes, and how funds and KYC systems would be handled under Binance’s control. The gap between the initial purchase in February 2023 and the October 2025 sign-off stretched over more than two years. That delay reflected both local caution and the broader scrutiny Binance has faced in multiple countries. Next Steps And Oversight According to officials familiar with the matter, Gopax will now need to implement the specific compliance measures it pledged to regulators. The exchange will be monitored, and further checks could be applied as part of ongoing oversight.

Analyst Says The Clock Is Ticking,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fate-sealed-october-31/,"Bitcoin slipped below three-day Ichimoku cloud support on Wednesday, prompting market technician Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) to flag the first decisive warning for bulls while outlining a tight sequence of conditional signals into month-end. Sharing a chart on X, he wrote: “Bulls finally lost the 3D kumo support which is the first clear red flag to look for.” He cautioned that the breakdown does not guarantee a straight-line slide, adding that “the kumo is very thick here which means the price can be very spiky/turbulent and even further down moves may be ‘bumpy’ for bears with bounces etc…” Why Bitcoin’s Next Bull Window Opens October 31 The analyst framed the next tests through the lens of Ichimoku’s time-price structure and the weekly baseline. “Probably the clearest indication for now to watch for would be the time cycles and whether the weekly Kijun Sen will hold,” he said, specifying levels at $105.700 for the current week and “$109,559” for next week. In Ichimoku methodology, the weekly Kijun Sen functions as a mean-reversion axis; sustained closes below it typically confirm momentum deterioration, while defenses of the line can reassert trend control without requiring an immediate new high. Dr Cat’s near-term line in the sand on daily closing conditions is clear: “If today closes above $113K we don’t have an indication for an immediate danger of a bearish continuation.” That threshold sits alongside his broader stance that separates time horizons. He reiterated that his “Long term = Bullish with the same targets I’ve shared many times,” but recast the shorter outlook as “Short to mid term = Neutral, range between ~$100K and prev ATH.” Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Now Control 44% Of Realized Cap, Highest Ever Rather than declaring a hard bottom, he now views sentiment as a risk factor in its own right: “I said recently that the bottom should be put by the 13th of October — and even already in. But today after observing the sentiment I have strong concerns about red flags… I haven’t seen in a very long time so much mass bullish confidence and even arrogance across Twitter. So at this point I will simply not try to guess whether the bottom is in or not.” He mapped out escalation points if downside resumes. “Short term bearish triggers would be a renew of the crash low briefly after the 13th of October, mid-term bearish trigger: the same but after the 19th, even better after the 26th of October.” In other words, a swift retest immediately after October 13 would raise short-term alarms, while fresh lows registered after October 19 or October 26 would strengthen the case that the corrective phase has more to run. He also downplayed the odds of a straight snapback, warning that “even if the bottom is in, a V-shaped recovery remains extremely unlikely.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Reset Complete? Ostium Foresees Explosive Move To $133,000 Against that caution, Dr Cat still identifies a specific window for bullish validation. Anchoring to Ichimoku’s Chikou Span alignment on the daily and three-day timeframes, he said “the earliest window of opportunity for a bull breakout above ATH is the 31st of October.” That timing caveat is critical: the October 31 marker is a first possible opening, not a guarantee, contingent on price stabilizing around or above the weekly Kijun and avoiding those date-based bearish triggers. The shared chart underscores the nuance: price slipping beneath the three-day cloud is a mechanical negative, but the thickness of the cloud and proximity of higher-timeframe supports imply choppy discovery rather than a clean trend resolution before the end of the month. Taken together, Dr Cat’s framework is binary but conditional. A daily close back above $113,000 would blunt “immediate” continuation risk and keep the weekly Kijun defenses in play at $105,700 this week and $109,559 next week. Failure to hold those rails — particularly if accompanied by renewed lows after the 19th or 26th — would harden the corrective bias and defer any credible breakout attempt. As the calendar tightens, the market now has a clear checklist into October 31, when, per his model, the first “window of opportunity” opens for a move that could credibly threaten and surpass the previous all-time high. At press time, Bitcoin stood at $111,479.

The deal throws Ripple right into the heart of the $120 trillion corporate treasury market, giving it direct access to some of the largest companies on Earth and their global capital operations through GTreasury, which has reportedly been building treasury management systems for more than 40 years. This is a full-blown takeover paid entirely in XRP. GTreasury is known for running complex cash forecasting, risk management, and compliance tools for major corporations. Ripple now owns all of that. And instead of tweaking the current system, the company is trying to replace it with something faster and programmable. No more waiting days for cross-border settlements. No more capital locked in silos. Ripple says it’s building a system where money moves instantly, and corporate treasurers can actually use their funds when and where they need them. Ripple adds GTreasury’s enterprise clients to its crypto rails Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, said the existing infrastructure has been a bottleneck for far too long. “For too long, money has been stuck in slow, outdated payments systems and infrastructure, causing unnecessary delays, high costs, and roadblocks to entering new markets—problems that blockchain technologies are ideally suited to solve.” Brad believes this merger is about freeing trapped capital. He said combining Ripple’s crypto infrastructure with GTreasury’s treasury systems gives teams the tools to process payments in real time and find new ways to grow. GTreasury’s boss Renaat Ver Eecke called the move a “watershed moment” for corporate finance. “We have focused on providing the most compliant and feature-rich solutions to corporations around the globe,” Renaat said. “Now, by joining Ripple, we are accelerating our vision from managing capital to activating it.” Renaat pointed to the mix of their forecasting and risk tools with Ripple’s speed, global crypto network, and digital asset tools as the reason treasurers will now be able to handle liquidity, payments, and risk across the digital economy. With the deal, Ripple is giving corporate finance teams new tools to hold, move, and invest crypto assets across borders and time zones. One of the first key integrations will allow clients to route capital into the global repo market using prime broker Hidden Road, which Ripple also acquired earlier this year. That gives companies a way to actually earn on short-term idle capital, which is a massive pain point in traditional systems. Ripple accelerates crypto push with third acquisition in 2025 This is Ripple’s third major acquisition in 2025, following its takeovers of Hidden Road and Rail, a platform that focuses on stablecoin infrastructure. The goal here is to absorb the existing stack and wire it directly into Ripple’s crypto rails, the press release said . The deal with GTreasury is expected to close in a few months, pending regulatory approvals. Until then, both teams are already starting to work on the technical integration needed to merge systems and bring real-time liquidity to the enterprise. Brad later posted on X to hammer the point home: “Today, Ripple is breaking into the $120T corporate treasury payments market with the $1B acquisition of GTreasury. The past few years have reminded this industry why payments, first and foremost, is THE primary use case for crypto and blockchain. Payments are where Ripple first started for exactly these reasons—the infrastructure is complex, siloed and inefficient, but as we know, perfectly positioned to benefit from decentralized financial technologies.” He added that “astounding amounts of cash are trapped in outdated payments systems, creating friction, unnecessary costs, and barriers to entering new markets. GTreasury has been serving some of the most well known brands for decades—and now together with Ripple, we’ll be able to help CFOs manage all their assets, include stablecoins, tokenized deposits, etc at scale around the world, as well as put their idle capital to work with repo markets via Hidden Road. The opportunity is here, and we’re diving right in. It’s happening.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to BNY’s Q3 earnings report, net income rose to $1.34 billion, while earnings per share reached $1.88, up 25% from last year. The bank said total revenue hit a record $5.1 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year, with both Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services contributing to the growth, while the pre-tax margin came in at at 36%, and return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) surged to 25.6%. Chief Executive Officer Robin Vince said the company’s strategy is delivering measurable progress. “BNY delivered another quarter of strong results,” he said, adding that record revenue came from “broad-based growth across our platforms” and that its two core transformation programs are “showing results.” Robin pointed to a new commercial model that is helping the firm boost sales momentum and expand client solutions. He also said the company is integrating artificial intelligence across its operations, describing the latest version of BNY’s AI platform, Eliza, as “smarter, faster and easier to use.” BNY increases revenue, invests in efficiency Total fee revenue reached $3.64 billion, up 7%, driven by stronger client flows, higher market values, and a weaker U.S. dollar that benefited international operations. Investment and other revenue came in at $208 million, helped by disposal gains and other investment profits. Net interest income surged by 18% to $1.24 billion, supported by the reinvestment of maturing securities into higher-yield assets and balance sheet growth, though changes in deposit mix offset some of the gain. The bank reported a $7 million benefit from credit losses, driven by a more favorable macroeconomic outlook that outweighed higher reserves linked to commercial real estate exposure. Noninterest expense increased 4% to $3.24 billion, mainly from staff merit raises, investment spending, and a weaker dollar. These expenses were partly offset by efficiency savings, and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%, said BNY. BNY’s average deposits reached $299 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while capital levels stayed strong. The Tier 1 leverage ratio held at 6.1%, and the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stood at 11.7%, compared to 11.9% a year ago. The bank returned $1.2 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $381 million in dividends and $849 million in share repurchases, with a 92% payout ratio year-to-date. BNY faces lawsuit over Epstein-linked claims BNY’s assets under custody and administration surged by 11%, while assets under management totaled $2.1 trillion, flat from last year as inflows were offset by outflows. The earnings report claims that BNY’s liquidity remains stable, with an average liquidity coverage ratio of 112% and a net stable funding ratio of 130%, both exceeding regulatory minimums. But alongside the strong quarter, BNY did acknowledge that it now faces new legal pressure. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit against BNY and Bank of America, alleging they knowingly provided financial services that enabled Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street , Robin said, “We don’t think the suit has any merit, and we’re going to contest it vigorously.” Jane Doe is represented by Boies Schiller and Edwards Henderson, the same firms that previously secured $75 million and $290 million settlements from Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, respectively, over similar claims.

Alongside its Solana product, Volatility Shares now oversees $781 million in AUM , showing that institutional demand for crypto-based investment vehicles is rising fast. As more financial giants roll out products like this, the case for higher XRP valuations continues to strengthen. XRP Price Prediction: Ongoing Accumulation Favors Big Upcoming Push to $10 XRP is down 13% over the past week , yet trading activity remains high, with $6 billion in volume over the past 24 hours, representing 4% of its circulating supply. Despite the pullback, XRP continues to hold within a key range between $2 and $3.65 , still awaiting a breakout while Ethereum and BNB Coin push into new all-time highs. This consolidation phase could be a sign of accumulation , not weakness — and all it may take is the right catalyst to send XRP soaring. A bullish RSI crossover above the 14-day moving average could be the early signal that a new leg up is coming. In the near term, a move to $10 looks realistic as institutional adoption gains pace. Over the longer term, a $100 XRP price prediction is still in play as Ripple expands its ecosystem and utility. At the same time, altcoin season has sparked major interest in early-stage presale plays like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Solana-powered Bitcoin Layer-2 that has already raised $23 million from investors eager to catch the next wave of breakout potential. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Kickstart a New Era for BTCFi BTC holders have waited for a long time for a project that solves the issues that have prevented Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem from further expanding. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first layer-2 scaling protocol for the top crypto, leveraging the efficiency and low transaction costs offered by the Solana network, along with smart contract support. Through the Hyper Bridge, BTC holders can safely send their tokens to a designated Bitcoin wallet and get the corresponding amount in the Hyper L2 to stake, lend, and earn yield on their assets through a suite of dApps built on this side chain. As top wallets and exchanges progressively embrace this solution, the demand for its native asset, $HYPER, should skyrocket, making Bitcoin Hyper one of the most attractive presales of the year. To buy $HYPER before its next price increase, head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

These three coins are all in a strong position fundamentally and technically, with Tether Gold in a particularly strong position to rise as traders seek safer havens. We look at the prospects for these coins in the article below, while we also take a look at one up-and-coming token that’s winning over lots of new investors. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Altcoin Could Explode As Soon As ETFs Begin Launching XRP has declined by 2% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.45 representing a 13% loss in a week and a 19% drop in a month. On the other hand, XRP can still point to a 350% increase in the past year, during which it has made strong headway on the back of Ripple’s renewed growth. This annual gain gives it a great launchpad for further increases towards the end of the year, especially if the numerous XRP ETFs in waiting receive the go-ahead from the SEC. XRP ETFs would result in an explosion of demand for the altcoin, which is already popular among institutions, according to CoinShares data . And given its strong fundamentals, its oversold chart looks very bullish right now, in that it indicates that a big upwards correction could come soon. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both hit bottoms recently, signalling that XRP is trading at a big discount relative to recent levels. So sooner or later, buyers should swoop back in, something which they’re likely to do as and when the first ETFs launch. We could therefore see the XRP restore to $3 in November, while ETF volumes could push it beyond $5 by the New Year. Crypto Price Prediction: Tether Gold ($XAUT) – Waning Dollar Will Continue to Push Gold-Linked Token to New Highs In contrast to most other top-100 tokens, Tether Gold has risen today, moving to $4,254 and confirming a 5% increase in a week. XAUT has also risen by 15% in a month and by 59% in a year, with its rise coming as tariff uncertainty, inflation, and a declining dollar push more investors towards the safe haven of gold. And because XAUT is pegged 1:1 with gold, the token has risen accordingly, with more gains likely to come in the near and more distant future. Its chart today highlights how much momentum it has gathered over the past few weeks, particularly in September and October. Source: TradingView Normally, its elevated RSI and MACD would indicate overbuying, predicting that a correction may be coming soon. However, Tether Gold is not a normal asset, given its pegging to gold itself, so it will rise for as long as gold continues to rise. And given the ongoing instability of the global economy, there’s no immediate end to gold’s current rally. XAUT could reach $5,000 by the end of the year, while a longer-term target would be $7,000. Crypto Price Prediction: Pepe ($PEPE) – Whales Continue to Accumulate Oversold Meme Token Pepe has taken a 3% hit today, with its drop to $0.00000723 also marking a 21% decline in the past week and a 33% decline in the last 30 days. Worryingly, PEPE has also suffered a 31% drop in the past year, unlike most major tokens, which have risen (often substantially) in this period. This would suggest that Pepe may be experiencing a long-term decline, possibly as traders concentrate more on newer meme coins. That said, whales continue to buy Pepe every now and again , indicating that it has an enduring appeal as a vehicle for profits. Assuming that this trend will continue, its chart today would suggest that it could recover strongly soon, given its oversold indicators. Source: TradingView Its MACD has been declining over the past few days and looks like it could bottom out very soon, announcing the onset of a rebound. Because Pepe is a meme token, it will depend on a market-wide recovery to make its own recovery. Such a recovery may arrive with the launch of altcoin ETFs towards the end of the year, which could incite a bull rally. In this kind of context, PEPE will return to $0.000010 in November and will push towards $0.000030 by the end of the year. PEPENODE Raises $1.8 Million As Market Prepares for Launch of First Mine-to-Earn Token The crypto price prediction for the 3 coins above does look very promising, yet traders may also want to diversify into newer tokens, since these can often outperform during bull periods. One possibility may be to look at presale coins, which, under the right conditions, can rally hard when they list for the first time. One of the most interesting presale coins available right now is PEPENDOE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has now raised over $1.8 million in its increasingly popular sale. It's always where you least expect it.. But with PEPENODE you can ALWAYS expect bigger and better nodes https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/2TYP9c3cJv — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 16, 2025 The main reason for the growing interest in PEPENODE is that it’s the market’s first-ever mine-to-earn token. What this means is that its platform provides users with the ability to build and run their own virtual mining rigs, from which they can earn rewards in other tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin. By using the PEPENODE token to buy more virtual nodes, users can earn greater rewards. As such, there’s a real incentive to accumulate more PEPENODE, which could rise consistently in price as a result of sustained demand. Holders of PEPENODE will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, while investors can buy it now by going to the coin’s official website. It’s currently selling for $0.001105, although there’s every chance that it will eclipse this price once it lists.

He emphasized that Binance has consistently listed all digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, suggesting that XRP’s strength and size warranted continued support despite regulatory pressures. Strong Projects Do Not Need to Pay for Listings CZ’s comments follow recent debates about Binance’s listing requirements. In a separate post, he stated that solid blockchain projects do not need to pay to get listed, arguing that teams focused on innovation and long-term value creation are more likely to attract exchange support. Need a listing fee (sarcasm) I believe Binance listed all top coins over $100 billion market cap. Never delisted XRP (when they were attacked) either. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 15, 2025 His remark came after Limitless Labs CEO CJ Hetherington publicly criticized Binance’s alleged conditions for securing an early “alpha listing”, a form of preliminary access to spot trading on the exchange. Hetherington claimed that Binance demanded a 4% token allocation for user airdrops, an additional 1% for marketing, a $250,000 security deposit, and a further $2 million in BNB as collateral for listing. According to Hetherington, these terms were unreasonable and gave preference to wealthier projects. He added that launching a token on Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 blockchain, might be a better alternative. Base creator Jesse Pollak also weighed in, stating that token listings should not come with high financial barriers, and suggesting that Binance’s approach undermines accessibility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Binance’s Response CZ dismissed Hetherington’s claims as misleading, describing the criticism as an example of “loser mentality.” He clarified that Binance’s listing process is designed to prioritize user safety and transparency. The deposits, he explained, apply only to listings that carry a higher risk and are refundable under standard conditions. Binance co-founder He Yi also addressed the controversy, confirming that the exchange does not charge listing fees for reputable projects and that the refundable deposits function as safeguards rather than hidden costs. CZ’s reaffirmation that Binance stood by XRP during its legal battle reinforces the exchange’s reputation for supporting established crypto assets. While regulatory scrutiny continues to shape exchange policies, Binance’s approach underscores the importance it places on liquidity, stability, and user protection. At present, XRP remains a top-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization, maintaining a strong trading presence on major exchanges, including Binance , which has continued to facilitate its trading pairs without interruption.

Interoperability framework Legacy Mesh has integrated Solana, exposing the altcoin to $175 billion in cross-chain liquidity from native USDt and Tether Gold (XAUt). Since its debut, USDT0 has already processed over $25 billion in bridge volume across twelve chains. Now, Solana users can tap that same unified liquidity to support dApps, payments, and institutional-grade use cases like treasury management, remittances, and collateralized lending. According to Bitwise Chief Investment Matt Hougan, Solana is positioned to win over Wall Street and become banks’ preferred network for stablecoin transactions. “Solana is the new Wall Street” – @Matt_Hougan , CIO @BitwiseInvest pic.twitter.com/gNfEu8Pbdr — Solana (@solana) October 3, 2025 Tether integration only strengthens the argument, alongside protocols such as Splyce and Chintai that allow retail investors to access tokenized securities directly on the network.

The altcoin is now retesting a key demand zone around $180. Recovering this level could confirm a higher low and signal the start of a new uptrend, setting up for a potential breakout.

The RSI is trending back toward the neutral line, while the MACD histogram is converging on the signal line, both signs of building buy pressure. The key breakout threshold sits at $300, the early-year Solana price all-time high. Once flipped to support, SOL could enter new price discovery, targeting $500 for a potential 160% gain. But with deepening TradFi exposure through stablecoins, corporate treasury accumulation, and upcoming spot ETFs, fresh demand could see the rally extend 415% to $1,000.

Large holders have been rapidly exiting their positions. Net position change data shows an aggressive sell-off trend, with whale wallets offloading 360 million DOGE , worth approximately $74 million . This likely coincided with the broader flash crash across the market, but the scale of Dogecoin-specific selling is hard to ignore. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Key Trend Line Bounce Still Favors Bullish Outlook Dogecoin (DOGE) just bounced off a key trend line, signaling strong buyer support even as whales continue to sell. The token is holding steady at $0.20, with volumes spiking to 10% of its circulating supply. If DOGE clears the $0.22 resistance, it could be the start of a major rally to $0.45 or higher. That said, if large holders keep dumping, a break below trend line support could open the door to $0.14 or even $0.12. Still, history shows that dog-themed tokens have outperformed across multiple cycles.

The cryptocurrency’s rising correlation with equities lessens bitcoin’s role as a diversification tool. Gold, by contrast, is shining this year as a safe-haven asset, effectively flipping the “digital gold” narrative promoted by cryptocurrency advocates on its head. By James Picerno Bitcoin may or may not become a global standard for digital payments in the years ahead, but it looks like a good proxy for assessing the financial market’s appetite for risk. That’s good news for investors looking for an alternative read on equity risk sentiment, but it could be problematic for using bitcoin as a hedge against stock market risk. Back in March we noted that comparing the most popular cryptocurrency with US shares (S&P 500 Index) suggests an increasingly tighter connection between bitcoin and sentiment on Wall Street. Seven months later, the connection between the two asset classes looks even tighter. The latest example: When stocks tanked last Friday (Oct. 10), so did bitcoin, which lost substantially more that day vs. the S&P 500. Gold, by contrast, was up 1.0%. One day could be noise, of course, but a review of bitcoin vs. stocks over the last several years confirms a tighter connection between the assets in recent history. For example, over the past three years, the daily returns for bitcoin and the S&P 500 posted a moderately positive 0.33 correlation, up from a slightly negative correlation in the previous three-year period. Note: Perfect correlation (no diversification benefit) is indicated by 1.0; no correlation (random behavior) is 0.0; and -1.0 is perfect negative correlation (always moving inversely). Although the cryptocurrency still exhibits a fair amount of return independence from stocks, the degree of low/negative correlation is fading as the asset moves into the mainstream of financial markets. Monitoring risk sentiment The upside of a higher correlation: there are times when bitcoin appears to offer contemporaneous, or early, signals of a change in risk sentiment for stocks. The digital asset’s downturn in early 2025, for instance, foreshadowed the subsequent slide in equities. Coincidence? Maybe, but something similar occurred again in April, when bitcoin bottomed around the time that the decline in stocks started to reverse. These two events suggest that this crypto asset sometimes confirms, if not predicts, a change in investors’ risk appetite for stocks. By contrast, bitcoin in its early days was seen as an independent asset, disconnected from traditional financial markets and the economy. That perception was largely attributable to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which, historically, operated outside the mainstream of finance through a network of independent and predominantly offshore exchanges. But the growing embrace of the cryptocurrency by institutions and easier access for individuals via publicly traded bitcoin funds have tightened the ebb and flow between the two asset classes. Correlation and Diversification The rising correlation between bitcoin and stocks suggests that the digital currency has become somewhat less useful for diversifying equity risk, if only on the margins so far. Consider how a rolling 3-month window for daily returns has evolved. The linear trend shows the correlation approaching 0.4 (black line in the chart below). That’s still well below correlations between, say, US large-cap stocks vs. small-caps, or US stocks and foreign equities. But if recent history is a guide, bitcoin and stocks look set to become even more closely aligned in the future. Bitcoin’s moderately positive correlation still offers a degree of independence from stocks, but the connection between the two assets is showing stronger alignment in periods of elevated stock market stress, such as during the spring correction. Bitcoin’s story as an investment class has continually evolved, from digital cash to a store of value, and later to a volatile, high-return vehicle. As its correlation with equity markets deepens, it is beginning to resemble a speculative asset more than the alternative store of value it was once touted to be. It’s too soon to write off bitcoin as a diversifying force for stocks. Even if it’s more closely aligned with equities going forward, it may still be useful as a complement for diversifying stock market risk vis-a-vis other asset classes, such as bonds, commodities and property shares. But if 2025 is a guide, it seems that the crypto’s success in going mainstream is starting to conflict with its earlier image as an asset apart from the financial system’s status quo.

The case is the first legal challenge the Chamber has brought against Trump this term, according to court filings lodged on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Chamber the fee as “not only misguided policy” but “plainly unlawful,” and asked the court to strike down the rule as an abuse of executive power. Before this change, H-1B visa costs were usually below $5,000, excluding attorney fees. But under Trump’s new rule, companies would have to pay $100,000 per visa, a twentyfold increase. For industries like technology, manufacturing, education, health care, and finance, the Chamber warned, this could shut off access to specialized workers altogether. Chamber warns the new fee will hurt U.S. businesses “The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber, said in a statement. The Chamber’s decision to sue is striking because it has mostly stayed silent on other controversial Trump policies, like the nasty tariffs that have caused turmoil for small manufacturers. This time, however, the group said the new H-1B structure would hurt American competitiveness and block innovation. The White House announced the rule in mid-September, triggering confusion across companies that sponsor H-1B workers and among the visa holders themselves. Many feared losing their legal status, until the administration clarified that current H-1B holders were exempt from the change. Each year, the government issues about 85,000 new H-1B visas, selected through a lottery from roughly 425,000 applications. Universities are exempt from that cap, but the rest of corporate America must compete fiercely for those limited slots. White House defends the move and introduces gold card option Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, defended the new fee, calling it “lawful” and “a necessary, initial, incremental step toward reforms.” She said, “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H-1B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had said last week the $100,000 price was chosen to stop companies from using H-1B visas for entry-level hires and instead target “the great engineers” and “impressively detailed executives.” At the same event, Trump signed an executive order allowing wealthy foreigners to pay $1 million for a “gold card” giving them U.S. residency, and corporations to pay $2 million for a “corporate gold card” letting them sponsor one or more employees. Despite its lawsuit, the Chamber still acknowledged some of Trump’s economic achievements. Bradley said, “President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth.” But he noted that long-term expansion “will require more workers, not fewer.” Bradley added that Trump has repeatedly said he wants to “educate, attract, and retain the world’s best and brightest in the U.S.,” and the Chamber “shares that goal.” The organization maintains that the H-1B program, when priced fairly, is essential for keeping America’s workforce competitive and ensuring that U.S. companies don’t lose access to the specialized talent needed to stay ahead in global markets.

Mining stocks have shown resilience in the past year, jumping from a market cap of $28 billion to $94 billion. That’s an increase of around 235% in only 12 months. Investors have shown massive interest in mining companies. Last week, IREN Limited signed multi-year cloud services contracts for deploying Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs. MARA Holdings has agreed to acquire a stake of 64% in Exaion, the company that specializes in operating high-performance computing (HPC) data centers. Despite the positive sentiment, mining stocks have dropped sharply after a Bitcoin slide to under $108,000. Miners sell Bitcoin Bitcoin miners have been showing signs of selling pressure. Based on a report by Cryptopolitan, around 51,000 BTC, worth around $5.6 billion, were moved from miner wallets to exchanges starting October 9. Two days ago, Bitcoin mining stocks reached double their value to $94 billion but dropped to $86.91 billion, based on data from Bitcoin Mining Stock. IREN Limited leads in the Bitcoin mining stock market with a market cap of $16.76 billion. The stock dropped by 9% and currently trades at $61.83. The second spot is reserved for Applied Digital Corporation, with a market cap of $10.25 billion. The company stock, APLD, witnessed a slight reduction of around 3% to trade at $36.64. MARA Holdings is in the third position with a market cap of $7.51 billion. Its stock, MARA, has dropped significantly by 11.25% and currently trades at $20.27. Marketcap Heatmap.

The crypto market fails to recover Earlier in the week, the crypto market tried to recover from last Friday’s market crash, which caused the liquidation of over $19 billion. On October 10, Bitcoin was trading at $121,741. Traders were expecting a new all-time high, but the following day, the market crashed, and Bitcoin dropped to as low as $104,000 on some exchanges. The crypto market tried to recover during the week. Bitcoin reached a top of around $115,000, while Ethereum hovered around $4,200. However, the momentum failed. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,938, while ETH dropped to $3,870, based on real-time data from CoinGecko.

While BTC’s price movements are notorious for their sudden, dramatic swings, history shows that the 200 WMA technical indicator has stood out with remarkable consistency. How The 200 WMA Has Defined Every Bitcoin Cycle Luke Broyles, an observer of Bitcoin’s market cycles, has noted on X that BTC has been screaming buy all 5 times that it hit the 200 WMA. This track record leads many to ask if they should hold a lump sum on the sidelines until that hits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Wobbles — Is A Sharp Downside Move On The Horizon? Broyles acknowledges that while BTC has been trending down, that hasn’t been the worst idea in the world. Although it isn’t a magic bullet. As Broyles explains, 3 out of the 5 times it has hit the 200 WMA, it was there for mere days. The worst part is that when BTC trends upward, the 200 WMA rises with it, making the ideal entry a constantly moving target. However, Broyles provided a vivid example from recent history. In April 2023, BTC was $31,000, and the 200 WMA was $25,000. Before that, BTC was $16,000 months ago, and many thought a pullback into the $20,000 range was likely. Meanwhile, the analyst advocates for a buy at 31,000. During that time, 200 WMA was so close, and they cared more about bragging rights of I bought at the 200 WMA instead of simply accumulating BTC. By the time BTC briefly dipped below the line again, it was already at $28,000, and that was the last chance. Currently, the 200 WMA sits comfortably above $50,000, and if BTC’s uptrend continues, that line could climb to $70,000 or even $100,000 before price ever revisits it. Why Bitcoin Remains Bullish On Higher Timeframes An analyst known as Scient has emphasized that BTC is on the higher timeframes. The blue zone remains a must-hold area for bullish continuation, with price consolidating above $108,000 for nearly three months. This range could be setting up a clean flip of that level into support before a major expansion phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? Furthermore, all liquidity below the range lows (RLs) has been swept. The recent drop followed a higher high (HH) on the 3-day chart, and now BTC sits right at the RLs, an ideal zone where a higher low (HL) could confirm a continuation pattern. Scient pointed out that it’s the candle body that matters for divergence, the wicks don’t count. He’s watching closely for hidden bullish divergences to develop on the 3D timeframe, which would confirm the bullish setup. According to the analyst, this week looks relatively slow, but the next volatile move will likely come next week.

53250778,607523,1760659243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53250778.jpeg,Bitcoin SOPR Shows Market Nearing Post-Correction Levels,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sopr-shows-market-nearing-post-correction/,"Bitcoin is once again testing investor conviction as it fights to stay above the $110,000 level following last Friday’s sharp correction that triggered a massive leverage wipeout across the market. After one of the most volatile sessions of the quarter, traders are watching closely to see whether BTC can stabilize or if more downside pressure will emerge. According to on-chain data shared by Darkfost, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are continuing to exert significant pressure on the market. Their Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) — a key metric tracking realized profits — currently stands at 2.32, showing that this group is selling coins at an average gain of over 130%. Such elevated profitability levels often coincide with phases where long-term investors take profits after extended rallies, contributing to selling pressure and short-term weakness. Despite this, Bitcoin’s ability to defend its current range suggests underlying demand remains resilient. Long-Term Holders Still Taking Profits, But Signs of Exhaustion Emerge Analyst Darkfost points out that while the Long-Term Holders’ (LTH) SOPR currently sits at 2.32, the shorter-term averages are starting to soften. The weekly SOPR (7-day moving average) has fallen to 1.82, and the monthly SOPR (30-day) sits at 1.79, both trending downward since the summer. Although these figures remain below the annual average of 2.25, they indicate a gradual cooling of realized profits — a sign that selling pressure may be easing. This dynamic reflects a crucial transition point for Bitcoin’s market structure. As long-term holders continue to realize profits above 1.0, they’re selling coins at a gain, effectively capping momentum and weighing on price recovery. Yet, the current decline in SOPR averages hints that this wave of profit-taking may be nearing exhaustion. Historically, such drops in realized profit levels have preceded market stabilization and, eventually, recovery phases. Darkfost highlights that the current setup closely resembles the October 2024 correction, when Bitcoin’s SOPR bottomed near similar levels before the next major upswing. If history rhymes, the ongoing contraction in LTH profitability could signal that the worst of the correction is behind us. Still, further moderation in SOPR remains key for the market to fully reset and for sustainable upside momentum to re-emerge. Bulls Defend $110K Zone Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin continues to hover around $111,500, showing signs of stabilization after last Friday’s steep sell-off. The 8-hour chart highlights a fragile recovery structure, with BTC struggling to regain key moving averages and momentum fading below the $117,500 resistance, which remains a major supply zone. The 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) moving averages are beginning to converge — a sign of compression that typically precedes a strong directional move. For now, BTC is trading below all three, suggesting that sellers still dominate the mid-term trend. Holding above $110,000 is crucial; a decisive break below could open the door to retesting the $105,000–$106,000 range, where strong demand previously emerged. Reclaiming $114,000–$115,000 would be the first sign of strength, potentially triggering a push toward the $117,500 barrier. However, volume remains muted, implying that traders are cautious as the market digests recent volatility. Bitcoin’s price action points to a consolidation phase, with buyers and sellers in temporary equilibrium. If bulls can protect the $110K region and momentum rebuilds, BTC could attempt a gradual recovery, but failure to do so risks extending the correction further.

The asset, which experienced a sharp decline earlier this month, remains unable to regain the crucial $3.00 level despite a partial rebound. XRP dropped to the $1.50 range on October 10 during the broader market downturn but quickly stabilized above $2.00. Since then, however, it has struggled to build the momentum required to break through major resistance points. According to TraderJB, this behavior fits within a larger corrective structure that may now be nearing completion or could extend for several more months. Completion of the W–X–Y Correction In his latest technical assessment, the analyst described XRP’s recent trend as a ten-month corrective phase made up of three main waves labeled (W), (X), and (Y). Each of these phases lasted between three and four months and reflected alternating periods of decline, recovery, and consolidation. $XRP Beautiful 10-month flat-zigzag-zigzag combination formed. Two scenarios from here: 1. The correction is already done (or days from being done), forming a double-three. 2. Two more corrective waves are left, turning it into a triple-three. Given that the (W), (X), and (Y)… pic.twitter.com/JjerZp3LFi — TraderJB (@TraderJBx) October 15, 2025 Historical data aligns with this interpretation. The first wave (W) spanned from January to April, taking XRP from its January peak near $3.40 to around $1.80 by April. The subsequent (X) wave occurred between May and July, as the token rebounded to roughly $3.60. The final (Y) wave unfolded from August through October, characterized by sideways movement that culminated in the October market crash. That sudden selloff pushed XRP to $1.50, which TraderJB identifies as the completion point of the (4) wave within the larger cycle. He also noted that the drop cleared out a significant number of leveraged long positions, which could help set the stage for a potential recovery. Two Possible Directions for XRP From this point, the analyst envisions two main paths. The first possibility is that the correction phase has already ended, completing a “double-three” structure that would allow for a renewed upward trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The alternative scenario assumes that XRP still has two smaller corrective legs remaining, labeled (X) and (Z), which would form a “triple-three” pattern and delay any substantial recovery until mid-2026. Although both scenarios remain viable, TraderJB leans toward the first outcome, suggesting the market could soon shift in favor of buyers once short positions begin to unwind. Currently, XRP trades around $2.38 . A decisive move above $2.80 to $3.00 would indicate growing bullish strength and confirm the start of a new rally . Conversely, a drop below the recent $1.50 low would suggest that the corrective structure is not yet complete. While XRP’s recent performance has been marked by volatility and hesitation, the broader technical outlook suggests a decisive move could be approaching. For now, investors continue to monitor the $2.80 to $3.00 range as the critical zone that may determine XRP’s next major direction.

The announcement came during Oracle’s AI World conference in Las Vegas, where the company outlined how its AI-driven database business will expand sharply in the coming years. The database giant now expects its AI-powered data platform revenue to surge to $20 billion by fiscal 2030, up from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2025 and $3 billion in 2026. This rally, Oracle executives said, will be driven by surging demand for computing capacity and easier access to hardware supplies over the next few years. Speaking to analysts, Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle’s two new CEOs, explained , “You see the change in these numbers that it’s a little bit easier for us to find supply, not this year or next year, but in subsequent years. So as we’re able to find that supply, customers contract for it, we see immense demand, and then we go about delivering that to customers.” Oracle confirms Meta deal and $65 billion in new contracts During the same presentation, Clay revealed that in just 30 days of the current quarter, Oracle secured $65 billion in new cloud infrastructure commitments, spread across seven different contracts with four major customers. Clay stressed that none of those clients were OpenAI, addressing speculation that Oracle’s recent growth was overly dependent on the ChatGPT maker. “None of those customers are OpenAI,” he said. “I know some people are questioning sometimes, ‘Hey, is it just OpenAI?’ The reality is, we think OpenAI is a great customer, but we have many customers.” Among those customers is Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram. Reports from Bloomberg in September said the two companies had been negotiating a $20 billion cloud deal, which Clay confirmed is now in motion. This comes as Meta continues one of the tech industry’s largest AI spending sprees, with its capital expenditures for 2024 expected between $66 billion and $72 billion. The partnership gives Oracle a massive boost as it competes directly with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud for a slice of the AI infrastructure market. The company has been expanding its cloud infrastructure division, while also allowing its database software to run on other clouds, which has helped attract diverse clients. Back in July, Oracle even secured a $300 billion commitment from OpenAI, showing just how aggressively the company is scaling its footprint in high-end AI compute. Oracle sets bold targets for 2030 with focus on profit margins Despite its explosive growth, Oracle disclosed that AI infrastructure carries a gross margin of 30% to 40% after accounting for land, data center, power, and computing costs. Yet, according to a report from The Information, Oracle earned only 14% on renting out Nvidia AI chips in the August quarter, evidence that costs are still tight as AI hardware demand outpaces supply. Chief financial officer Doug Kehring pushed back against the idea that Oracle is chasing revenue at any cost. “I’ve read a lot of stories that are speculating that Oracle is chasing revenue for revenue’s sake,” Doug said, adding that:- “But let’s be crystal clear: we only pursue opportunities where we have a clear line of sight to attractive market margins that reward us for intellectual property and the activity we bring to customers.” After the market closed, Oracle announced new long-term targets; $21 in adjusted earnings per share on $225 billion in revenue for fiscal 2030, representing a 31% compound annual growth rate. That’s above the $18.92 EPS and $198.39 billion in revenue that analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting. Still, the stock slipped 2% in extended trading as investors digested the forecast and its ambitious timeline.

A growing row between China and the Netherlands over the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has put the continent’s car production at risk. Industry leaders have also warned that the row could bring assembly lines to a standstill across Europe if it is not resolved soon. The crisis was triggered after the Dutch government announced it would take over Nexperia, a semiconductor firm based in Nijmegen that China’s Wingtech Technology fully owns. The move, announced on October 12, was described as “exceptional” and aimed to safeguard national security and technological sovereignty. The Netherlands stated that it took the action out of concern that Nexperia’s technology could fall into its Chinese parent company’s hands and be modified without oversight. The action followed months of pressure from Washington, which had warned European allies about the security risks associated with Chinese ownership in key technology sectors. In court filings, which went largely unnoticed at the time, U.S. officials had privately pressured Dutch regulators to oust the Chinese leadership of Nexperia and tighten controls. That came on top of new American export control rules that expanded restrictions to subsidiaries 50% or more owned by sanctioned Chinese entities. Late last year, Wingtech was placed on the U.S. “entity list,” effectively severing its access to American chipmaking equipment and software. Beijing didn’t take long to retort. On October 4, before the Dutch announcement but as tensions were escalating, China’s Commerce Ministry issued an order preventing Nexperia China and its subcontractors from exporting certain finished products and sub-assemblies manufactured in China. In a statement, Nexperia said it was in discussions with officials in China regarding an exemption and was working with its European clients to mitigate the disruption. Carmakers scramble to contain fallout Once again, the European automotive industry finds itself at the center of a global trade and technology war . The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warned that if deliveries of the Nexperia chip were to cease, parts of Europe’s car production may shut down. Nexperia’s chips are critical to rudimentary automotive systems — everything from sensors and lighting to braking controls and battery management. Among its customers are Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Bosch. Last week, Nexperia informed several customers that it would no longer be able to guarantee delivery times. The announcement set off emergency reviews across the sector. Volkswagen, which does not yet count among companies suffering production delays, said it’s monitoring the situation closely. BMW said that some of its supplier network is already feeling the effects, and they are in active conversations with their partners to ensure stability. Bosch, one of Europe’s largest providers of auto parts, cautioned that even short-term disruptions could send shock waves through the supply chain. Stellantis, whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat, and Opel, stated that it is collaborating with Nexperia and other suppliers to assess the potential implications and develop contingency plans. Carmakers brace for a new chip shortage Europe’s carmakers are bracing for a recession. The industry is still recovering from the 2021–2023 semiconductor shortage, which resulted in tens of billions of dollars in losses and led to plants halting or suspending production. Analysts caution that this standoff could lead to similar chaos, but this time, it would be geopolitical rather than pandemic-induced. Xuezheng Zhang, the company’s chief executive, has even gone so far as to say that systems designed by Nexperia are responsible for 10 percent of the world’s electricity consumption — all by making transistors that can switch off rapidly but don’t turn on particularly well. Factories in Germany, France, and Italy would be most affected by this, as many of their suppliers rely on just-in-time delivery of chips from Nexperia. Europe’s chipmaking ecosystem is fragile already. Although efforts have been made to increase local production under the EU Chips Act, much of the packaging and assembly work continues to occur in Asia, particularly in China.

This deal will be the most significant private capital agreement ever recorded in history. Under this agreement, Meta and Blue Owl Capital Inc. will share ownership of the tech company’s Hyperion data center based in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The tech giant will retain only 20% of the shares for Meta, according to individuals knowledgeable about the situation. Financial institutions join forces with tech firm amid AI boom era Meta and Blue Owl Capital Inc.’s deal highlights growing interest in the AI ecosystem as tech companies join forces with financial institutions to make significant investments in the industry. Morgan Stanley plays a crucial role in this agreement. To illustrate, the bank arranged for approximately $27 billion in loans and around $2.5 billion in investments via a special purpose vehicle to finance the construction. This kind of arrangement is becoming more common for substantial initiatives. The bank began embracing this deal at the start of the year with a strategic approach to attracting several asset managers and infrastructure lenders who wanted to be part of it. After careful consideration, a reliable source suggested that Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl emerged as the winners. This funding approach is established to encourage tech firms with innovative ideas to develop massive data centers, allowing them to continue this initiative without negatively impacting their credit scores. As a result, data from sources has pointed out that many companies are taking significant debts to cover their escalating expenses. Additionally, it allows tech firms to maintain low debt levels and grants Wall Street investors an opportunity to make investments in physical assets considered safer. On the other hand, Meta opted for a completely different approach in this financing setup. The tech giant revealed that it is not taking on the debt directly, but the financing institution is doing so. Meta’s role in the deal is to act as the developer, operator, and tenant of the initiative. Notably, this project is scheduled for completion in 2029. In the meantime, tech companies in the US bond markets managed to raise about $157 billion by late September. This reflects a 70% increase compared to last year. When reports requested representatives from Meta, Morgan Stanley, Pimco, and Blue Owl to comment for more information on the topic of discussion, they declined to respond. Elon Musk’s xAI 20 billion fundraising marks a significant deal in the tech industry Recently, structured investments have gained more interest as insurers and other investors seek debt linked to tangible assets. An example of a company that has adopted this strategy is Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, in its recent $20 billion fundraising round. In this approach, the company leases chips rather than owning them outright. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the new round is more significant than initially expected. It is tied to xAI’s plan to utilize Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its largest data center, located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that approximately $7.5 billion is in equity, while as much as $12.5 billion is in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that purchases Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for five years, providing financiers a path to recover their investment without exposing themselves to company-level risk. On October 16, the parties involved in the funding round completed the last step. Under this deal, they intended to price the bonds in a 144A format with Pimco as the primary lender, according to people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because this information is private. The individuals also highlighted that a few other investors are set to receive some shares of the debt, which matures in 2049 and will be fully repaid over time. Another source stated that the bonds are likely to price at approximately 225 basis points over Treasuries. Morgan Stanley was the sole bookrunner on this deal, the sources said.

But though Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals remain solid, new Ethereum-built DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a top crypto to invest in this year. In phase 6 presale, the project is valued at $0.035 and already sold out more than 65%. Mutuum Finance has already generated $17.4 million in funds and gained over 17,200 investors. Its expanding network and utility-focused model have experts terming it the next big DeFi phenomenon on Ethereum, and possibly one of the standout performers in 2025 across the altcoin space. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Bounces Back Towards $4,500 as Bulls Maintain Momentum After temporarily dropping below the $3,800 mark, Ethereum (ETH) is showing a solid reversal signal, popping back above $4,150 and closing out the key bearish trend line at about $4,100. The action also took ETH through the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the $4,758 top and $3,423 low, which suggests newfound momentum to the upside within the marketplace. Primary upside targets in this situation lie at $4,250, then $4,320, and potentially a breakout to the $4,400–$4,500 region, levels which may bolster broader investor confidence. A reversal at $4,250 may, on the other hand, begin the short-term correction back into $4,120–$4,100 region with deeper support near $4,020 and $3,950. Although speculative traders remain focused upon Ethereum’s technical recovery, long-term investors also eye new projects within the burgeoning DeFi space such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which suggests capital again is going into innovation throughout the Ethereum network. Mutuum Finance Attracting Greater Presale Hype Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to trend in the DeFi sector and headlines in crypto news with strong interest building among investors. The sixth presale phase of the project is already 65% subscribed, which indicates strong market momentum.

53250781,607397,1760662801,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53250781.jpeg,World Bank Publishes Report Talking About Ripple And XRP – Here’s What It Says,https://bitcoinist.com/world-bank-on-ripple-and-xrp/,"The World Bank has published a report discussing Ripple’s Interledger and XRP . They indicated that the payment solutions involving XRP were promising, as they enable the exchange of currencies across different networks. World Bank Talks About Ripple And XRP Crypto influencer SMQKE shared a World Bank report on ‘Blockchain Interoperability’ that considered Ripple’s Interledger , noting how anyone can receive any currency of their choice using XRP. The bank described this as being “very promising” for the payment domain, as it enables the exchange of value across different payment networks. The bank further stated that the Interledger routes packets of value in the same way as the Internet routes packets of information. The World Bank report highlighted how the Interledger is addressing interoperability, as the team has developed several settlement rails for both crypto and non-crypto payments, with XRP a major part of this solution. Notably, Ripple also continues to adopt several payment standards, including the ISO 20022 standard , to ensure that its payment solution can be adopted for cross-border transactions. XRP is known to serve as the bridge currency, enabling users to transfer and receive any currency of their choice. The report highlighted the functions of nodes on the Interledger, in which XRP acts as the router , connecting the sender of USD and the receiver of another currency like Bitcoin. This also applies to non-crypto payments, as one can send USD and receive another currency with XRP serving as the router. Meanwhile, SMQKE had mentioned how the payment firm had previously collaborated with the World Bank to advance the modernization of global payment clearing and back-end infrastructure. Ripple’s partnerships with several banks are one of the reasons why members of the XRP community envisage that XRP could make headway in the global financial ecosystem. SMQKE recently shared documents that showed Ripple’s integration into the European financial system. The Firm Makes Headway In Africa Ripple announced that it has partnered with South Africa’s Absa to provide crypto custody services for the financial institution. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan indicated that this development may represent a major win for XRP. He noted that the collaboration between Ripple and the bank is not only about custody but seems to be connected to the broader demand for Ripple’s payment solutions in Africa. Morgan further remarked that with announcements such as that, there is more to know behind the announcement. Notably, the company earlier this year partnered with the African fintech giant Chipper Cash to integrate its payment technology into the platform.

The increase in online activity is an indication of increased retail participation, which is usually the beginning of a bullish sentiment across major altcoins. On-chain activity also reveals an increase in wallet activity, which means that both new and current holders are accumulating. With the resurgence of interest in altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is mentioned by analysts as one of the top projects to watch , due to its structured presale, verified audits, and potential of 500x returns, alongside ADA, SUI, and HYPE. Layer-1 Tokens, ADA, SUI and HYPE on The Spotlight Cardano has experienced social and search performance, and analysts have found sharp increases in retail queries after recent ecosystem developments. Santiment data indicated that ADA has achieved its highest social dominance since May and this could be an indication of a sentiment change with investors returning to long-term plays. The increased DeFi activity and numerous layer-2 integrations of the network have also helped to spark a new wave of optimism, as developers continue to expand the ecosystem of the Cardano project at a gradual rate. In the meantime, analysts reported that following a sharp decline, Cardano price has resumed testing the trendline support, which may act as a catalyst for the price target of $1. ADAUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X In the meantime, on-chain statistics of SUI indicate growing volumes of transactions and increasing rates of staking, indicating the formation of a solid base of long-term holders. Technical analysts observe that the SUI/USDT pair had a bullish reversal trend at the end of its multi-month support zone, which may have an upward momentum, should the market conditions improve. Even more so, HYPE also took the stage, with both search and social volumes increasing at a rapid pace. The recent performance of the coin and campaigns by communities have assisted in maintaining the interest of investors at a time when major cryptos are experiencing declining volatility. Analysts think that the concurrent upsurge of ADA, SUI, and HYPE can signify the beginning of an altcoin rotation phase. Among this trend, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming one of the more prominent contenders due to its verified smart contracts and rapidly expanding investor base, making it in the same conversation as these high-performing names. Market Sentiment Turns Cautiously Optimistic Despite the volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum, analysts say the altcoin market is showing early signs of recovery. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals that mid-cap altcoins have started outperforming major assets, driven by retail inflows and renewed speculative appetite. As global liquidity conditions improve and interest in decentralized applications rises, assets such as Cardano and SUI are regaining momentum. Technical setups also support the bullish reversal narrative. Cardano has reclaimed its 200-day moving average, which often signals the beginning of a medium-term uptrend. SUI crypto, on the other hand, has been trading within a tightening wedge pattern, a structure that historically precedes an expansion of volatility. Recent data showed that SUI volume rallied 69% in just 7 days, signaling an increased bullish trend for the top altcoin. Traders are watching for breakout confirmations that could trigger multi-week rallies across the broader market. SUIUSD 1-Week Chart | Source: X Amid this backdrop, speculative capital continues to flow into early-stage presales, where investors see higher risk-adjusted returns. One project capturing this momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an Ethereum-based presale token that has already raised over $16 million. With its ongoing audit by CertiK and previous verification by Hashex, the project stands out for its security qualities that have become critical for presale participants in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Big Presale Opportunity Analysts are comparing MAGACOIN FINANCE to a successful early-stage project that produced gains after launch. However, unlike traditional meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE integrates functional tokenomics with transaction-based burn mechanisms. This hybrid model gives the project real-world utility, a rare combination in the current market. The project’s capped supply and liquidity-lock mechanism create built-in scarcity, while its deflationary design ensures steady upward pressure once trading begins. Early projections estimate a 500× upside if listings on exchanges materialize after the presale. The final presale phase is scheduled for Q4 2025, followed by exchange listings by early 2026. Market strategists believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE success so far lies in its transparency and structure. Unlike many unverified presales, the project provides regular progress updates, community engagement through Telegram and X (Twitter), and open audit reporting. Its steady presale growth positions it as the best altcoin to buy among 2025’s emerging tokens, especially as investors diversify beyond layer-1 projects like Cardano and SUI. In recognition of continued momentum, the project is extending a 50% EXTRA bonus to investors—exclusive for a limited time with PATRIOT50X. Final Take The rising interest in Cardano, SUI, and HYPE signals growing confidence that the crypto market could be entering a new recovery phase. On-chain data and technical setups support the possibility of an altcoin rotation as investor sentiment improves. At the same time, structured presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining ground as investors look for early, high-upside opportunities in a cautious market. With its verified audits, presale momentum, and deflationary token model, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands among the top altcoins to buy alongside ADA, SUI, and HYPE.

The token plunged nearly 40% intraday before rebounding, now hovering between $2.20 and $2.60 as traders assess what’s next. Related Reading: Is The XRP Bottom In? Top Crypto Analyst Turns Ultra-Bullish Despite heavy whale selling and lingering volatility, market analysts insist that “this week could change everything” for XRP, with key ETF decisions and regulatory milestones approaching that could redefine its long-term outlook. XRP's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview Flash-Crash Fallout: Liquidations, Whale Flows, and Key Support XRP was swept up in the Oct. 10 crypto “flash crash,” sliding intraday by 40% before rebounding to a monthly loss near 20%. The trigger wasn’t a protocol flaw but a leverage washout tied to tariff headlines that jolted risk assets. Heavy forced deleveraging slammed both CEX and DEX liquidity, pulling most majors sharply lower in minutes. Since then, XRP has steadied in the $2.20–$2.60 band, with the 200-day EMA near $2.62 now a pivotal pivot. On-chain flows show mixed positioning as large holders sent sizable tranches to exchanges during the drop (a classic profit-taking/hedge tell), yet the torrent slowed after Oct. 11, helping price stabilize. Technically, bulls need a daily close back above $2.80–$3.00 to neutralize the short-term downtrend; lose $2.20, and the next magnet sits near $1.80. Notably, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin held its peg through the chaos, an institutional-friendly datapoint that underscores XRPL’s operational resilience under stress. Derivatives Heat Up as XRP ETF Window Nears Currently, futures open interest eased, but options activity surged triple-digits, signaling traders are bracing for larger moves. Long/short ratios remain skewed long on major venues, fertile ground for volatility if support cracks. That backdrop meets a dense ETF decision window (Oct. 18–25) for issuers including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares. Pundits point out that the SEC’s shortened 75-day review is a sign of an accelerated process, even as macro cross-currents (tariffs, growth jitters) complicate risk appetite. Legal clarity also looms large as courts have affirmed XRP isn’t a security on secondary markets, removing a structural overhang that kept many institutions sidelined last cycle. What Would Flip the Trend With the XRP price below the 20/50/100-day EMAs and the Supertrend still bearish, momentum remains fragile. Bulls need: Price confirmation: Reclaim $2.80–$3.00 with rising spot volume to target $3.50–$3.80. Flows confirmation: Net ETF inflows and calming options skew to validate dip-buying. Macro calm: Softer tariff rhetoric and benign data to reopen risk windows. These absent, a break below $2.20 risks a deeper corrective leg toward $1.80, with tail-risk bears eyeing $0.75 in a severe macro shock. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash Nonetheless, the institutional narrative is intact as RLUSD’s stability, CBDC/RWA conversations tied to XRPL, and a maturing compliance toolset all support longer-term adoption. That’s why some analysts insist “this week changes everything”, if regulatory catalysts align, XRP’s next leg higher could begin.

The proposed legislation, House Bill 183 (HB 183), would authorize the state’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to invest public funds in Bitcoin and other digital assets. If approved, HB 183 would allow the state CFO to allocate up to 10 percent of any funds in certain state-held accounts into digital assets. The Trust Fund of the Florida Retirement System, which the State Board of Administration administers, would be subject to similar guidelines and would allow up to 10 percent investment in accordance with those criteria. The Bill clarifies what constitutes a digital asset, such as Bitcoin or tokenized securities , but could also encompass non-fungible tokens. It also imposes tight controls on how those investments can be held and directed. Under the proposal, the money could either be held directly by a chief financial officer, placed in an account managed by a qualified custodian, or invested in SEC-registered exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Supporters of the Bill say it is an effort to keep Florida’s financial institutions on the cutting edge and allow for insurance against inflation and loss of confidence in traditional fiat money. The law describes Bitcoin as a store of value, or a potential long-term savings vehicle for public funds, much like the way governments have used gold. If passed, the new policy will take effect on July 1, 2026. The bill also promotes digital integration by permitting Floridians to pay some taxes and fees with digital assets. Those payments, in turn, would be automatically converted into U.S. dollars before being deposited into the state’s general fund, allowing government accounts to remain dollar-based while eliminating any rigidity that may hinder the use of cryptocurrency payments. States rush to build Bitcoin reserves as federal momentum grows The action by Florida also comes as several U.S. states are experimenting with how to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems . Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas all passed laws in early 2025 to hold Bitcoin as part of their states’ portfolios. Lawmakers in Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Missouri also introduced such proposals, with scores failing after legislative sessions concluded. Industry observers view Florida’s proposal as a reflection of a growing state-versus-federal race to determine the future of digital finance. If Florida’s bill passes, it could motivate other states to follow suit, particularly those with well-developed tech sectors or large cryptocurrency communities. The measure would also bolster Florida’s image as a blockchain-friendly state, following Governor Ron DeSantis’ previous efforts to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) while introducing regulations that are friendly to Bitcoin. Lawmakers weigh risks and readiness But despite mounting excitement, critics caution that the move could subject public dollars to volatility and potential legal wrangling. The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate by more than 10% in a week, and it could put taxpayers’ money at risk if states invest in the digital currency. Several financial watchdogs have also raised concerns about whether public dollars should be invested in an asset class that is largely unregulated and vulnerable to market manipulation. Defenders argue that Bitcoin’s long-term perspective is bullish and safe, and custody of the asset through SEC-regulated ETFs would provide sound risk management. They also contend that the small exposure, limited to 10%, will enable Florida to dip its toe in the water without risking its finances. HB 183 is waiting for assignment to a committee in the Florida House. It will undergo hearings and debate before being moved to the Senate. If approved by both chambers, the bill would be sent to the governor for signature. As the legislative process continues, Florida’s proposal will serve as a test case for whether digital assets can become a legitimate tool of public finance and whether U.S. states are prepared to manage Bitcoin like a sovereign wealth fund for the digital age.

Analysts see this pullback as a chance to spot the best crypto to buy now and rotate into stronger altcoins. While top names like Solana and Dogecoin remain under the spotlight, rising players such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining traction as fresh contenders for long-term growth. Solana Price Prediction 2025: Can It Rebound From Market Weakness? The Solana price prediction 2025 continues to be one of the most debated topics in the market. Recently, Solana lost its $200 support, dipping into the red zone and sparking concerns among traders. Institutional movements have been a big driver of sentiment. For example, Galaxy Digital transferred $51 million worth of SOL to Binance, fueling speculation about potential sell pressure. ETF excitement also plays a role in shaping sentiment. Bloomberg analysts forecast near certainty for a Solana ETF approval, which could mark a turning point for demand. On social platforms, technical experts remain confident. SOL price analysis Analyst Jelle noted that SOL broke an 18-month reaccumulation range and retested it successfully. This aligns with broader expectations that top altcoins to watch in 2025 include Solana, given its strong ecosystem and possible ETF boost. Some traders see the dip as a shakeout before a bigger run. Analyst Matt suggested $240 could still be realistic once Bitcoin stabilizes. These outlooks support the idea that Solana’s downturn may simply set up longer-term gains, making it one of the best altcoins amid market dip phases. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: Is $1+ Still Possible? The Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 remains ambitious despite the latest pullback below $0.20. DOGE charts show a gap between $0.19 and $0.07 that many analysts believe will close, adding further volatility. DOGE analysis by Ali Long-term forecasts, however, continue to point higher, with some analysts suggesting that DOGE could reach over $1.50 by Q1 2026 based on past cycle trends. Dogecoin has a history of sudden moves fueled by both retail enthusiasm and influencer backing. With technical patterns resembling earlier bull cycles, many view the token as one of the top cryptos for 2025 bull run potential.

The consistent performance of Bitcoin at above $110,000, Ethereum at above $3,900 and XRP below essential resistance indicates a building strength of the key assets. As analysts seek fresh rallies, investors are now looking at early-stage tokens that would outperform in Q4. Out of the 5 best altcoins to buy before the October reversal, MAGACOIN FINANCE can be highlighted due to its organised presale, whale involvement and analyst support. Bitcoin Price Catch-Up With Gold Bitcoin is not as strong as Gold in October, but analysts believe that Bitcoin is resilient due to its stability around $111,000. Quinn Thompson, CIO at Lekker Capital, told attendees at the Digital Asset Summit that Bitcoin’s move could soon catch up to Gold. Analysts from 21Shares share similar optimism. Matt Mena emphasized that structural demand, ETF inflows and the prospect of rate cuts continue to anchor the strength of Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Beige Book signaled labor softness, reinforcing expectations of policy easing, a condition that is historically bullish for digital assets. Consequently, Bitcoin remains among the best crypto to buy before the October rebound. Analysts project that a break above $115,000 could ignite a move toward $150,000 by year-end as global liquidity expands. Its steady base near $111,000 offers investors technical and psychological support amid macro uncertainty. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Ethereum Price Builds Toward Parabolic Rally Ethereum is still consolidating around $4,000, holding strong above its major support of $3,900. Crypto analyst Ali believes that this level is important to the next parabolic phase of Ethereum. According to his MVRV Extreme Deviation Bands model, ETH may soar to $5,000- $6,000 when support holds. This was echoed by analyst Mister Crypto, who had estimated a potential parabolic move as Ethereum follows past accumulation patterns that resulted in historic breakouts. In the meantime, 21Shares analyst AltcoinGordon observed that the structure had changed, though the plan had not, pointing to consistent bullish setups despite slight corrections. The future of Ethereum enhances the mood of the entire market and preconditions the rise of new assets. Of these, MAGACOIN FINANCE received significant attention from investors. Analysts believe it is currently among the best altcoins to buy before the October rebound , as whales and analysts position early for post-presale gain. XRP Price Consolidates Below Resistance XRP has reached a period of consolidation just below the resistance zone of $2.50-$2.60, following a strong recovery from $2.30. Technical charts show that there is a major bearish trendline around $2.50 and breaking this price would lead to a surge towards $2.75 or even $2.80. The Relative Strength Index is still intact and thus there is the opportunity to see a momentum swell when the buying power increases. According to market analysts, XRP is structured in a manner that is similar to pre-breakout conditions in prior cycles. The break of the resistance at $2.60 would signal a bullish reversal trend, which is consistent with the general crypto narrative of recoveries. Moreover, the capacity of the asset to sustain higher lows indicates investor confidence before the possible institutional inflows. Although XRP is still in consolidation, analysts are still indicating altcoins that have potential for short-term increases. Other projects with high growth potential in Q4 2025 include MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has an authentic presale structure and whale accumulation. Final Take The slowdown of the crypto market in October has a bigger story behind it. The strength of Bitcoin around $111,000, Ethereum around $3,900 and XRP coiling pattern are all signs of a fresh wave of momentum. With macro conditions improving and Fed policy relaxing, traders are shifting to early-stage opportunities with high ROI. Of the 5 best altcoins to buy before the October rebound , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out, with analyst coverage and whale involvement. Its organization, reputation and timing make it one of the best investment options for investors who expect the next crypto market boom.

Governing Council members say the situation is still too unpredictable for the bank to rush into fresh monetary easing. ECB leaders study tariff impact before making next move ECB Governing Council member Edward Scicluna stated that the central bank should take its time before adjusting interest rates, as the global economy is still grappling with the full impact of the new U.S. trade tariffs . He explained that inflation in Europe might increase if the tariffs raise the prices of imported goods. But at the same time, prices might also fall if the tariffs slow down global trade and reduce demand for goods and services. Scicluna said it would be a mistake to make any rash decisions because no one can tell for sure which way this will go. “It’s not so straightforward whether higher trade tariffs will be disinflationary or inflationary,” he said in an interview on Thursday. “The jury is still out, and we shouldn’t jump to conclusions as this is crucial.” Scicluna also advised people not to expect significant changes at the next meeting by the ECB on October 29–30 in Florence, Italy. He said the central bank will likely maintain its current rates because the economic situation hasn’t shown any significant improvements in recent weeks. The December meeting will be more important because, at least, the ECB will have a clearer picture of how the economy is performing by then. He added that anyone inside the ECB must present strong and convincing reasons for another rate cut. “For me, it would need convincing arguments to support another cut,” he said. “The onus is on those who want to cut further to convince the rest of us.” Policymakers see a stable outlook but fear political and trade risks The European Central Bank released its latest projections in September, which expect inflation to remain closer to 1.7% in 2025 and rise slightly to 1.9% in 2026. The bank also expects moderate but steady economic growth across the 20 countries that use the euro. These numbers show that inflation is slowly moving towards the central bank’s 2% target. Governing Council member Edward Scicluna stated that the most recent economic data indicate there is no urgent need for the ECB to adjust its interest rates or implement new measures at this time. Scicluna explained that it would take months for the effects to spread throughout the economy if the central bank were to change its interest rates at the next meeting. For this reason, he said the bank should not make any sudden changes that could offset the balance that currently exists. The United States recently increased tariffs on imported goods, and analysts said prices would rise because companies and consumers would have to pay more for imports. However, some economists now argue that the same tariffs could have the opposite effect, lowering inflation by slowing trade and demand. Scicluna said this is why the ECB must monitor the situation carefully and avoid reacting too soon. He also said global industries could face shortages and production would become more expensive if China goes through with its plan to limit the export of rare earth minerals. Head of Estonia’s central bank, Madis Müller, said the supply issues could “reignite price pressures” across Europe and make inflation harder to control if they spread through global markets. The head of Germany’s Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, said the current interest rate feels right for the economy because it’s not too low to cause overheating, and not too high to choke off growth. The central bank can utilize this “neutral rate” to observe how the economy performs without introducing new pressure. Scicluna concurred, but also cautioned that global geopolitics can change the economic environment more quickly than it can be predicted in financial models. He advised European leaders to concentrate on domestic reform, invest in innovation, and improve productivity — not “spend so much energy worrying about what is happening on the other side of the Atlantic.” Get seen where it counts.

The transaction reportedly happened quietly with the Fed acting as the Treasury’s fiscal agent, part of an emergency $20 billion swap-line under negotiation between Washington and Buenos Aires. Behind that line, the Treasury is scooping up pesos from and through major banks as it tries to slow the sell-off that’s gutted confidence in the local currency. Officials from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America are in talks with the Treasury for $20 billion in short-term loans to Argentina, backed by domestic assets. A report from Bloomberg said Citigroup has been off-loading pesos to the Fed repeatedly, not just this week but during earlier trading sessions. Banco Santander SA has been buying pesos onshore for the Treasury as part of the same effort. None of the banks, the Fed, or the Treasury commented publicly. Peso weakens as Bessent pushes rescue deeper The peso crashed to 1,424 per US dollar mid-session Thursday before a late recovery to about 1,410–1,400 when fresh dollars were offered locally. No one confirmed which institutions stepped in, but traders say the support came just as the panic peaked. The Treasury’s goal is to absorb dollar demand from households and investors rushing for safety ahead of the October 26 election. Many Argentines don’t believe any level of US funding will stop another brutal devaluation. Trump’s Scott insists the peso is “undervalued” and is already weighing a plan to double the package to $40 billion through private bank deals. President Donald Trump said that US support would vanish if Milei’s party loses the midterms, spooking investors who already watched the libertarian’s candidates wiped out in key provincial races. That message rattled markets that see Milei’s free-market plan as the only economic framework left. “Bessent’s announcements have diminishing marginal returns: each one lasts less and less,” said Ezequiel Asensio, portfolio manager at Valiant Asset Management, who added that: “The market doesn’t believe Bessent, not even with the cash he’s putting in.” Market disbelief grows as bailout strains system The Treasury hasn’t revealed the scale of its peso purchases, and traders say each operation sparks only a brief rally before sellers pile back in. Lucio Arrocha, strategist at StoneX, warned that “a devaluation is inevitable” and that a Milei defeat would only accelerate capital flight. “There’s not enough dollars in the country to face the capital flight that will take place,” he said. For Scott, the drama feels like déjà vu. Early in his career under George Soros, he was part of the 1992 bet that forced the U.K. to abandon defense of the pound, a trade that earned Soros about $1 billion. Now Scott is on the opposite side, trying to prevent a collapse instead of profiting from it. Javier Timerman, managing partner at AdCap Grupo Financiero, called the comparison a warning shot: “All Argentines, investors and analysts believe the exchange rate has to adjust and that there won’t be economic activity while rates and the exchange rate stay where they are.” Analysts say the peso still hasn’t dropped enough to match 12 percent inflation since April, leaving it overvalued even after the latest plunge. The official rate is now roughly where the black-market rate was before partial FX-control easing earlier this year. The US-led buying spree is drying up liquidity inside Argentina, driving loan costs above 100 percent and leaving the government rolling over less than half of its maturing peso debt. “This can’t go on much longer,” said Miguel Kiguel, a former Argentine finance secretary. “People still think the intervention lasts until the election, and after that no one knows how it continues.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News|Argentina|Citigroup|Federal Reserve|U.S Treasury,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-17 01:50:42

The gap is expected to prompt the Communist Party to push for higher domestic spending at its key conference next week. The slowdown stems from escalating US-China trade tensions , which have sharply reduced investment, industrial output, and retail sales, weighing on overall global sales growth. Sources say the National Bureau of Statistics’ data, due Monday, October 20, will likely show GDP grew 4.7% in the third quarter year-on-year, down from 5.2% in the previous quarter. Economists call for a shift towards promoting consumption to enhance China’s economy China’s economy has struggled in the last quarter, sparking endless debates among economic analysts. They anticipate that a discussion may be held among party officials concerning this situation at the upcoming fourth plenum in Beijing. This meeting will outline their adopted strategies for the country’s development between 2026 and 2030, as governments and investors call for a shift towards increasing domestic consumption. Examples of analysts who weighed in on the topic of discussion include Michelle Lam and Wei Yao from Societe Generale SA. They shared a report highlighting that several policymakers believe stimulating consumption is crucial to counterbalance the risks associated with US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies and declining returns on investment in traditional industries. The analysts believe embracing a consumption goal will demonstrate a stronger commitment to this policy. Meanwhile, after Trump was re-elected as president, high-ranking officials pledged to shift their focus toward promoting consumption by applying strategic approaches, such as increasing spending on education and job creation. Contrastingly, they have been too cautious in their moves and have not yet created a specific target. In China, household consumption accounts for approximately 40% of the country’s GDP. This percentage is less than the global average of 56%, according to data from the World Bank. Additionally, it lags behind the nearly 60% observed in wealthier countries. Regarding the situation, economists from Morgan Stanley, including Robin Xing, stated in a report last week that they anticipate the main focus for policies will be technological self-sufficiency, innovation, and national security. At the same time, there might be some support for gradual reforms to social welfare. China undergoes nine consecutive quarters of deflation Overall, China’s economy appears strong this year, growing near the government’s target of about 5%. This has resulted from the strong performance of industries such as high-tech manufacturing, with exports reaching new highs. Still, beneath the surface, economic vulnerabilities are mounting. Declining prices and intense competition are eroding company profits, while consumer demand is waning. The housing market, on the other hand, remains weak, and investment is plummeting. New data next week will likely confirm that China has experienced nine consecutive quarters of deflation, a streak of falling prices not seen since the market-based reforms began in the late 1970s. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:5bacff32-abaf-4591-a7eb-259f581c4786-65"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> In related news, the Group of Seven finance ministers agreed to present a united front and coordinate a short-term response to China’s export controls on rare earths. They also plan to diversify their supply chains, European Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis announced Thursday. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, Dombrovskis stated that China now dominates the global supply chains for rare earths, with 80-90% of them sourced from China. “It was clear that G7 partners have shared concerns about those new extensive Chinese export controls, expanding both the scope of minerals covered, but also in terms of covering the value chain and having quite extensive extraterritorial provisions,” Dombrovskis said. He noted that they agreed on one hand to coordinate this work and their engagements with Chinese counterparts to seek some short-term solutions. Still, he added that they needed to continue the work, which is not new, on diversifying and enhancing the resilience of our supply chains. Get seen where it counts.

The value of the seized Bitcoin—around $15 billion—marks the largest forfeiture action in the DOJ’s history, underscoring the scale of global crypto-related financial crimes and the US government’s growing role in tracking and recovering digital assets. The indictment against Chen Zhi was unsealed this week in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, revealing details of a complex international fraud operation that targeted thousands of victims worldwide through sophisticated investment scams. Prosecutors allege that Chen and his associates laundered billions in stolen funds through cryptocurrency exchanges and shell companies before the assets were traced and frozen. This latest seizure adds to the already significant Bitcoin reserves held by the US government from past enforcement actions, including those tied to the Silk Road, Bitfinex hack, and other major cases. In total, US holdings now exceed 316,000 BTC, valued at nearly $36 billion at current prices, making the government one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. US Government’s Bitcoin Holdings Grow After Historic Seizure CryptoQuant reports that the US government now controls 316,760 BTC, worth roughly $35.9 billion, following its latest seizure from Chen Zhi’s “pig butchering” scam. The 127,195 BTC confiscated in this case alone—currently valued at $13.2 billion—marks the largest single Bitcoin seizure ever conducted by the Department of Justice. At Bitcoin’s peak earlier this year, those same holdings were worth around $15.5 billion. This operation cements the US as one of the largest known Bitcoin holders, with its wallet comprising assets from several major law enforcement actions over the past decade. The most significant components include: Bitfinex Hack (2016) — Law enforcement recovered 106,910 BTC stolen from the crypto exchange after a multi-year investigation. The funds were linked to Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, who laundered billions before being arrested in 2022. Silk Road (2013) — The government confiscated 81,988 BTC from the dark web marketplace operated by Ross Ulbricht. This remains one of the earliest and most famous crypto seizures. Potapenko/Turogin (2022) — A smaller seizure of 667 BTC connected to Estonian nationals accused of running a $575 million crypto fraud through shell mining services. Together, these seizures highlight how the US has quietly become a major Bitcoin whale—a position gained not through investment, but through relentless enforcement and asset recovery in the digital age. Bitcoin Holds Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $111,142, showing signs of stabilization after last week’s flash crash that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The 12-hour chart reveals that BTC has found temporary support near the $110,000 zone, which has acted as a key demand area multiple times since mid-September. This range now serves as a battleground between cautious buyers and sellers capitalizing on market weakness. However, BTC remains below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, both currently converging around $114,000–$116,000, creating strong short-term resistance. The 200-day (red) moving average sits near $112,000, slightly above current levels, signaling that the broader trend is still fragile. A clean break above these levels could open the path toward $117,500, but failure to regain momentum may expose BTC to another test of $108,000–$110,000. Trading volumes remain elevated but slightly cooling compared to last Friday’s capitulation event, suggesting consolidation rather than panic. Overall, Bitcoin appears to be in a recovery phase, though the lack of directional conviction indicates that traders are waiting for stronger catalysts — whether from macro data, ETF flows, or on-chain signals — before taking decisive positions.

Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Have Done Some Net Distribution According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, Bitcoin’s key investor tier is starting to show signs of slight profit-taking. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply Distribution,” which measures the total amount of the supply that investors belonging to a particular wallet segment are currently holding. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Now Control 44% Of Realized Cap, Highest Ever Addresses or holders are divided into these groups based on the number of tokens present in their balance. The 1 to 10 coins cohort, for instance, includes all investors owning between 1 and 10 BTC. In the context of the current discussion, a broad range of 10 to 10,000 coins is of focus. It converts to $1.1 million at the lower end and $1.1 billion at the upper end. Given this scale, the range would naturally cover some of the key Bitcoin investor cohorts like the sharks and whales. Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the range over the last few months. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 coins group saw a drop of 17,554 BTC (about $1.9 billion) between October 12th and 14th. Before this decline, the metric had been in an uptrend since late August. The cryptocurrency’s recovery attempt has fizzled out since this selloff occurred, so it would appear possible that the profit-taking from the sharks and whales could, in part, be behind the bearish action. On a more long-term scale, though, this latest distribution spree from the key investors isn’t too significant, as their wallets have still grown since the start of 2025 by 318,610 BTC, worth a whopping $35.5 billion. A similar light profit-taking event took place in late August, following which the sharks and whales quickly corrected course and resumed accumulation. This buying then supported BTC’s bullish push. Wallet balance is just one way to classify holders. Another popular methodology in on-chain analysis is using holding time to separate investors between short-term holders (STHs) and long-term holders (LTHs). The cutoff between the two cohorts is 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? The STHs may be considered to represent the fickle-minded side of the market, while the LTHs are resolute diamond hands. These HODLers have been selling recently, however, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared in an X post. A net 265,715 BTC has exited the wallets of the Bitcoin LTHs over the past 30 days, which is the largest monthly outflow since early January.

This deep split in sentiment comes after a volatile start to what is support to be a bullish month, with Bitcoin struggling to find footing after a steep plunge triggered by escalating trade fears. The beloved ‘Uptober’ kicked off with strength as buyers rushed into Bitcoin while uncertainty loomed over a possible U.S. government shutdown. But last Friday out of anywhere, everything flipped. Prices fell hard (from $121,000 down to $104,000) after President Donald Trump last out at China’s Xi Jnping and vowed 100% tariffs on all Chinese goods. That single headline nuked the rally and sent crypto markets spiraling. Whale shorts $192M as Bitcoin crashes to $104K Bitcoin’s collapse came just as gold was breaking past $4,300 to hit fresh all-time highs. While the yellow metal surged more than 17% in the last month, Bitcoin has fallen 8%, unable to claw back Friday’s losses. Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, explained the shift in capital, saying: “Right now, capital is clearly favoring gold due to its momentum and reduced volatility profile.” He added that central banks are acting as structural buyers, giving gold a backstop that Bitcoin currently lacks. Sean still expects investors to rotate into Bitcoin eventually, but for now, the capital is riding gold’s momentum. On Thursday, Bitcoin was trading near $108,000, but the earlier collapse exposed deeper cracks. In a market note, Ed Yardeni, a longtime Wall Street strategist, broke down the chaos: “The crypto derivatives ecosystem exacerbated Bitcoin’s recent fall,” he wrote. “During the abrupt drop, liquidity dried up, with over $19 billion in liquidations across crypto futures and leveraged positions.” And the whales were watching. One wallet scooped up nearly $192 million by shorting Bitcoin before the crash. That same wallet made another bearish move late Sunday, adding even more weight on the downside. Analysts stick to $165K calls as gold passes $4,379 Bulls had reasons to be hopeful at the start of October. Over the past 12 years, Bitcoin has gone up in 10 of them during this month, based on Compass Point Research data. Plus, it had just hit a fresh high above $126,000. Alongside metals, it was part of the so-called “debasement trade”—a play against fiat currencies losing value. But that trade has now flipped, with gold stealing the spotlight. Despite all that, banks are still holding onto bullish forecasts. JPMorgan expects Bitcoin to reach $165,000 by year-end. Citi projects $133,000 in that same timeframe, and $181,000 by 2026. But on the charts, none of that optimism has shown up yet. Meanwhile, gold keeps making new all-time highs. The precious metal topped $4,379 yesterday before easing slightly back to $4,350. Year-to-date, gold is up up over 50%, which is more than double Bitcoin’s 20% return in 2025. This gap made Ed call gold the “new bitcoin,” claiming it’s the better safe haven and predicting that the precious metal will hit $5,000 in 2026, and even $10,000 before the decade ends. HSBC raised its gold forecasts, now predicting an average price of $3,355 in 2025, and $3,950 for 2026, pointing to strong buying from central banks and growing macro uncertainty. In any case, the market-moving influence of a worsening trade conflict between China and America makes it harder to declare the sell-off a turning point for crypto or a peak bitcoin moment. If the dispute over critical minerals restrictions leads to a massive escalation in tariffs come Nov. 1, investors — crypto and otherwise — are in for more pain. And bitcoin and its lesser altcoin peers don’t have the corporate earnings to cushion a deteriorating macroeconomic picture.

A team of analysts led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou claimed in a note released on Thursday that evidence suggests a significant deleveraging event is underway within perpetual futures, a favored tool among native cryptocurrency investors. Traditional market participants trading regulated products, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs or CME futures, didn’t panic as much. The data from JPMorgan depicts the resilience of investors in exchange-traded funds. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 220 million in outflows between October 10 and October 14, or 0.14% of their assets under management. Withdrawals from Ethereum ETFs were a little higher, at $370 million (1.23% of AUM). JPMorgan analysts said the figures suggested that ETF investors, typically retail and institutional players with longer-term horizons, did not engage in panic selling during the market downturn. Futures numbers proved that CME Bitcoin futures, a popular trading ground for institutional investors, experienced minimal liquidations during the week. Selling was a bit heavier in CME Ethereum futures, but this was due more to algorithmic and quantitative traders (not large funds) cutting risk in response to increased volatility, JPMorgan said. Those trends, the analysts said, underscore a critical shift in the market’s structure: Institutional and regulated investors are no longer driving violent price swings. Instead, that role has fallen back on “crypto-native” players operating in offshore and unregulated markets. Perpetual futures signal sharp deleveraging Although ETFs and CME futures were holding up, perpetual futures—an instrument that enables continual leveraged betting on cryptocurrency prices—tumbled significantly. Open interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures decreased by around 40% in dollar terms, exceeding the actual decline in the spot price, according to JPMorgan. That sharp drop implies that traders had been forced to unwind positions as prices fell, adding momentum to the selloff. The analysts said the trends suggested large-scale deleveraging by so-called crypto-native investors, many of whom trade on offshore platforms with high leverage. This crew, rather than ETF or CME traders, was the principal driver of the liquidation cascade, they added. The correction on Friday, October 11, resulted in the liquidation of more than $20 billion in long positions from over 1.5 million traders, according to Coinglass data. The selloff was the largest liquidation event in crypto’s history, surpassing even the May 2021 crash. Some of the catalyst was geopolitical news. Markets were in turmoil after President Donald Trump announced that he would impose 100% tariffs on Chinese tech imports, triggering a wave of selling across risk assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins all fell as traders sought to cover losses. By the following Monday, Bitcoin had briefly fallen below $106,000 before rebounding partially. It was trading near $108,500 on Friday, approximately 2.5% lower than its value over the previous 24 hours. Analysts reaffirm crypto fundamentals amid shaky sentiment Still, with the record-setting liquidation, JPMorgan said the damage is concentrated more on speculators than on longer-term investors. Institutional flows from an ETF lens are steady, and on-chain data show no major outflows from cold wallets or custodial platforms, where large long-term holders typically store their holdings. However, market sentiment remained fragile. The episode showed that leverage funding and momentum trading were still driving crypto markets, JPMorgan said, and that volatility was likely to remain high until more institutional engagement and oversight of offshore exchanges became common. Investors and analysts are now watching to see if Bitcoin can establish a foothold above $100,000, a key psychological level for many traders, and whether leveraged positions start to accumulate again in the weeks ahead.

The CNBC host warned that a wave of bad bank loans is now pushing Jerome Powell into a corner, one where cutting rates fast might be the only way to stop the bleeding. “Today got real ugly, but at least we finally have something that can make the Federal Reserve itchy to cut interest rates sooner rather than later: bank loans gone bad,” Jim said. “Nothing motivates the Fed to move faster than credit losses, because they’re a definitive sign that the economy is going south.” US stock markets sink as bank losses pile up Thursday’s market session was a bloodbath for the trading floor, led by a brutal selloff in bank stocks as earnings seasons kick off with beats across JPMorgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.7%, the S&P 500 plunged by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped by 0.5%, led by a brutal selloff in bank stocks, as shown by data from TradingView. The sell pressure came after investors panicked over the health of regional banks’ lending businesses, which are suddenly looking way shakier than anyone expected. The biggest shock came from two auto-related firms, Tricolor and First Brands, both of which filed for bankruptcy this week. Then came the dominoes. Zions Bancorporation reported a $50 million loss tied to two commercial loans on Wednesday night, and by Thursday, Western Alliance was claiming a borrower had committed fraud. So its been a week packed with red flags, and as Jim put it, “the banking system has provided us with enough questionable credits in one week’s time” to make Powell’s hand tremble over the rate-cut lever. Lower interest rates usually spark the economy back to life, but Jim reminded everyone that they also help borrowers avoid default, something the Fed can’t ignore right now. He’s convinced these credit cracks are the exact kind of pain that forces policymakers to act fast, no matter how loud the inflation hawks scream. The tone across Wall Street was fear and frustration. Investors are tired of watching the same credit risks reappear in new forms, especially in the private lending space. Those markets have been ballooning for years, and now that some of their loans are going sour, everyone’s realizing just how deep the rot might go. Jim also pointed to Jamie Dimon’s earlier warning that the bankruptcies in the auto sector were “like cockroaches – when you see one, there are probably more.” Dimon’s prediction aged fast. The sudden collapse of First Brands has already set off questions about how such a small auto-parts supplier managed to entangle billions of dollars across global banking and fund-management firms. Jim didn’t sound panicked, though. “Now, it’s possible there’s foul play involved in that multi-million problem of First Brands,” he said. Jim added that:- “Doesn’t matter, though: a bad loan is a bad loan is a bad loan, and that’s good for the stock market because these bad loans won’t hurt profits of anything other than the banks. The pain will be contained, I think.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy|USD,EN,0,0,FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-17 02:39:24

Machines that let people turn cash into crypto have grown fast, and regulators say the surge has put older and vulnerable users at particular risk. Regulators Tighten Rules Authorities have introduced a set of new controls aimed at cutting abuse. Based on reports, a cash cap of AUD5,000 per transaction is now in place for many ATMs. Operators are being told to strengthen identity checks, add clear scam warnings on the machines, and file more reports when activity looks suspicious. AUSTRAC has set up a task force to inspect providers and press compliance where it is missing. Scams Hit Older People Hard The harm is already real. Reports have disclosed that around 150,000 transactions flow through crypto ATMs each year, moving roughly AUD275 million in total. About 99% of those are cash deposits. In Tasmania, police say 15 people lost a combined AUD2.5 million in recent schemes and one person lost about AUD750,000; the average age of victims in that case was about 65. Many of the cases involve callers who pressure or trick victims into sending cash to a machine and then transferring the funds overseas. Enforcement And Gaps Police and AUSTRAC have been refusing renewals for noncompliant operators and running targeted investigations. Still, enforcement faces limits. The number of machines has ballooned — estimates put them at roughly 1,600–1,800+ across the country — and some providers were found not to be doing proper identity checks or transaction monitoring. That makes it hard to police every kiosk, and it leaves room for criminals to move quickly. Risks For Victims And The System Once cash is converted and moved on-chain, it is often hard to reverse. Funds can be mixed, sent through multiple wallets or routed abroad. That makes recovery difficult, especially when recipient addresses tie into overseas services that do not cooperate with Australian authorities. Regulators warn that while ATMs have legitimate uses — for people who prefer cash or lack access to online services — the machines’ anonymity and instant transfers create a high abuse risk.

Verified Audit and Analyst Reports Say It’s Legit,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/magacoin-finance-scam-or-real-verified-audit-and-analyst-reports-say-its-legit/,"With numerous new crypto projects emerging, investors are increasingly asking: Is this token genuine or just another short-term hype? People are now talking about MAGACOIN FINANCE – a fast-rising altcoin – which is an impressive project with substantial presale numbers and a buzzing community. MAGACOIN FINANCE does not appear like many early-stage tokens, which either vanish quickly or raise alarm bells. Backed by an audit that verifies its legitimacy, MAGACOIN FINANCE is supported by a firm conviction from analysts who follow new coins with potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming more and more recognized as a credible project. This article will explore why that is the case, what the audit shows and how MAGACOIN FINANCE is building trust in arguably the most difficult market in crypto history. What Is MAGACOIN FINANCE? MAGACOIN FINANCE is a community-driven digital asset project that has been growing steadily since the launch of its presale. The structure of this project is focused on transparency, accessibility and long-term community value. This formula appeals to new investors in an uncertain market. The project stands out for building an ecosystem reliant on verifiable credibility. The public audit of ongoing presale updates on its official website is cleverly designed to instil confidence in investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is neither a speculative meme coin nor an unaudited DeFi project. Instead, its transparency was intentional, to grow gradually. Verified Audit Confirms Transparency and Security One of the clearest signs that MAGACOIN FINANCE is a legitimate project is its independent audit verification. The project secured an audit from Hashex, a well-known and respected smart contract auditing firm that has previously audited many serious projects. The audit established that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract is safe, appropriately configurable, and free from vulnerabilities that could compromise user funds. This part is valuable for presale investors, as it demonstrates that the team implemented security measures earlier to ensure the proper safety of funds. Crypto audits are a crucial process for building trust in a cryptocurrency. MAGACOIN FINANCE has chosen to undergo auditing, setting it apart from many unverified presales that opt for transparency to save time. The analysts who looked over the report said that the contract had no significant problems and worked as investors expected. Growing Market Confidence and Analyst Endorsements Crypto analysts and community trackers have continued to cover MAGACOIN FINANCE for one key reason: consistency. Since the beginning of the presale, the business has provided public and verifiable data on its progress and fundraising. According to the most recent report, the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale has surpassed $16 million, attracting both retail and larger investors and diversifying from established assets like Ethereum and Solana. Analysts describe the project as a credible early-stage investment that reflects many of the features common in legitimate, long-term crypto ecosystems: Transparent communication through verified channels. Real-time tracking on its official presale dashboard. Active social communities that engage in meaningful discussions rather than hype. Moreover, experts suggest that the project’s measured marketing and audit-backed foundation position it among the few early-stage altcoins maintaining positive market sentiment amid volatile conditions. Community Growth and Ecosystem Engagement The MAGACOIN FINANCE community has become a significant strength of MAGACOIN FINANCE beyond audits and analyst opinions. The project is followed by thousands of users on several social media platforms, where most engagement concerns shared excitement, presale milestones, and long-term vision. The team has always encouraged transparency, responding to investor queries in public settings and updating users on presale status in real-time. Very few early-stage crypto projects allow customers to reach out to the CEO with queries, making MAGACOIN FINANCE’s accessibility rare. The reports from the community reveal that presale participants have found the process of purchasing easy and secure. This is possible due to the connection to the wallet built in the official website and its compatibility with multiple devices. How MAGACOIN FINANCE Builds Investor Trust Trust in crypto doesn’t come from hype — it comes from verified steps that show a project is committed to long-term value. MAGACOIN FINANCE builds that trust through a combination of factors: Verified Audit: The Hashex audit confirms the project’s code security and smart contract reliability. Official Website Transparency: The presale dashboard at MAGACOINFINANCE.com provides live fundraising data, real-time stage updates, and secure wallet connections. Community Accountability: Open communication through social platforms keeps users informed and engaged. No Hidden Promises: Unlike scams that rely on unrealistic projections, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on steady community growth and verifiable development milestones. These attributes together form a blueprint for credibility that separates legitimate crypto projects from those built purely for speculation. Why Analysts Consider It Legit When evaluating potential “scam or real” tokens, analysts often focus on three primary pillars: transparency, third-party verification, and execution. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks all three boxes. Transparency: All presale information, wallet details, and stage progress are publicly available. Verification: The Hashex audit acts as a third-party validation of its smart contract. Execution: The project has delivered consistent updates and achieved measurable progress toward its roadmap goals. Because of this structured approach, analysts are increasingly categorizing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a legit project , especially compared to the wave of unaudited presales that frequently collapse post-launch. What Makes MAGACOIN FINANCE Different from Typical Presales The crypto space is full of presale projects that promise an almost immediate return on investment, but few have the data and accountability behind the claims. MAGACOIN FINANCE is less focused on speculation but on sustainability. Its early fundraising success, combined with a clear commitment to investor safety and transparency, demonstrates a roadmap grounded in fundamentals, not hype. With good security, open communication and developer verification, the project is creating the conditions for its longevity while many other projects fail to survive their first cycle. Is MAGACOIN FINANCE a Scam? The Verdict Following an audit, community engagement and consistent presale milestones, there is no evidence proving MAGACOIN FINANCE is a scam. The project’s confirmed audit, visible presale activity, and growing analyst recognition all add to its legitimacy. All crypto investments come with risk. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE has the characteristics of a genuine, transparent, and secure project. As with any venture, due diligence is always critical, but all the signs so far indicate authenticity and not a scam. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project striving to earn trust, a rare commodity in the industry.

In addition to these established coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a low-cap presale worth considering, as it continues to gain momentum from investors and community-driven fundamentals. XRP Holds Institutional Ground Although there was a drop from $2.49 to $2.41 as the leverage got unwound and institutions sold, XRP held firm. Institutional investments via ETFs and long-term acquisitions support the asset’s bullish structure. XRP has the potential to recover towards $3.80 to $4.20 as long as the market volatility is reduced. XRP Price Chart: CoinMarketCap XRP’s strong catalyst is regulatory certainty. There are increasing filings for the ETF and continued inflows from institutional investors, which highlight Ripple’s emergence as a go-to option for institutions when it comes to cross-border payments globally. As a result, analysts still see XRP as one of the best-performing institutional-grade cryptos heading into 2025. Cardano (ADA) Maintains Technical Strength Cardano remains very steady and fundamentally very strong, currently trading at $0.80 – $0.87. Experts note that whales have recently increased their ADA holdings, while on-chain data indicates that staking participation continues to rise. The future governance, along with scaling changes under the Hydra plan, multiples the long-term potential of ADA. Many strategists belonging to the market are listing Cardano among the most undervalued large-cap cryptos that can outperform – if and when institutions start looking for cheap altcoins that have a viable ecosystem. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Market Resilience Avalanche (AVAX) is holding strong at around $22.81 amid recent fluctuations. There’s a strong institutional interest that continues with liquidity injection to its DeFi and gaming ecosystem. Avalanche’s features help developers create customised blockchains. This enhances scalability and adoption of this network. Market analysts expect AVAX to once again test the $30 level if the broader market sentiment improves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Low-Cap Presale Gaining Market Attention Apart from the established players, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting market attention as one of 2025’s best low-cap presale opportunities. The project has garnered significant interest from investors, with thousands worldwide having purchased more than $16 million worth of tokens. According to analysts, following the exchange listing, there is a possibility of 75x to 100x returns on investment due to Scarcity-Based Tokenomics and its verified smart contract, along with dual audit by Hashex. These validations strengthen the trust of investors, making it one of the top low cap presale launches this year Conclusion XRP, Cardano, and Avalanche have shown persistent resilience, supported by long-term investor confidence and institutional inflows, as well as technical strength. The booming ETF of XRP, along with developments on the ADA ecosystem and the growing use cases of AVAX in DeFi, affirm their potential as foundational assets for a diversified portfolio. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the leading low-cap presale for 2025 — a promising project combining verified security, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and rising investor engagement. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review.

Traders are watching closely to see if the bulls can defend this level and set the stage for a potential comeback. Solana Begins A Healthy Pullback After Recent Rally In a recent update, BitGuru highlighted that Solana (SOL) appears to be entering a healthy pullback phase following a sharp rally and partial recovery. This retracement is part of a natural market rhythm, allowing the asset to cool off after its recent burst of bullish momentum. Such pauses often serve as a foundation for more sustainable future growth, rather than signaling weakness. Related Reading: Historic Liquidation Event Highlights Solana Resilience Against Ethereum, Which Is Leading? While SOL’s price is hovering around the $203 mark, it is also facing strong resistance near $210. The market structure remains constructive, with buyers still active, though slightly cautious after the recent volatility. Should bulls manage to hold their ground and push through $210, BitGuru suggested that Solana could target the $225–$230 region in the short term. Conversely, if the price fails to clear resistance and loses support, a brief consolidation between $190 and $210 could follow. Short-Term Bearish Momentum Takes Hold Below Key Averages In a recent post, crypto analyst BeLaunch shared insights on Solana’s current price action, noting that the asset is showing signs of a short-term pullback following its strong rally. At the time of analysis, SOL’s price was trading around $199.45, marking a 1.84% gain, though still below its daily high of $208.91. The move reflects a mild cooling period after an upward surge. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher Again – Has It Finally Found Its Short-Term Bottom? From a technical perspective, the price of Solana has dipped below key moving averages, indicating a shift toward short-term bearish momentum. The asset is currently testing a key support zone near $195.53. However, BeLaunch observed that the recent decline came on lower trading volume, suggesting that selling pressure might be easing rather than intensifying. According to the analyst, Solana’s structure points to a phase of consolidation rather than a full reversal. The price action appears to be forming a base after its breakout run, giving the market room to breathe before its next move. BeLaunch concluded that a sustained hold above $195 could trigger a rebound, potentially setting the stage for Solana to retest higher resistance levels near $210 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below this level could lead to a deeper retracement. However, in the broader outlook, the current weakness may represent a healthy reset within a larger bullish structure rather than a bearish trend reversal.

The company is creating what it calls a digital-asset treasury, or DAT, which will be stacked with XRP. The money will come through a SPAC deal, and Ripple also plans to put in some of its own XRP tokens, according to a report by Bloomberg. This plan hasn’t been finalized yet.A few details, including Ripple’s full contribution and the structure of the fundraising, are still being discussed. But the end goal is clear: Ripple wants to bulk up its XRP reserves fast and on its own terms, while the industry is still struggling to recover. Ripple buys GTreasury, pushes ahead with SPAC while markets drop The fundraising comes just days after a market crash that triggered massive liquidations. The sell-off, which was worsened by the growing U.S.–China trade tensions, caused serious panic across altcoins. Even Bitcoin dropped more than 3% on Thursday, showing the market isn’t done bleeding. That hasn’t stopped Ripple from moving forward. If the plan works, this would be the largest XRP-focused treasury ever created. At the same time, Cryptopolitan reported on Thursday that Ripple is buying GTreasury for $1 billion. GTreasury is a company that builds tools for finance teams to manage crypto holdings like stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and other assets. Ripple said the deal will help it work more closely with corporate treasurers who want better crypto infrastructure. Still, investors don’t seem too excited about DATs lately. Shares of big crypto-holding firms like Strategy Inc., run by Michael Saylor, and Metaplanet in Japan have dropped sharply in recent months. Most people are backing off after watching Bitcoin and altcoins get hammered. That makes Ripple’s timing all the more unusual. But XRP has held up better than most. So far in 2025, the token has risen 13%, while Bitcoin is up 16%. Ripple already holds 4.74 billion XRP in its wallets, worth around $11 billion, based on recent prices. The company also has 35.9 billion XRP locked up in on-ledger escrows, which release on a monthly basis. Crypto treasuries slow down as Ripple builds its own stash This year, more than 300 public companies are holding Bitcoin through crypto treasury vehicles, many of which were created using SPACs or reverse mergers. But the buying is slowing fast. In August, firms bought just 14,800 Bitcoin, down from 66,000 in June. The average purchase size dropped to 343 Bitcoin, a huge fall from earlier highs. Back in March, Bitcoin accumulation was growing at 163%, but by August, that number was just 8%. So far, XRP hasn’t seen that kind of institutional action. Few companies have taken major stakes in the token. One rare case is VivoPower International Plc, a clean-energy firm that raised $121 million in May to move into XRP. Most treasuries remain focused on Bitcoin. While Ripple prepares its SPAC-driven fundraising push, others in the space are trying new strategies. Some crypto lenders and derivatives firms have been building out creative financing tools like Bitcoin-backed loans, convertible token deals, and structured crypto payouts. These setups offer more speed and freedom than banks can, but they’re also risky. In fact, some of these strategies have become dangerous games. Traders are now betting on short-term yields, giving up long-term upside just to stay afloat. It’s turned into a tightrope walk for some treasury managers; they’re stacking volatile assets on top of even riskier structures, with barely any room for error.

The first major resistance is near the $4,070 level and the trend line. A clear move above the $4,070 resistance might send the price toward the $4,120 resistance. An upside break above the $4,120 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,220 resistance zone or even $4,250 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,020 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,880 level. The first major support sits near the $3,820 zone. A clear move below the $3,820 support might push the price toward the $3,740 support.

G20 Watchdog Warns of Global Crypto Regulation Gaps The G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB) has warned that major gaps remain in how countries regulate cryptocurrencies, despite the market’s value doubling to $4 trillion over the past year. The FSB noted that stablecoins, now worth about $290 billion, are only fully regulated in a few jurisdictions. FSB Secretary General John Schindler emphasized the need for global cooperation, citing the ease of cross-border crypto transfers and the growing link between digital assets and traditional finance. While risks are limited for now, the FSB cautioned they could rise as adoption deepens. G20 risk watchdog warns of ‘significant gaps’ in global crypto rules https://t.co/aACigdhMyB — The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) October 16, 2025 Bitcoin traded near $108,690, largely unaffected by the report. Analysts viewed the FSB’s call for unified oversight as a positive step toward establishing clearer global standards for cryptocurrency regulation. Babylon Labs Unveils Trustless Bitcoin DeFi on Ethereum Babylon Labs has introduced a new system that allows users to borrow on Ethereum using native Bitcoin as collateral, without relying on centralized bridges or intermediaries. The mechanism, powered by BitVM3 technology, secures BTC in cryptographically verified vaults. We've completed the first Trustless Vaults experiment. We successfully borrowed USDC against native BTC on Ethereum Mainnet with @MorphoLabs . BTC is the largest capital pool in crypto and has been cut off from DeFi. We solved this.

While the system is largely trustless, analysts note that its liquidation process still depends partly on authorized liquidators and trusted oracles. The launch reflects growing efforts to integrate Bitcoin into decentralized finance. Analysts say expanding Bitcoin’s role beyond payments and storage could strengthen long-term demand, as BTC held steady near $108,690. Zeta Network Raises $230M with BTC-Backed Private Sale Zeta Network, a Nasdaq-listed company, has raised $230.8 million through a private share sale, accepting both Bitcoin (BTC) and SolvBTC, a wrapped BTC token from Solv Protocol. The firm issued new shares and warrants while adding Bitcoin-based assets to its treasury, reinforcing confidence in BTC’s long-term value and scarcity. Solv Protocol CEO Ryan Chow said more public companies are finding innovative ways to hold Bitcoin, aligning with the growing demand for BTC yield products such as Coinbase’s Bitcoin yield fund and BlackRock’s proposed Bitcoin income ETF. Zeta’s Bitcoin-backed fundraising boosted market sentiment, with BTC trading near $108,700 as investors viewed the move as another sign of accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Descending Channel Hints at Drop Toward $103,500 Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remains range-bound below $110,000, facing difficulty regaining upward traction after multiple failed attempts above $109,600. The chart outlines a potential triple-bottom formation, but persistent rejection near $110,500 and a descending triangle breakout highlight weakening buyer momentum. A bearish crossover between the 20- and 50-period EMAs adds pressure, signaling continued downside risk. The RSI near 42 stays below its midpoint, indicating a lack of buying strength. Price action shows lower highs and no clear bullish engulfing candle to confirm a reversal. If BTC fails to break above $110,500, a move toward $107,300 appears likely, followed by deeper supports at $105,200 and $103,500 key levels where buyers have historically stepped in. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin continues to trade below a descending triangle pattern, with TradingView projections suggesting a possible retest. A decisive close above $112,700 would invalidate the bearish bias, opening a path toward $114,600 and $117,600. Traders may look for short setups below $109,500, targeting $107,300, while long positions are better placed above $112,700. Despite near-term weakness, analysts expect Bitcoin’s broader uptrend to hold, with a potential Q4 rebound once consolidation resolves. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.7 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013115 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

XRP remains among the top in PayFi (payment-focused finance), but new players like Remittix (RTX) are beginning to make some noise with fresh tech and useful payment options. Since investors are looking beyond hype to real-world use cases of a project, the competition for control of global crypto payments is becoming tangible, and Remittix’s rapid progress is difficult to ignore. XRP Price Movement and Market Position As of writing, XRP currently trades for $2.45, down 1.44% for the day. Market cap is $147.04 billion, and volume 24 hours is around $5.83 billion, down 3.06%. Ripple still dominates the institutional payment networks and retains partnerships across the banking sector but has growing competition in the PayFi space on the horizon. Many traders still view Ripple as a leader among payment-focused cryptos. However, newer DeFi projects with integrated crypto-to-fiat solutions, such as Remittix (RTX), are demonstrating that faster, more accessible on-chain payments could reshape how the next generation of global transfers operate. Why Remittix Is Drawing PayFi Attention Remittix (RTX) is one of the best crypto presales of 2025, already raising over $27.5 million and selling more than 678.8 million tokens at $0.1166 each . The project offers an advanced crypto-to-fiat bridge that enables users to send assets like BTC, ETH, and XRP directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. It positions itself as a cross-chain DeFi project targeting the $19 trillion payments industry. Remittix has reached multiple key milestones, including verified listings with BitMart and LBank coming soon, and a CertiK verification that ranked it #1 globally for pre-launch tokens. The Remittix wallet is already in beta testing, showing real product progress before token launch, a major contrast to many speculative projects.

The “Bitcoin for Signal” campaign suggests integrating the crypto through the Cashu protocol and its “Chaumian Ecash.” BTC developer Cashu shared the movement on X, and Dorsey reposted, saying, “@signalapp should use Bitcoin.” Bitcoin supporters push Signal to use BTC for private payments Many people already use Signal every day because it protects their conversations from being spied on and their data from being collected . Now, the campaign also aims to enable these users to send and receive money privately and securely. Supporters say people will be able to send money to each other instantly across the globe, without banks, middlemen, or extra apps, if the messaging app adds Bitcoin payments through the Cashu protocol. The message on the Bitcoin for Signal website says, “Bitcoin belongs in Signal. Cashu ecash enables truly private BTC payments inside the world’s most trusted encryption messenger.” People argue that the leading digital asset could also help the service become financially independent, as it currently relies on donations and external funding. With BTC payments, users can directly send small donations or “tips” inside the app to help Signal stay free and open. Co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, drew more attention to the campaign when he reposted Cashu’s message to his millions of followers and commented, “@signalapp should use Bitcoin.” Other popular figures, like Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, co-founder of Satoshi Labs, Pavol Rusnak, and the anonymous developer behind Cashu, Calle, have also expressed their support for the campaign. Peter Todd even criticized the app’s current payment option, MobileCoin (MOB), and said, “I’ve been wanting to try MobileCoin. But it’s such a failure I can’t even buy any. Signal App needs to accept reality and just add Bitcoin support.” The encrypted messaging service tested MobileCoin in April 2021 to see if people could send money privately through the app, but users and experts found problems with the system over time. MobileCoin is not as decentralized as BTC or other cryptocurrencies because it relies on a small group of computers, known as validators, to process transactions. Critics also argue that MobileCoin is difficult to purchase or use in most countries because it isn’t available on many exchanges. For this reason, most people believe it won’t grow or reach the large global audience that Signal already has, so they believe that replacing or adding BTC would address these problems. The app has approximately 70 million active users each month. According to analysts, it will instantly become one of the largest platforms for private, peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions if even a small portion of its users start sending the crypto through the app. Critics warn Bitcoin may weaken Signal’s privacy goals Some privacy experts, digital rights groups, and blockchain engineers say adding the crypto could actually weaken Signal’s strong reputation for privacy and security . According to them, BTC’s public blockchain could expose information that conflicts with the app’s main goal of keeping users completely anonymous. An engineer at Aztec Network, José Pedro Sousa, responded to Jack Dorsey’s post with a sharp question: “Jack, why use a fully public blockchain for a privacy chat? The digital rights group Techlore also warned that combining BTC payments with Signal could unintentionally create new privacy risks that the app was never designed to handle. They suggested that the messaging service consider using digital currencies like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), as they already have built-in privacy features. Other privacy-focused developers noted that anyone can analyze Bitcoin’s blockchain. However, privacy coins utilize advanced cryptographic techniques, such as “zero-knowledge proofs,” to conceal transaction details while still verifying that payments are valid. They say this technology would better align with Signal’s mission than relying on Bitcoin’s open and transparent system. Those who support the Cashu protocol defended their design, stating that it utilizes a system of BTC-backed “ecash” tokens to hold and send Bitcoin without their transactions appearing on the public blockchain. They added that people will be able to make payments privately inside Signal without their crypto addresses being exposed. However, many experts say Cashu and other ecash systems are still new and have not yet been tested on a large scale. Privacy researchers also warn that it takes years to build, test, and prove the safety of such systems. Signal might face bugs, scalability issues, or weaknesses that attackers could exploit if it rushes to integrate BTC through Cashu.

UPXI's value is heavily tied to its 2 million SOL holdings and staking yields, but dilution risk from 48 million registered shares limits upside. Legacy consumer product business continues to decline, raising concerns that future operations may require selling SOL or using staking rewards for expenses. I cautiously upgrade UPXI to 'hold,' as a potential mNAV re-rating could occur if SOL surges, but dilution and operational risks remain. Back in May, I initiated coverage of Upexi, Inc ( UPXI ) and called the stock a 'sell' due to its inflated valuation relative to the combo of its legacy business and its Solana ( SOL-USD ) themed DAT strategy. Since that 'sell' call, UPXI shares have fallen by as much as 70%. Currently, UPXI shares are just 40% off that mid-May sell call: Data by YCharts Given the fact that SOL is actually up 5% over that same stretch, I think it would be fair to call UPXI's performance as a SOL-proxy considerably poor over these last 5 months. As I said at the end of that May piece, good assets can be purchased at a bad price. And even though Upexi paid a great price for its SOL earlier this year, $10 for UPXI in May was a bad deal. At a price currently under $6, prospects look a lot better. Solana Strategy and mNAV Just as (Micro)Strategy ( MSTR ) had been able to do for the last several years, Upexi quickly scaled up its Solana holdings through various financial instruments like common stock and convertible note issuance. According to data tracked by Blockworks Research, Solana DATs hold roughly 15.8 million SOL combined. Solana DAT Supply (Blockworks) Of that combined SOL position through DAT companies, Upexi holds a little over 2 million SOL and is the fourth largest Solana-themed DAT in the market. The table below breaks down the value of Upexi's Solana relative to its current market capitalization and its post-share registration diluted market capitalization: mNAV Calculation Prior To Offering Offering Completion Shares 58,888,756 94,457,980 UPXI Price $5.61 $5.61 Solana 2,018,419 2,018,419 Solana Price $185 $185 Solana Value Per Share $6.34 $3.95 mNAV 0.88 1.42 Source: Upexi, Analyst's Calculation, $185 SOL price at article submission Utilizing a basic calculation alone, UPXI arguably looks cheap relative to its SOL holdings based on a $5.61 closing price and a $185 SOL price on October 16th. Things get a bit more murky due to the recent offering registration that could see as many as 48 million shares sold from buyers of Upexi's PIPE and convertible note. The problem for UPXI shareholders is the proceeds from the offered shares go to the selling stockholders rather than the company. Thus, this would be expansion of the float that wouldn't lead to SOL purchases for UPXI shareholders. Not included in that offering is roughly 5 million in additional shares through options, warrants, and other instruments: Excluded From Share Count UPXI Shares Options ($3.39 ex) 621,353 Warrants ($4.20 ex) 1,848,735 Debt Converts 186,667 Preferred Converts 138,889 RSU from Incentive Plan 2,250,000 Total 5,045,644 Source: Upexi Given those shares, we can calculate a fully diluted mNAV for UPXI at closer to 1.5. The justification for a fully diluted mNAV premium this large is debatable, in my view. The company has the ability to raise capital through its $500 million equity line. Raising capital in this way makes sense in a world where mNAV premium is extended. But I suspect as long as the stock trades at a discount to basic mNAV, diluting existing shareholders through that $500 million equity line is less likely. Especially considering such a large cohort of shareholders have registered their shares for sale, including CEO Allan Marshall - though he would retain the majority of his equity. As I see it, Upexi's immediate path to acquiring more SOL is likely limited to its staking strategy. Solana Staking Yield vs Staked SOL (StakingRewards) In Upexi's last earnings report, the company noted an 8% annualized yield from staking SOL. This yield has come down quite a bit since the end of Upexi's last reported quarter. Investors can think of the relation between staked assets and staking yields similarly to the way they would bonds or dividends; the more demand there is for yield, the lower the yield goes. Upexi's Staked SOL 2,018,419 Annual Yield as of 10/16 6.5% Annualized Return at $185 $24,271,488 Source: Analyst's calculations The good news is even at the current annualized SOL staking yield of 6.5%, 2 million staked SOL at a value of $185 per coin generates over $24 million in staking rewards. This would actually flip Upexi to a profitable company, all else being equal. Legacy Business It's important to remember that even though the company's equity valuation is now largely tied to the daily performance of Solana, Upexi continues to operate its legacy consumer product business. Even with roughly $1 million in digital asset revenue during the year ended June, Upexi still saw top line revenue decline year over year by 43% and lost $13.7 million during the fiscal year: 10-k (Upexi) $9.8 million of Upexi's $11.2 million decline in revenue year over year was due to its divesting of its re-commerce business. Still, this implies that even adjusting for the re-commerce portion, Upexi's owned-brand consumer product business looks to have contributed roughly $1.4 million to that year over year revenue decline. The point is, if Upexi continues to operate its consumer business, it could come at the expense of SOL holdings in the future either through liquidated staking rewards or capital raised through equity offerings going toward opex. Closing Thoughts As I see it, the potential headwind of 48 million shares coming into the float without leading to direct SOL purchases limits the upside of the stock. At a basic mNAV discount, Upexi theoretically has an incentive to sell Solana and buy back common shares if doing so could generate greater returns than the staking yield from the SOL. But I largely view such a strategy as unlikely. My expectation is UPXI will perform in correlation with SOL for the foreseeable future, but may continue to lag the underlying in the event large quantities of the registered shares are sold. I'll cautiously upgrade UPXI to a 'hold' due to the possibility that basic mNAV could re-rate from a discount to a premium in the event SOL surges in price. But I still don't personally have any interest in buying shares of UPXI at this point in time.",SOL-USD|UPXI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-17 03:41:00

Analysts now suggest that the contrast could mean that while markets are expanding rapidly, mainstream participation may still be in its infancy. Social Media Debates Whether the Bull Market Has Truly Begun Debate erupted on X after the official account of the crypto polling platform Kalshi noted that searches for “buy Bitcoin” have not matched the 2017 or 2021 highs, asking, “Has the bull market even started?” Indeed, data from Google Trends shows that interest in the search term in the U.S. is currently at a low level of 11, based on incomplete data for October 2025. This is nothing compared to the record high of 100 set in December 2017 or the reading of 45 during the bull run in February 2021. However, Google’s FAQ makes it clear that the data is based on a sample of searches and does not include low-volume terms. This means that it may not accurately reflect real-time interest, especially considering the shift in how users now search. Nonetheless, The Kobeissi Letter, a financial commentary account, still pointed out the paradox : “The market cap of crypto just exceeded a record $4 trillion. Yet, 75% of investors have zero exposure to crypto right now. We are still early.” Their post met a little pushback, with some people saying that search data might not be the best way to measure true adoption. One user mentioned that even 0.05% of ChatGPT’s estimated 2.5 billion daily prompts about crypto could equal 1.25 million Bitcoin-related queries, which traditional metrics might miss. BTC advocate “BitcoinVoter” added that a lot of people now know how to buy the OG cryptocurrency without needing Google. Meanwhile, market tracker “StockStormX” called search volume a “lagging indicator,” suggesting it often peaks when retail euphoria is at its highest. Bitcoin Outlook Looking at the market, CoinGecko data shows BTC trading at $111,053 at the time of this writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours and nearly 9% lower over the past seven days. This drop was triggered by a historic liquidation event on October 10, which saw over $19 billion in positions wiped out as Bitcoin fell from above $126,000 to around $101,000. The leading cryptocurrency remains about 12% below its all-time high set earlier this month, but despite the shakeout, the asset has demonstrated some resilience, maintaining a trading channel above $108,000 since mid-July. At the same time, the broader crypto market has rebounded to a total capitalization of $3.87 trillion, with BTC dominance steady at 57.3%.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the funds will be raised through a special purpose acquisition company structure, with Ripple contributing part of its own XRP. The treasury would become one of the largest corporate vehicles focused on XRP accumulation. Digital asset treasuries, or DATs, have become a growing trend among public companies seeking to diversify corporate reserves into cryptocurrencies. Over 200 of these entities now collectively hold more than $464b in digital assets, signaling a broad institutional shift toward crypto as an alternative balance-sheet asset. According to Bloomberg, Ripple Labs is leading a fundraising initiative of at least $1 billion, aiming to establish a new digital asset treasury to accumulate XRP. The funds will be raised through a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), and Ripple will also contribute a… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 17, 2025 Ripple’s $1B Bet Signals a Shift From Survival to Strategy in the Post-Selloff Era Ripple’s initiative comes despite fragile market conditions following a wave of liquidations that wiped out some $19b in leveraged positions . Its decision to press forward suggests confidence in XRP’s long-term utility across payments and liquidity solutions. Separately, Ripple agreed to acquire treasury management software provider GTreasury for $1b. The deal, announced Thursday, will give Ripple access to tools used by large corporates to manage tokenized deposits and stablecoins. The acquisition also strengthens Ripple’s relationships with finance chiefs looking to integrate digital assets into treasury operations, bridging traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Ripple Eyes Institutional Adoption, Positioning XRP Beside Bitcoin in Corporate Treasuries In July, Ripple held about 4.74b XRP in its wallets, valued near $11b at current prices. Another 35.9b coins remain locked in on-ledger escrow, set to release gradually each month. If successful, Ripple’s DAT would mark a milestone for XRP. While Bitcoin dominates corporate treasuries, XRP has yet to see similar institutional accumulation. Ripple’s move could reshape that narrative. Japan’s SBI Holdings is one of the few major institutions to use XRP within its internal treasury operations, leveraging it for cross-border liquidity. Other companies have followed suit with smaller funds, but none rival the scale Ripple now envisions. Its initiative could make XRP one of the first altcoins to achieve meaningful corporate treasury adoption. Bold Treasury Bid Challenges the Notion That Crypto Reserves Are Losing Steam The effort comes as investors debate the sustainability of digital-asset treasuries. Shares in crypto-heavy firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet have slipped amid volatility. Yet Ripple’s expansion signals that some players remain undeterred by short-term swings. If executed, the plan could cement Ripple as the largest institutional holder of XRP and potentially reshape how digital assets function as strategic reserves for corporations worldwide.

The purchases will begin “soon,” with future acquisitions depending on how the crypto market behaves. That announcement instantly sent Newsmax shares up 4.1% in after-hours trading, landing at $11.27. The decision makes Newsmax the first New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)-listed company to officially hold Trump Coin in its balance sheet. Chief Executive Christopher Ruddy explained that Trump Coin’s value “should track the success of the Trump presidency, which so far has been impressive.” Ruddy said the initiative aims to diversify corporate holdings and align with the growing crypto adoption taking place across U.S. institutions. Trump expands his wealth through massive crypto gains Last year, Donald Trump told a court he was nearly out of money. He warned that unless a $500 million civil penalty was reduced to around $100 million, he would have to liquidate his real estate empire to stay afloat. But in less than a year, everything has flipped. Trump is now both President of the United States and one of the wealthiest officeholders in modern history, his businesses booming both at home and abroad. While past presidents often gave up income for public service, Trump has used his position to generate extraordinary profits through business ventures. He has made tens of millions from selling branded bibles, sneakers, autographed guitars, and even cologne. Several social media and news outlets have also paid him hefty legal settlements, cases that most legal experts dismissed as weak. Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, has reportedly signed a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, surpassing the going rate for similar projects in the streaming industry. The real story, though, lies in Trump’s growing crypto empire. According to a Financial Times investigation, the Trump family has made over $1 billion in pre-tax profits during the past year, largely fueled by the crypto rally that has defined his new term. And the $1 billiob doesn’t even include his unrealized gains, which have boosted his net worth on paper by billions more. His stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social and a Bitcoin treasury business, is now worth roughly $1.9 billion. When asked by the Financial Times if those estimates were accurate, Eric Trump allegedly said the family’s total was “probably more,” hinting that the full scale of their crypto operations remains unknown. The Trump ecosystem spans memecoins, NFTs, stablecoins, tokens, and even a DeFi platform, all wrapped in the family’s branding. Crypto-friendly policies reshape Washington Inside Washington, Trump has kept his campaign promise to become the “first crypto president.” He has ordered the formation of a national Bitcoin reserve, and installed crypto-supportive regulators across federal agencies. Under Trump’s new SEC chairman Paul Atkins, many investigations into major crypto companies like Kraken, Binance, BitMEX, Coinbase, Gemini, Tether, and Circle have been quietly dropped. The administration has also encouraged crypto companies that fled the U.S. under Joe Biden to return and restart operations there, aiming to beat China, as the president puts it. Over the past nine months, Bitcoin has broken about ten all-time highs, energizing markets and cementing the new administration’s influence on the global crypto sector. Executives from the largest crypto exchanges and blockchain firms have been seen visiting Trump’s White House, in what is seen as a deep integration of politics and crypto finance. “We’re going to be growing it even more. More than people thought,” said Trump about the crypto sector this summer. “It’s a really hot industry.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

53257027,607565,1760673620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53257027.jpeg,Ethereum Founder Buterin Stirs Up Bitcoin Core Vs. Knots Debate,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-bitcoin-core-vs-knots/,"Vitalik Buterin has waded into Bitcoin’s long-running dispute over “spam” policy and node software philosophy, amplifying a blistering post by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell that frames the controversy as a clash between open, market-driven neutrality and what he calls populist calls for censorship. “Greg Maxwell defends a principled commitment to freedom and open market-based resource allocation against the populist desire to censor the Current Hated Thing,” Buterin wrote on X, quote-tweeting BitMEX Research’s summary of “fighting talk” in the “Core v Knots” debate. Buterin Takes A Stance: Supports Bitcoin Core The immediate spark was a fresh message from Maxwell—posted “Today at 06:40:27 PM” on Bitcointalk—responding to pressure on Bitcoin Core maintainers to ship code perceived as filtering or degrading disfavored transaction types. Maxwell argues that Bitcoin Core’s position, “going all the way back to Satoshi , AFAICT,” is that “Bitcoin is a system secured by economics and self interest.” In his telling, proposals associated with Bitcoin Knots and its advocates amount to building “weapons that can be used against Bitcoin,” a direction he insists Core contributors will not take. Maxwell’s post is unsparing about both the substance and tone of the current push to constrain on-chain activity. “The knots vision of Bitcoin seems to be a system (in)secured by altruistic hope and populist theocracy—by cancel culture and paper straw bans,” he writes, adding that such campaigns “are really popular on social media and (I expect) a big fail in the real world.” He acknowledges widespread distaste among Core regulars for “NFT/shitcoin traffic,” but says that commitment to permissionless use must override aesthetic preferences: “Core’s commitment to individual freedom, self determination, and related principals is great enough that they recognize that some wasteful or stupid traffic is the cost of an open system, and that speculative small improvements related to ‘spam’ aren’t worth risking properties that underlie Bitcoin’s entire reason for existence.” The through-line of Maxwell’s argument is that the project must not bend to “would-be censors” merely because they are “loud and obnoxious,” deploy legal threats, or invite government action. Instead, contributors will “route around them by using and improving Bitcoin just as they would with the weapons of any other attacker.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin Core is not a vendor optimizing for customers, but a group building a network they themselves want to use: “The people who work on Bitcoin do so for themselves— to create and protect a system they want to use. They’re not making a product for customers… Everyone is invited to share in the benefits of their work if you want what they’ve created, sure. But they’re not going to work against their own interest in a open system secured by economics and resistant to human influence because of popular outcry.” That “not a product for customers” line quickly became a flashpoint. “Everyone who runs Core IS a customer. This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever read,” X user BaconBitz objected. Buterin, who had elevated the exchange earlier, pushed back on that framing with a terse aesthetic defense: “No, it’s a paragraph written by someone who understands that a good protocol is a work of art.” Maxwell also ties today’s agitation to a broader cultural reaction against the popularity of on-chain experiments. In his post, he argues that “filter fundamentalism is a thing at all” largely because of “the popular success of NFT/shitcoin bullshit,” and offers a pointed aside about Luke Dashjr’s long-standing advocacy for what Maxwell characterizes as “personal transaction morality police.” In a characteristically caustic turn, he suggests that advocacy recently “picked up a little traction” not just because of sentiment shifts but also funding dynamics, alleging “he got handed millions in charity investment after becoming an involuntary no-coiner, and now can pay people to work with him and promote his positions since few would previously do it voluntarily.” The backdrop to all of this is the practical question of what, if anything, Bitcoin Core should do at the code level to address surges in block space demand stemming from inscriptions, NFTs, or other fads that critics label “spam.” Maxwell’s answer is unequivocal: permissionless design and economic incentives are the defense, not discretionary filters . “It’s nothing new that there is a sizable portion of the population that understand ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it’ and a sizable (and vocal!) portion that don’t understand it or don’t agree with it.” In that spirit, he warns against meeting censors “half way” and rejects the idea that threats of state action should steer protocol stewardship.

Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash After touching an all-time high above $126,000, the world’s largest crypto asset has shed nearly 9% on the weekly charts, reflecting waning momentum amid broader market uncertainty and renewed U.S.–China trade tensions. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Momentum Fades Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $111,300, down roughly 1% in 24 hours, after briefly dipping to an intraday low of $110,292. Technical indicators show the asset under pressure, with the 20-day and 50-day moving averages turning lower and a bearish crossover emerging on the MACD. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to the mid-40s, signaling cooling buying strength and the potential for further downside if support fails. Analysts are eyeing $107,000–$110,000 as the crucial short-term demand zone. A decisive break below this area could open the path toward $100,000, while a bounce above $115,000–$123,000 would be needed to restore bullish sentiment. “Bitcoin’s structure suggests fatigue at the top, with a potential double-top formation visible around $126,000,” one market analyst noted. “A weekly close below $110K would likely trigger broader profit-taking.” Whales Turn Cautious, Bitcoin ETF Inflows Slow On-chain data indicates that BTC whales have increased short exposure, signaling caution among large holders. This aligns with reports of falling ETF inflows, which declined by over $223 million this week after surging more than $2.7 billion the week before. Analysts suggest this cooldown reflects a pause in institutional demand following months of aggressive accumulation. Meanwhile, traders are closely watching macro developments, as gold’s rally to a record $4,200 has drawn some capital away from Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. Weak U.S. data and tariff-related volatility have added pressure, pushing some investors back toward traditional safe havens. Analysts Warn of Rising Wedge Breakdown Technically, Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a rising wedge pattern, often a bearish setup. If BTC closes the week below $110,000, the structure projects a potential downside target around $74,000, representing a 34% correction. However, long-term metrics such as hash rate and network activity remain strong, suggesting that any deep retracement could offer a buying opportunity for patient investors. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash For now, Bitcoin’s next move hinges on whether bulls can defend the $110K floor. A strong rebound from here could set the stage for another attempt toward $126K, but failure to hold support risks ushering in a much sharper correction before the next major rally begins.

Republican Representative Webster Barnaby filed the new proposal, known as House Bill 183, after his previous bill was withdrawn earlier this year. Expanding Florida’s Investment Scope HB 183, introduced Wednesday, would authorize the State Board of Administration and other public entities to invest up to 10% of their portfolios in digital assets. These could include Bitcoin, crypto securities, exchange-traded products, NFTs, and other blockchain-based investments. Barnaby’s new version strengthens rules around custody, documentation, and fiduciary duties, ensuring secure management of any digital holdings. The lawmaker also broadened the scope of eligible assets beyond Bitcoin-only exposure, aiming to give Florida greater flexibility in diversifying its reserve strategy. If approved, the measure would take effect on July 1, 2026. Crypto Reserve Bills Face National Challenges Despite the growing interest in crypto reserves, only three U.S. states — Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas — have successfully passed similar legislation. New Hampshire’s HB 302 allows up to 5% of public funds to be invested in digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion, currently limited to Bitcoin. Texas’ Senate Bill 21 established a Bitcoin-only reserve, while Arizona’s HB 2749 permits digital asset reserves only from unclaimed property. Barnaby’s Florida proposal would make it the first major state economy to pursue a diversified crypto investment policy. Additional Bill Targets Stablecoin Regulation In a related move, Barnaby also filed HB 175 to simplify the regulatory landscape for stablecoin issuers operating in Florida. The bill specifies that stablecoin providers fully backed by U.S. dollars or Treasury securities should not require separate state licenses. It also mandates monthly audits to ensure reserves are fully collateralized and publicly verifiable. Like the crypto reserve bill, HB 175 is scheduled to take effect in July 2026. California Strengthens Crypto Property Rights Meanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation last week protecting unclaimed digital assets from being automatically converted to cash. Senate Bill 822 ensures that unclaimed crypto holdings remain in their original form under state custody. The law allows account holders to recover their assets by submitting valid claims with the California State Controller’s Office, further establishing digital property rights in the U.S.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-17 04:52:47

Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB), the largest altcoins, recorded losses of 10%, 17%, and 7%, respectively, in the weekly time frame. The events of October 10 led to total crypto liquidations exceeding $20 billion, with an alarming 208,864 traders liquidated in just the past 24 hours, amounting to approximately $691.63 million in losses as a result of the ongoing correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Below $108,000: Peter Schiff Anticipates ‘Brutal’ Bear Market, CZ Responds In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), MartyParty warned that the ramifications of this event would include lawsuits targeting the alleged manipulators behind the crash. He criticized the centralized exchange (CEX) systems, stating: The manipulators cleared all the longs to 1.8x illegally. This had nothing to do with crypto. This is centralized exchange and casino systems that are opaque and easily manipulated with no regulation. Despite the turmoil, MartyParty expressed some optimism, noting that the crypto liquidations have cleared out long positions, which he believes could pave the way for future price increases. He also added that those responsible for this alleged manipulation would face scrutiny, predicting that this incident could evolve into one of the most significant fraud cases in financial history. Binance’s Role Adding to the concerns, another expert, Crypto Emre, highlighted the ease with which crashes can be orchestrated on platforms like Binance. He explained that the tokens visible in a user’s wallet are essentially held in Binance’s wallets behind the scenes. Emre asserts that the exchange can open short positions on multiple trading pairs simultaneously using private trading bots, which can then quickly sell the tokens held by users. Related Reading: Hyperliquid Vs Binance: Founders Clash Over Liquidation Transparency After closing the short positions at a lower price, the expert alleges that the exchange replaces the sold tokens with their own at a significantly reduced cost. Emre argued that as long as Binance remains operational, the potential for such manipulation will hinder the emergence of a robust crypto bull market. As the dust settles from the October 10 crypto crash, it remains uncertain whether regulatory bodies or individuals will take action against these alleged practices in the near future, as predicted by MartyParty.

According to records published by community burn tracker Shibburn, the wallet that carried out the transfer was newly created and had only that one visible SHIB transaction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sheds 25% As $57M Flees Market — Can The Memecoin Recover? Etherscan data shows the address was funded by a wallet tied to Coinbase, and it currently holds 0.002 ETH, worth roughly $9. Largest Single Burn In Months The 140 million SHIB moved on Wednesday stands out as the largest one-off burn in nearly three months. Reports show the last big single send happened on July 28, when an anonymous actor destroyed 600 million SHIB. Since that July event, most individual burns stayed below 100 million until this Coinbase-linked transfer. 🔥🔥 140,033,123 $SHIB -> transferred to dead wallet. https://t.co/EzSFusbkZa — Shibburn (@shibburn) October 15, 2025 Daily Burn Rate Jumps Based on reports from Shibburn, nine transactions that day totaled about 140 million SHIB destroyed, pushing the daily burn figure up by 222%. The tracker’s data also records a cumulative 410 trillion SHIB that have been sent to dead addresses over time. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s past transfers of around 410 trillion SHIB to a burn contract remain the largest single move toward deflation on record. Supply Still Vast Shiba Inu’s total supply remains enormous at roughly 589 trillion tokens. That scale means even large-sounding burns have only a tiny impact on the overall available supply. Market watchers point out that unless burn activity becomes sustained and much larger in scale, the supply math will not shift meaningfully. Wallet Details And Transparency Etherscan shows the burner address executed only that one outgoing SHIB transfer and nothing else. The funding trace to a Coinbase-associated wallet suggests a user on the exchange initiated the action, but the identity behind the address has not been disclosed. The post-burn balance for SHIB is zero, and the tiny ETH holding left behind makes the move appear deliberate and final. Price Action And Technical Levels Even after the large token send to the burn address, SHIB barely moved — it was trading around $0.00001049 when the burn happened, and it slipped only 0.15% over the prior 24 hours. The bigger picture hasn’t changed: roughly 589 trillion SHIB remain in circulation, so even headline-grabbing burns make only a tiny dent. This latest action is part of a string of deflation efforts, including Shibarium Layer-2 burns handled through Bone ShibaSwap, which together have removed billions of SHIB from circulation. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Market Impact Remains Limited This event looks significant in headline terms but small when compared with the huge SHIB supply. The transfer adds to an ongoing narrative of community-led burns that keep holders engaged, yet it is unlikely to change the market trend on its own. Traders and observers will watch whether similar, larger burns follow, or if this remains a one-off action tied to a single Coinbase-funded address.

Standard Chartered & OKX Expand Crypto Partnership To EEA As revealed in a press release , OKX is expanding its partnership with Standard Chartered . The two first came together in April to launch a first-of-its-kind collateral mirroring program in the UAE, allowing institutional clients to custody their assets with the bank while mirroring those balances into the crypto exchange for trading. Standard Chartered and OKX have now decided to expand this service to investors in the European Economic Area (EEA). “This innovation gives clients the best of both worlds: bank-grade custody and seamless exchange access, helping them reduce counterparty risk, strengthen asset security, and trade with greater confidence,” said the press release. Standard Chartered is a major multinational financial institution headquartered in the UK that’s classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). G-SIBs are considered institutions so core to the global economic framework that any instability related to them can have wide-reaching ripple effects. Earlier in the year, Standard Chartered became the first bank of this class to roll out a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk for institutional traders. With the OKX partnership, the bank has also become the first G-SIB to team up with a crypto exchange. OKX noted that the collaboration marks “a major step forward in aligning digital asset markets with the highest standards of traditional finance—bringing greater assurance and credibility for institutions and clients alike.” OKX, currently ranked the second largest crypto exchange in the world based on trading volume, is licensed under the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), the European Union’s unified framework for crypto assets. “MiCA provides clarity and certainty in regulation, which gives institutional clients the confidence to deploy capital securely,” read the press release. “By pairing this with innovative solutions like collateral mirroring, we’re helping clients trade more efficiently in a safeguarded environment.” Speaking of institutional crypto developments in the EU, nine big banks announced in late September a consortium aimed at launching a MiCA-compliant euro-based stablecoin. “Stablecoins” are digital assets that have their price pegged to a fiat currency. Currently, the sector is heavily dominated by USD-tied tokens, so this initiative intends to create a real European alternative. The initial list of participants included major European players, including two G-SIBs in ING and UniCredit. According to a Bloomberg report from last week, a tenth institution is joining the consortium: Citigroup, another G-SIB. The bank is the first non-European entity to take part in the effort. While no concrete date is known for when the banks will release the euro stablecoin, the initial announcement noted that they are aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,600, down more than 8% over the last week.",Crypto News|crypto|Cryptocurrency|OKX|Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SPONSORED|FIAT|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-17 05:00:48

It’s happening,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-to-xrp-investors-opportunity-is-here-its-happening/,"Ripple has announced a landmark acquisition of GTreasury, a leading provider of treasury and risk management software, in a $1 billion deal. The move positions Ripple to enter the $120 trillion corporate treasury payments market, one of the largest and most complex segments of global finance. This acquisition represents a major step in Ripple’s strategy to expand beyond cross-border remittances and into institutional-grade financial services. Reinforcing the Core Use Case for Blockchain Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Garlinghouse, stated that recent years have reinforced the importance of payments as the foundational use case for blockchain technology. He emphasized that inefficiencies and fragmentation within the financial infrastructure drove Ripple’s early focus on payments. The integration of decentralized solutions, according to Garlinghouse, addresses long-standing issues of siloed systems, delays, and costs in global money movement. Combining Expertise and Infrastructure GTreasury, which has served major global brands for decades, brings with it a deep network in the corporate finance space. Through this merger, Ripple plans to provide chief financial officers and treasury departments with tools to manage diverse digital and traditional assets, including stablecoins and tokenized deposits. The collaboration aims to enable corporations to operate seamlessly across jurisdictions, reducing settlement times and optimizing liquidity management on a global scale. Ripple also revealed plans to enhance capital efficiency for enterprises by connecting idle corporate funds to repo markets through Hidden Road, an institutional liquidity provider. This feature will allow businesses to generate returns on dormant assets while maintaining accessibility and compliance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Step Toward the Future of Enterprise Payments The acquisition underscores Ripple’s ambition to become a dominant player in institutional payments, bridging traditional finance and blockchain-based ecosystems. With global corporations seeking more efficient ways to manage liquidity, risk, and payments, Ripple’s combined expertise with GTreasury could redefine how corporate treasuries handle digital value. This move also reflects the maturing role of blockchain in solving real financial problems rather than speculative ones. By entering a $120 trillion market, Ripple is aligning itself with the broader trend of tokenization and on-chain financial operations within the enterprise sector. Garlinghouse concluded that the opportunity to transform global treasury management through blockchain technology is already here, affirming Ripple’s commitment to scaling its solutions and delivering tangible value to the institutional market.

According to Kikvadze, it's “only a matter of time” before the price of Bitcoin reaches $1 million, and then $10 million. As an early Bitcoin investor, Kikvadze assessed the cryptocurrency's evolution over the past decade and detailed the macroeconomic and institutional factors behind the rise. Stating that he has always viewed Bitcoin as “an investment against the irresponsibility of governments and the money printing of central banks,” Kikvadze argued that it acts as a “digital gold” with anti-inflationary properties and an insurance. Related News: Tether (USDT) Co-Founder Explains Why Bitcoin Price Fell Stating that there is more than one reason for the dramatic rise in Bitcoin’s price, Kikvadze listed the most important driving forces as follows: Global Debt and QE: The rise in government debt worldwide, the continued spending of OECD countries, and the quantitative easing (QE) policies of central banks have increased the appeal of Bitcoin. Institutional Wave: He noted that the increased access to institutions, driven by the entry of giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, has had a profound impact on the industry. He attributed the beginning of institutional interest to Paul Tudor Jones' article supporting Bitcoin. Kikvadze also touched on competition in the mining sector, stating that the field is becoming more capital-intensive. Kikvadze reiterated that regulation for cryptocurrencies is a necessary and good thing, as he has believed since 2014. *This is not investment advice.

As market sentiment swings wildly and attention fragments across emerging projects, the old meme-coin war may be shifting into a new era dominated by utility and scarcity. Meanwhile, whispers about this new viral token have reached fever pitch. Many analysts are positioning what’s next as the next 100x crypto . Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Hair-Raising Potential or Standing On Shaky Ground? Shiba Inu remains one of the most talked-about ERC-20 coin stories, appealing to both nostalgics and risk-takers. Lately, SHIB’s price action has stalled under heavy resistance zones. Some chart watchers see a descending triangle tightening, which could lead to a >30% drop if the support fails. Analysts pointing toward a bullish thesis note SHIB’s burn rate is soaring, showing that the community is actively trying to reduce supply. In fact, reports suggest the burn could push SHIB toward $0.0000254 in a favorable cycle. There’s also chatter about a classic inverse head-and-shoulders forming. Still, skepticism runs deep. With such a vast circulating supply, even large rallies will feel slow and noisy. Several projections model SHIB hovering near $0.000013 for much of 2025 — modest gains at best. Some warn the coin might underperform against leaner, more focused low gas fee crypto challengers. Remittix (RTX): The New Viral Crypto SHIB Holders Are Now Betting On Remittix is being whispered about as a true DeFi project with real utility — not just hype. While SHIB weathered the meme cycle, Remittix is staking its claim in cross-border payments, integrating with bank rails, and promising crypto-to-fiat transfers at scale.

Investors also watched rising geopolitical risks, with Trump warning that the US is “in a trade war now” and threatening further tariffs on China.

In the latest update, China accused the US of exaggerating its rare earth export controls, calling the resulting “panic” unnecessary while signaling openness to trade talks. Traders remain cautious ahead of China’s fourth plenum (Oct. 20–23), where the 2026–2030 five-year plan will be unveiled.

While advocates see it as a step toward making Bitcoin usable for everyday payments, critics argue that Bitcoin’s public ledger could compromise Signal’s privacy model. The initiative is being pushed forward as Europe also grapples with privacy concerns tied to the proposed “Chat Control” law targeting encrypted messaging platforms. Bitcoin for Signal Gains Momentum Several well known Bitcoin advocates, including Jack Dorsey, are backing a new initiative called “Bitcoin for Signal.” The goal of the initiative is to integrate Bitcoin payments into the privacy-focused messaging app Signal through the Cashu protocol. The campaign was launched by pseudonymous Bitcoin developer Cashu , who wants to bring Bitcoin’s Chaumian Ecash technology to Signal, which will enable private and censorship-resistant payments in the app. Dorsey is a long-time supporter of Bitcoin adoption, and endorsed the initiative on X by reposting Cashu’s campaign message, stating that Signal should adopt Bitcoin. The idea also got some traction from well-known Bitcoin developers like Peter Todd, Calle, and Satoshi Labs co-founder Pavol Rusnak. Todd criticized Signal’s existing cryptocurrency payment feature, MobileCoin (MOB), by calling it a “failure” due to its centralization and limited accessibility. Signal integrated MobileCoin in 2021, but it has faced ongoing backlash from the Bitcoin community for relying on a small validator set and for lacking transparency. Supporters of Bitcoin for Signal argue that adding Bitcoin payments will align with the app’s privacy and independence ethos, and could potentially enable its 70 million monthly users to send peer-to-peer Bitcoin payments privately. Dorsey repeatedly said that Bitcoin must evolve beyond being just a store of value and should be used for everyday transactions, and this campaign wants to advance this vision. (Source: Bitcoinforsignal.org ) However, critics raised concerns that Bitcoin’s public ledger could undermine Signal’s privacy-focused design. Aztec Network engineer José Pedro Sousa questioned why a privacy app would use a transparent blockchain. Others, including digital rights group Techlore, warned that Bitcoin could compromise user anonymity. Some privacy advocates suggested alternatives like Monero and Zcash, which feature built-in privacy protections. While the Cashu protocol offers a privacy-preserving layer for Bitcoin, similar systems struggled to achieve mainstream success. The campaign comes during a time of growing tension over digital privacy in Europe. The European Union recently postponed a vote on the controversial “Chat Control” law, which would have forced encrypted messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp to scan private communications for child abuse material. Germany opposed the proposal by arguing it violated constitutional privacy rights. The vote is now expected to take place in early December.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 05:30:00

Both leading assets are now trading in narrow ranges, with lower volatility across major exchanges. Trading has weakened, and there are signs that many traders are re-evaluating their positions while the overall market stabilizes. At the same time, investors are turning their focus to promising new altcoins. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly emerged as a standout. Fuelled by transparency, audited contracts, and straightforward documentation, the Ethereum-based project has seen an exceptional 10,000% increase in presale hype. Its momentum underscores increasing demand for early-stage tokens with long-term upside potential. Bitcoin Holds Steady as Market Consolidates Bitcoin price today is down 1.39% past 24 hours, trading near $110,873 after briefly hitting $113,000 earlier this week. The asset has lost more than $4,900 in a month, which has reduced its market cap to $2.21 trillion. Source: TradingView Trading volume has declined by 20%, reflecting decreased momentum from retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin is now meeting resistance at $111,500 after multiple rejections in the 100-day EMA. Traders are evidently cautious after a series of lower peaks. Many are watching the $110,000 support level, along with modest downside levels near $108,000 if there is further selling pressure. Yet, there is still a triple-bottom pattern around $109,600 in which recovery can still occur. A break above $114,600 and $116,000 could open a way to $125,000 or $130,000 before the end of the year. Ethereum Moves Sideways Amid Cooling Market Activity Ethereum follows Bitcoin’s consolidation pattern and is struggling to break $4,220. Ethereum ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with its most recent price below $4,050 due to multiple unsuccessful efforts towards regaining more resistance. Source: TradingView ETH has formed a contracting triangle with support near $3,950 and resistance around $4,075. On-chain activity remains moderate, with RSI readings below 50 indicating limited buying strength. A close above $4,200 would likely lead to a move to $4,350 or $4,420 levels. On multiple technical factors, analysts warn of a dip to $3,750 if $3,880 holding fails. Despite low volatility, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem remains active, echoing investor patience during consolidation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains 10,000% Hype in Early Presale Stage While major assets cool, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured market attention with explosive early-stage momentum. The project’s transparent audits, traceable wallets, and open communication have earned a strong level of investor confidence. Analysts call it one of the few presales for which execution matches published documentation. The token’s Ethereum foundation has supported safe transactions, while the deflationary model slowly lowers the total supply. Its staged presale system is rewarding early investors with fair pricing and balanced liquidity. These factors have fueled rapid community expansion and helped MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out from typical altcoin launches. Industry watchers think that this framework is the basis for its 10,000% hype growth . As Bitcoin and Ethereum trade sideways, traders see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fresh entry point with strong ROI potential before 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum have been consolidating as the broader market cools, creating a wait-and-see vibe from large investors. Volume is still low, but the technical formations are conducive to a return of volatility when key resistance threshold levels are taken out. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s verified audits, fair presale structure, and deflationary design have elevated it as a credible new entrant in the altcoin space. Its popularity in early-stage projects is a testament to the increasing demand for transparent and sustainable crypto projects designed for long-term value.

Community matters more than whitepapers, and sometimes a dog-themed token with zero utility outperforms venture-backed projects. BONK proved this when it airdropped to Solana users on Christmas 2022 and rallied over 2,000% in its first week. By December 2023, it became the third-largest meme coin behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu , with Coinbase and Binance listings making it legitimate. But here’s what nobody mentions. BONK succeeded despite having no revenue model, no institutional backing, and launching right after FTX collapsed. The token’s success was pure community will and perfect timing when Solana desperately needed a win. Fast forward to October 2025, and everything has changed. Institutional money is flooding back into crypto, regulatory clarity is improving, and projects launching with actual revenue models are commanding serious valuations. Astra Nova ‘s $RVV launches October 18th into this completely different market environment, and the contrast with BONK’s grassroots launch couldn’t be sharper. This one has NVIDIA backing, Alibaba Cloud infrastructure, Saudi Arabia’s NEOM support, and the team behind Shiba Inu’s billion-dollar ecosystem. More importantly, it launches with a proven revenue model that automatically buys back and burns tokens using platform fees. When Community Meets Infrastructure BONK’s December 2022 launch was beautifully simple. The team airdropped 50% of supply to Solana community members, NFT holders, and developers who survived the FTX disaster. No presale, no venture capital, just massive community distribution creating instant ownership across thousands of wallets. Within five months, the token delivered a 4,315% return and sparked a rally across the entire Solana ecosystem. The strategy worked because Solana needed positive momentum, and BONK gave the community something to rally around that wasn’t tied to FTX wreckage. By November 2024, BONK hit its all-time high of $0.00005916, driven entirely by community support and growing integration across Solana dApps. The token proved that in the right conditions, pure community energy creates billions in market value even without traditional metrics. Astra Nova takes that community-first approach and layers institutional infrastructure on top. The project is backed by the Shiba Inu founding team, which means they’ve already built one of crypto’s most engaged communities and know how to sustain that energy through market cycles. But instead of relying solely on community hype, $RVV launches with Shiba Inu and Simon’s Cat already building applications on TokenPlay AI, bringing millions of existing users into the ecosystem before the token goes live. Revenue Models Change Everything BONK’s tokenomics are straightforward. The team burns tokens periodically to reduce supply, with major burns like the 1.69 trillion token BURNmas event creating scarcity through governance decisions. Since launch, the ecosystem has burned approximately 12 trillion tokens representing over $340 million permanently removed from circulation. This deflationary pressure supports value, but burns depend on treasury decisions rather than automatic mechanisms tied to platform activity. $RVV’s approach is fundamentally different because buyback and burn is built directly into how TokenPlay AI generates revenue. Every application launched on the platform collects fees from user transactions, and a percentage automatically purchases $RVV tokens from the open market and destroys them permanently. More applications mean more transactions, more transactions mean more fees, and more fees mean constant buyback pressure scaling with ecosystem growth. Platforms using similar models already prove the revenue potential. Pump.fun generated $15.5 million in fees during a single day in January 2025 and has collected over $803 million cumulative. LetsBonk.fun generated nearly $800,000 in its first three days and now uses fees to buy and burn BONK tokens, creating the revenue model BONK itself never had. Institutional Backing That BONK Never Had BONK succeeded with anonymous developers and no institutional support, which was part of its grassroots appeal. $RVV launches with NVIDIA’s Inception program access, Alibaba Cloud infrastructure across 91 global availability zones, and NEOM backing from Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative. The Shiba Inu founding team brings expertise in building and maintaining crypto’s most active communities through multiple market cycles. The Timing Advantage BONK launched into terrible market conditions in December 2022, right after FTX collapsed. The token succeeded despite awful timing because the community needed hope. $RVV launches into October 2025 when institutional money is returning and markets reward projects with real business models. On October 18th, $RVV goes live with 250,000 creators ready to build immediately, major IPs already integrated, and buyback mechanics activating the moment transactions flow. BONK proved community matters. $RVV launches with community, infrastructure, and revenue model working together. The question isn’t whether BONK’s playbook still works, but whether combining all three creates something bigger.

The influx reinforces Ethereum’s dominance as the world’s most actively developed blockchain, supported by its expanding network of layer-2 solutions. Solana Trails Ethereum with 11,500 Developers Solana ranked second with roughly 11,500 new developers contributing code this year. However, the Solana Foundation noted that Electric Capital’s dataset may be outdated and undercounts actual figures. Bitcoin, in comparison, attracted around 7,500 new developers over the same period. According to Electric Capital’s developer tracker, Ethereum now hosts the largest active developer base across all blockchain ecosystems, with 31,869 active developers. Solana follows with 17,708, while Bitcoin trails at 11,036. Ethereum’s figure includes contributors to layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Unichain, as defined by L2Beat, without double-counting developers working across multiple layers. Despite Ethereum’s lead, Solana’s growth over the past two years has been far stronger. Full-time Ethereum developers grew by 5.8% year-on-year, while Solana recorded a 29.1% increase in the same period and a 61.7% surge over two years, one of the fastest expansions in the industry. 1/ New data confirms: @Ethereum is the #1 ecosystem for new developers in 2025. pic.twitter.com/ZThdbGDf0X — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 15, 2025 Still, Solana’s developer count may be higher than reported. The foundation’s head of developer relations, Jacob Creech, said around 7,800 developers are missing from the current dataset, urging the community to submit GitHub repositories to improve Solana’s tracking. Some analysts have also challenged Electric Capital’s methodology, arguing that ecosystems using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), such as Polygon and BNB Chain, should be grouped together, since their developers share tools and programming standards. Adding to the debate, Jarrod Watts, head of Australia for layer-2 project Abstract, suggested that AI-assisted code generation and hackathon projects could be inflating the overall figures. “This data likely includes a tonne of vibe coding slop and hackathon repos that are never touched again,” he said. Latin America’s Developers Flock to Ethereum and Polygon As reported, developers across Latin America are increasingly building on established blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon instead of creating new base-layer protocols, a report from Sherlock Communications found. Ethereum leads regional activity, accounting for more than 75% of blockchain transactions, while Polygon’s share nearly doubled to 20%. Developers cited transparency, ease of use, and regulatory clarity as key reasons for choosing mature ecosystems over newer ones. According to Sherlock researcher Luiz Eduardo Abreu Hadad, Latin America’s developer community shows “strong technical maturity” and a growing focus on solving real-world problems rather than reinventing infrastructure. On-chain data from 697,000 transactions in countries including Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia, and Peru supports this trend. Local projects like Brazil’s Núclea Chain and RBB, however, highlight the region’s potential to build its own blockchain infrastructure.

A close above the $1,250 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $1,320 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $1,350 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $1,200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,125 level. The next major support is near the $1,100 level. The main support sits at $1,065. If there is a downside break below the $1,065 support, the price could drop toward the $1,000 support.

The move signals the company’s intent to strengthen its presence in the digital-asset ecosystem, even as investors remain cautious following a market-wide selloff. The funds will be placed in a new digital-asset treasury (DAT), with Ripple contributing some of its own XRP to the effort. This comes at a time when the crypto market remains fragile, and investor sentiment toward such ventures has cooled. Ripple’s digital-asset treasury plan Ripple’s fundraising will reportedly take place through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), with discussions around the final structure still underway. The company’s DAT will serve as a long-term holding vehicle for XRP, the token closely associated with Ripple’s payment network. If successful, this will be the largest treasury initiative centred on XRP, which currently ranks as the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalisation of $140.57 billion. At present, XRP is trading at $2.34, down 2.63% in the past 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data . While similar accumulators have faced declining confidence — with firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and Japan’s Metaplanet Inc. seeing share drops — Ripple appears committed to pushing forward. Its decision highlights a broader trend of established crypto players looking to reinforce their ecosystems despite volatility and shifting investor sentiment. XRP’s resilience compared to wider crypto losses The broader market downturn that followed tensions in the US-China trade war saw a wave of liquidations across exchanges, hitting both major and smaller digital assets. Even Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell amid renewed selling pressure. The pullback raised questions about the sustainability of speculative altcoins and their place in diversified crypto portfolios. Yet, XRP has shown relative resilience. It has gained substantially so far in 2025. Ripple’s treasury initiative could potentially stabilise XRP’s price and strengthen market confidence by signalling corporate commitment to long-term value accumulation. Ripple’s $1 billion GTreasury acquisition Ripple’s plans for the DAT coincide with its acquisition of GTreasury, a treasury management software provider, for $1 billion. The deal, announced on Thursday , aims to connect corporate finance chiefs and treasurers with blockchain-based financial solutions, including tokenised deposits and stablecoins. By integrating GTreasury’s platform, Ripple is positioning itself as a key bridge between traditional finance and the tokenised economy. The acquisition also suggests Ripple’s strategic pivot toward institutional adoption of blockchain finance tools — a segment expected to see substantial growth as businesses explore digital asset integration into everyday financial operations. Institutional participation in token accumulators grows Throughout 2025, the crypto industry has seen a proliferation of publicly listed token accumulators — entities that hold cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or XRP as part of structured investment vehicles. These are often created through SPAC mergers or reverse takeovers to give investors indirect exposure to digital assets. More than 300 entities now hold Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net, signalling growing institutional involvement in the space.

The move, confirmed on-chain, represents around 21% of CI Global’s total $620.61 million ETH holdings, according to data from their Ethereum ETF portfolio. BREAKING: This Canadian ETF just staked $130M ETH CI Global Asset Management holds $620.61M of ETH in their ETHX ETF, and have just staked $130M. They still hold around $490.85M of unstaked ETH in their ETF. Will they be staking this as well? pic.twitter.com/8i68ti6wy0 — Arkham (@arkham) October 16, 2025 CI Global’s Bold Move into Staking The ETHX ETF currently holds approximately $620.61 million in Ethereum. Of that, $130 million is now staked, earning yield through network validation and rewards. That leaves $490.85 million of unstaked ETH still sitting idle in the ETF. The big question: Will CI Global stake the rest? If they do, it would push total staked ETF-held Ethereum to one of the highest levels among traditional funds, potentially influencing yields across liquid staking protocols and DeFi. This marks a significant shift, not just in ETF strategy but in institutional participation on-chain. Traditional funds are no longer holding ETH passively. They’re beginning to earn from the network itself Institutional Ethereum Demand Is Building CI Global’s move comes amid a wave of institutional ETH accumulation across exchanges. On-chain data shows large-scale withdrawals from centralized platforms, often the first sign of long-term holding or staking activity. Over the past 48 hours, roughly $415 million worth of ETH has moved off exchanges tied to institutional wallets. Tom Lee Reportedly Bought $415M in ETH The biggest headline of the week: Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, reportedly purchased $415 million worth of ETH through two separate entities. On-chain trackers identified two addresses withdrawing $185 million from Kraken overnight, matching known purchase patterns associated with Bitmine’s institutional flow model. This comes just a day after another $231.5 million worth of ETH was withdrawn from BitGo wallets. Combined, that’s $415 million in ETH bought over a 48-hour period. These are not retail moves. They mirror Bitmine’s historical accumulation strategy, large, timed withdrawals ahead of macro catalysts or liquidity shifts. TOM LEE BOUGHT $415M WORTH OF ETH Two addresses withdrew $185M ETH last night from Kraken. These movements are in addition to the $231.5M withdrawn from Bitgo that we reported yesterday – bringing the total to $415M. These withdrawals match known Bitmine purchase patterns. https://t.co/XrIFGG3LUL pic.twitter.com/YOjda3vkgl — Arkham (@arkham) October 16, 2025 $6 Billion in Shorts on the Line Ethereum’s open interest is now sitting on a knife’s edge. Analysts estimate around $6 billion worth of ETH shorts could face liquidation if the price pumps just 10% from current levels. That means a short squeeze could easily propel ETH into its next leg higher, especially with fresh inflows from ETFs and whale wallets. Add in BlackRock’s latest ETH inflow and Bitmine’s ongoing purchases, and market pressure is clearly building on the short side. $6,000,000,000 in shorts will get liquidated if $ETH pumps 10%. BlackRock had an inflow yesterday, while BitMine is also buying. The only uncertainty is around the US-China deal, which is dragging everything down. Any signs of trade deal could push Ethereum higher. pic.twitter.com/du0Of40aLD — Ted (@TedPillows) October 16, 2025 Macro Clouds, But Optimism Grows Despite the heavy buying, macro sentiment remains the biggest overhang. The ongoing uncertainty around the U.S.–China trade deal has weighed on risk assets across the board. Traders are holding their breath for any sign of progress. “Any indication of a trade breakthrough could send Ethereum flying,” one analyst noted, pointing to the combination of institutional inflows, ETF staking activity, and short exposure as a “perfect storm” setup. For now, the market remains cautious, but data points are stacking up in favor of a move higher. Ethereum’s Institutional Cycle Is Underway This latest wave of ETF staking and whale accumulation signals a clear shift in market structure. During previous cycles, institutional interest often lagged behind retail. This time, it’s leading. CI Global’s decision to actively stake ETH shows traditional finance is becoming more comfortable with on-chain yield, treating staking as a legitimate income stream rather than a speculative risk. That development could have ripple effects across the broader ETF landscape. If other funds follow suit, billions in idle ETH could transition into active validator participation, effectively reducing circulating supply and strengthening the network’s economic base. Ethereum’s On-Chain Story Strengthens Ethereum is now being treated less like a speculative token and more like an on-chain financial asset, one that yields, secures, and compounds. Institutional staking inflows could amplify ETH’s long-term scarcity dynamics. As more ETH is locked for yield, liquid supply tightens, making price reactions sharper during accumulation waves. Combine that with short-side risk and upcoming macro catalysts, and Ethereum sits on a high-tension coil that could unwind dramatically in either direction. For now, $415 million in new institutional ETH buys, $130 million staked by a major ETF, and $6 billion in shorts waiting to be squeezed are setting up one of the most asymmetric setups Ethereum has seen all year. The Bottom Line CI Global Asset Management staked $130M ETH, leaving $490.85M unstaked in their ETF. Tom Lee and Bitmine-linked addresses withdrew $415M ETH from centralized exchanges. BlackRock continues to record ETH inflows. $6B in shorts could be liquidated on a 10% price jump. A U.S.–China trade breakthrough remains the macro wildcard. Institutional capital is moving fast. Ethereum is once again the asset of choice, not for speculation, but for yield, exposure, and network participation. And if the next 10% move triggers the short cascade analysts expect, we may be watching the early phase of Ethereum’s next institutional leg. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This week, the investment firm announced a strategic investment in Temple Digital Group, a privacy-focused technology stack for trading capital markets built on the Canton Network. Alongside that, YZi Labs also led a $50 million funding round in Better Payment Network (BPN), a programmable, multi-stablecoin payment layer designed to connect CeFi and DeFi payments globally. Both moves mark a clear signal: YZi Labs is betting on the next evolution of compliant, enterprise-ready Web3 infrastructure. Temple Digital Group: Privacy Meets Compliance Temple Digital Group is building a new foundation for on-chain institutional trading, focusing on compliance and privacy. The company operates on the Canton Network, the world’s first privacy-configurable public L1 developed by Digital Asset, already processing over $1.5 trillion in monthly tokenized U.S. Treasury repo activity. Temple’s stack includes non-custodial wallets and API interfaces that enable 24/7 digital asset trading without compromising regulatory standards. With YZi Labs’ latest investment, Temple plans to expand its engineering and compliance teams and roll out new products such as: Asset issuance and management tools Perpetual futures Cross-network trade routing on Canton Network The company will also continue researching cryptographic interoperability between Canton and other blockchains, a step toward seamless multi-chain integration. https://t.co/dUioYxl4Mi — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 16, 2025 Institutional Momentum Around Canton Network Temple’s growth comes at a time when institutional participation in the Canton Network is accelerating. Major financial players like Goldman Sachs and Citadel are already active within the ecosystem, exploring tokenized securities and real-world asset (RWA) markets. Canton’s architecture is designed for regulated financial institutions, offering privacy, compliance, and interoperability within a single framework. For YZi Labs, the investment represents a broader push toward trusted DeFi infrastructure, where institutions can participate without regulatory friction. Privacy and compliance are the missing pieces for large-scale DeFi adoption, Canton and Temple Digital are solving exactly that. Expanding Product Lines and Market Reach With the new funding, Temple aims to broaden its product coverage to include more financial instruments and deeper cross-chain integrations. The focus is on bringing real-world assets on-chain, a sector expected to exceed $16 trillion in tokenized value by 2030, according to industry estimates. The firm also plans to establish cross-network trade routing, connecting liquidity between Canton and other major blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. In the short term, this could boost institutional adoption and enhance confidence in privacy-oriented DeFi infrastructure. However, regulatory hurdles still loom, particularly around global deployment timelines over the next 12–18 months. YZi Labs’ Broader Strategy: Building the Next Financial Stack This investment in Temple is just one piece of a broader strategy. YZi Labs is building a portfolio of infrastructure projects that merge DeFi efficiency with traditional finance compliance. Following its rebrand from Binance Labs, YZi Labs has shifted focus toward: Privacy-enabled blockchain infrastructure On-chain financial settlement tools Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization Developer-focused infrastructure for global markets Each move highlights the firm’s belief that the future of Web3 lies in institutional integration, not speculative hype. $50M Funding in Better Payment Network (BPN) In another major move, YZi Labs announced it has led a $50 million financing round in Better Payment Network (BPN), a programmable, multi-stablecoin payment layer built on BNB Chain. BPN is designed to bridge CeFi and DeFi, bringing stablecoin settlements into global enterprise finance. It offers a unified, on-chain layer for minting, swapping, and settlement of fiat-backed stablecoins, enabling regulated, low-cost cross-border transactions. The funding will be used to: Build on-chain liquidity pools for stablecoin-to-stablecoin corridors Develop an early market-making ecosystem Improve on-chain FX pricing and liquidity for institutional users https://t.co/Kr12b0OyTC — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 16, 2025 Connecting CeFi and DeFi BPN represents the growing trend of programmable money, where stablecoins can move freely across regulated networks without intermediaries. The system will allow enterprises, fintechs, and banks to settle multi-currency transactions instantly, bypassing traditional SWIFT channels and reducing operational costs. For example, a U.S. company could pay a supplier in Europe instantly using on-chain stablecoins, while both sides retain regulatory compliance through verified entities. With YZi Labs’ backing, BPN aims to become the go-to settlement layer for regulated global payments, directly competing with emerging on-chain systems like Circle’s CCTP and RippleNet. The Bigger Picture: Web3 Infrastructure Evolves Between Temple Digital and BPN, YZi Labs is shaping the next layer of Web3 infrastructure, one that is compliant, scalable, and institution-ready. Both projects target long-standing barriers in crypto adoption: Temple focuses on privacy and compliance in trading, while BPN addresses global payment interoperability. Together, they highlight the broader industry shift, from speculative DeFi to real-world, utility-driven ecosystems. As institutional confidence grows and frameworks like MiCA mature, investments like these could accelerate blockchain’s role in global finance. Conclusion: From Experimentation to Execution YZi Labs’ latest moves underline a clear narrative, Web3 is going professional. The focus has shifted from decentralized experimentation to enterprise-grade execution. With Temple Digital Group bringing compliance and privacy to capital markets and BPN bridging stablecoin settlements across borders, the foundation is being laid for a regulated, interoperable financial internet. In the months ahead, all eyes will be on how these platforms roll out real products and partnerships, and how institutions respond to the next evolution of blockchain finance.

Binance Funding Rates Signal ETH Surging To $6,800",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-correction-binance-funding-eth-6800/,"Ethereum (ETH) may be nearing the end of its price correction, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap continues to trade slightly above $4,000, following a strong sell-off last week when it almost crashed to $3,400. Ethereum Price Correction May Be Over According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Ethereum funding rates on Binance crypto exchange have remained positive, despite being in a narrow range. This shows that long positions on ETH still dominate the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Feels “Too Efficient” As Arbitrage Opportunities Vanish – What It Means For Price? ETH funding rates fluctuating normally on Binance – despite the digital asset’s recent extraordinary price appreciation – implies that futures traders are not exhibiting greed or euphoria, typically associated with the mid-phase of a healthy uptrend. For example, during the 2021-22 bull cycle, ETH funding rates often surged to 0.1% to 0.2%, aligning with local market tops. At present, these funding rates are hovering around 0.01% to 0.03%, implying that the market has not reached overheated levels just yet. In addition, the absence of negative funding rates confirms a decline in short positioning, and elevated risk appetite among investors. The CryptoQuant analyst added: The overall trend remains upward. Low funding rates combined with strong price momentum suggest that the correction is likely complete. In the short term, minor profit-taking or sideways consolidation between $3,600–$3,800 would be natural. If funding rates gradually rise above 0.05%, it could signal overcrowded longs and trigger a short term pullback. The current combination of moderate levels of leverage and gradually rising spot demand hints toward a potential ETH rally, eyeing the $4,500 to $5,000 range in the long term. The price target could be even higher with a favorable derivatives structure and funding dynamics. That said, a sharp increase in funding rates could be seen as an early warning of another price pullback for the cryptocurrency. However, ETH’s market structure still supports a potential surge to $6,800 by the end of 2025, the analyst concluded. ETH Ready For New Highs? Several indicators point toward ETH looking to resume its bullish momentum. For instance, ETH’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) trend recently hinted toward the digital asset rising to $5,000 in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest Further, ETH exchange reserves continue to tumble at a rapid pace. Recent exchange data shows that ETH reserves on exchanges have hit a multi-year low, raising the possibility of an impending “supply crunch” for the cryptocurrency. That said, there are several other factors that may fuel another sell-off in ETH, pushing its price again below $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,053, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

A new class of altcoins, including dominant names like Solana (SOL), HYPE, and SUI, has analysts bullish as sentiment improves across the board. Solana (SOL) Gains Strength Ahead of Market Recovery Solana is staying competitive due to strong technical and institutional momentum. The Alpenglow update of the network is coming soon, which will cut the transaction finalization from 12.8 seconds to milliseconds. Last week, Solana experienced a surge in on-chain activity, marked by significant transfers and the accumulation of it by whales. The use of Solana by firms like Visa, Stripe, and Franklin Templeton has increased institutional uptake, making it the blockchain of choice for scalable financial applications. Whale Accumulation Sparks Interest in HYPE Whales show great interest in HYPE token amid ongoing fluctuation in the markets. In November 2025, a team token unlock worth $11.9 billion is looming. This will undoubtedly cause some selling pressure in the short term. In order to counter this, large holders have been buying the dips. This accumulation reflects confidence in HYPE’s long-term outlook. Indicators of a bullish breakout appear on the higher time-frame charts. As per analysts, a breakout pattern is beginning to form. The key support levels are around $3.40. It may rally up to $4.50-$5.00. SUI (SUI) Shows Renewed Momentum Investor interest in SUI is also increasing, with the company trading around $4.23 and a market cap of $14.6 billion. Analysts say more substantial trading volume and buyer activity position SUI among the potential altcoins to keep an eye on as liquidity returns. The growing ecosystem of decentralised apps and gaming continues to attract developers and retail investors. If the crypto recovery broadens, SUI is likely to see upside to $5.00-$5.50 in the short to midterm, positioning it as a major benefactor in the next Layer-1 growth story. The Rising Low-Cap Opportunity to Watch In line with the large-cap recovery stories, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention from investors looking for the next big thing in the early stage of the bull phase. The project has attracted the interest of retail and institutional investors. It is in very high demand. Hashex and audits add to the credibility and sustainability of its smart contracts. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing adoption reflects broader investor confidence in utility-driven crypto projects. With consistent community engagement and strong early-stage interest, it continues to emerge as a promising addition for investors seeking diversification beyond the established players. Conclusion Solana, HYPE, and SUI have captured potent market recovery narratives backed by whales and institutions with active development pipelines. All these projects show the ability to bounce back in the midst of uncertainty and are well-positioned to see growth in Q4. While MAGACOIN FINANCE grabs attention as a low-cap gem, what sets it apart is its double-verified security, scarcity-driven value, and surging presale momentum. As the markets transition from fear to optimism, these projects collectively illustrate the direction in which the smart money is moving in the next crypto cycle 2025. Experts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s successful Hashex audit and ongoing verification on Certik as significant proof of reliability, reinforcing investor trust in its presale model.

The drop came as global markets turned defensive, with equities slipping, bonds gaining and gold reaching a fresh record. It last traded 2.4% lower on the day around $108,503, and is down over 10% in the last week. Asian stocks mirrored Wall Street’s overnight losses, with investors retreating from risk assets after signs of credit strain resurfaced among US regional banks. Sentiment in equities also took a hit from rising trade tensions between the US and China. Beijing on Thursday accused Washington of stoking panic over its rare earth export controls and rejected a White House call to roll back the curbs, rattling already fragile market confidence. Altcoins Struggle as Market Pressure Builds on Weaker Momentum Bitcoin, which recently hit a record high of $126k on Oct. 6, has struggled to find a footing since last week’s sharp selloff. That downturn was triggered by a wave of liquidations exceeding $19b, compounded by jitters over US–China trade friction. The selloff swept across major tokens, leaving investors wary of further downside. Bitcoin has declined to ~$111K, dropping 11.8% since its $125.8K all-time high 9 days ago. With Trump's temporary tariff threats acting as a catalyst, gold has thrived, while equities chop. It can be argued $BTC 's drop is still in ""overreaction"" range. https://t.co/7WOMPa4RaT pic.twitter.com/DJQZatkqsY — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 15, 2025 Ether dropped 2.2% to $3,931, while XRP slipped 2.7% to $2.36. Market watchers said momentum in altcoins remained weak as traders reduced exposure ahead of potential regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, said XRP is facing near-term pressure due to whale transfers and exchange inflows. “Key support is forming between $2.10 and $2.30,” he said. “A breakout toward $3.00–$3.25 remains possible if ETF approvals materialize by late October, which would likely trigger renewed institutional inflows.” He added that Ripple’s recent $1b acquisition of GTreasury enhances XRP’s position in corporate finance, expanding its utility for settlements beyond speculative trading. Capital Rotates Toward Utility Tokens as Solana Leads Market Recovery In contrast, Solana is showing stronger momentum, Lee said, targeting a range between $210 and $250. Growth in DeFi activity and optimism around potential ETF approvals continue to support its performance. “Both assets are benefiting from a broader capital rotation into utility-driven tokens,” he said, noting that investors are focusing more on blockchain projects with real-world applications. Meanwhile, concerns in traditional markets have added to the cautious tone. The collapses of First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings revived fears of hidden credit losses, while accounting write-downs tied to fraud at Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance wiped out more than $100b in US banking market value in a single day. With credit worries mounting, gold and silver extended their rallies to fresh highs. Bitcoin, often touted as digital gold, has yet to follow suit, falling 6.3% over the past week, its sharpest drop since March. As Bitcoin Matures, Its Price Action Mirrors Traditional Markets More Closely Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, said Bitcoin’s growing integration with mainstream finance could explain its closer alignment with broader markets. Harz added that institutional adoption will accelerate innovation in Bitcoin-based decentralized finance. “These institutions holding BTC will want to unlock Bitcoin’s utility and put their assets to work by securely deploying BTC natively into DeFi protocols,” he said. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above the $110,000 threshold will likely depend on macroeconomic catalysts. Traders remain cautious, watching for signals from the US Federal Reserve on interest rates and how trade tensions might influence risk appetite heading into the final quarter of the year.

53261666,607764,1760680855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53261666.jpeg,Kraken Expands U.S. Footprint With $100M Small Exchange Acquisition Amid Derivatives Push,https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-expands-u-s-footprint-with-100m-exchange/,"Kraken has expanded its U.S. regulatory footprint through the $100 million acquisition of Small Exchange, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-licensed derivatives trading platform previously owned by IG Group. The decision marks a climactic step in Kraken’s bid to bring regulated crypto derivatives trading onshore and strengthen its presence in the world’s largest capital market. Kraken Secures CFTC License to Build Regulated U.S. Derivatives Hub The acquisition gives Kraken ownership of a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license , enabling it to design and operate exchange derivatives directly under U.S.. Kraken says this structure will allow it to integrate spot, margin, and futures products into a single regulated liquidity system, a first for its American clients. “Kraken’s acquisition of a CFTC-regulated Designated Contract Market creates the foundation for a new generation of United States derivatives markets,” said Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO. He also added, “This step connects spot, futures, and margin products inside a single regulated system, reducing fragmentation and bringing onshore the kind of access and performance that has mostly existed offshore.” The transaction includes both cash and equity considerations, with IG Group receiving $32.5 million in cash and $67.5 million in Kraken’s parent company stock. IG reported a post-tax profit of £73.3 million from the sale and confirmed it will continue collaborating with Kraken through a product distribution partnership. Expanding Kraken’s Global Derivatives Network This purchase builds on Kraken’s recent acquisitions, including NinjaTrader , which provides U.S. clients access to CME-listed crypto futures, and Crypto Facilities, its U.K.-based derivatives venue regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Together, these platforms form a global derivatives infrastructure spanning the U.K., EU, and now the U.S., enabling institutional clients to move collateral in real time and manage risk efficiently across regions. Founded in 2011, Kraken now serves over 15 million users worldwide, offering more than 450 digital and traditional assets. With the addition of Small Exchange, the company gains the regulatory flexibility to introduce U.S.-listed crypto futures and options, potentially challenging offshore leaders like Binance and Bybit.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-reach-the-end-heres-what-it-means/,"Market analyst CryptoBull has presented a compelling technical setup showing XRP nearing the end of a large falling wedge formation against Ethereum on the daily chart. The chart, shared on the Binance pair (XRP/ETH), illustrates a gradual compression between lower highs and higher lows, forming a structure that typically precedes a directional breakout. The analyst noted that this setup often leads to an upward move, implying a potential phase in which XRP could outperform Ethereum in the weeks ahead. Over the past several months, XRP has steadily declined in relative strength compared to Ethereum , maintaining a downward trajectory within the wedge since early spring. However, the recent price action has brought XRP close to the lower support boundary, where many traders are now closely monitoring for confirmation of a reversal or a continuation of the current trend. #XRP is about to reach the end in this giant falling wedge against Ethereum. This is a structure that usually moves to the upside suggesting that XRP will outperform Ethereum in the coming weeks! pic.twitter.com/C3EwcUc6dB — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 15, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the Community Reactions to CryptoBull’s observation have been divided. A user named Jack Rio expressed skepticism, suggesting that XRP has temporarily lost its dominance against Ethereum and that the overall structure appears bearish rather than bullish. Another user, Elephant, maintained a similar view, predicting that XRP’s value could weaken further over the coming months, possibly extending losses toward lower valuation levels. In contrast, CFLOYD76 commented with a brief yet cautious remark, interpreting the analyst’s use of “usually” as an important qualifier, implying that while a breakout is statistically favored, it is not guaranteed. Evaluating the Technical Implications From a technical standpoint, a falling wedge pattern is generally viewed as a bullish formation, especially when appearing after a sustained downtrend. The decreasing volatility within the wedge suggests that selling pressure is subsiding and that buyers may be preparing to reclaim momentum. However, this interpretation depends on confirmation through a breakout above the wedge’s upper resistance line, supported by a significant increase in trading volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The daily chart also shows that XRP’s performance against Ethereum remains below its 200-day moving average, indicating that broader momentum continues to favor Ethereum in the short term. Until XRP can establish sustained strength above that moving average, any upward attempt might face resistance. Based on the chart structure, XRP could be approaching a decisive technical juncture. If XRP breaks above the descending resistance line accompanied by volume expansion, a notable recovery relative to Ethereum may follow, with potential targets near previous consolidation levels. However, failure to hold the lower boundary of the wedge would invalidate the bullish scenario, potentially leading to further underperformance. As the formation nears completion, traders and analysts alike are paying attention to whether this compression phase signals the beginning of a reversal or the continuation of XRP’s relative weakness.

53261254,https://finbold.com/?p=255605,1760681043,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,SEC chair Atkins prioritizes innovation in crypto rulemaking,https://finbold.com/sec-chair-atkins-prioritizes-innovation-in-crypto-rulemaking/,"Enforcement and crackdowns have long characterized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) stance on cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. After years of standoffs, its new willingness to engage with the crypto industry could mark the start of a genuine experiment in regulatory change. SEC Chair Paul Atkins designated crypto and tokenization as the agency’s “job one” priority, marking a move toward a pro-innovation stance. The agency’s previous chair, Gary Gensler, wielded enforcement as his primary tool. Under Atkins, however, the agency seems to be asking a different question: how to let innovation thrive while maintaining oversight. Gensler-led SEC: Enforcement as policy Gensler treated most cryptocurrencies as “securities” and centered his crypto regulation strategy on aggressive enforcement and litigation. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC filed over 125 crypto-related enforcement actions and obtained a total monetary settlement, according to the report . About 64% were non-fraudulent actions alleging unregistered securities offering violations, and 37% were unanimously approved by the Commissioners. Between late 2020 and 2024, the SEC filed a string of lawsuits against several high-profile crypto firms, including Ripple (December 2020), Bittrex (April 2023), Coinbase (June 2023), Binance (June 2023), and Kraken (November 2023), alleging violations such as unregistered securities offerings and operating unlicensed exchanges. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, criticized Gensler “ prejudged crypto ,” pursuing lawsuits against crypto firms “without investigation,” stifling the industry’s growth in the US. The enforcement-heavy environment in the U.S. led some crypto businesses to exit the market. Some firms, despite being registered with the SEC, struggled to stay afloat under the strict regulations. Atkins-led SEC: Innovation as strategy Following Gensler’s departure in January 2025 and before Atkins’ arrival, Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda announced the creation of the Crypto Task Force, which is led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. The task force’s goal was to take a balanced approach to the cryptocurrency and digital asset sector rather than prioritizing only enforcement. A significant policy shift occurred in January 2025 when the SEC rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 . It eased barriers for financial institutions offering crypto custodial services. Since taking office in April 2025, Atkins has led the SEC to begin withdrawing or pausing select crypto lawsuits. In July 2025, the agency launched Project Crypto to “modernize the securities rules and regulations” and enable U.S. financial markets to operate on-chain. At DC Fintech Week on October 15, the pro-crypto SEC chair emphasized the objective of building a future-proof crypto framework “to actually attract people back into the United States who may have fled.” By jokingly dubbing the SEC a “Securities and Innovation Commission” at the Forum, he signaled the agency’s innovation-friendly agenda. Ultimately, the SEC, led by Atkins, plans to initiate rulemaking around its “innovation exemption” vision by the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on the status of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown .

The proposed legislation was introduced at the 2026 legislative session. The House Bill 183 authorizes the state’s chief financial officer to allocate 10% of public funds into Bitcoin and ETFs. The specific public funds include the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund. NEW: Florida files first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill of the 2026 legislative session. House Bill 183 would allow the state to invest 10% of public funds in digital assets, and permits retirement fund investment. pic.twitter.com/sI4bUBiiB3 — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) October 16, 2025 Further, the state’s retirement system would be subject to similar allocation guidelines, subject to some limitations and conditions. Former Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis already advocated for the state to include Bitcoin in Pension Funds last year. He called Bitcoin “digital gold,” which would help diversify Florida’s portfolio. Strict Custody and Compliance Measures The detailed proposal stipulates stringent custody safeguards, mandating that crypto holdings be managed by the CFO and through qualified custodians. Florida legislators crafted these guardrails to align with federal compliance standards and institutional investment best practices. The legislation, if approved, would allow Floridians to pay certain taxes and fees in digital assets. These payments would then be converted to dollars and sent to the state’s general revenue fund, the proposal read. Besides, the bill clarifies that digital assets are not limited to Bitcoin or tokenized securities, but could also include non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Florida: From Stalling BTC Reserve Plans to Strategic Leap In May, Florida abandoned efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, placing the state alongside Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma, which have recently failed to pass legislation allowing Bitcoin-based investment strategies. The latest bill proposal aligns with similar frameworks enacted by Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas, per tracking platform Bitcoin Laws. Meanwhile, other states are preparing for new sessions in early 2026. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bills. Source: Bitcoin Laws “States are seeking to modernize their balance sheets,” said Julian Fahrer, founder of Bitcoin Laws. The House Bill 183 is awaiting further hearings in the Florida House.

Dogecoin Is Retesting The Support Line Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a pattern forming in Dogecoin’s 12-hour price chart. The pattern in question is an Ascending Channel from TA, a type of Parallel Channel. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Now Control 44% Of Realized Cap, Highest Ever Parallel Channels form whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the pattern provides resistance, while the lower one acts as support. When these trendlines are sloped upward, the Parallel Channel is known as an Ascending Channel. As the asset moves through this channel, its price observes some net growth. Either trendline not holding up can naturally result in a breakout in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it a bearish one. Like the Ascending Channel, there is also a Parallel Channel known as the Descending Channel, emerging when the price witnesses net consolidation to a downside. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Ascending Channel that the 12-hour price of Dogecoin has been moving inside for the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin retested the upper level of the Ascending Channel in September and it ended up finding rejection. Since then, the memecoin has plummeted back toward the lower level situated around $0.19. “$0.19 is mission-critical for DOGE,” noted the analyst. As mentioned before, breakdown of an Ascending Channel support level can signal a bearish continuation. In the event that the support level does end up holding, Dogecoin could see a rebound. Martinez has said that the next stop for the memecoin in this scenario could be $0.33, corresponding to the resistance level of the Ascending Channel. It now remains to be seen how the DOGE price will develop in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests STH Cost Basis Again: Is This Where Support Flips? Earlier, the analyst also shared a chart for another altcoin trading inside a Parallel Channel: XRP. In this case, the 12-hour price of the cryptocurrency is following a Parallel Channel with trendlines parallel to the time-axis. From the graph, it’s visible that XRP has been plunging inside the channel recently and could be heading toward a retest of the lower level, which is situated at $2. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.187, down 24% in the last seven days.

He spoke about the idea in a TV interview and linked the effort to World Liberty Financial and its USD1 stablecoin. Tokenization Tied To World Liberty Financial According to those reports, the effort centers on one specific building now under development. Eric Trump said the minimum stake could start at $1,000, making a slice of a high-value property available to more ordinary investors.

Some tokens could carry perks tied to the property — access to hotel rooms or member benefits was mentioned as an example. But the exact legal setup was not explained. It is unclear whether the tokens will be treated as securities under US law, or if they will be structured as fractional shares, trust interests, or another vehicle. Market Reaction And Expert View Some traders took the move as a sign of growing appetite for tokenized assets, while others urged caution because of legal and liquidity questions. Based on reports, analysts said investor access is attractive, but secondary markets for such tokens may be thin at first. Regulatory And Legal Questions Remain According to sources, US regulators have been watching tokenization closely. Project Crypto at the main regulator has been linked in news coverage to a broader push to sort out rules for tokens tied to real assets. How the Trump family plan will comply with disclosure rules, investor protections, and tax handling has not been spelled out. Those gaps leave open a range of outcomes, from a tightly regulated offering to one that must be reworked to meet US rules.

The price is visibly pressing against the resistance trendline, indicating a point where a decisive move may soon occur.

X Finance Bull stated that if XRP breaks the resistance line, it could alter overall sentiment in a single move, implying that conviction has been lacking but could return swiftly with confirmation. In contrast, Cavalli Vapore argued that technical setups hold little relevance without broader liquidity. He stated that regardless of indicators, market direction continues to follow Bitcoin , asserting that XRP will remain constrained until substantial capital rotation occurs. His position reflects a belief that structural breakouts require macro alignment rather than isolated chart signals. Further skepticism came from GVOCollective, who pointed out repeated instances where XRP approached critical technical levels only for Bitcoin to decline shortly afterward. He referenced recent occurrences where key moments for XRP were overshadowed by wider market pullbacks, reinforcing the argument that correlation remains a dominant force. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Wider Market Performance Context To frame the technical situation within prevailing conditions, recent performance figures show broader weakness. Bitcoin has declined approximately 10% over the past week and 1.69% in the last 24 hours, currently trading near $110,700, according to CoinMarketCap data . XRP has experienced a steeper drop, falling about 16.57% over the week and 3.37% in the past 24 hours. These figures underline the caution expressed by some commentators, who question whether a breakout attempt can sustain momentum amid wider market contraction. Assessing Potential Impact While Block Bull’s chart isolates a key structural point for XRP , the divergence in commentary reflects unresolved sentiment. Bullish analysts remain focused on the technical trigger, suggesting that a confirmed breakout above resistance could restore confidence. Skeptical voices insist that such a movement must coincide with improving liquidity conditions and Bitcoin stabilization to be meaningful.

The 2.2% drop was small, but in a year dominated by trade wars and soaring borrowing costs, Washington considered it a minor win. Treasury officials said the red ink could have been much worse without the unexpected $198 billion September surplus, which set a record for the month. The ratio of deficit to GDP eased to 5.9%, its lowest level since 2022, though still far above the long-term average near 3%. The US government, battered by expensive debt and costly policies, collected just enough cash through tariffs to keep the shortfall from deepening further. Tariffs climb while debt costs explode The federal government took in $202 billion in tariffs for the year, an astonishing 142% surge from 2024. In September alone, the US collected $30 billion, up 295% from a year earlier. Treasury officials credited this to President Donald Trump’s new wave of import tariffs, which targeted everything from Chinese electronics to European steel. The higher duties poured money into federal coffers even as they rattled global trade partners and spooked investors. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that “we’re on our way” to reducing the debt and deficit, pointing to Congressional Budget Office projections showing the deficit-to-GDP ratio finally dipping below 6%. Yet behind those numbers lies the reality of America’s spiraling interest burden. Payments on the national debt hit $1.2 trillion, nearly $100 billion higher than 2024, and the largest ever recorded. When subtracting interest earned on Treasury investments, net interest payments stood at $970 billion, surpassing defense spending by $57 billion and ranking just behind Social Security, Medicare, and health care. The mounting cost of debt now casts a haunting shadow over every budget discussion in Washington. Each uptick in interest rates forces the government to spend more just to service existing loans, leaving less room for public investment or relief measures. Treasury’s Scott said the administration would keep balancing growth plans with debt control, though markets remain skeptical that either can happen quickly. Tariff war hits consumers as public sentiment sours Trump’s decision to slap broad tariffs on US imports earlier this year faced backlash from economists who warned it would lift prices and hurt household budgets. While inflation did rise in tariff-sensitive sectors, such as automobiles and electronics, the jumps have been modest so far. Federal Reserve officials said they might cut rates further, expecting those price pressures to fade. The current federal funds rate now sits between 4.00% and 4.25%, signaling a cautious approach to keep credit affordable. For the fiscal year that ended in September, the US collected $5.2 trillion in revenue while spending just over $7 trillion, leaving the deficit that the Treasury reported this week. Despite that, Americans appear unimpressed. Meanwhile, nine months into Trump’s second term, a Harris poll for the Guardian now shows that 53% of Americans think the economy is getting worse, only slightly better than the 58% recorded in April. About 60% say the cost of living has climbed, and 47% believe the job market has weakened, according to the poll. Only 24% of Republicans think the economy is deteriorating, compared with 60% of independents and 67% of Democrats, but the gloom is spreading even among Trump’s strongest supporters. Roughly half of rural Americans, who backed him 69% to 29% in last year’s election, now feel more pessimistic about the economy than they did in early summer.

This integration will allow users to connect their Solana wallets directly to the Uniswap Web App to trade SOL tokens within the app. Uniswap Adds Solana Support to Its Web App “Until now, Uniswap Web App users had to leave the app to trade on Solana. Now you can access Ethereum, Solana, Unichain, Base, and more networks all in one place,” Uniswap wrote in a blog post published today. The platform stated that this step aims to reduce fragmentation in the DeFi ecosystem. “The separate development of the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems makes the DeFi experience more challenging than it needs to be,” the statement said. “This creates both friction for experienced users and a barrier for beginners.” The Uniswap team announced that the first phase of the Solana integration has been completed, with the next steps being bridging, cross-chain swap, and full integration of the Uniswap Wallet. Solana, which launched in 2020, has become a prominent DeFi network, attracting attention with its high speeds and low transaction fees. According to DefiLlama data, the total value locked (TVL) on Solana exceeded $10.9 billion as of October 2025. This integration is considered a significant step in Uniswap’s vision to expand the multi-chain DeFi experience and offer its users a more seamless cross-chain trading environment. *This is not investment advice.

Its transaction throughput and upgrade proposals are fueling expectations. Remittix makes a different case: not just growth, but a real-world payment utility. This piece outlines how SOL might move and where Remittix could fit as a pragmatic alternative in this evolving market. What Analysts Say About SOL’s Short-Term Path SOL is currently priced around $188, with support around $185 and resistance near $200. If SOL can break above resistance at $200, a bullish breakout at $260 to $270 could occur. The latest forecasts indicate that if momentum and inflows from institutional buyers continue, SOL may also revisit $300. Upgrades and ETF positioning may act as key catalysts for upward moves. Remittix Offers A Different Angle Compared To SOL Remittix diverges from SOL by focusing on usable payments rather than network speculation. Where SOL bets on developer traction and blockchain upgrades, Remittix aims to embed itself in day-to-day cross-border transactions. That gives it a different kind of upside, driven by adoption rather than purely price momentum. The Remittix team is verified by CertiK, ranking it #1 in prelaunch audits. The beta wallet is active, and community testers engage daily. It already secured listings on BitMart and LBank, with a third listing in progress. A 15% USDT referral program allows users to claim rewards every 24 hours, and a $250,000 giveaway fuels engagement. As it nears a $30 million raise, Remittix has reactivated a 50% bonus promotion using code RTX50 ahead of a major listing splash. Remittix has sold over 678 million tokens, raised over $27.5 million, and trades at $0.1166. Here are five strengths that underline Remittix’s appeal: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency One of the few projects with product progress before TGE Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Remittix Stands Out As A Utility Option SOL’s forecast holds both promise and risk: a move beyond $245 to $260 could drive it higher, but resistance might stall gains. In that landscape, Remittix stands out as a top crypto to buy with purpose. Its model prioritizes solving real-world problems, giving it a distinct role beyond speculative altcoins.

Among the best crypto coins to buy, Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have emerged as standout picks, each representing a different side of the innovation spectrum. Solana continues to dominate as one of the most efficient, developer-friendly blockchains in the industry, powering thousands of dApps and DeFi projects with unmatched transaction speed. But while Solana reinforces its legacy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing fresh investor attention as the next major player in decentralized finance. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and $17.45 million raised, Mutuum Finance is drawing headlines as one of the best cryptos to buy now ahead of the next market cycle. For those asking what crypto to buy now or seeking diversification with real upside, Solana and Mutuum Finance stand out as the top cryptocurrencies every smart investor should be watching in Q4 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction: Whale Accumulation Highlighting the Breakout Solana (SOL) is once again demonstrating why it is still one of the top cryptos to watch out for in 2025. Fresh on-chain data shows that more than $169 million in SOL has been taken from exchanges, unequivocal evidence of whale accumulation and long-term faith. After a powerful rebound from the $173 mark and as the RSI goes bullish, Solana’s momentum is increasing towards a probable breakout. Crossing $300 may pave the way towards the $500 region if buying strength continues to build up. As Solana cements its position among the best crypto coins to invest in this quarter, the majority of investors are broadening their horizons, keeping an eye out for up-and-coming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining the same attention going into Q4 2025. Mutuum Finance’s Unshakeable Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is causing ripples in the DeFi market, getting itself listed among the top cryptos to invest in this year. The presale Phase 6 of the project is already underway at $0.035 per coin, an increase of 16.17% from phase 5. Investor interest remains unchecked with just over 17,220 investors investing more than $17.4 million so far. With over 70% of Phase 6 already sold out, Mutuum Finance continues to record high demand from foreign investors, a trend that suggests its growing popularity as a new cryptocurrency with long-term growth potential. Early birds are getting in queue for stratospheric profits when MUTM finally hits the open market, making it one of the top crypto to buy for forward-looking investors. The core design channels protocol revenue back into the token via buy-and-distribute mechanics. Activity from lending and borrowing generates fees; a share of these are used to purchase MUTM on the open market and distribute to mtToken stakers. Because rewards are tied to usage rather than pure emissions, incentives can remain durable as volumes scale. Overcollateralized loans, utilization-based interest rates, and conservative LTVs create the conditions for steady on-chain cash flows that support long-term staking yields. Launch of the Lending and Borrowing Protocol The second milestone in Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is to launch a lending and borrowing protocol , upon which its DeFi platform will be developed. Its V1 version of such functionality will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with lite super features only like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. And via the launch event, users are empowered to collateralize, borrow, and lend USDT and ETH, giving retail and institutional users a fast, secure, and highly scalable DeFi experience. This upcoming protocol strengthens MUTM’s position among top cryptocurrencies offering real-world utility and robust DeFi infrastructure, with many calling it a next big crypto candidate. Daily Leaderboard Update, Rewarding Active Traders Mutuum Finance’s leaderboard is energizing investors with community-incentivized rewards. The No. 1 to No. 5 biggest buyers over the last 24 hours spent $8,860, $8,339, $1,187, $949, and $408 respectively on MUTM tokens, showing growing activity and investor interest. The most active single-day buyer earns a $500 MUTM reward, provided they complete a successful trade within the 24-hour timeframe. This offer not only rewards active presale behavior, but it also codifies the foundation of the project’s community — another reason Mutuum Finance is frequently cited among the best cryptocurrency to invest in lists for new entrants in 2025. Mutuum Finance has received over $17.4 million from 17,220 investors in Phase 6, with more than 70% sold. Its largest daily buys of $8,860 and $8,339 underscore long-term traction and community support. With its lending and borrowing protocol on the cards, MUTM brings innovation, scalability, and real-world DeFi utility, positioning it as one of the best crypto coins to buy today. Alongside Solana, it’s clearly among the top cryptocurrencies for investors seeking high potential in DeFi, making MUTM a standout in the current market of emerging new crypto coin opportunities.

Analysts are watching the $2.8 level as the asset struggles well below that. Without a breakout soon, traders say the risk of further losses grows. Technical signals also show momentum turning lower. Key Resistance Zones in Focus XRP is priced at $2.27 at press time, down 6% in the past 24 hours and over 19% in the last week. The current range puts the token just under two important price levels. One is a previous support near $2.4, which has turned into resistance. The asset has failed to move back above it in recent weeks. Another hurdle is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, placed near $2.8. This level has held as resistance on past attempts. Analyst Lark Davis said, $XRP is facing two major resistances right now – Previous support (yellow line), now acting as resistance – 0.618 Fib right above it Bulls need to punch out a weekly close above ~$2.8 Otherwise, we could see further downside. Watching closely. pic.twitter.com/jjA6rNovQP — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) October 16, 2025 He added that a failure to do so may invite more downside. Moving Averages Show Downside Pressure A bearish crossover has formed on the daily chart. The 50-day moving average (yellow) has dropped below the 100-day (blue). This pattern has appeared three times earlier this year and was followed each time by sharp declines. The most recent was a 46% drawdown. Source: Steph Is Crypto/X XRP remains below both moving averages. The price structure suggests continued weakness unless buyers step in with volume. According to Steph Is Crypto, this marks the fourth bearish cross of the year. Moreover, the MACD line has now moved below its signal line on the weekly chart. Red bars on the histogram are growing, showing increasing downside momentum. Similar moves in the past have led to long periods of lower prices. The RSI has also dropped to 44. That’s under the 50 mark that often separates bullish from bearish territory. It had reached 57 in earlier weeks but has since pulled back. This suggests reduced buyer strength for now. Source: TradingView Support Levels and Broader Moves As CryptoPotato recently reported , if XRP fails to hold above current levels, traders are watching $2.1 as the next support. This zone sits just above the psychological $2 handle. Below that, attention shifts to $1.78. If momentum shifts upward, $2.8 remains the resistance to break. A close above that would improve the price structure and open up $3. Ripple also announced a partnership with Absa Bank in South Africa. The agreement brings Ripple’s custody tech to the institution’s digital asset operations. Separately, Ripple is working with Immunefi to strengthen security on its XRP Ledger lending protocol.

It is a sign that the recent market chaos has not deterred crypto giants from pursuing their business plans to the fullest, according to a report by Bloomberg on Thursday. Ripple will contribute some of its own XRP to the new DAT, according to Bloomberg’s anonymous sources. The company directly holds 4.74 billion XRP worth about $11 billion, and there are almost 36 billion tokens held in escrow, which are scheduled to be released on a monthly basis. In total, the fintech firm controls over 40% of the total XRP supply.

XRP DATs are pretty rare, with only sustainable-energy firm VivoPower International announcing a $121 million fundraising in May to pivot to investing in XRP. Bitcoin and Ether DAT momentum has remained strong despite the recent market rout, with companies such as Tom Lee’s BitMine aggressively buying the dip. BitMine has made two Ether purchases since the weekend leverage flush, adding more than 300,000 ETH to its monster stash. Meanwhile, Strategy acquired 220 BTC for around $27 million earlier this week, bringing its total to a whopping 640,250 BTC worth around $70 billion at current market prices. XRP Price Reaction XRP markets did not react to the news, and the asset has declined 5% on the day in a fall to $2.27 at the time of writing. The payment token fell to its lowest level since early July in late trading earlier today (excluding last Friday’s flash crash to under $1 on some exchanges). It’s now down by almost 40% since the peak marked in mid-July of $3.65.

In just two weeks since launch, mXRP has attracted nearly $30 million in deposits, underscoring the rising investor appetite for $XRP-based yield opportunities and signaling a new wave of adoption for tokenized assets. The milestone highlights growing enthusiasm around RWA tokenization, a rapidly expanding sector at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). Through Midas, mXRP enables users to gain yield exposure to XRP, a cryptocurrency long associated with efficient cross-border payments, while leveraging the security and interoperability of Axelar’s cross-chain infrastructure. mXRP’s rapid growth signals a shift in the digital asset landscape. Investors are favoring yield-bearing, blockchain-backed opportunities over speculative tokens. By integrating XRP liquidity into the Midas ecosystem, users can earn sustainable returns in a decentralized environment, combining real-world asset stability with DeFi flexibility. Therefore, this surge signals a renewed interest in XRP as asset tokenization goes mainstream. With major financial institutions exploring RWA integrations and platforms like Midas streamlining yield access, momentum around XRP-linked assets is set to accelerate. Furthermore, mXRP’s success solidifies Midas as a top RWA player, where transparency, liquidity, and efficiency fuel adoption, while reaffirming XRP’s enduring utility in powering next-generation financial products. XRP Eyes $2.10 Support and $2.80 Resistance Amid Market Pullback Renowned analyst Ali Martinez spots XRP’s next support at $2.10 and resistance at $2.80, as the token dips to $2.27 amid a broader crypto correction after weeks of bullish momentum driven by asset tokenization and the growing RWA sector. XRP’s recent pullback follows a technical cooling period after climbing above $2.50 , driven by profit-taking and short-term momentum loss. Despite this, investor sentiment remains bullish, fueled by growing institutional interest in tokenized assets. Technically, a sustained close above $2.80 could trigger a breakout toward $3.30, revisiting 2017–2018 highs. Conversely, failing to hold $2.10 may open the path to the key $2.00 support. Therefore, XRP’s near-term price will likely be shaped by market sentiment, regulatory clarity, and tokenization momentum. The $2.10–$2.80 range now marks the key battleground for its next major breakout or consolidation. Conclusion mXRP’s record-breaking launch signals soaring investor demand for yield-driven, XRP-backed products. By merging Axelar’s secure cross-chain infrastructure with Midas’ RWA platform, it showcases the rising appeal of tokenized real-world assets and a broader shift toward transparent, high-yield DeFi solutions. Meanwhile, XRP’s $2.10–$2.80 range marks a critical phase: staying above $2.10 could spark a rally, while a break below risks testing investor confidence and driving prices lower.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|AXL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 07:41:51

Key Takeaways: Bitfarms increased its convertible note offering to $500 million, citing strong investor demand. The company plans to use proceeds for general purposes and capped call transactions to limit share dilution. Bitfarms’ stock remains up more than 80% this month amid renewed optimism in Bitcoin mining. In a statement on Thursday , the Nasdaq- and Toronto-listed miner said it will issue 1.375% convertible senior notes due in 2031, with an option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $88 million within 13 days. The offering is expected to close around Oct. 21, pending Toronto Stock Exchange approval. Bitfarms’ $500M Notes Offer 30% Premium Conversion Price, Maturing in 2031 The notes will accrue interest semi-annually starting July 15, 2026, and mature on Jan. 15, 2031. They feature an initial conversion price of roughly $6.86 per share, a 30% premium to Bitfarms’ last closing price of $5.28. Bitfarms said proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and capped call transactions, which are designed to minimize share dilution if the notes are converted. The company operates mining and high-performance computing facilities across North America, supported by a 1.3-gigawatt energy pipeline, with more than 80% of its capacity based in the U.S. Bitfarms’ stock (BIFT) dropped 18.4% to $5.28 on Thursday and slipped another 5.3% in after-hours trading, according to Yahoo Finance data. Despite the pullback, shares remain up more than 80% over the past month, reflecting renewed investor optimism in the Bitcoin mining sector as crypto markets rebound. $BITF Break down of today’s $300M offering in layman’s terms.

It’s a smart move. pic.twitter.com/Ki5ivDJzK1 — James Paul (@dochonda) October 16, 2025 As reported, in May, Bitfarms faced a proposed investor class action after it disclosed plans to restate its 2022 and 2023 financial results. The lawsuit accuses the company of improperly accounting for capital raising transactions and misleading shareholders. The company reportedly failed to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, proceeds from digital asset sales were recorded as operating cash flow rather than investing cash flow. The firm also overstated its remediation of a material weakness tied to warrant transactions. US Lawmaker Calls for National Security Probe Into China-Linked Bitcoin Mining Firms In September, Congressman Zachary Nunn asked the US Treasury to launch a national security review of Chinese firms Bitmain and Cango, citing concerns over their expanding presence in the US crypto mining sector. In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Nunn pointed to opaque ownership structures, potential state ties, and risks to national infrastructure as grounds for a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigation. Bitmain, which dominates over 80% of the global Bitcoin mining hardware market, and Nasdaq-listed Cango have both denied any merger plans. Still, Nunn raised alarms over their growth strategies in the US, complex financing arrangements, and possible involvement in US energy infrastructure. His concerns follow a $300 million equipment deal between Bitmain’s US arm and a Trump-linked mining firm. Both companies have stated they comply with US laws and have no ties to foreign governments.

The move aligns with the asset manager’s strategy of capitalizing on the growing demand for compliant, liquid, and transparent reserve options among digital payment companies. The asset manager updated the BlackRock Select Treasury-Based Liquidity Fund (BSTBL) to comply with the GENIUS Act. BlackRock positions BSTBL as the go-to fund for stablecoin reserves BlackRock will make its BSTBL the main destination for stablecoin companies to store the reserves backing their digital tokens. It has increased the amount of short-term U.S. Treasuries in the fund because these government-backed assets are the safest and most easily convertible into cash when needed. The company also removed agency investments and added overnight repurchase agreements, so the fund can quickly move money in and out through short-term lending and borrowing. These significant changes will ensure that the money is always readily available when a stablecoin issuer needs to redeem tokens or handle large cash movements. The daily trading deadline for the fund will be extended from 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, providing companies and investors in various time zones with additional time to complete their transactions. People will also be able to balance their cash positions and respond to market changes quickly. BlackRock’s global head of product and platform for cash management, Jon Steel, said these updates are a direct response to the growing number of stablecoin companies seeking trusted and compliant ways to store their reserves. The GENIUS Act requires companies that issue stablecoins to maintain strong and transparent reserves and undergo regular audits to demonstrate that they have sufficient assets to back every token they issue. Steel said the redesign makes BackRock one of the top choices for stablecoin issuers who need both safety and flexibility. The investment company’s updated BSTBL fund demonstrates how the worlds of traditional and digital finance are gradually converging. The company’s major change provides stablecoin issuers with a secure place to store their reserves, assuring regulators that reputable companies are managing these funds. BlackRock expands digital asset strategy with tokenization and partnerships The asset manager is already working with one of the largest stablecoin issuers, Circle , and also operates BUIDL (a tokenized money market fund that utilizes blockchain to record ownership). Additionally, the company manages the largest Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States. The giant’s CEO, Larry Fink, stated that tokenization can reduce the need for intermediaries, lower costs, and increase transaction transparency. He told investors that the company sees significant commercial opportunities in utilizing tokenization to bridge the gap between traditional and digital markets. Fink says there is already more than $4.5 trillion worth of assets sitting in digital wallets, so it is essential for a company like BlackRock to develop safe, regulated methods for that money to move and grow. The total stablecoin supply worldwide is approximately $300 billion, and Citi analysts estimate it could grow to $4 trillion by 2030, in the most optimistic scenario. Analysts at TD Cowen also believe the value of tokenized assets could exceed $100 trillion within five years. BlackRock is creating products for both traditional institutions and crypto-native companies in its BSTBL fund and its BUIDL tokenized fund. The firm is developing a model that is likely to be imitated by other major organizations in finance, and stablecoin issuers can already utilize BSTBL to maintain their reserves in safe, short-term U.S. Treasuries while complying with the GENIUS Act . Digital-savvy investors can also utilize tokenized funds to manage their assets in real-time. The market is starting to gain confidence now that laws like the GENIUS Act provide clear rules, and companies like BlackRock are stepping in to build compliant solutions. The asset manager’s involvement demonstrates that digital assets can coexist safely within the existing financial system, rather than being outside of it.

This aligns with the Trump administration’s push to bring blockchain development back to the U.S. Superapps and Regulatory Streamlining Atkins endorsed superapps, platforms merging payments, investing, and banking, common in Asia. He urged digital coordination with agencies like the CFTC to simplify oversight. These changes aim to address fragmented rules, though no launch timeline was shared.

According to an X thread published by the Ethereum Foundation on Wednesday, Ethereum is well ahead of competitors Solana and Bitcoin in terms of cumulative developer participation this year. Electric Capital’s analysis leading up to September, based on GitHub data, shows that the Ethereum ecosystem hosts 31,869 active developers. Solana ranks second, recording more than 11,500 new developers within the same nine-month period, while Bitcoin followed with nearly 7,500 new contributors. Developers prefer Ethereum According to Electric Capital’s cumulative monthly trend chart, Solana’s developer base now totals 17,708, while Bitcoin’s stands at 11,036. Other ecosystems, such as Polygon, Stacks, Sui, Internet Computer, BNB Chain, Stellar, and Aptos, trail below 7,000 developers. 3/ In 2025, Ethereum is still home to the largest developer ecosystem of any blockchain. pic.twitter.com/gezmiOmEyX — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) October 15, 2025 However, Jacob Creech, the head of developer relations at the Solana Foundation, argued that Electric Capital’s data underreports Solana developers by about 7,800. Creech took to X on Thursday to ask contributors to submit their GitHub repositories for Solana’s internal crawlers to capture complete developer activity. “The data here is unfortunately out of date, Electric Capital’s data misses many of our repositories … If you’re building on Solana, please also submit your repos so that EC has the most up-to-date information on Solana,” the developer relations head remarked. Electric Capital’s dataset accounts for new developers who made their first-ever code commit to a blockchain ecosystem in 2025. In the context of Ethereum, this encompasses the layer-1 network and all layer-2 rollups, as defined by L2Beat, including Arbitrum, Optimism, and Unichain. Developers are counted once per parent ecosystem, even if they contribute to several sub-projects, to avoid duplication. Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak said the classification of ecosystems should consider technological overlap among chains that share similar architectures. “EVM chains should be grouped together,” Stańczak continued, “Developers on Polygon and BNB clearly can reuse the majority of skills and EVM tooling. It would also appreciate Starknet’s efforts in building the great CairoVM developer community by showing their growth. I can imagine an extended grouping that adds all non-EVM L2 because of ecosystem interoperability.” Developer growth rate cools on Ethereum Ethereum may be the dominant network by absolute numbers, but its developer growth rate has slowed down in the last 10 months compared to newer chains. Full-time developers in the Ethereum ecosystem increased by just 5.8% over the past year and 6.3% over two years, according to Electric Capital’s datasets. Solana posted a 29.1% increase in the past year and a 61.7% surge over the last two years, by contrast, the fastest expansion among major blockchain ecosystems. According to the Protocol Guild, which represents Ethereum core contributors, the median annual salary for an Ethereum core developer is about $140,000, nearly 50% to 60% below market rates. Comparable private-sector blockchain roles average $359,000, the group reported . The pay gap has prompted some developers to consider leaving for commercial opportunities. One unnamed Ethereum contributor reportedly turned down a $700,000 compensation package to continue working on Ethereum’s open-source infrastructure. Numbers compared with Chainspect analysis One social media user, going by the handle memevsculture on X, questioned the validity of developer data, noting a gap between reported developer counts and visible app availability. Alongside its growing developer base, the Ethereum Foundation (EF) recently deployed 2,400 ETH, valued at approximately $9.6 million, and about $6 million worth of stablecoins into a yield-bearing Morpho vault, according to a Wednesday announcement. “Morpho is a pioneer in permissionless DeFi protocols and consistently demonstrates a commitment to Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) principles,” EF wrote on X. The foundation said both Morpho Vault v2 and Morpho Blue v1 were released under the GPL2.0 license, in tandem with Ethereum’s open-source ethos.

Despite reports of major holders unloading hundreds of millions of ADA, other large investors appear to be buying the dip, signaling renewed confidence ahead of the October 23 Grayscale ADA ETF decision and next month’s Cardano Summit in Berlin. Whales Return as Analysts Target $1 Recovery After falling from $0.80 during the broader crypto correction, ADA has entered a consolidation range between $0.65 and $0.70. On-chain data reveals conflicting whale behavior, some large holders sold over 350 million ADA in a week, while others accumulated 140–200 million tokens worth roughly $100–$140 million. The renewed buying helped ADA rebound by more than 2% in 24 hours, lifting it back toward the key $0.70 level. Crypto analyst MMBTrader said ADA continues to defend higher-timeframe support and could be “ready for its next leg up past $1.” Similarly, market strategist Javon Marks projected that once ADA breaks through near-term resistance at $0.74–$0.80, momentum could accelerate toward $1.20–$1.60, with extensions to $2 possible if sentiment strengthens. $0.74 Cardano (ADA) Resistance in Focus On the 4-hour chart, Cardano is shaping a falling wedge pattern, a structure often preceding bullish reversals. Immediate support rests at $0.65, while $0.74 acts as the first major resistance. A decisive breakout above $0.74 could trigger moves toward $0.80–$0.86, aligning with the 50-day exponential moving average. Technical indicators show mixed signals as the RSI at 37 suggests ADA is approaching oversold territory, while Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at over 0.13 hints at light inflows returning. Analysts warn that failure to hold $0.65 may open a retest of $0.60–$0.62, last seen during June’s correction. Ecosystem Growth and Institutional Watch Beyond ADA price action, Cardano’s fundamentals continue to develop. The network’s DeFi TVL remains subdued at $288 million, but new staking options through eToro’s U.S. launch and ongoing ecosystem projects like Midnight and Leios have drawn optimism from long-term investors. With ETF speculation, whale accumulation, and growing institutional accessibility, analysts argue that ADA may be building a base for recovery into Q4. A clear move above $0.74 could confirm a bullish reversal and set the stage for a test of the $1 mark, while failure to defend $0.65 would extend consolidation.

Tom Lee Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-the-crypto-treasury-bubble-burst-tom-lee-thinks-so/,"BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, has shared his perspective on the recent surge of crypto-focused treasury companies and the future of this multi-billion-dollar trend. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For ‘Rapid Expansion’ As Price Holds $3,900 Support – 30% Rally Coming? Crypto DATs Bubble Already Burst On Thursday, BitMine’s Chairman Thomas “Tom” Lee joined Fortune’s Crypto Playbook Podcast to discuss the surge of Digital Assets Treasury (DAT) companies and why he thinks the bubble surrounding these vehicles may have already burst. Discussing the need for this alternative type to get exposure to crypto assets, Lee argued that DATS “are not just passive vehicles,” and properly executed companies will get capital and be supported by investors. He noted that companies like Strategy and BitMine, the two largest crypto treasuries in the world, both see several billion dollars of daily trading volume, adding that “the two companies combined are 86% of all trading volume for the DATs.” Lee was also asked about the argument that the trend is creating a potential bubble. Fortune’s senior crypto analysts questioned whether the bubble might burst and have a negative impact now that there are hundreds of DATs in the market. He affirmed that the bubble has likely already burst, at least to some capacity, and argued that around 80% of these firms are trading below the net value of their underlying assets. “If that’s not already a bubble burst (…), how would that bubble burst?” Nonetheless, BitMine’s chair explained that instead of questioning if a bubble has burst, he prefers asking if the market has become discerning, which he thinks it already has. BitMine, Not ‘Just’ A DAT? Lee argued that, while other crypto treasuries have not been creators of shareholder value, BitMine is “not just a DAT,” but also the largest holder of Ethereum (ETH) in the world. Notably, BitMine is a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network Company with a focus on accumulating crypto for long-term investment. The company aims to own 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, currently holding 3.03 million ETH tokens, or over 2.5% of the total supply. According to Lee, this gives BitMine multiple roles, including providing a significant amount of security to the Ethereum network. Based on these roles, he considers the company is “essentially a liaison between how Wall Street views future upgrades to Ethereum, to the community.” “So we’re not just a DAT. We’re becoming, you know, one of the important voices within Ethereum, and that really was our goal. You know, that’s why, when BitMine was created,” he said. Adding to his argument, Lee has previously asserted that the company is confident that the two “Supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto,” which will “play out over decades.” Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) ‘Uptober’ Rally On Pause Until This Level Is Reclaimed As a result, he considers that “Ethereum remains the premier choice given its high reliability and 100% uptime.” During the Podcast, BitMine’s chairman reaffirmed this stance, stating: “The tokenization of everything else, (…), is in the quadrillions. You know, especially as AI moves towards micro payments, which need to happen on the blockchain. That to me is a bigger opportunity, and (…) Ethereum is where a lot of this is going to be built. (…) So to me, there’s still an exponential opportunity in owning ETH over Bitcoin,” Lee concluded.

The caption read, “‘Get up’ energy only! Get up, stack conviction. XRP isn’t a vibe, it’s a mission. @bgarlinghouse kept building when the room was loud.” The light tone of the post immediately drew the attention of the XRP army, as it celebrates not just the company’s leadership but the resilience many in the community associate with the digital asset’s long journey through various challenges . “Get up” energy only!

The company’s ongoing expansion into international payment systems and institutional partnerships has been a focus for its supporters, many of whom view XRP not only as a cryptocurrency but as a central component of Ripple’s vision for faster and more efficient financial infrastructure. The phrase “it’s a mission” in the post resonates with that sentiment, reflecting the belief among many holders that XRP represents a purposeful movement rather than a passing trend. The video’s upbeat tone and direct call to “get up” mirror that forward-looking spirit, reminding the community of the resilience that has characterized XRP’s growth over the years.

Others said they planned to add the track used in the clip to their playlists, with one user stating that it should be played when XRP hits a new all-time high. The post refreshing break from the usual market chatter, capturing the enthusiasm surrounding XRP in a fun, relatable way. A few even compared it to previous viral moments within the crypto scene, calling it one of the best uses of generative AI.

""It Will Be the Biggest One Yet!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ripple-labs-announces-new-1-billion-xrp-move-it-will-be-the-biggest-one-yet/,"Ripple Labs will lead a fundraising effort of at least $1 billion aimed at establishing a new digital asset treasury to accumulate XRP, Bloomberg reported. According to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the matter, the fundraising will be carried out through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Ripple will transfer its XRP assets to this company. Ripple has not made an official statement on the matter. The report stated that the transaction terms are still under negotiation. If the fundraising, which targets at least $1 billion, is successfully completed, it will create the largest XRP-based Digital Asset Treasury to date. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to dominate the cryptocurrency market in 2025, particularly regarding institutional adoption and DATs, XRP has seen significantly less interest as a base asset for DATs. However, this move is expected to boost interest in XRP. Ripple currently holds 4.74 billion XRP (about $11 billion) in its wallets, with an additional 35.9 billion XRP held in an escrow account that is scheduled to be released monthly. Despite the sharp declines, Ripple continues its aggressive market moves, announcing on the same day that it will acquire corporate treasury management software provider GTreasury for $1 billion. The company described the acquisition as a strategic move to help corporate treasury managers access digital assets like tokenized deposits and stablecoins. XRP ranks fifth among global cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of $138.9 billion. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.31, down 4.4% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ripple Labs Announces New $1 Billion XRP Move!

Bitcoin led the adverse charge, with a nosedive toward $105,000 as of press time, which is a multi-month low on multiple exchanges. The altcoins follow suit in an even more painful manner. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that bitcoin had recovered a lot of ground following last week’s calamity and even challenged $116,000 earlier this week. However, it faced an immediate and strong rejection at that point, which pushed it south to the crucial resistance at $110,000. Although that line held at first, the bears were a lot more persistent and drove the asset below it yesterday evening. That was just the start of yet another deeper correction, however. In the past several hours, BTC has registered another leg down and is close to breaking below $105,000, which is the first line of defense, according to some analysts. The next such buying wall is formed at around $100,000. Other market observers have turned completely bearish on the asset. Captain Faibik claimed that the 2024/2025 bull run is over, and they expect a 50% correction in the midterm. Naturally, the altcoins are getting obliterated in such occasions. Binance Coin, for example, which set a new all-time high just days ago, has plunged by over 12% in the past 24 hours to under $1,050 as of press time. ETH is down by more than 6%, XRP’s losses exceed 7%, and the landscape with the lower caps is even more painful. “Altcoins are under pressure as liquidity continues to rotate back into Bitcoin and stablecoins amid risk-off sentiment. This latest dip reflects declining speculative appetite after last week’s macro data, thin order books amplifying volatility, and renewed uncertainty around regulatory headlines impacting smaller-cap tokens,” said Wenny C, COO at SynFutures, in a statement to CryptoPotato. The crash in the past 24 hours has impacted over-leveraged traders once again, with almost 290,000 such market participants getting wrecked.

Insiders recommend a $0.035 DeFi coin,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/17/what-crypto-to-buy-before-year-end-insiders-recommend-a-0-035-defi-coin/,"The crypto market is showing signs of life again. Bitcoin and Ethereum have both found stability after months of swings. But the real action this year is not coming from big names. It’s coming from new cryptocurrency projects that are still in presale. One new crypto coin drawing strong attention from analysts and early investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . For investors still deciding what crypto to buy now before year end, MUTM’s sub-$0.05 pricing and clear roadmap stand out. MUTM stands out because it is still priced at just $0.035, yet insiders expect it to reach around $0.06 to $0.07 before the first quarter of 2026. That would nearly double from the current level. The project has already attracted more than 17,300 holders and raised about $17.42 million. Phase 6 of the presale is now 68% complete, and the next stage will move the price to $0.04 — a 15% increase. Many investors believe Phase 6 may close within days, making this one of the last chances to enter before listing. A new DeFi platform with real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a full DeFi lending and borrowing system. It will first launch on the upcoming Sepolia Testnet in the last quarter of 2025. The platform will feature smart contracts that manage loans, liquidity pools, and interest rate changes automatically. Users will be able to deposit assets like ETH or USDT and borrow against them. Lenders will supply funds to pools using stablecoins or well-known tokens such as SOL, BTC, and ETH. These lenders will receive mtTokens in return, which represent their share of the pool and include their earned interest. For example, someone lending $10,000 in USDT may see their balance grow with dynamic rates as pool usage rises. Borrowers, on the other hand, will post their crypto as collateral. Each loan will be overcollateralized, meaning the borrower always keeps more value in reserve than they borrow. This design keeps the system safe and fair. Borrowers will repay loans with interest, while lenders enjoy steady earnings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also support a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Here, users can lend or borrow riskier tokens such as SHIB or PEPE. These deals come with custom terms and higher returns. The addition of lending and borrowing capabilities enhances the platform’s practical appeal and is set to attract a larger community of users. In the near term, users will gain access to options for lending, borrowing, and staking their assets within designated pools to earn rewards. Since these activities rely on MUTM, the growing on-chain demand is anticipated to play a pivotal role in driving the token’s long-term value upward. The project’s dashboard and leaderboard are already live, helping users track positions and get rewards in real time for their investment. A new update has been implemented for the 24-hour leaderboard. Every day, the user who reaches the top rank will earn a $500 MUTM reward, provided they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard automatically resets each day at 00:00 UTC. Why insiders expect a strong year-end move Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is different from many presales because its platform and token will launch together. That means real use from day one. When the beta version goes live, it will already include lending, borrowing, and staking. Every transaction on the platform will create natural demand for the MUTM token — a key reason some analysts place it among the best cryptocurrency to invest in lists and even flag it as one of the best crypto to buy now into 2026. This testnet phase allows users to try out the core features before the official launch. It helps them understand how the system works while building trust in the project. As more users engage and share positive feedback, the platform is expected to attract stronger investor attention, potentially driving higher demand and boosting the token’s value. A key part of its growth plan is the future buy-and-distribute system. Revenue from lending and borrowing will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These bought tokens will then be shared with users who stake mtTokens. This continuous buyback cycle increases the reward flow to stakers and keeps interest high in the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also expand into a decentralized stablecoin system in later stages. Users will be able to mint a $1-pegged coin by locking assets like ETH or SOL. When they repay or close positions, that coin will be burned. Each minting and burning event will boost the utility and demand for MUTM across the network. Investment case and community giveaways To see how early investors have already benefited, take this example. Someone who invested $5,000 in Phase 1 when MUTM was $0.01 received 500,000 tokens. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that position is now valued at $17,500 — a 250% value gain even before the listing. With analysts projecting a rise to $0.07 by early 2026, that same investment grows to $35,000, marking a 600% total return. Even new buyers entering now at $0.035 can expect a strong upside. Once the price moves to $0.07, their position doubles. This growth is supported by the project’s real utility and its upcoming testnet release. The excitement around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also powered by community rewards. A $100,000 giveaway is running, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Alongside that, a $50,000 bug bounty encourages developers to review and improve system security before launch. These programs show that the team values both safety and engagement. Final words Investors who keep an eye on crypto charts can see that DeFi tokens are gaining traction again. Traders looking for top cryptocurrencies under $1 as year-end approaches are gravitating toward projects with working products and near-term catalysts. After Phase 6, the price steps up 15% in the next stage — and Phase 6 is selling quickly. Many see this as one of the last opportunities before an exchange listing. For anyone investing in crypto this year, the numbers are straightforward: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends clear growth goals, real utility, and community power — a credible next big crypto contender to hold into 2026.

53268506,https://invezz.com/?p=2930249,1760692064,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Bitcoin miner Bitfarms upsizes debt offering to $500M to scale AI ambitions,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/17/bitcoin-miner-bitfarms-upsizes-debt-offering-to-500m-to-scale-ai-ambitions/,"Bitcoin mining company Bitfarms Ltd. has upsized its convertible note offering to $500 million as it plans to ramp up investment in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing infrastructure. The North American crypto miner initially proposed raising $300 million through convertible senior notes due in 2031, but expanded the offering to $500 million just a day later, according to a statement issued on October 16. Bitfarms also granted initial purchasers the option to buy an additional $88 million worth of notes within a 13-day window, potentially raising the total to $588 million if fully exercised. The offering is expected to close around October 21, pending approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange. According to the announcement, the convertible notes will accrue interest semi-annually beginning July 15, 2026, and mature on January 15, 2031. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that may be repurchased, redeemed, or converted under specified conditions. Investors will be able to convert the notes at an initial rate of 145.6876 common shares per $1,000 principal, implying a conversion price of approximately $6.86 per share, a 30% premium over the closing price on October 16. As part of the raise, the company also entered into capped call transactions with financial institutions to mitigate potential equity dilution from conversions. These privately negotiated instruments cover the number of shares underlying the notes, with a cap price of $11.88 per share, roughly 125% above Bitfarms’ market value at the time of pricing. Bitfarms intends to fund the capped call costs using proceeds from the offering or existing cash reserves. Bitfarms to scale AI infrastructure Proceeds from the offering are primarily earmarked for corporate purposes as well as for scaling its infrastructure footprint for AI and high-performance computing workloads. According to the company, the offering is an “opportunistic capital raise,” as over the past year, Bitfarms has made significant progress in pivoting toward AI infrastructure. Earlier this year, it secured up to $300 million in private debt financing from Macquarie Equipment Capital to fund its Panther Creek data centre campus in Pennsylvania. Located less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia, the facility is expected to attract high-performance computing tenants and serve as a cornerstone of the company’s expansion into the AI and data centre market. At the time, Bitfarms had just completed its acquisition of Stronghold Digital Mining through a stock-for-stock merger, which added two power campuses in Pennsylvania to Bitfarms’ portfolio. Simultaneously, Bitfarms announced plans to exit the Argentine market to focus on its US expansion . The company has since submitted a master site plan for its Pennsylvania campus, with efforts now focused on building out the facility to accommodate large-scale AI workloads. Bitfarms operates over 461 megawatts of capacity and maintains a 1.3 gigawatt energy pipeline, more than 80% of which is based in the United States, putting it in a strong position to serve growing demand for AI computing. Bitfarms shares fall Following the announcement of the initial $300 million convertible note offering, Bitfarms’ stock fell sharply, dropping over 18% to close at $5.28 on Thursday. Even during this pullback, Bitfarm stocks remain significantly higher on longer timeframes. Bitfarms shares have surged more than 530% since April. Over the course of this year, Bitfarms has posted strong top-line growth despite margin pressures stemming from the April 2024 bitcoin halving. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue climbed 33% year-over-year to $67 million. Meanwhile, in the second quarter, Bitfarms reported revenue of $78 million, which marked an 87% gain from the same period in 2024.

The increase in liquidity comes amid a volatile week marked by sharp corrections and renewed optimism for a late-October rebound. Liquidity Returns as BTC Goes Down to $105K Data shared by analyst Arab Chain revealed that Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average of trading volume has risen to about $3.68 billion, according to Binance figures, the strongest level in seven months. However, the rise comes at a time when the price of BTC is declining, with the asset trading at $104,900 at the time of this writing. Still, the improving volume points to an influx of large traders gradually re-entering the market, with observers suggesting the behavior could mark a potential reaccumulation phase, where professional investors rebuild positions after recent price drops. On October 10, the OG crypto saw more than $17,000 shaved off its price when it nosedived from $122,000 to about $105,000 after the U.S. and China crossed swords over new tariffs. On some exchanges, it went further south to $101,000. That particular incident saw traders lose as much as $19 billion worth of leveraged positions, although a subsequent report by market technician Carmelo Alemán placed the actual losses at a much more modest $2.31 billion. BTC did recover from the storm, going to about $116,000, before a series of dips pushed it back down to its current level just below $105,000. It also triggered another wave of liquidations, with nearly 300,000 traders seeing positions worth approximately $$1.1 billion closed out. Analysis from CryptoQuant attributed some of the short-term weakness in the market to Binance-led selling pressure, noting a negative funding rate persisting for four consecutive days. Despite this, U.S.-based buying activity remains firm, reflected in a positive Coinbase Premium, suggesting strong spot demand that may offset futures-driven selling. Bullish Backdrop and Technical Foundations Despite recent pressure, the underlying market structure for Bitcoin remains positive. A technical perspective shared by market observer Axel Adler Jr. identified the $106,000 to $107,000 range as a major support zone, with a breach potentially leading to a test of the $100,000 level. According to him, as long as this foundation holds, the broader bullish trend is considered intact. The flagship crypto has declined 4% in the last 24 hours and 12% over the past week, even though it maintains a 58% gain over the preceding year. Historically, October has been a strong month for BTC, with a recurring seasonal pattern known as “Uptober” often seeing its most powerful gains in the latter half. CryptoQuant data indicates that exchange reserves typically shrink during this period as investors move coins into long-term storage, tightening supply and setting the stage for potential rallies.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is also trading below $3,800 after losing 7% of its value in the last 24 hours. The market could continue its massive sell-off in the near term as there is no macroeconomic relief on the horizon. ETH dips below $3,800 as spot Ethereum ETFs record massive outflow Ether is down 7% in the last 24 hours and is now trading below $3,800 per coin. The negative performance comes as spot Ethereum ETFs recorded over $56 million in outflows on Thursday. The outflows came as institutional investors are taking a cautious approach to the market. Market sentiment remains a bit sour at the moment, with investors expecting further bearish price action in the near term. The Federal Reserve will meet later this month to discuss whether it will keep interest rates unchanged or cut by 25 basis points as widely expected. However, due to a lack of economic data in the last three weeks, the Fed could postpone that rate cut, a move that would negatively affect the prices of Bitcoin, Ether, and other major cryptocurrencies. The dip could occur before the FOMC meeting if the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, hints at the possibility publicly. ETH could drop below $3,500 as bears remain in control The ETH/USD 4H Chart remains bearish and efficient after facing rejection from the daily resistance level at $4,232 earlier this week. The rejection level coincides with its 50-day EMA and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,710 and could record further losses in the near term. If the pullback continues, ETH could extend its decline towards the Friday low of $3,506. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum’s RSI and MACD indicators are extremely bearish. However, if ETH recovers, it could rally towards the Monday high of $4,232 before attempting to hit the $4,500 psychological level. Ether’s 4-H RSI has dropped below the 14-day exponential moving average (EMA), suggesting a change in the direction of the coin’s price trend. The last two times this crossover occurred, ETH dipped by 49% and 63% after hitting the $4,100 threshold twice. In both scenarios, ETH dipped to or below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). If that happens now, Ether could experience a massive drop to $2,500 in the mid-term, representing a 35% drop from its current price. Regardless, the Friday low of $3,500 could serve as a strong support in the near term and allow Ether to bounce back. The general trend of the market remains bearish, with traders recording heavy losses over the past few hours. Recent data revealed that traders lost over $250 million worth of leveraged positions in the last 60 minutes.

Fund flow data highlights this resurgence, with smaller wallets contributing $368 million+, outpacing larger players and signaling renewed retail confidence. Derivative metrics, including a 3.3–3.5 Long/Short ratio, suggest bulls remain in control, though overexposure could trigger short-term shakeouts. If ADA manages to break through the $0.72 resistance, the next key target sits near $0.99, potentially drawing in more liquidity, though sellers may defend this level before the next leg up. While Cardano demonstrates impressive momentum, many investors are also exploring emerging Mutuum Finance (MUTM), keeping an eye on the next-generation DeFi projects poised to make an impact in 2025 as they weigh which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning.

Zhao believes DAT companies should use a custodian to store their crypto as a precaution. Binance’s founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao said digital asset treasury (DAT) companies should use third-party custodians for their crypto. The statement came in response to the recent case of QMMM, one of the early treasury companies. The firm reportedly disappeared after the initial stock rally. All DAT companies should use 3rd party crypto custodians with account setup audited by investors. This is a prerequisite for any @yzilabs investments in any #BNB DATs. https://t.co/POsFWZqoJG — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 17, 2025 Zhao has paid special attention to BNB companies, with Binance standing as a potential partner and custodian for those buyers. As Cryptopolitan reported , QMMM gained the spotlight recently after its stock trading was suspended, following a 959% appreciation. The stock was suspended following accusations that the Hong Kong-based, US-listed company was using social media to manipulate the asset price. QMMM closes offices, disappears QMMM is the first DAT company to fold, even before announcing any actual purchases. QMMM planned to raise up to $100M for a multi-asset strategy, focusing on BTC, ETH, and SOL. The company promoted itself on Reddit, which was also noted by the US SEC as potential manipulation. The QMMM stock rally also caused liquidations when traders attempted to short the company due to its risky profile. The unusual rally wiped out those short positions, leading to additional losses. At the peak, QMMM was valued at $990M. QMMM had an anomalous rally before its trading was suspended, causing additional short liquidations. | Source: TradingView . There is no direct data on whether QMMM managed to buy any crypto. The company’s latest round placed $8M in public shares, without outlining any intended crypto purchases. Before that, the company held a $8.6M IPO in early 2024. QMMM moved in during the peak euphoria stage of DAT companies, but so far only managed a brief rally of its stock over $300. Later, the stock fell to $119, when all trading was frozen. QMMM disappeared in September Based on local reports, QMMM may have emptied out its Hong Kong offices in September. At that time, the company was already making claims to pouring $100M into crypto, with no further evidence. The company was headed by Kwai Bun, a Hong Kong native with reality TV fame. It went public in 2024 at $4 per share, later riding the wave of the DAT companies hype. The disappearance of the company from its offices coincided with the trading halt in the USA, as some suggested QMMM intended to cash out through the hype phase. According to other sources, the DAT company bubble may have burst, as there are no longer cases of stocks trading at a premium. The weakening prices of BTC, ETH , SOL and other assets are also leading to increased scrutiny for the DAT model. Some DAT companies also post their transparent reserves, while others claim hiding their wallets is for security reasons. Altcoin DAT companies are considered riskier, especially if they are not buying the tokens on the open market. According to Tom Lee, CEO of BitMine, the DAT bubble has burst, as most companies trade below the value of their crypto treasuries. However, some companies continue buying, showing long-term confidence or intending to use their treasury for staking and passive income.

The renewed activity has sparked optimism among analysts who believe the token might soon rise back to $4,500. Blockchain data shows that institutional investors are purchasing the dip, indicating long-term faith despite short-term price weakness. BitMine Immersion Technologies has been at the forefront of this accumulation wave with hundreds of thousands of new ETH added to its balance sheet. Analysts noted that the move reflects increasing belief that Ethereum is undervalued. Meanwhile, another Ethereum-based project, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is attracting attention with its verified security and growing whale activity to show similar accumulation behavior in the broader market.

The move brought the firm’s total holdings to 3.03 million ETH, roughly 2.5% of the total supply of Ethereum. According to the company chairman, Tom Lee, the acquisition represented the “halfway point” toward BitMine’s goal of owning 5% of total supply. Analysts take this as a strong signal that large institutions view current levels as undervalued. On-chain data supports this narrative. Blockchain trackers recorded wallet balances for addresses holding over 10,000 ETH, climbing by over 4% month-over-month, showing a wide accumulation trend. Large holders have added about 150,000 ETH combined since mid-October, which is equivalent to about $603 million at current prices. Exchange flows also support growing buying pressure. The Exchange Net Position Change metric fell from -1.55 million ETH on October 10 to -1.94 million ETH five days later, implying that more coins were leaving exchanges than were entering. Historically, such sustained outflows are a sign of growing confidence as investors shift to cold storage for long-term holding. Source: GlassNode Analysts believe Ethereum’s consolidation phase is coming to an end. The asset is trading around $4100, which forms a clear bullish Flag pattern on the weekly time frame. This structure is often preceded by strong upward continuation after accumulation phases. Source: X Technical analysts speculate that a clean breakout above $4,300 could send ETH swiftly toward $4,500, and beyond $5,700 if momentum gains speed. Support is firm at $3,800, and in this zone, it must hold to maintain the bullish setup. Traders point out that the higher lows on Ethereum suggest controlled market behavior and confidence of long-term participants. If volume increases during the breakout, the move might validate the flag pattern, and the next part of the rally is confirmed. On-chain momentum indicators are also in line with this view, with renewed inflows into self-custody wallets as whales pile up. Institutional Confidence Strengthens Ethereum’s Outlook BitMine’s buying spree has solidified the idea that institutional investors still view Ethereum as a core digital asset. Despite losing almost 20% of its value since August, institutional conviction has not wavered. Experts explain that while retail traders enjoy exiting during corrections, professional investors are often buying strategically. Entities such as BitMine view market dips as chances to expand their exposure. This difference between short-term speculation and institutional positioning speaks volumes to the maturing nature of the Ethereum market. Moreover, developer activity is high. Ethereum remains a leader in the blockchain sector with over 31,000 active developers, almost twice the number of Solana. The expansion of decentralized finance and layer 2 networks has ensured a high level of demand on-chain and deep liquidity, both of which are conducive to a sustainable price base. MAGACOIN FINANCE Whale Activity Mirrors Institutional Accumulation On-chain monitoring tools reveal that large wallets linked to MAGACOIN FINANCE have also begun showing steady accumulation. Analysts note that this behavior mirrors institutional entry patterns seen during early stages of major bull cycles. Whales appear to be quietly building positions in anticipation of stronger momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s emphasis on transparency and security continues to attract serious investors. The project has undergone multiple independent audits, including by Hashdex, confirming the integrity of its smart contracts and operational systems. These reports verified key areas such as contract reliability, transaction stability, and resistance to exploits. Analysts believe this security-first approach sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from unverified altcoin projects. Its commitment to audited safety has reinforced investor confidence and aligns with broader trends favoring verifiable, compliant crypto initiatives. Conclusion Ethereum’s whale accumulation marks a pivotal shift in sentiment. Institutional buyers are returning, and on-chain data points to renewed confidence ahead of a potential breakout. With BitMine leading large-scale accumulation and technical indicators hinting at strength, analysts expect Ethereum to retest $4,500 soon. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rising whale interest and verified transparency highlight how security and trust are becoming central themes in the next growth phase of the crypto market.

Despite this, though, the altcoin is still not out of the woods, with bearish indicators that seem to be piling up around it. Unless something changes soon, the Solana price could be gearing up for another major hit that could send it down even lower than the legendary flash crash. Friday’s Crash Was Only Confirmation Of Bearish Pattern For Solana Price While the broader market thinks that the October 10 crash has come and gone, leaving the market in a more bullish state, one analyst deviates from this and believes that this has actually set the Solana price on a more bearish path to more declines. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals The Chances Of The XRP Price Rallying 300% To $9 This Bull Run According to an analysis shared on the TradingView website, crypto analyst Klejdi Cuni shows that the Solana price actually confirmed a larger bearish pattern after the crash triggered by Donald Trump’s 100% tariff comments on China. As a result, the entire bearish trend is yet to actually play out. Not only is the Solana price already on track for more corrections, but it is also further at risk as the Bitcoin price struggles to hold up. After initially recovering, the Bitcoin price has since been on a slow decline, and altcoins such as Solana have been affected as well. With the Bitcoin price already struggling, the analyst believes that the Solana price is already looking at a decline to at least $170. However, in the event that the entire bearish narrative does play out, then the Solana price is at risk of crashing 50% to $104. SOL ETFs Could Change The Narrative Amid the expected bear pressure, there is still the topic of pending Solana ETF applications that could change the entire narrative. Data from The Block website shows a total of 11 Solana ETFs that are pending a decision from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash If these Solana ETFs are approved for trading, it could trigger a large influx of institutional liquidity into the altcoin. Just like the trend seen with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, this could lead to a surge in the Solana price, effectively eliminating the bears from the table. At the time of writing, the Solana price was still trending above $200. However, with the Bitcoin price skirting around $111,000, it is possible that the altcoin could suffer a crash below $200 before finding its footing once again.

Early investors who recognized its potential changed their lives forever. Today, the crypto market stands at a similar crossroads. As investors look for the next big mover before the next upcycle, one name is beginning to dominate the conversation — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new crypto coin is emerging as a powerful DeFi contender with genuine use cases, audited technology, and an active presale that continues to attract attention. As portfolios rotate, many long-term allocators narrowing down what crypto to invest in are starting to place MUTM on shortlists of the best crypto to buy now heading into 2025. Presale momentum and early investor advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to become the next major success story in decentralized lending and borrowing, bringing real financial utility to the blockchain arena. Its model, roadmap, and timing are creating the kind of setup analysts associate with early XRP moments — an asset with purpose, momentum, and massive upside. With that profile, MUTM is increasingly mentioned alongside top cryptocurrencies to watch as the cycle turns. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale continues to gain traction, generating over $17.42 million from more than 17,300 holders so far. The project is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, and nearly 68% of this round is already sold. Once this phase concludes, the next price step will rise to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. Early participants from Phase 1 have already seen around 3.5x paper growth, and each phase brings new price momentum. Analysts tracking crypto prices expect a 200%–1,000% upside post-launch and expected exchange listing. Unlike speculative meme tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers a structured and functional system built around on-chain lending, borrowing, and yield generation. Real utility and long-term strength Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a dual-model ecosystem combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, users will deposit assets into audited smart contracts to earn stable yields. Each lender will receive mtTokens, representing their deposits and entitling them to a share of interest and rewards. Borrowers, on the other hand, will post overcollateralized assets to unlock liquidity through the same secure smart contracts. Collateral such as ETH, SOL, or AVAX will back these loans, maintaining system safety while ensuring borrowers can access stable liquidity. Riskier assets will move to the P2P side, where users will negotiate loan terms directly for higher returns. This structure provides flexibility for both conservative and adventurous users — all while driving on-chain activity and real demand for MUTM tokens. Every transaction in this system strengthens the token’s economy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use platform-generated revenue for open-market buybacks of MUTM, distributing purchased tokens to mtToken stakers as rewards. This creates a continuous buy-and-distribute cycle that boosts both token value and long-term holder rewards. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing its roadmap with clear precision. Phase 1 — presale launch, audit, and marketing — has been largely completed. Phase 2 is now in active development, with smart contracts, front-end systems, and analytics tools under construction. The next stages will bring testnet deployment, final audits, and full exchange preparations. The team has officially announced through its X account that the V1 version of the protocol will soon debut on the Sepolia Testnet. This release will introduce core components including a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot — all essential for ensuring efficiency and system stability. Initially, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral with ease. This early phase will give users a practical preview of the platform’s main features, helping them understand its real use and reliability. As users test and engage with these tools, overall confidence in the ecosystem is expected to grow, attracting more investors and potentially fueling an upward move in the token’s value. The project’s planned stablecoin system will further expand utility. Users will mint a $1-pegged decentralized asset by locking approved collateral, creating consistent ecosystem demand. Borrowing, lending, staking, and stablecoin minting will all depend on MUTM — ensuring constant token circulation and value linkage. The launch that could change everything Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will synchronize its live platform launch with the MUTM token listing, aligning real utility with immediate market activity. This dual debut strategy sets it apart from other presales that often delay for months after selling tokens. Functional DeFi platforms tend to attract major exchange listings faster, leading to strong early liquidity and price momentum. For allocators building exposure into the next cycle, it increasingly fits the filters used to identify the best cryptocurrency to invest in at early-stage valuations. Analysts anticipate that an investor entering now at $0.035 will see MUTM rise toward $0.35 by mid-2026 — a 10x growth trajectory. Even a more moderate climb to $0.14 represents over 300% gains, outperforming most traditional assets by far. This growth path mirrors the early XRP rally: a low market cap, tangible use cases, and early believers rewarded for recognizing innovation before the masses. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is closing in on the final stretch of its current phase, and demand continues to climb. With a $100,000 giveaway underway — where ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens — the project is reinforcing its commitment to loyal participants. Final words A new release just raised the level of the 24-hour leaderboard. The user at the top of the list will get a $500 MUTM bonus every day, but only if they make at least a single purchase in that 24 hours. Every day at 00:00 UTC, the leaderboard restarts itself right on time. It doesn’t happen often, but history often rhymes. XRP’s early success once marked a time of rapid growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ready to lead the next wave of investing in crypto as they come together. This new crypto coin isn’t just a token; it’s the start of a whole DeFi community that’s meant to last for the long term and give investors real returns. It’s possible that the next rise is already forming, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) looks like it will be the big story — a next big crypto candidate that pairs utility with timing.

Data from Companies MarketCap values gold’s total market capitalization at approximately $30.38 trillion, reinforcing its dominance as a global safe-haven asset, as noted by The Economic Times . Since the start of the year, gold has risen more than 60%, fueled by geopolitical tensions, expectations of aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, massive central bank purchases, and a growing shift toward de-dollarization. Gold ETFs have also seen a sharp influx of funds, reflecting strong investor confidence. At the time of writing, gold trades around $4,360 per ounce. Why Gold Keeps Shining Investors are rapidly pivoting to safe-haven assets amid market volatility, a weaker U.S. dollar, and expectations of looser monetary policy, making gold increasingly attractive. Analyst Craig Erlam of OANDA’s MarketPulse observed: “Gold’s outlook will depend largely on the trajectory of interest rates in 2026 and the relationship between the U.S. and China. If no agreement is reached and tensions escalate, gold could exceed $5,000 per ounce.” Meanwhile, Reuters reports that ANZ expects gold to reach $4,400 per ounce by late 2025, potentially peaking near $4,600 in mid-2026, before a correction begins once the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle concludes. According to Trading Economics, prices may stabilize around $4,066 by the end of the current quarter, with potential to rise toward $4,248 over the next 12 months. Main Forces Behind the 2025 “Gold Rally” Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts Weakening U.S. dollar Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China Rising demand for defensive assets Sustained central bank purchases of gold As a reminder, gold’s previous record was set on September 22, following a deep correction in the crypto market — a shift that once again highlighted investors’ renewed faith in tangible, time-tested assets like gold.",News|Markets,EN,0,0,FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 09:34:05

Key Takeaways: Crypto sentiment plunged into Extreme Fear, with Alternative.me’s index dropping to 22. Bitcoin struggled near $110,000 amid renewed US–China trade tensions. Long-term holders sold 265,700 BTC in the past month, while overleveraged traders faced $418 million in liquidations. According to Alternative.me’s Fear & Greed Index, market sentiment fell to 22, Extreme Fear, down from 64 (Greed) just one week ago. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Fear and Greed Index also dropped to 28 (Fear) from 54 (Neutral) last week, signaling widespread caution among traders. Bitcoin Stalls at $110K as US–China Tensions Spark Flight to Gold The rapid shift in sentiment mirrors growing unease across global markets. Bitcoin hovered just above $110,000 on Thursday, struggling to hold key support as renewed US–China trade tensions dampened risk appetite. The flight to safety was underscored by gold hitting new record highs above $4,230 per ounce, signaling investor preference for traditional safe-haven assets. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund (ETF) data showed sustained outflows. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw withdrawals of $94 million on Wednesday, extending a multi-day streak of redemptions. Derivatives data also pointed to mounting selling pressure, with total liquidations surpassing $418 million over the past 24 hours. Long positions outnumbered shorts by more than 2.4 to 1, suggesting that many leveraged traders were caught off guard as prices retreated. The Fear and Greed Index is sitting at extreme fear and the VIX is at 25 while $SPY & $QQQ are still less than 3% from all time highs. The data and the mood are telling two very different stories. pic.twitter.com/QutmyyEjV2 — Shay Boloor (@StockSavvyShay) October 16, 2025 On-chain data paints an equally cautious picture. Long-term holders, wallets with coins held for over 155 days, have sold roughly 265,700 BTC in the past month, the largest such outflow since January. Analysts interpret this as profit-taking amid heightened volatility, a signal that even veteran investors are trimming exposure. “The move reflects rising caution among veteran holders amid volatility, painting a bearish scenario for the cryptocurrency,” said Milad Azar, Market Analyst at XTB MENA. As reported, Bitcoin may be nearing a critical turning point, according to trader Tony “The Bull” Severino, who believes the next 100 days could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters a parabolic rally or ends its current bull cycle. Severino pointed to the Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which has tightened to levels unseen before, often a precursor to sharp price moves in either direction. Severino cautioned that “head fakes,” or false breakouts, are common during such setups. He noted Bitcoin recently failed to break above the upper band with strength after briefly touching $126,000, suggesting a potential dip before any sustained rally. BitMEX Chair Says Ethereum Could “Flip” Bitcoin Like Equities Overtook Gold After 1971 Ethereum could eventually surpass Bitcoin’s market share, similar to how U.S. equities overtook gold following the end of the gold standard in 1971, according to BitMEX chair Tom Lee. Speaking with ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Lee compared Ethereum’s potential rise to the shift that occurred after the “Nixon Shock,” when the US dollar became fully synthetic and unpegged from gold. Lee noted that the move away from gold created massive demand for financial products tied to the dollar, paving the way for Wall Street’s dominance. “The market cap of equities today is $40 trillion compared to $2 trillion for gold,” he said, highlighting how financial innovation transformed the dollar’s role globally.

Cisco Talos and Google Threat Intelligence Group independently confirmed the attacks target job seekers through fake interview processes, deploying malware that steals crypto and credentials. The group deployed a new JavaScript module that combines BeaverTail and OtterCookie malware, featuring keylogging and screenshot capabilities. The malicious software was distributed via a Node.js package named “ node-nvm-ssh ” on the official NPM repository, disguised as a chess application called “ Chessfi .” Node-nvm-ssh infection path | Source: Cisco Talos Google has documented a North Korean group, UNC5342, which has been embedding JADESNOW malware and INVISIBLEFERRET backdoors within smart contracts on the BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum since February 2025. UNC5342 EtherHiding on BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum | Source: Google Cloud The technique stores malicious payloads on public blockchains , creating a decentralized command-and-control infrastructure that cannot be taken down by law enforcement. This discovery comes as North Korean hackers stole over $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024 and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 alone , funding the regime’s weapons program through elaborate money laundering networks. EtherHiding Turns Blockchain Into Bulletproof Hosting Platform EtherHiding embeds malicious JavaScript payloads within smart contracts on public blockchains, turning decentralized ledgers into resilient command-and-control servers. Attackers retrieve payloads using read-only function calls that avoid transaction fees and leave no visible blockchain history. The technique offers decentralized storage, prevents takedowns, pseudonymous transactions obscure attacker identity, and immutable smart contracts cannot be easily removed. Attackers controlling contracts can update payloads at any time, changing attack methods or deploying different malware simultaneously. Google Threat Intelligence documented UNC5342 using EtherHiding in the “Contagious Interview” campaign, where fake recruiters impersonate companies like Coinbase and Robinhood. Victims download malicious files from GitHub repositories during technical assessments, triggering multi-stage infections. The JADESNOW downloader queries BNB Smart Chain through API providers like Binplorer to retrieve payloads from smart contract address 0x8ea**8a71c. The contract has been updated over 20 times within four months, costing an average of $1.37 in gas fees per update. On-chain transactions | Source: Google Cloud Blockchain explorers show on-chain transactions containing Base64-encoded and XOR-encrypted messages that decrypt to heavily obfuscated JavaScript payloads. The malware pivots between networks, querying Ethereum transaction history through multiple explorer APIs, including Blockchair, Blockcypher, and Ethplorer. The final INVISIBLEFERRET.JAVASCRIPT payload connects to command-and-control servers via port 3306, sending victim hostname, username, operating system, and current directory. The backdoor processes arbitrary command execution, file exfiltration, and directory harvesting while targeting over 80 browser extensions, including MetaMask and Phantom.

Silent Push researchers discovered Blocknovas registered to a vacant lot in South Carolina, while Softglide traced back to a Buffalo tax office. These companies launched the “Contagious Interview” campaign, a Lazarus Group subgroup specializing in malware deployment. ZachXBT documented at least 25 instances of North Korean IT workers infiltrating crypto companies, operating under more than 30 fake identities with government-issued ID cards and professional LinkedIn accounts.

According to Bloomberg , the French prudential supervision authority, ACPR, has been conducting on-site controls since late 2024, with Binance instructed to strengthen its risk controls during the examination. “ Periodic onsite inspections are a standard part of the supervision of regulated entities, ” Binance stated. The checks verify compliance with conditions for PSAN (digital asset service provider) registration, particularly testing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. Failure to address ACPR findings could lead to sanctions or compromise a company’s ability to obtain MiCA agreements from France, which allows firms to operate across all 27 EU member states. Companies have until June 2026 to secure the license, with only Deblock, GOin, Bitstack, and Credit Agricole-owned CACEIS receiving approval so far. The inspections come as France, Austria, and Italy have urged the EU’s top markets watchdog to directly supervise major crypto companies and tighten rules, following the identification of implementation disparities across the bloc. Binance’s History in French Last year, Binance replaced co-founder Changpeng Zhao with two new shareholders, Yulong Yan and Lihua He, in May 2024, to maintain its operational status in France after Zhao’s guilty plea for violating U.S. banking laws . French regulations prohibit majority shareholders with criminal records. Zhao previously owned 100% of Binance France. The restructuring forms part of a “ global restructuring project ” aimed at aligning with regulatory standards, as MiCA enables companies to “passport” their licenses across EU countries. France serves as Binance’s strategic European hub despite facing two investigations from French prosecutors over potential money laundering and unauthorized advertising. ACPR’s typical demands following inspections include hiring additional compliance staff and strengthening IT security systems, with companies receiving several months to comply. The information collected by ACPR is shared with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which grants MiCA agreements. Earlier this year, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, directed Binance Australia to appoint external auditors after identifying “ serious concerns ” with anti-money laundering controls. @binance faces mandatory audit in Australia over serious AML and terror financing concerns amid nationwide enforcement campaign. #Binance #Australia https://t.co/lVsofJm6gC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 CEO Brendan Thomas emphasized that “ businesses can have systems that apply to multiple jurisdictions—but they need to reflect local regulatory requirements. “ However, Binance told Cryptonews that the firm has “ engaged openly and transparently with AUSTRAC over the past several months. ” The exchange claims to employ “ over 1,200 team members—nearly 22% of global workforce—in compliance-related functions, with spending projected to increase 33% this year. ” Yesterday, the exchange also completed its acquisition of South Korean exchange Gopax after a two-year regulatory holdup, marking its return to Korea’s market. MiCA’s Enforcement Disparities Across Europe In contrast to Europe, back in June 2023, Coinbase agreed to pay $100 million to settle complaints regarding “ historical shortcomings ” in its regulatory compliance work with New York’s Department of Financial Services. The settlement included a $50 million penalty and a $50 million commitment to compliance program investments over a two-year period. The exchange has since developed crypto-focused anti-money laundering tools and an automated Transaction Monitoring System, following investigations that began in 2021. For exchanges operating in Europe, such as OKX, regulators are considering penalties against the exchange after hackers allegedly laundered $100 million in stolen Bybit funds through its Web3 platform. However, the problem lies in authorities still debating whether OKX’s integrated services fall under MiCA regulations, with some recommending permit revocation and operational restrictions. France just approved Lise Exchange, a tokenized stock exchange that aims to redefine how IPOs work for SMEs. #France #IPO #LiseExchange https://t.co/56RhlDLw3A — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 Amid Eurepo’s unclear regulatory enforcement, France has approved Lightning Stock Exchange (Lise) as the nation’s first fully tokenized equity exchange in October, securing a DLT TSS license under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The platform integrates the roles of Multilateral Trading Facility and Central Securities Depository on a single, distributed ledger, enabling instant trading and settlement. Lise plans to host its first IPOs in early 2026, targeting small and mid-cap enterprises that have traditionally faced barriers in the public market. The approval positions France as a European leader in tokenized securities as real-world asset tokenization surged past $33.9 billion, up over 10% in the past month.

Each time ETH leads the market, projects built on strong utility often follow. One project now standing in that spotlight is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Experts expect that as Ethereum continues to recover, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will become one of the next big crypto opportunities for investors looking for strong growth and reliable yield. For investors deciding what crypto to invest in as ETH flirts with its peak, MUTM’s blend of real yield and lending mechanics stands out. With ETH retest ATH? From a technical perspective, ETH recently broke out above $4,800, but now faces resistance and momentum is cooling. Its nearest firm support lies around $4,070, which coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and the midline of its long-term ascending channel. Analysts often treat this $3,900–$4,100 zone as a “make or break” area — if it holds, bulls retain the chance to push upward again; if broken, deeper correction is likely. On the fundamental side, Ethereum faces headwinds: on-chain activity has declined recently, with transfer counts dropping from ~838K to ~680K, indicating weaker network usage even as price remains elevated. Weak usage versus strong price is a divergence that can weigh on upside. Still, ETF inflows and macro tailwinds could provide needed buying pressure if ETH regains conviction above resistance. In short: a retest of ATH support is possible — holding $4,070–$4,100 is critical — but volume, confirmation, and resumed on-chain activity must back it up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Dual lending models that power real demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines a real lending protocol with staking rewards and market buybacks. This creates a system that grows through actual use, not hype. The project is now in its Phase 6 presale, showing rapid progress with 68% of tokens already sold. The current price is $0.035, and over 17,300 holders have already joined. The presale has raised about $17.42 million so far, with a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens. An investor who entered in Phase 1 at $0.01 is now up 250% in value. When the listing price reaches $0.06 and progresses toward the projected $0.21 target, that same $4,000 investment will grow to $24,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to bring real value to both lenders and borrowers. Recently the team on X has announced the launch of the protocol’s V1 on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, supporting ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. That concrete timeline is why MUTM often appears on ‘best crypto to buy now’ screens among DeFi-focused traders. For community building and incentivizing the huge investors, a recent update has enhanced the 24-hour leaderboard feature. Each day, the user who achieves the top position will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, provided they complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour window. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. The fundamentals of Mutuum Finance are based on two main models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, lenders will deposit tokens such as USDT or SOL into smart contracts. Suppose a user lends $10,000 worth of SOL-equivalent USDC; they will earn between 12% and 18% APY based on how much of the pool is being used. After one year, this will return about $1,500 in passive income, paid directly through the platform. Borrowers will also benefit. For example, someone with $8,000 worth of SOL will be able to use it as collateral to borrow $6,000 USDT. This allows them to stay exposed to SOL’s price movement while gaining access to liquidity. It is a direct example of how decentralized lending helps users use their crypto coins efficiently without selling them. The P2P model will target higher-risk assets like PEPE or TRUMP tokens. Lenders and borrowers will negotiate directly, setting their own rates and durations. Here, lenders will be able to earn yields up to 25% or more, depending on market demand. By separating these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will protect its main pools while still giving users the freedom to earn high yields. This structure will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most complete lending protocols in upcoming DeFi, answering the question many traders ask: is crypto a good investment when real use cases exist? Buybacks, rewards, and ETH-driven growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will include a continuous buy-and-distribute model. Every time users lend or borrow, the protocol will collect fees. These fees will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a strong demand loop—stakers earn consistent MUTM rewards, and buybacks push the token’s price upward through active use. As ETH’s trading volume continues to increase, Mutuum’s on-chain activity will also rise, creating more fees for the buyback system. This link between platform growth and token rewards will help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strengthen its market position as DeFi expands again. The project also plans to launch its beta version alongside the token’s market debut, bringing immediate utility from day one. This means traders, lenders, and borrowers will be able to use the platform the moment it lists, which is rare in new projects. The timing will let Mutuum Finance (MUTM) capture early DeFi liquidity when ETH retests its peak. Taken together, ETH’s setup and MUTM’s cadence put it on many top cryptocurrencies watchlists for the coming quarter. To manage volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use tested lending parameters. Stable assets like ETH and USDT will keep loan-to-value ratios near 75%, while volatile tokens will stay around 65%. This helps the system stay secure, even when prices move quickly. The protocol will also include a reserve factor of about 10% to 44%, protecting users and maintaining strong liquidity. Final outlook before ETH’s breakout Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building momentum fast. With 68% of Phase 6 already sold, the next phase will bring a price rise to $0.04—a 15% increase. The presale is proving strong interest from investors who are looking for the next big crypto that blends real use, rewards, and long-term growth. With its presale heating up and its platform launch set to align with Ethereum’s rally, this project stands out as one of the top crypto coins to buy before ETH’s next breakout—a setup that experts already see reaching 500% growth in the coming months. As Ethereum moves toward retesting its all-time high, attention is shifting toward DeFi projects with active ecosystems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that description perfectly, offering a dual lending model, steady buybacks, staking rewards, and live progress through its dashboard and leaderboard.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/one-of-the-largest-states-in-the-us-is-getting-ready-to-invest-in-bitcoin-btc-here-are-the-details/,"While the government shutdown in the US has been going on for two weeks, important developments continue to occur. At this point, the latest news came from Florida, one of the most populous states in the United States. Accordingly, a bill was introduced by Florida Republican Representative Webster Barnaby that would allow the state to invest in digital assets such as Bitcoin and crypto ETFs. New House Bill 183 (HB183), introduced in the Florida House of Representatives, would allow up to 10% of money in certain public funds, including the General Revenue Fund, the Budget Stabilization Fund, and various trust funds, to be invested in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and ETFs. Accordingly, HB183 would give the state's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the State Board of Governors the authority to invest in and manage Bitcoin and ETFs. The bill would also allow Floridians to pay certain taxes and fees with digital assets. These payments would be converted to dollars and transferred to the state's general fund. HB 183 positions Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation and is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2026. HB183 is currently awaiting committee approval. The bill must pass the Senate and receive the governor's signature before it can take effect. Florida's move follows a growing national trend toward state policies for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted similar Bitcoin reserve laws since 2025, reflecting a growing appetite for crypto diversification at the state level. *This is not investment advice.

The data, which came from CardRatings.com, reflects how average families are leaning on credit cards to cover everyday costs with the Federal Reserve’s rate cut doing nothing to ease the pain, and the numbers reveal that relief is still far out of reach for millions. Nearly half of U.S. households now carry credit card debt, paying over 20% interest on average, as it becomes one of the most expensive ways to borrow, for financing survival. “For millions of American households, credit card debt represents their highest-cost debt by a wide margin,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, describing how widespread and costly revolving balances have become. Fed rate cuts bring almost no real help Most credit cards have variable interest rates , which means their rates usually follow the Fed’s benchmark. When the Fed lowers its rates, the prime rate drops too, and that should bring down interest rates on credit cards within a billing cycle or two. But that isn’t happening. When the Fed cut rates by a full point in late 2024, the average credit card rate only slipped by 0.23% during that same period. And when the central bank trimmed another quarter point last month, the average rate fell by just 0.09%, landing at 24.22% for the third quarter. “Consumers hoping for an automatic, proportional drop in their credit card interest rates may be disappointed,” said Jennifer Doss, executive editor at CardRatings.com. She explained that the link between Fed policy and card APRs is often weaker than people assume, adding that “credit card rates are heavily influenced by credit conditions and individual credit scores.” Jeff Sigmund, spokesman for the American Bankers Association, said the industry sets rates in “a highly competitive market.” He added that if the Fed keeps cutting rates, some consumers will see lower APRs eventually, though how much and how soon depends on the type of card and the issuer. Banks protect themselves, not borrowers Issuers, meanwhile, are finding ways to keep profits safe. Rossman said that card companies often trim the lower end of their APR range, which affects borrowers with excellent credit, but keep the higher end untouched. Basically, the best customers get small cuts while those struggling with debt stay trapped in high-cost balances, according to CNBC. For some retail credit cards, APRs are even rising, despite the Fed’s moves, according to a Bankrate survey. Banks that issue store-branded credit cards have said maintaining higher APRs was necessary following a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule limiting what the industry can charge in late fees. Even after bank trade groups succeeded in overturning that rule earlier this year, major issuers like Synchrony and Bread Financial said they wouldn’t roll back those increases. Here is what that means for the average American: even if your card rate dropped by a quarter point, say, from 20.12% to 19.87%, you’d save about $1 a month if you’re only making minimum payments. The only people escaping the pain are those who pay off their balances every month or take advantage of 0% balance transfer cards that offer 12 to 21 months interest-free. “The real consumer benefit lies in making your personal credit card rate 0%, either by paying in full – if you can – or signing up for a 0% balance transfer card,” Rossman said.

The vote ended 51–45, short of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster, AP reported. The continued impasse has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees on unpaid leave and many more uncertain about their next paycheck. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voiced concern: “As we see both sides digging in on day 16 of the shutdown, ordinary people are asking whether their government will be there when they need it.” Media outlets note that this standoff could surpass the 16-day shutdown of 2013, which stemmed from disputes over the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The White House said military payroll expenses this week totaled $6.5 billion, though it remains unclear whether those funds will cover the next pay period. What’s Blocking a Deal Senate Republican Leader John Thune accused Democrats of blocking efforts to reopen the government by rejecting compromise proposals. “The Democratic Party is a party that doesn’t take ‘yes’ for an answer,” Thune said. He suggested holding a separate vote on extending ACA subsidies, though there’s no guarantee it would pass. Democrats, meanwhile, insist they will not back any spending bill that fails to protect tax credits for health insurance plans. “The ACA crisis looms large over everyone. And yet, Republicans seem willing to allow insurance premiums to skyrocket,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. The proposed rate hikes could affect 24 million Americans who receive insurance through ACA marketplaces. Most states plan to begin sending new rate notices on November 1. A Crisis With Growing Economic Risks Experts warn that the shutdown could soon outlast the 2013 episode and is already threatening startups and IPO plans. On October 16, Republicans tried advancing a Defense Department funding bill, but the measure failed in a 50–44 vote, with only three Democrats supporting it. Despite occasional attempts at compromise, party leaders remain deadlocked and have yet to engage in meaningful dialogue. On Capitol Hill, many now believe there’s no quick end in sight. “Many people are asking us how this will all end. We have no idea,” admitted House Speaker Mike Johnson. Prediction platform Polymarket puts the odds of the shutdown lasting beyond October 15 at 71%.

53269638,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86621,1760695240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Analysts Call This Crypto the Best Entry Point for 2025 Bull Market Exposure,https://timestabloid.com/why-analysts-call-this-crypto-the-best-entry-point-for-2025-bull/,"The crypto market is waking up again. Analysts believe that 2025 will open a fresh wave of growth for strong DeFi projects. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining major attention. The project’s ongoing Phase 6 presale is already becoming a favorite among investors looking for early exposure before the next bull market begins. Unlike many new crypto coin launches, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a complete lending ecosystem with live dashboards, a working leaderboard, and a testnet launch planned for Q4 2025 on Sepolia. This early release includes vital tools like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot designed to keep operations smooth and secure. At first, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral easily. That mix of visible delivery and measured scope is exactly what many screen for when deciding what crypto to invest in ahead of 2025. A Presale With Real Momentum Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is priced at $0.035, with over 68% of the phase supply already sold. The project has raised $17.42 million and attracted more than 17,300 holders. The next phase will increase the price to $0.040, a 15% jump. Each phase has seen a steady increase in value, creating excitement among those investing in crypto before wider market recovery. It’s also why MUTM keeps appearing on best crypto to buy now shortlists during presale season. Early participants have already seen major paper gains. For instance, buyers from Phase 3 at $0.02 are now up 75% before any exchange listing has even occurred. This steady growth shows that investor confidence is not only holding but expanding. Analysts describe Phase 6 as the “sweet spot” where entry remains affordable while upside potential remains strong. As the presale continues to progress toward the next price tier, demand is building every day. The project’s growing community, active dashboard and 24-hour leaderboard make it easier for new participants to track presale rankings and stay updated. Each day, the user who ranks first will receive a $500 MUTM reward, as long as they perform at least one transaction during that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. This level of transparency has strengthened trust and encouraged new users to join before the next price adjustment. For investors comparing top cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it already combines visible development progress with real-time engagement. Dual-Lending Design Building Future Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a concept—it is a full financial platform in development. As a defi crypto, its model will combine two core systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. These two modules will serve both conservative and high-yield users, giving the project a flexible foundation for long-term growth. In P2C, lenders will deposit tokens like USDT or ETH into audited smart contracts. They will receive mtTokens in return, representing their pool share and earned interest. If a user lends $15,000 in USDT, they will receive the same amount in mtUSDT, which grows in value as interest accrues. A typical annual yield is expected around 15%, meaning the same deposit could grow by about $2,250 in one year. Borrowers will join from the other side. They will post collateral, such as ETH, and borrow up to a set percentage of its value—around 75%, depending on the asset. For example, someone holding $1,000 in ETH could borrow $750 while keeping their crypto exposure intact. When the loan is repaid, both parties benefit, and the system remains balanced through automatic liquidation safeguards. The upcoming lending and borrowing features add meaningful real-world use cases that will likely attract a broader range of users to the platform. As most of these actions directly or indirectly depend on MUTM, the consistent rise in demand is expected to serve as a strong driver for the token’s future value growth. As more users lend, borrow, and stake, the demand for MUTM tokens will naturally increase, giving this new crypto coin a strong foundation for long-term market exposure. $1 Pegged Stablecoin, Chainlink Based Oracle System and Security Audit Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to introduce its decentralized stablecoin, pegged to $1, as a key driver of on-chain activity. It will be minted when users borrow against collateral and burned when loans are repaid. This constant flow will ensure borrowing and lending stay active within the ecosystem. Governance rules will adjust interest rates to keep the stablecoin balanced, adding liquidity and consistency for all users. Mutuum’s oracle system will also play a central role in price discovery. Using Chainlink as its main data feed, backed by fallback and aggregated price sources, it will maintain accurate valuations across multiple assets. That precision is vital for trust and smooth operations, giving institutional users more confidence once the platform launches. The project’s audit process also supports this trust. CertiK’s review assigned a TokenScan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, backed by both manual and static analysis. Alongside this, a $50,000 bug bounty program is active, encouraging developers to test and strengthen security even before full release. Final Words These elements point to one direction—growth. The presale is not only raising funds but also building a loyal user base and a functioning product structure. Analysts tracking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project that listings might begin around $0.06, with targets between $0.60 and $1.20 within the first year after launch. That means a $2,000 presale position at $0.035 could grow into $20,000–$40,000 as the market expands in 2025. The 2025 bull market will reward projects with real utility and clear revenue design. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits both descriptions. With live dashboards, strong presale traction, and active progress toward its testnet, it represents one of the most promising entries for investors seeking the best crypto exposure before listings begin. For those still considering investing in crypto, Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is where opportunity meets timing—the perfect starting point before the next big run begins.

53269920,608037,1760695259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53269920.jpeg,Crypto Bank Anchorage Digital’s New Feature: Global USD Wire Transfers For Crypto Users,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bank-anchorage-digitals-new-feature/,"Anchorage Digital Bank announced the introduction of global USD wire transfers, positioning itself as a leader among crypto-native institutions in the sector. As the only federally chartered crypto bank in the United States, Anchorage now offers a federally regulated platform that allows clients to manage both cash and crypto. Anchorage Digital Unveils Dual Currency Feature With this new feature, clients can hold, send, and receive both USD and cryptocurrency , eliminating the operational complexities that have traditionally plagued the management of these asset classes. Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital, articulated the bank’s vision: We’re eliminating the operational complexity of managing both cash and crypto. Our clients can now consolidate assets with a single, federally regulated banking partner and move funds efficiently across both. We believe the future of finance will be built on crypto rails, and we’re giving institutions the flexibility to operate this way. Anchorage Digital now enables clients to consolidate their holdings, convert between USD and cryptocurrencies through its trading desk, and earn rewards on eligible stablecoins, ensuring that cash does not remain idle. The new service also opens up reliable USD banking options for crypto startups and innovators. Furthermore, international institutions will benefit from simplified USD flows into the US, reducing currency risk and operational overhead by partnering with a single regulated entity. Users can manage all their assets and execute transfers through various channels, including an institutional web dashboard, an iOS app, or programmatically via a comprehensive API, all supported by Anchorage Digital’s security measures. Crypto Banking Trend Additionally, clients can convert USD into one of hundreds of supported digital assets via the trading desk, and mint stablecoins with USD to collect rewards on select options such as PayPal’s PYUSD and Paxos’ USDG. As part of its roadmap, the bank further disclosed: Anchorage Digital Bank will continue to expand its USD offerings, including interest-bearing USD accounts in the coming months. Our goal is to eliminate the friction between crypto and fiat, giving institutions a single platform to hold and move capital with confidence. Notably, Anchorage Digital’s approach mirrors a growing trend among leading crypto firms. Sony Bank, for instance, recently submitted an application to US regulators for a national banking charter through its subsidiary, Connectia Trust, joining a select group of firms—including Stripe, Coinbase, Paxos, and Circle—all vying for federal crypto banking licenses. However, a new crypto bank named Erebor has emerged, backed by a group of tech billionaires, including Peter Thiel. Having received partial regulatory approval to launch, Erebor is set to join the ranks of Anchorage.

Bitcoin Fear Index Plunges to Yearly Low — Bitwise Sees Opportunity as $HYPER Emerges Among the Best Presales October 17, 2025 • 10:00 UTC On October 10th, a violent market crash sent $BTC tumbling to $103,133 , only for the coin to rebound to $116,044 by October 13th before cooling off at $108,138 at the time of writing. The Bitcoin Fear Index dropped to 22 from last week’s 71, its lowest in a year, reflecting the widespread risk aversion among investors. However, Bitwise interprets this as a contrarian signal, arguing that it’s the ideal phase for accumulation. The historical pattern from April this year supports Bitwise’s theory, as $BTC dipped below $74K only to rally above $100K the following month. On the other hand, Glassnode data suggest that small holders are accumulating Bitcoin, a sign of rising retail confidence. Amid high market volatility, promising presale opportunities like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) are gaining strong traction from savvy investors. Bitcoin Hyper is a scalability solution that aims to deliver Solana-level speed, ultra-low fees, near-instant finality, and support for dApps, DeFi, and NFTs. Discover how to purchase Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in our comprehensive guide. $1.8B in Bitcoin Profits Hit the Market — Is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Poised to Shine Among the Best Presales? October 17, 2025 • 10:00 UTC $BTC is exhibiting signs of exhaustion, dipping below its key psychological zone of $110K-$112K and is now trading at $108,572, signalling low investor confidence. On October 15, traders locked in $1.8B in profits during which long-term holders took advantage of 6X gains and small-time holders sidelined with smaller returns. The same day saw $319M in realized losses , suggesting market instability and a sentiment shift among profit-takers and loss-sellers. Analysts cite this pattern as healthy derisking – one that resets the market’s overbought conditions before its next leg up. Checkonchain Data shows Bitcoin stuck between its 128 and 200 DMAs, signalling fading momentum and a potential directional shift ahead. As $BTC consolidates near $110K, savvy traders are rotating capital into emerging presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . A recent whale purchase $28,230 just last week shows that the project’s momentum is heating up. Take a look at our expert $HYPER price prediction path.

53269694,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86620,1760695376,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple (XRP) Enters Africa. Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-enters-africa-heres-the-latest/,"Ripple has confirmed a significant development in its expansion strategy by introducing institutional-grade digital asset custody services to Africa. The initiative is being implemented through a partnership with Absa, one of South Africa’s major banking institutions. This marks a deliberate step by a key financial technology company to support Africa’s transition into regulated digital asset management and infrastructure. The announcement was shared by Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Senior Executive Officer and Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, who referenced a personal connection to South Africa, highlighting the importance of the region in Ripple’s broader international strategy. By choosing a prominent South African bank as a partner, Ripple is demonstrating that African financial institutions are moving beyond exploratory phases and are committing to operational engagement with blockchain-based solutions. Ripple Custody has arrived in Africa! Having spent time in South Africa earlier in my career, it holds a special place in my heart, so I'm delighted we’re bringing institutional-grade digital asset custody to one of the nation’s leading banks. This news highlights the serious… — Reece Merrick (@reece_merrick) October 15, 2025 Institutional Focus on Custody and Asset Security The introduction of Ripple Custody in Africa is tailored towards institutions rather than retail markets. This suggests a targeted effort to deliver compliance-backed, enterprise-level infrastructure that aligns with the regulatory expectations of major financial entities. Custody services are foundational to institutional participation in digital assets. They offer secure storage and management solutions for banks, asset managers, and corporates to enter the space. Ripple’s positioning as a trusted partner indicates that this collaboration goes beyond simple integration. It implies involvement in long-term infrastructure planning, technical deployment, and strategic alignment with African financial frameworks. By engaging with established banking players such as Absa, Ripple aims to integrate blockchain solutions into traditional finance rather than operating on the periphery. Market Implications and Community Reactions The move has not gone unnoticed among cryptocurrency supporters. A user under the name Anonymous VIP reacted strongly, calling it one of the most bullish developments to date, further stating that such milestones are often overlooked until major price movements occur. The comment also referenced the conclusion of the legal case surrounding XRP , pointing out that the asset now operates without the regulatory uncertainty that previously constrained institutional perception. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While the commentary may reflect a community perspective rather than institutional analysis, it highlights a broader sentiment that major infrastructure developments are occurring independently of speculative market cycles. The introduction of custody services positions Africa not as a secondary market but as an emerging pillar in the global digital asset framework. Positioning Africa within Global Digital Asset Adoption South Africa, with its advanced banking system and influence in Africa, serves as a strategic entry point for wider continental adoption. Ripple’s engagement with a top-tier bank signals that digital asset integration is progressing through formal financial channels rather than emerging solely through fintech startups. This approach aligns with trends in other regions where institutional infrastructure forms the basis for regulatory recognition and eventual market-wide adoption. Ripple’s custodial expansion into Africa represents not only a technological deployment but an institutional signal. It confirms that Africa is being treated as a region ready for integrated digital asset services, supported by established financial institutions, rather than experimental initiatives. As digital asset custody becomes foundational to institutional engagement worldwide, this development places African banks at the forefront of future-ready financial systems.

SharpLink’s shares rose 2% to $15.45 in morning trading but later eased to $14.57 at the time of writing, data from Yahoo! Finance shows. Citizens’ analysts based their bullish forecast on the expected long-term growth of Ethereum (ETH). The bank projects ETH will exceed $7,000 by 2026 and could surpass $20,000 by 2030, supporting SharpLink’s expanding Ethereum-focused strategy. Why Analysts Are Bullish on SharpLink SharpLink has quickly emerged as one of the most ambitious Ethereum treasury operators in the public market. After building a sizable position in ETH, the company began allocating assets toward staking and on-chain income strategies to steadily grow its net asset value (NAV) over time. Unlike traditional companies that simply hold cryptocurrencies, SharpLink actively manages its Ethereum balance sheet, according to analysts led by Devin Ryan. “SharpLink is not a passive Bitcoin or Ethereum custodian,” the report stated. “The company issues shares at a premium to NAV or repurchases them when prices are lower, using ETH reserves to generate on-chain returns.” Citizens described SharpLink’s model as a “flywheel mechanism” that could lift NAV per share as Ethereum’s ecosystem expands and institutional adoption accelerates. Strong Leadership and Institutional Confidence Citizens also praised SharpLink’s leadership, highlighting its mix of crypto-native innovation and traditional finance discipline. The company is chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and co-led by former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom, combining deep blockchain expertise with institutional experience. The analysts wrote that SharpLink’s leadership is “ideally positioned to scale the Ethereum treasury model, merging the flexibility of crypto with the rigor of capital markets.” To strengthen its balance sheet, SharpLink raised $76.5 million in a direct offering priced at a premium to market value. Citizens said the move reinforces institutional confidence in SharpLink’s governance model and Ethereum-driven strategy. With its hybrid of on-chain leverage and off-chain discipline, SharpLink could emerge as a top-performing equity proxy for Ethereum’s growth — offering traditional investors a new way to gain exposure to blockchain-based assets.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 11:13:40

The announcement, made by Governor Kathy Hochul on Thursday, marks a major step in what’s being called the largest private investment in New York’s history. The two-mile line will deliver the power needed for the massive Micron facility, which is projected to create more than 50,000 jobs over the next two decades, including 9,000 direct roles within the company itself. Hochul said the state is “moving quickly ahead with all due speed and deliberation,” describing the project as one that will transform Central New York . The Public Service Commission also approved environmental and construction plans for the first phase, which include expanding the Clay substation and installing new equipment to connect it to the plant. The approval follows a 2022 agreement between Micron and New York State, when the company chose the region to house its advanced chip factory aimed at producing one in four U.S.-made semiconductors by 2030. Micron halts data center chip supply to China after 2023 ban While Micron is expanding at home, the company is cutting off its data center chip supply to China after the business failed to recover from Beijing’s 2023 ban on its products in critical infrastructure. The ban effectively locked Micron out of a market worth billions, and it hasn’t bounced back since. The decision follows ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, which have intensified since 2018, when Donald Trump first imposed tariffs on Chinese imports and the U.S. began targeting Chinese tech firms with security claims. Micron was the first American chipmaker targeted by Beijing, a move widely viewed as retaliation for Washington’s export controls meant to limit China’s semiconductor progress. Nvidia and Intel have also been accused by Chinese authorities of posing security risks, though neither has faced direct action. Micron said the data center division “had been impacted by the ban” and reaffirmed that it complies with all local regulations wherever it operates. Even with the exit, Micron will keep selling chips to two Chinese clients that run data centers outside China, one of which is Lenovo. The company earned $3.4 billion, about 12% of its annual revenue, from mainland China last year and plans to continue serving automotive and mobile phone manufacturers in the country. Micron faces AI competition losses but stays active in China The Chinese ban forced Micron to miss out on the country’s AI-driven data center boom, which jumped ninefold to 24.7 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) in 2024, according to the Reuters report. That surge benefited Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix , and Chinese chipmakers YMTC and CXMT, all of which have been expanding aggressively with government backing. Even as it lost ground in China, Micron’s global business has been lifted by demand from AI data centers elsewhere, pushing the company to report record quarterly revenue this year. A company insider familiar with the operations allegedly said that over 300 people work on Micron’s China data center team, though it’s unclear how many jobs will be affected by the restructuring. In August, Micron laid off several hundred employees in its universal flash storage division after deciding to end development of mobile NAND products globally. Yet, Micron is not walking away entirely, the company continues to expand its packaging plant in Xian, keeping its local operations active. “We have a strong operating and customer presence in China, and China remains an important market for Micron and the semiconductor industry in general,” Micron said in its statement.

Rząd reaguje na falę oszustw,https://bitcoinist.com/australia-wypowiada-wojne-bankomatom-kryptowalutowym/,"Kryptowaluty narzędziem przestępstw? Australia postanowiła ograniczyć działalność bankomatów kryptowalutowych. Powodem jest gwałtowny wzrost liczby oszustw i nadużyć. Agencja AUSTRAC oraz australijska policja federalna poinformowały, że maszyny umożliwiające wymianę gotówki na cyfrowe aktywa stały się celem przestępców. Coraz częściej wykorzystywane są do prania pieniędzy i wyłudzeń. Australia wypowiada wojnę bankomatom kryptowalutowym. Jak wpłynie to na całą branżę? Nowe regulacje i ograniczenia Władze Australii wprowadziły nowe przepisy . Mają one przeciwdziałać nadużyciom. Zgodnie z raportami, na wielu bankomatach wprowadzono limit 5 000 dolarów australijskich na jedną transakcję . Operatorzy muszą teraz stosować także wzmocnione procedury identyfikacji użytkowników. Na ekranach urządzeń pojawiają się też wyraźne ostrzeżenia przed oszustwami. AUSTRAC utworzyła specjalną grupę zadaniową do kontroli operatorów. W miejscu, gdzie wykryto nieprawidłowości, nakazano wstrzymanie działalności lub cofnięto licencje. Nie będziemy odnawiać zezwoleń dla podmiotów, które nie spełniają standardów bezpieczeństwa – oświadczyła agencja w komunikacie prasowym. Główni poszkodowani seniorzy Problem ma wymiar społeczny. Dane pokazują, że rocznie przez australijskie bankomaty kryptowalutowe przepływa około 275 milionów dolarów australijskich . Ze wspomnianej kwoty aż 99% to wpłaty gotówkowe. To bardzo wymowne liczby. W samej Tasmanii 15 osób straciło łącznie 2,5 miliona dolarów w serii oszustw, a jedna z ofiar oddała przestępcom 750 000 dolarów. Australia wypowiada wojnę bankomatom kryptowalutowym? Oszustwa dotykają przede wszystkim seniorów. Średni wiek poszkodowanych wynosił 65 lat. Schemat działania oszustów jest bardzo podobny. Fałszywy konsultant telefoniczny nakłania do wpłaty gotówki do bankomatu kryptowalutowego, po czym środki są natychmiast przesyłane do zagranicznych portfeli, często niemożliwych do namierzenia. Luka w systemie i trudności z odzyskaniem środków Australijskie służby podkreślają, że gdy tylko gotówka zostanie zamieniona na kryptowalutę, odzyskanie środków jest prawie niemożliwe . Pieniądze są błyskawicznie transferowane do innych portfeli, mieszane w transakcjach on-chain i często kończą w jurysdykcjach, które nie współpracują z australijskimi organami ścigania. Z tego powodu rząd i instytucje finansowe apelują o większą ostrożność przy inwestowaniu w aktywa cyfrowe. Jednocześnie zaznaczają, że same kryptowaluty nie są problemem – kluczowe jest to, jak i gdzie są kupowane oraz przechowywane. Rosnąca potrzeba bezpieczeństwa w świecie krypto Rosnące ryzyko oszustw sprawia, że użytkownicy coraz częściej szukają bezpiecznych i zdecentralizowanych rozwiązań , które pozwalają zachować pełną kontrolę nad swoimi aktywami. W tym kontekście pojawia się coraz więcej nowoczesnych portfeli kryptowalutowych, które stawiają na przejrzystość i ochronę danych użytkownika. Jednym z narzędzi, które zyskało w ostatnich miesiącach dużą popularność wśród inwestorów, jest Best Wallet . Wspomniany projekt to decentralizowany portfel kryptowalutowy oparty na blockchainie Ethereum. Aplikacja pozwala nie tylko przechowywać i wymieniać kryptowaluty, ale także śledzić rynek, analizować trendy i uczestniczyć w nowych projektach DeFi. Best Wallet – bezpieczeństwo, prostota i kontrola Best Wallet to portfel typu non-custodial , co oznacza, że użytkownik samodzielnie zarządza swoimi kluczami prywatnymi i nie musi przechodzić procesu weryfikacji tożsamości. W świecie, w którym kradzieże cyfrowych aktywów sięgają miliardów dolarów rocznie, takie rozwiązanie daje poczucie niezależności i ochrony. Portfel oferuje szereg zabezpieczeń – od czterocyfrowego kodu PIN, przez blokadę biometryczną (Face ID lub odcisk palca), aż po funkcję ukrywania tokenów uznanych za spam lub potencjalne oszustwo. Co ważne, Best Wallet nigdy nie prosi użytkowników o ujawnianie kluczy prywatnych, co znacząco minimalizuje ryzyko phishingu. Nowa era inwestowania i token $BEST Ekosystem Best Wallet rozwija się dynamicznie, a jego centralnym elementem jest token $BEST , działający w sieci Ethereum. Token umożliwia dostęp do ekskluzywnych funkcji, stakingu z atrakcyjnym oprocentowaniem (nawet do 300%) oraz udziału w airdropach. Co ciekawe, przedsprzedaż kryptowalut w ramach projektu rozpoczęła się w listopadzie 2024 roku i przyciągnęła uwagę inwestorów z całego świata. Zainteresowanie nie dziwi – Best Wallet łączy prostotę z innowacyjnością, a jego ekosystem obejmuje również wbudowaną zdecentralizowaną giełdę (DEX), dostęp do aplikacji Web 3.0 i możliwość handlu tokenami bez konieczności korzystania z zewnętrznych platform. Jak inwestorzy mogą chronić swoje środki? Rosnąca liczba oszustw, takich jak te związane z bankomatami kryptowalutowymi w Australii, to sygnał ostrzegawczy dla całego rynku. Eksperci podkreślają, że kluczem do bezpieczeństwa jest świadome zarządzanie aktywami oraz wybór narzędzi, które gwarantują pełną kontrolę nad funduszami. Użytkownicy coraz częściej zadają sobie pytanie, jak zakupić kryptowaluty w sposób bezpieczny i przejrzysty. Odpowiedzią na to wyzwanie mogą być właśnie zdecentralizowane portfele, takie jak Best Wallet, które eliminują pośredników i minimalizują ryzyko utraty danych. Opinie użytkowników i rozwój projektu Recenzje Best Wallet w sklepach Google Play i App Store są w przeważającej większości pozytywne. Użytkownicy chwalą intuicyjny interfejs, łatwość obsługi i brak konieczności przechodzenia weryfikacji KYC. Wysoko oceniana jest także integracja z DeFi, dzięki której można uczestniczyć w nowych projektach czy stakingu bez wychodzenia z aplikacji. Dodatkowo, twórcy Best Wallet zapowiadają wprowadzenie szeregu nowych funkcji, takich jak agregator stakingu, analityka rynkowa, rozszerzenie przeglądarkowe czy nawet obsługa NFT. Te innowacje mają sprawić, że Best Wallet stanie się jednym z najbardziej kompletnych narzędzi do zarządzania kryptowalutami na rynku. Co dalej z australijskim rynkiem krypto? Decyzja rządu Australii o zaostrzeniu przepisów może wyznaczyć trend, który stanie się punktem odniesienia dla innych państw. Chociaż działania władz mają na celu ochronę konsumentów, eksperci ostrzegają, że zbyt restrykcyjne podejście może spowolnić rozwój innowacji w sektorze blockchain. Z drugiej strony, sytuacja pokazuje, jak ważne jest wdrażanie rozwiązań, pozwalających użytkownikom zachować niezależność finansową. W tym kontekście portfele takie jak Best Wallet mogą odegrać kluczową rolę w budowaniu zaufania do całej branży. W świecie, w którym regulacje stają się coraz bardziej rygorystyczne, wybór odpowiedniego narzędzia ma znaczenie większe niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej. Niezależnie od tego, czy korzystasz z bankomatów kryptowalutowych, czy handlujesz na najlepszej giełdzie kryptowalut .",Legislation,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-17 11:26:08

Bitcoin’s price reacted with an immediate uptick that pushed it from its multi-week bottom (on most exchanges) back to $106,000. Recall the developments that took place last Friday when the POTUS threatened China with a new wave of tariffs, which were later made official with a starting date of November 1. Some Chinese products were supposed to be taxed at over 100%. This political turmoil caused an immediate crash in the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin stood above $122,000 but crumbled below $117,000 within minutes, and then the cascading effect of billions of dollars in overleveraged positions drove it even further south to under $110,000 on most exchanges and all the way down to $101,000 on Binance. Further reports on the matter revealed that this might have been one big misunderstanding between Beijing and Washington, and the tension between the two superpowers began to de-escalate. Just minutes ago, Trump was asked whether the 100% tariffs on China will stand. He responded with a “No,” and added that “I think we will be fine with China.” Both countries’ presidents are supposed to meet in two weeks. BREAKING: President Trump was just asked if his 100% tariff on China will stand.

Among the coins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have captured the spotlight, but for very different reasons. Dogecoin, continues to thrive on community enthusiasm and retail-driven rallies, yet its growth remains tied to market sentiment. Over the years, Dogecoin has maintained a loyal base of supporters and a strong social media presence, which has often triggered sudden price spikes. However, its lack of structured utility and heavy reliance on influencer-driven narratives have made its long-term trajectory unpredictable compared to utility-focused projects. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is earning recognition for its real-world utility and next-generation DeFi model that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending within one ecosystem. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 70% sold out and $17.45 million raised, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as one of the top crypto to buy now for investors seeking substantial upside. As speculative tokens fade and utility-driven projects rise, Mutuum Finance is increasingly seen as the best cryptocurrency to buy for those aiming to turn a modest $100 into a potential five-figure portfolio by 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction: Waiting for a Breakout Following the Rebound in Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing renewed recovery attempts after having another downward correction from the $0.25 resistance zone where selling has routinely capped its rallies. The meme token now has solid support around $0.18, building a crucial range between $0.18 and $0.25 that traders are interested for direction. A confirmed breakout above the level may revive the previous bull run that ensued for the year by restoring investor confidence and causing renewed buying interest. Should momentum stall, however, DOGE may become stuck in a trading zone where bulls and bears battle for supremacy. With Dogecoin stabilizing in this most crucial area, however, most investors are already finding newer options like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — projects that celebrate innovation, sustainability, and the potential for greater long-run returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Heads the Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains trending in crypto news today, fast becoming one of the hottest DeFi projects to watch and a serious contender for crypto to buy now. Investor interest is soaring, with over 17,220 participants depositing over $17.45 million in the current presale. This tidal wave of response reflects the increased confidence and faith in the long-term vision and sustainable ecosystem architecture of Mutuum Finance, making it one of the best cryptocurrency to buy for strategic investors. MUTM Leaderboard Update Top 5 investors in the last 24 hours have made spectacular investments with $796, $535, $505, $474, and $440 in MUTM tokens respectively. Healthy participation such as this serves as evidence of the rising worldwide hype in Mutuum Finance’s presale and how it is becoming one of the brightest areas in the DeFi space highlighted in crypto news today. This kind of activity reinforces its position as a top crypto to buy now for investors seeking growth and early adoption opportunities. Top-ranked player of the day’s leaderboard wins a $500 MUTM token reward. Eligibility requires a minimum of a trade in the 24-hour period. This new feature creates day-to-day activity through the incentivizing of regular investors and provides the project additional momentum in the current presale. With its expanding community and strong performance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to be recognized as the best cryptocurrency to buy by analysts tracking promising DeFi assets. Lending and Borrowing Protocol Implementation in Q4 2025 Mutuum Finance is also gearing up to release its next prominent success, the release of its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol . Its initial version (V1) will be released on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025. Its basic DeFi building blocks of the product like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot will be a part of the initial release. ETH and USDT will be available for borrowability, lendability, and collateralization from day one, providing rapid, scalable, and easy-to-use DeFi for retail and institutional users. Mutuum Finance has raised $17.45M from 17,220 investors to date, and Phase 6 has sold a whopping 70% by itself. Top day buys of $796 and $535 show fantastic momentum.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $1.12. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.82 with an average trading price of $1.75. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency lost 11.52% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.171 level. As of October 17, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a strong downtrend. The meme coin’s price plunged to $0.176 today, representing a significant 11.52% loss since it closed near the $0.188 level yesterday. This downtrend indicates negative market sentiment, as losses have been massive today; however, the coin may find support around the $0.171 zone as it continues to fall toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bearish trend with intense selling pressure, as sellers are currently leading the market. The cryptocurrency’s price decreased to $0.176 today. Red candlesticks on the chart signify selling pressure. Negative sentiment is currently prevailing, as the token’s price is falling rapidly. DOGE/USD 1-day Price Chart. Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance is high, leading to high volatility levels. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the resistance level, has shifted to $0.284, whereas its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.171. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the lower neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 33.72 in the past 24 hours. The indicator does not give a selling indication as it moves towards the oversold region, as the overall market sentiment is negative today. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour chart for Dogecoin also shows a downtrend with bears leading the market throughout the day. Selling pressure remains present below the SMA, which is evident from several red candlesticks. The DOGE/USD pair is facing increasing volatility as it approaches the $0.175 level on an hourly basis. This increased volatility signals more volatile price movements in the coming hours. Seller dominance is currently pushing the DOGE price toward the local support of $0.171. DOGE/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: Tradingview The Bollinger Bands are diverging, leading to increased volatility levels. This divergence signifies increased market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger Band is now at $0.211, which indicates the resistance level. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band is at $0.179, showing the broken support level. The RSI indicator has entered the oversold area on the 4-hour chart. Over the last four hours, its value has dropped to 27.26. This situation hints at seller dominance, and further depreciation seems possible if sellers keep selling assets.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased to $0.176 in the past 24 hours. If sellers dominate the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further losses and may retest the $0.171 support. On the other hand, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may jump towards the resistance of $0.196 by the next trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.513038–$0.652958 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.176 over the last 24 hours as sellers tried to maintain resistance around $0.188 and succeeded. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.349799 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,175.58 DOGE in October; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.82 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinions on Dogecoin Cryptopolitan reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked issuers to withdraw DOGE ETF filings under new listing rules, along with some other crypto-related ETF filings. The regulator is introducing generic standards to replace 19b-4 reviews to speed up ETF approval.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214.

Canadian businessman and TV personality O’Leary said in a recent interview posted on X that he witnessed congestion, which left Ethereum users paying heavy gas fees just to process small transactions. “Over the past weekend, I witnessed something every crypto investor should pay attention to. Ethereum, the largest blockchain in the world, got congested, and fees skyrocketed past $1,000 just to process small transactions. That’s like paying a thousand-dollar toll to drive on a one-lane highway,” O’Leary wrote . What was seen, according to the millionaire, proves Ethereum cracks under pressure when real traffic hits the network. “Over a decade, we’ve talked about going on-chain, and now with real-world adoption finally happening, the cracks are showing. Innovation is about building infrastructure that can actually handle scale.” O’Leary talks Genius Act results and real world blockchain adoption In a video interview posted on his brief explainer on X Thursday, Kevin O’Leary linked the scalability issue to what he coined “growing on-chain adoption fueled by recent legislation.” “I anticipate that you’re going to be crashing Wall Street with the blockchain with crypto. We’ve been talking about going on-chain for 12 years, but it never happened. But now, with the stimulus of the Genius Act, for the first time ever, people are starting to use it as a digital payment system,” the businessman explained. According to O’Leary, blockchain-based payments require transactions to move “on-chain,” through networks such as Ethereum and Solana. “So over the weekend, and the reason I bring it up, a concern that I’ve had for a long time, and I’ve seen before, is that Ethereum , the biggest blockchain, got overloaded, overcrowded.” O’Leary likened Ethereum’s congestion to a one-lane toll road overwhelmed by heavy traffic. “Ethereum is a single-lane highway and all the cars are transactions on it, but they have to go through the authentication toll booth out in the middle of nowhere. It works fine when there’s not massive volatility or massive volume. But when we had that occur on Saturday, it got stuck.” He added that users had to pay higher fees to move their transactions to the front of the queue, which drove gas fees to extreme levels. “That’s how you tell it’s stuck, because you can buy your way to the front of the car line to get through the toll. One of those transactions traded for more than a thousand dollars. Imagine if you’re buying something for a dollar fifty, and you had to pay a thousand to use Ethereum. That’s screwed up.” Ethereum dev says Layer 1 is not meant for high traffic Several Ethereum community members responded to O’Leary’s sentiment to defend the blockchain’s long-term scalability plans. One developer, Adriano Feria, said Ethereum’s main Layer 1 is not designed to handle everyday retail transactions. “Ethereum’s L1 is not meant to handle retail traffic. It is the final settlement layer for the on-chain economy, focused on security, neutrality, and auditability. Scalability happens on L2s, which already process close to 300 transactions per second across rollups and is a couple of months away from scaling another 8x,” Feria remarked . He also mentioned Ethereum’s broader ecosystem includes several Layer 2 rollups, which handle most retail and high-frequency transactions before settling final results on the Ethereum main chain. “We have already seen a high level of retail on Coinbase, Visa, BlackRock, Sony, Deutsche Bank, and Ant Digital, who are all building or settling on Ethereum or its rollup ecosystem. Billions in stablecoins, RWAs, and tokenized funds like BlackRock’s BUIDL already rely on Ethereum security.” Feria also bashed the idea that scalability should be Ethereum’s top priority because large institutions prioritize reliability and security over raw throughput. “Scalability is not the main priority for all use cases and users,” he said. “Institutional settlement needs maximum security, liveness, and permanence, which is why Ethereum’s L1 is still the ‘default’ network for their operations.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|ETH|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-17 11:31:45

While most investors are retreating after the latest selloff, real estate mogul Grant Cardone is adding aggressively. His firm, Cardone Capital, purchased another 200 BTC this week, following a 300 BTC acquisition just days earlier, signaling confidence while others hesitate. CardoneCapital just confirm another 200 BTC after buying 300 last week. pic.twitter.com/CyleoOaWDN — Grant Cardone (@GrantCardone) October 16, 2025 In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine , Cardone described BTC as a “multiplier of wealth,” comparing money to attention; both must be captured, stored, and multiplied to build lasting value. He views holding cash as a losing game: “Saving it doesn’t keep it because it’s going down in value,” he said, arguing that fiat erodes wealth over time. Blending Real Estate and BTC Cardone’s investment approach stands apart. Rather than buying crypto directly, he uses cash flow from income-producing properties to accumulate BTC. Monthly rental income is reinvested into BTC, effectively turning tenants into indirect contributors to the fund’s digital asset holdings. Each fund starts with roughly 15% allocated to BTC, expanding gradually to a 50/50 mix of real estate and crypto over several years. This approach leverages real estate’s steady returns with Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, a balance Cardone believes can outperform traditional portfolios. “Our renters are buying the investors Bitcoin,” he explained. “It’s real estate merged with Bitcoin, not backed by it.” This structure offers investors exposure to BTC without managing custody or wallets directly, earning comparisons to “MicroStrategy for real estate investors.” Bitcoin Price Prediction: Triangle Breakdown Hits $103K As discussed in my previous forecast , BTC/USD has already extended its decline, reaching the projected $105,000 and $103,500 support targets. The drop followed a confirmed triangle breakdown, marking a decisive shift in short-term momentum. BTC remains trapped within a descending channel, with the 20- and 50-period EMAs reinforcing downward pressure as both slope lower. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI near 25 shows oversold conditions, hinting at possible relief. Still, without a confirmed bullish reversal, BTC could consolidate between $103,500 and $107,400 before choosing direction. Resistance sits at $107,500 and $110,800; failure to break above could pull prices back toward $101,600–$99,000. Traders are watching this range for stability, and while near-term sentiment remains cautious, institutional accumulation and oversold signals suggest this correction could form the base for Bitcoin’s next recovery heading into Q4. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013125 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Hold or Enter a New Bear Market,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-now-sits-on-its-50-week-support-hold-or-enter-a-new-bear-market/,"In a recent analysis shared on X, crypto market analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) presented a detailed chart comparing XRP’s current price movement to a previous market phase. The chart, labeled, features a 50-week simple moving average (SMA) shown in yellow and a series of parallel patterns that suggest a possible repetition of past behavior. The post emphasized XRP’s current proximity to its 50-week SMA, describing it as a critical point that could determine whether the asset maintains its upward structure or transitions into another bear market. The analysis used a side-by-side comparison of the 2020-2021 and 2024-2025 market periods, illustrating recurring technical behavior in both price movement and timing. The chart highlighted XRP’s interaction with the long-term moving average as the primary indicator guiding this assessment. BREAKING: $XRP NOW SITS ON ITS 50-WEEK SUPPORT. HOLD — OR ENTER A NEW BEAR MARKET. pic.twitter.com/SG91u1q3PX — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 14, 2025 Comparing 2020-2021 to 2024-2025 According to the chart, XRP’s price in late 2020 broke above the 50-week SMA before accelerating sharply during the 2021 bull market. The current data shows a similar setup, with the price once again testing the 50-week moving average from above. The annotated circles and arrows on the graph indicate points where XRP previously rebounded from this level, suggesting that this technical area has served as both a confirmation of strength and a risk threshold. At the time of the post, XRP traded around $2.42, with the 50-week SMA positioned near $2.45. This proximity suggests a tight technical range, where a sustained close below the average could imply a weakening trend, while a rebound could reinforce bullish confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context and Technical Significance Moving averages play a critical role in long-term technical analysis. The 50-week SMA often represents a key dividing line between bullish and bearish conditions. Traders typically view price action above this average as an indication of momentum and strength , while a breakdown below it can suggest a shift toward weakness. Steph’s comparison of historical and current phases drew attention to how XRP’s movement often rhymes with historical patterns . In early 2021, after reclaiming the 50-week line, XRP entered a sharp upward trend prior to a retracement. The current setup reflects a similar dynamic, though the environment in 2025 comprises distinct market factors, including regulatory developments and overall crypto sentiment. Should the price maintain support above the 50-week SMA, the chart implies potential continuation of the upward phase seen earlier in the decade. Conversely, a failure to hold above this level could align with the start of a new corrective period. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The integration allows users to connect their Solana wallets and trade SOL tokens directly from the Uniswap Web App, removing the need to switch platforms. This move comes as part of Uniswap’s broader strategy to simplify decentralized finance and enhance cross-chain accessibility for users. Unified DeFi Experience Across Blockchains Previously, Uniswap users had to exit the platform to trade assets on Solana. According to the blog post , with this upgrade, Uniswap now supports Ethereum, Solana, Base, and Unichain from a single interface. This expansion aims to solve the fragmentation challenge in decentralized finance, where networks often operate in isolation. Consequently, the update simplifies access for traders, streamlines user interaction, and encourages broader participation in multi-chain markets. The latest integration marks the first phase of a larger plan that includes future developments such as bridging, cross-chain swaps, and Uniswap Wallet compatibility with Solana. These steps are expected to strengthen liquidity flow between networks, fostering interoperability and scalability within the DeFi ecosystem. Solana’s Role in DeFi Growth Since its 2020 debut, Solana has become one of the most active Layer 1 networks in decentralized finance. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees have drawn both developers and institutional players. The network’s growth positions it as a major competitor to Ethereum in areas such as decentralized trading, NFTs, and payment solutions. Solana’s Market and Technical Outlook Despite the major announcement, Solana’s price has slipped in the past 24 hours. SOL currently trades around $175.68 , down over 10% daily and nearly 20% for the week. Its market capitalization stands at $96 billion with a trading volume exceeding $11 billion. However, analysts suggest this pullback could precede a bullish breakout. Source: X According to Bull Bear Spot, the Solana (SOL/USDT) chart compared to M2 Global Liquidity shows a strong bullish divergence. While global liquidity trends upward, Solana appears to be consolidating near a critical support zone at $176–$182. The next resistance lies around $187–$190, and a breakout above this range could open targets near $240 and $280. Historically, Solana’s price has responded positively to global liquidity growth, hinting that a surge may be on the horizon.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|UNI|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 11:58:04

Following this decline, some investors are exiting the market, while others are searching for potential dips. At this point, cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment announced that there was exceptionally high and low activity in some altcoins. At this point, Santiment noted that altcoins currently experiencing high on-chain volatility could be a great buy signal considering that almost all of the cryptocurrencies have been trending back over the past week. Santiment analysts stated that, according to the shared table, altcoins shown in dark red are networks with high activity, while those in dark blue are networks with low activity. Accordingly, the networks with the highest activity were ranked as follows: FTX Token (FTT) WAX PAX Gold Origintrail Synthetix Euler XYO YFI Status Bounce The altcoins with the lowest activity were listed as follows: Multi Collateral DAI (On BNB) Nexus Mutual Rocketpool Lido DAO Maker Staked Ethereum MX Token Clearpool USDD Chromia Lastly, when a token is hot (i.e., seeing high network activity), a recovery is likely. If its price is outperforming the market, a correction is very likely. However, if its price is underperforming (i.e., falling along with the rest of the market), this is a buy signal. Conversely, if a token is cold, meaning it sees low network activity, it is likely to see the same direction. Buy the dip opportunities are arising after a week of crypto decline.

A portion of the proceeds is likely to be used to buy more ETH. SharpLink Raises $76.5 Million To Buy More Ethereum According to an announcement made earlier today, SharpLink Gaming has entered into a securities purchase agreement with an unknown institutional investor for the purchase and sale of 4.5 million shares of its common stock. Notably, the Minneapolis-based firm stated that it had sold shares for $17 per share, a 12% premium above its market rate of $15.5 recorded in the closing hours of trading on October 15. It is also at a premium to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the firm’s current holdings of 840,124 ETH. The offering is expected to close on October 17, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Commenting on the development, Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of SharpLink said: This is a novel equity sale transaction that is both accretive to stockholders and strategically structured, reflecting strong institutional confidence in SharpLink and our long-term vision. By raising equity at a meaningful premium to both market price and NAV, we’re able to continue accumulating ETH and increasing ETH-per-share for our investors. He added that Ethereum adoption continues to grow among both retail and institutional investors, across different verticals such as stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized assets. Following today’s announcement, SharpLink shares are slightly down, trading at $15.07 at the time of writing. However, the shares are up an impressive 445% over the past six months, largely driven by an increase in the price of ETH. As mentioned earlier, SharpLink is currently ranked second among publicly-traded firms in terms of the amount of ETH held in their treasuries. BitMine Technologies continues to lead the pack, with more than three million ETH on its balance sheet, according to data from Coingecko. Is Crypto Treasury Still The Play? The practice of companies developing crypto treasury strategies has become increasingly popular over the past few years. It picked up pace following the victory of pro-crypto Donald Trump in the November 2024 US presidential election. This trend is not just limited to leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), or Ethereum, but companies are also exploring crypto treasury strategies focused on other altcoins such as Solana (SOL) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) . That said, some warning signs have the investors doubting the benefits of a crypto-focused treasury strategy on a company’s finances. For instance, recently, Metaplanet’s valuation fell below the value of the total BTC it holds on its balance sheet. Similarly, Michael Saylor’s Strategy’s shares – the largest publicly-listed firm in the world by amount of BTC held – have also shown poor performance over the past few months. At press time, ETH trades at $3,921, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|avalanche|bitcoin|BitMine|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|ETH|Ethereum Adoption|ETHUSDT|Sharplink|solana|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-17 12:00:25
53274118,334036,1760702449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/53274118.jpeg,Bitcoin.h Formalizes Commitment to Digital Scarcity With Launch of Fixed-Supply Framework,https://chainwire.org/2025/10/17/bitcoin-h-formalizes-commitment-to-digital-scarcity-with-launch-of-fixed-supply-framework/,"Austin, Texas, October 17th, 2025, Bitcoin.h (BTC.h) , a sustainable digital asset built on the Hedera Hashgraph network, announced the launch of its Fixed-Supply Framework, formalizing its commitment to transparent digital scarcity as an alternative to complex inflationary tokenomics. The framework establishes an immutable supply of 21 million tokens with no mining, staking rewards, or founder inflation mechanisms. Addressing Complexity Fatigue in Crypto Economics The cryptocurrency industry has increasingly adopted complex staking protocols, token emissions schedules, and inflationary mechanisms that create stakeholder uncertainty and obscure true scarcity. These systems often prioritize feature additions over fundamental economic clarity, leaving participants unable to assess long-term value propositions. Bitcoin.h's Fixed-Supply Framework eliminates this complexity by providing a pure economic model where all 21 million tokens are fully minted and immutable through Hedera Token Service. The framework removes variable supply dynamics entirely, creating verifiable scarcity without ongoing emissions or protocol-driven inflation. “The Fixed-Supply Framework isn't just a technical specification, it’s a declaration of principle. We've built a digital asset where the rules are clear, the supply is fixed. Bitcoin.h was built on that foundation, a transparent, finite digital asset with immutable rules” said John Ortmann, Member of Bitcoin HT, LLC. Leveraging Hedera for Sustainable Scarcity The framework utilizes Hedera Hashgraph's native token service to ensure immutability while delivering sustainable infrastructure. Hedera processes over 10,000 transactions per second using approximately 0.000003 kWh per transaction, addressing environmental concerns that have plagued Proof-of-Work systems. The quantum-resistant SHA-384 cryptography provides long-term security against emerging computational threats, positioning Bitcoin.h as infrastructure designed for future technological landscapes rather than just current market conditions. Transparent Economics for Mainstream Adoption The Fixed-Supply Framework targets stakeholders seeking straightforward digital scarcity without navigating complex reward mechanisms. By eliminating staking yields, mining schedules, and emissions curves, Bitcoin.h provides economic clarity comparable to traditional scarce assets while maintaining the blockchain's technological advantages. This approach appeals particularly to participants who feel they missed early Bitcoin adoption opportunities, offering a second entry point into fixed-supply digital currency without the environmental concerns or quantum vulnerabilities of legacy systems. Bitcoin.h tokens are currently available for trading on a growing list of exchanges, including Biconomy.com, CoinEx, SaucerSwap, and several other DEXs. Additional information about the Fixed-Supply Framework and transparency initiatives are available at Bitcoin.h’s website . About Bitcoin.h Bitcoin.h (BTC.h) is a sustainable, quantum-resilient digital asset built on the Hedera Hashgraph network with a fixed supply of 21 million tokens. Designed as a practical and eco-conscious alternative to legacy cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin.ℏ combines digital scarcity with modern energy efficiency and security standards.

Oktobrī Bitcoin cena nokritās zem 106 000 ASV dolāru atzīmes. Jauni investori baidās no tirgus krīzes, bet pieredzējuši investori zina, ka šis ir viens no labākajiem laikiem, lai iegādātos žetonus par zemākām cenām. Pieredzējuši investori veic uzkrājumus projektos, kas apvieno dinamiku ar reālu ilgtermiņa lietderību. Mēmu iepriekšpārdošanas sektorā līderis ir Maxi Doge (MAXI), kas tikai dažu nedēļu laikā ICO ir piesaistījis 3,6 miljonus dolāru. Blue-Chip kriptovalūtas piedzīvo peļņas fiksēšanu Liela kapitāla kriptovalūtas pašreizējā tirgus korekcijā saskārušās ar paplašinātu peļņas fiksēšanu. Nedēļas grafikā Bitcoin cena samazinājās par 13,08 %, Ethereum samazinājās par 13,03 % līdz aptuveni 3787 dolāriem, bet BNB, XRP un SOL piedzīvoja attiecīgi 15,1%, 19% un 17,81% samazinājumu. Pēdējās 24 stundās kopējā kriptovalūtu tirgus kapitalizācija samazinājās vēl par 5,29 % līdz 3,58 triljoniem ASV dolāru, un bailes pieauga, jo CMC kriptovalūtu baiļu un alkatības indekss ir vienāds ar 28 (bailes). Pieaugot nenoteiktībai, tirgotāji jau meklē nākamo uzvarētāju, pirms tirgus stabilizējas. Kriptovalūtu blogeris Skots Melkers (Scott Melker) nesenā analīzē atzina, ka pēc lielākās kriptovalūtu likvidācijas vēsturē tirgus elastība šķiet gandrīz brīnumaina. Neskatoties uz bailēm, tas nav lēto akciju tirgus, bet gan strukturāla pārkārtošanās, kas liek investoriem pārdomāt risku. Ņemot vērā pieaugošo institucionālo interesi un spēcīgos pamatrādītājus, Melkers paliek optimistisks, iegādājoties kritumu un uzticoties pacietībai, lai uzvarētu. Labākā kriptovalūta, ko iegādāties tagad 2025. gada oktobrī Maxi Doge šķiet gatavs vadīt mēmu nozares nākotni. Kriptovalūtu tirgū notiekot peļņas fiksēšanai, Maxi Doge ir saglabājis savu dinamiku, piesaistot vairāk nekā 3,6 miljonus dolāru. Šis jaunais mēms nav tipiska mēmu monēta; tajā tiek izmantota hype enerģija un kopienas noskaņojums kopā ar spēcīgu tirgus dinamiku. Maxi Doge ir jauna zema kapitāla mēmu monēta , kas piešķir unikālu pagriezienu Dogecoin stāstam, koncentrējoties uz nākotnes darījumu tirdzniecību. Ņemot vērā pieaugošo ažiotāžu ap 1000x sviras tirdzniecību, MAXI laiks nevarētu būt labāks. Priekšplānā ir “Maxi”, muskuļots, sporta zāles Doge variants, kas humoristiski attēlo mūsdienu bezbailīgo tirgotāju, kurš cenšas gūt gan finansiālus, gan fiziskus ieguvumus. Ja MAXI saglabās savu sākotnējo dinamiku līdz DEX palaišanai, tā spēcīgais zīmols un atlīdzības modelis var izraisīt ievērojamu tirdzniecības aktivitātes pieaugumu.

One minute you’re convinced of a breakout; the next, a sharp red candle tests every ounce of conviction. For XRP holders, this isn’t just about charts or technicals—it’s about mindset. As XRP continues its volatile trajectory amid Ripple’s expanding global influence, a question posed by crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO on X has struck a nerve: Are you mentally prepared for what comes next? A Deeper Look Into Steph’s Chart In his recent analysis shared on X, Steph highlighted an intense short-term scenario unfolding on the Bitstamp XRP/USD chart. According to the visual data, XRP recently plunged toward the $1.65 zone , rebounded strongly to around $2.42, and has since retraced to its current price of $2.22. Are you mentally prepared for this $XRP scenario? pic.twitter.com/hFrpLykmVN — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 16, 2025 The striking part of Steph’s analysis, however, lies in the projected worst-case scenario. His chart reveals a potential corrective move that could push XRP back to $1.65, testing deep liquidity and psychological support before a dramatic rebound that could send the asset above the $3.80 mark. This pattern—marked by a sharp capitulation followed by a rapid recovery—mirrors classic accumulation cycles seen before major price rallies. Why This Scenario Deserves Attention Steph’s projection is not random speculation. It’s grounded in the current market structure and XRP’s broader liquidity zones. Following Ripple’s recent acquisition of GTreasury and its continued expansion into global payment systems, institutional demand for on-chain settlement solutions is steadily increasing. However, in the short term, macroeconomic uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and exchange outflows have led to a cooling in trading volumes—creating the ideal setup for volatility spikes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The $1.60–$1.70 region represents a historically strong accumulation area, previously serving as a springboard during XRP’s last major leg up. If retested, this zone could either mark the point of maximum fear —or the foundation for XRP’s next major rally above $3.80, as Steph’s chart suggests. The Psychology of Holding Through Volatility Steph’s post implicitly challenges holders to assess not only their price targets but also their mental resilience. Can you hold through a 30–40% dip if you believe in a rebound? Are you ready to withstand short-term losses while holding out for the asset’s long-term value to drive up its price? These questions cut deeper than technical analysis—they touch on emotional discipline. Smart investors know that markets reward patience. XRP holders can manage the emotional impact of market fluctuations by setting realistic expectations, diversifying their portfolios, and predetermining their exit strategies. The Bottom Line Steph’s chart is more than a technical forecast—it’s a psychological mirror. It forces the XRP community to confront its emotional limits before the market does it for them. Whether XRP dips to $1.65 or rebounds toward $3.80, one truth remains: preparation—both strategic and mental—will determine who benefits from the next move. In a market that thrives on extremes, the best question you can ask isn’t “What’s the price target?” but “Am I ready for the journey there?” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

That’s what Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called the unseen threats lurking in the US financial system. On Wednesday, during an earnings call, Jamie warned that when you find one, you should assume more are hiding. His exact words: “I shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there’s probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.” That warning came as banks and investors were already dealing with fresh chaos linked to two ugly bankruptcies in September; Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender, and First Brands, a big-name auto parts supplier. These two collapses triggered a disaster that’s now hammering mid-sized banks, investment firms, and their shareholders. Zions and Western Alliance suffer from credit hits On Thursday, the fallout hit regional banks the hardest, dragging their stocks down fast. Zions Bancorporation fell by 13%, while Western Alliance dropped by nearly 10%. Those stock hits weren’t out of nowhere. On Wednesday, Zions had revealed it had taken a $50 million charge-off, wiping out two unpaid business loans through its California Bank & Trust division. The bank said it discovered “legal actions initiated by several banks and other lenders” linked to the two borrowers. An internal review flagged the issue, forcing the charge. No other comment came from Zions, which ignored further press questions. By Thursday, Western Alliance stepped into the mess. The bank filed a lawsuit “alleging fraud by the borrower” over a revolving credit facility given to Cantor Group V LLC. It stressed that this had “no relation to First Brands or Tricolor” and called it “an isolated credit incident.” But even with that clarification, the market still panicked. The timing couldn’t be worse. These disclosures landed on top of rising concern that credit conditions for commercial borrowers are weakening. Analysts and traders are now scanning for the next weak link. As more companies go under, banks are getting hit with unpaid loans and questionable counterparties. Jamie saw enough in his own shop to sound the alarm. On Tuesday, JPMorgan confirmed it took a $170 million charge-off tied to its wholesale lending to Tricolor. Jamie admitted to analysts: “It was not our finest moment.” Jefferies investment exposed to First Brands collapse While regional banks took visible hits, Jefferies Financial Group also got pulled into the mud. A court filing showed one of its asset management funds is owed $715 million by customers tied to First Brands. That was enough to tank Jefferies stock more than 10% on Thursday. Trying to put a cap on the damage, Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and President Brian Friedman sent a letter to shareholders. They broke down their actual exposure: $43 million in receivables and $2 million in interest from First Brands loans. They insisted the effect was “readily absorbable” and called the market’s reaction “meaningfully overdone.” Still, the drop didn’t stop. With tensions already high, Jamie’s comment about cockroaches only made Wall Street more nervous. Analysts spent the rest of the week pressing banks on how exposed they were to non-bank financial institutions, a sector that’s grown faster than any other in 2025. The Federal Reserve reports that non-bank lending is the leading driver of loan growth across the US banking system this year. On Thursday, KBW analysts wrote in a note that bank investors “are rightfully on high alert for any change in asset quality trends.” And David Chiaverini, a regional bank analyst at Jefferies, tried to offer a calmer view. He said these exposures “are getting attention,” but that “the way these loans are structured should protect the banks and lead to overall solid credit results.” Whether that’s true or not, the mood is clear; Wall Street’s nerves are shot. And after everything that’s hit banks from every direction this month, no one’s brushing off Jamie when he says the cockroaches aren’t done crawling out. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

In the following lines, we will touch upon three important factors that may give investors a clue as to what’s coming next. The Bullish Elements As of this writing, ADA is worth around $0.62 (per CoinGecko’s data), or a 24% decline on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has plunged to roughly $22.5 billion, meaning it is now the 11th-biggest cryptocurrency. ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), though, indicates a recovery might be knocking on the door. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes to estimate whether the token is overbought or oversold. It ranges from 0 to 100, with ratios around and below 30 indicating that the valuation has plummeted too rapidly in a short period, potentially signaling a resurgence. Conversely, readings above 70 are interpreted as bearish territory. Recently, ADA’s RSI dropped to almost 30. ADA RSI, Source: CryptoWaves The second positive sign is the asset’s performance by that time of the year. X user Sssebi reminded that ADA’s pump in 2024 started in November, suggesting that if history repeats itself, the asset might hit a new all-time high before the end of 2025. Last year the pump started in November If $ADA gets another pump like that, there’s a chance it reaches a new ATH this year. pic.twitter.com/wvfjleddnE — Sssebi (@Av_Sebastian) October 17, 2025 Something for the Bears However, some factors hint that the pullback could intensify in the short term. Earlier this week, X user Ali Martinez revealed that large investors (those holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA) have offloaded 350 million tokens in the span of just seven days. These whales now control less than 4 billion assets, or around 10% of the circulating supply. Their selling efforts might spread panic across the Cardano community and cause other smaller players to exit the ecosystem as well. In addition, these actions increase the amount of ADA tokens available on the market, and basic principles of the economy dictate that the price should head south in the event of non-increasing demand.

BTDR has surged over 200% in the past year, but current valuation may have outpaced fundamentals, warranting a Hold rating with a $29 price target. While BTDR is well-positioned for AI and Bitcoin tailwinds, peers like CleanSpark and Iris Energy offer stronger operational metrics and may be better alternatives. Risks include Bitcoin seasonality, market pullbacks, and execution challenges in AI HPC; a conservative approach is favored, with 11% upside potential. Bitdeer Technologies Group (BTDR) is a Bitcoin mining company that is currently diversifying its business into a high-demand, high-performance computing market. This is one of a few legacy miners that has decided to reduce dependency on Bitcoin and its volatility, and strengthen fundamentals with a focus on a high-growth, AI-tailored industry. BTDR surged by more than 200% over the past 12 months, underscoring a significant outperformance versus the benchmark. However, although I believe the company is tied to significant revenue tailwinds, driven by AI demand, and Bitcoin's seasonality and adoption, I am not sure whether this is the best alternative to raise exposure to AI and Bitcoin via the equity market. I believe Bitdeer Technologies may appear to be well-positioned to ride this AI wave, but I also think that sentiment may have run ahead of its fundamentals, and I would not be surprised if the stock consolidates over the following year. I rate Bitdeer Technologies Group a Hold with a $29 price target over the next year. This suggests about 11% upside potential. I think the stock price may appreciate in price further, but I also believe it may offer a market-like performance. HPC AI Pivot As A Catalyst, And Bitcoin Seasonality May Still Be In Play The company is not the only legacy Bitcoin miner that has decided to pivot to AI-related operations, diversifying its business and reducing dependency on digital assets. MARA Holdings , CleanSpark , Ire n Limited , Cipher Mining , and others have shifted to a high-demand landscape, and the market has rewarded them with an upside. BTDR: Stock Price Performance Versus Peers (Seeking Alpha) Bitdeer appears to be the 3rd best-performing miner in terms of stock price appreciation over the past year. This is also supported by a neutral thesis, as I think that there may be better alternatives in the landscape, which have not run the trend significantly yet. After about a 209% surge over a 12-month period, I would not be surprised if profit-taking could occur. To support my narrative of other appealing alternatives available, I would like to separate two business segments: Bitcoin mining and the AI/HPC pivot. I think investors who are seeking to diversify in Bitcoin mining operations may find CleanSpark a better fit. Bitdeer has recently announced its self-mined hashrate has reached 35 EH/s , which appears to be impressive, yet CLSK operates at 50 EH/s capacity , highlighting an advantage. If long-term investors are seeking AI/HPC exposure, IREN Ltd may appear to be a more favorable opportunity, highlighting it has paused BTC mining operations expansion at 50 EH/s with a more direct focus on the HPC market. BTDR: Revenue (TTM) Versus Peers (YCharts) Although I think it may be difficult to compare one company to another, I think it may be a rational decision to analyze where your selection stands versus its peers. Of course, this does not mean that on the surface level, a more appealing opportunity could become a better investment, or vice versa, but I believe that reviewing your thesis is always a worthwhile decision. I think that BTDR appears to be well-positioned and could successfully ride AI and BTC tailwinds further. However, when comparing it to its peers and highlighting a massive surge so far, I am not sure whether this trend of outperformance could continue. On the upside, the high-performance computing for AI market was valued at $112 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach about $381 billion by 2029, highlighting a 26.3% CAGR over the next 5 years. This expectation for the market to triple in size may act as a significant tailwind for all the miners who have pivoted to the AI landscape. If the AI demand continues, and anticipation for market growth materializes, BTDR, along with other AI HPC names, could rally further. Bitcoin Seasonality May Be In Play, And That Is Another Argument For Bullish Thesis Although a pivot to the AI landscape diversified the business, the market may still see Bitdeer as a typical Bitcoin miner. This means that the company's stock price performance may be highly correlated with Bitcoin volatility. Nevertheless, the last three quarters of the year historically appear to be favorable for cryptocurrency sentiment. BTDR: Bitcoin Seasonality (Coinglass.com) The table above indicates that on average, through Q4, Bitcoin appreciates by 78% , while the median returns are roughly equal 48%. Although this quarter the cryptocurrency experienced about a 6% decline, I believe the seasonality may still be in play. To support this, I would like to highlight a few key tailwinds: pro-crypto administration, Gen Z's preference for crypto assets, and Bitcoin treasury companies. The current administration appears to be pro-crypto, which helps shape a clearer crypto asset landscape. For instance, on July 18 the President Trump signed the GENIUS Act , which introduced a framework for stablecoins. I think this may be significantly beneficial for the cryptocurrency environment in the long term, as a legal framework supports digital asset adoption. I think this article paints the demographic tailwind well for crypto assets in general. The Gen Z generation favors cryptocurrencies over any other assets, and I believe the trend is likely to continue. This would imply that cryptocurrencies in the future may have a strong demand supported by Gen Z's favorable adoption of assets. BTDR: Bitcoin Treasury Companies (Bitcointreasuries.net) There are more and more publicly listed companies that are adopting Bitcoin as treasury. For instance, BTDR appears to be 35th on the list with 2,061 Bitcoins on its balance sheet. These companies may provide a floor price for the crypto asset, and with continued coin accumulation, BTC may become a less volatile digital asset in the long term. Despite Bitcoin miners pivoting to the AI landscape, I think the market may tie crypto sentiment to these companies further. This tailwind can also act as a headwind if the cryptocurrency landscape experiences a significant shift in sentiment. Nevertheless, I think that BTC seasonality may remain in play, which could boost equities with crypto exposure higher. However, this is not guaranteed, and that supports my more conservative approach toward BTDR's future performance. BTDR Stock Is Not Cheap, And That Could Weigh On The Stock Price The company trades at a forward P/E (GAAP) of 24.64 , which highlights a 26% discount to peers of 33.35, and that is another argument for a bullish narrative. However, I still argue that BTDR appears expensive. The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales of 10.09 and 9.53, respectively, indicate a 3x premium at the midpoint versus the sector median of 3.56 and 3.53. This also suggests that the market may have already priced in the future revenue growth for the company. Therefore, if any uncertainties arise regarding the pivot to AI, sentiment may change, and the company may experience a selloff. This also implies that even if BTDR successfully pivots to the AI HPC landscape, this may not necessarily translate into the stock price appreciation, and this makes me cautious. On the upside, the company appears to be a medium-leveraged business. Bitdeer has roughly $626 million in total obligations and $304 million in cash, which partially offsets the debt. This indicates that management has financial flexibility to use debt instruments, if needed. BTDR: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) The forward revenue growth rate of 43% highlights that the trend of top-line growth may continue further. This also reflects approximately 6x outperformance versus the industry's average of 7.35%, supporting a bullish stance for the company. Management achieved a significant 168% Capex growth over the past year, underscoring a 26x outperformance versus the sector median of 6.37%. Although I think a pivot to the AI landscape was the right business decision, this could act as a headwind if heavy capital expenditure investments do not translate into significant top and bottom line growth. This is another area to monitor for investors. On the downside, BTDR's profitability metrics are weak. The company operates at a roughly 5% gross profit margin (TTM) , which highlights a 90% difference versus peers of nearly 50%. This significantly weighs on the stock price and highly contributes to my neutral stance for this stock. For instance, CleanSpark operates at a 52% gross profit margin (TTM), and IREN at about 68% , supporting the thesis that there may be better alternatives in the market. The market anticipates $0.96 in diluted EPS for FY2026, and I think this could be a reasonable estimate. If AI demand continues, BTC remains around an all-time high, and Bitdeer can successfully scale into the HPC market, this result may come in conservative. However, there are a lot of moving parts, and based on my analysis, even with positive tailwinds, BTDR's valuation has run ahead of its fundamentals. If we apply about 30x earnings multiple to a $0.96 EPS for FY2026, we come in at my price target of about $29, indicating a 11% upside. I believe this would be a rational earnings multiple, which highlights positive crypto and AI/HPC tailwinds, yet would also consider capped upside given already significant appreciation in the stock price. Conclusion: Bitdeer Technologies Is A Hold I think that Bitdeer Technologies may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who favor digital assets and tailwinds tied to artificial intelligence adoption. However, the company has significantly appreciated in the stock price over the past 12 months, and I think that valuation may run ahead of its fundamentals. BTDR has risks and concerns tied to its business. The Bitcoin seasonality may not materialize, the broader market has not experienced a pullback since the April lows, and trade tensions between the US and China remain. These could significantly change sentiment and drag the stock price down. Moreover, continued HPC demand is not guaranteed, and there is execution risk tied to this pivot. This is why I favor a more conservative approach and believe Bitdeer Technologies is a Hold. I think a $29 price target over the next 12 months appears to be rational, indicating an 11% upside possibility. 12 Wall Street analysts forecast a $28 price target, suggesting an 8% upside potential. This comes in line with my expectations, but time will tell how this will turn out.",BTDR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-17 12:24:44

The market’s sentiment remains cautious as ETH trades around $3,700, showing weakness both technically and sentiment-wise. Buyers are seemingly losing control, and the focus now shifts to key support zones below. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has broken below the long-term ascending channel structure and the 100-day moving average, located around the $4,100 mark. The price is currently moving toward the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $3,530. This zone is a critical area that previously acted as support, and is the base of the most recent rally in August. The RSI around 37 indicates bearish momentum but hasn’t reached oversold territory yet, implying that more downside is still possible. A clean breakdown below $3,500 could open the way toward the 0.618 retracement level at $3,200, while reclaiming the last price high around $4,200 would be the first sign of recovery. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows clear bearish order flow as the downtrend is aggravating after losing the $4,200 level and failing to reclaim it. The recent rejection from this zone has confirmed a shift in the short-term market structure to bearish. Momentum remains weak with RSI near 33, suggesting sellers still dominate. The next demand zone lies around $3,500–$3,400, where buyers recently held their ground during the massive liquidation event. However, failure to hold this level could accelerate the move toward $3,200 or even $3,000 in a deeper decline. Sentiment Analysis Long Liquidations Ethereum’s latest drop triggered a notable spike in long liquidations across all exchanges, marking one of the largest deleveraging events in recent months. This surge in forced selling reflects how overconfident long traders were caught off guard by the market’s swift reversal. Historically, such liquidation spikes often appear near local bottoms as leveraged positions get flushed out. However, the magnitude of this latest move suggests panic among retail traders, while institutions are likely waiting for clearer confirmation before re-entering. Overall, the sentiment remains fearful and risk-averse, with traders preferring caution over aggressive long exposure in the short term.

According to the lawsuit, they scrubbed references to those sources once questions arose. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday by authors E. Molly Tanzer and Jennifer Gilmore under the Copyright Act. It states ongoing infringement, saying Salesforce “continues to do so by continuing to store, copy, use, and process the datasets containing copies of Plaintiffs’ copyrighted books.” The complaint cites statements from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who told a Bloomberg interviewer in January 2024 that AI companies ripped off training data and that all the training data has been stolen. The authors seek class certification for all US copyright holders whose works have been used since October 2022. They are seeking statutory damages, the destruction of infringing copies, the return of profits, a declaration of willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. Salesforce faces a strong case; AI companies escaped similar claims According to the complaint, Salesforce pirated hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books to develop its XGen series of large language models. They did this by using the “notorious RedPajama and The Pile datasets,” which have a book corpus called Books3 that has more than 196,000 books copied from the private tracker Bibliotik. The filing states that Salesforce first mentioned “RedPajama-Books” as one of its training sources when it launched XGen in June 2023. An engineer for the company then linked GitHub users directly to both datasets. However, by September, those mentions were taken down from Salesforce’s website and replaced with vague descriptions of “natural language data” from “publicly available sources.” The next month, Hugging Face, the site that hosted Books3, removed the dataset due to copyright concerns. Additionally, the lawsuit revealed that in 2022, Salesforce trained its CodeGen models on The Pile. The company then introduced the technology to the market through its Agentforce AI platform, with the XGen-Sales model being released in October 2024. However, according to experts, authors must prove real financial harm, not just that their books were used for training. Recently, Judge Vince Chhabria dismissed similar claims against Meta, ruling that “simply claiming ‘our work was used’ isn’t enough.” To that end, the judge found Meta’s use of copyrighted books for training AI as fair use. Additionally, as reported by Cryptopolitan, recent rulings have favored OpenAI and Anthropic in similar cases, with judges finding that authors failed to prove market harm. However, one judge criticized Anthropic for maintaining a permanent library of pirated books. Salesforce taps Google’s Gemini AI to power Agentforce 360 In other news, Salesforce has extended its partnership with Google to include deeper integration of Gemini AI models with its Agentforce 360 platform. Gemini’s multimodal intelligence will be integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem as a result of the partnership. This will help support tasks such as hybrid reasoning and multi-step process automation across enterprise sales and IT services. The expanded integration enables the Atlas Reasoning Engine, central to Agentforce 360, to leverage Gemini models. This gives enterprise workflows additional model options. Additionally, the hybrid reasoning capability enables users to set up AI agents within Salesforce that produce consistent and accurate outputs. The collaboration also extends the reach of Salesforce’s Gemini integration, previously limited to Gmail, to other Google Workspace applications, including Sheets, Docs, Drive, Slides, and Meet. Agentforce 360 now supports native interoperability with Google Workspace, allowing users to initiate sales engagements, qualify leads, and schedule meetings from within applications like Gmail and Google Calendar. It also provides direct access to Salesforce Customer 360 apps within Google tools, streamlining data access and workflow continuity for sales and service teams. Salesforce chief scientist Silvio Savarese said , “In the enterprise environment, it’s imperative for AI agents to be highly capable and highly consistent, especially for critical use cases […] Together, we are setting a new standard for building the future of what’s possible in the Agentic Enterprise down to the model level.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|Anthropic|Google|Meta|OpenAI|Salesforce,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-17 13:22:05

Meanwhile, Ghana’s central bank is moving quickly to introduce its first crypto laws, with a bill expected to reach parliament by the end of the year. Bank of Ghana Governor Johnson Asiama said that the country is building the expertise and infrastructure that is needed to monitor digital assets as adoption in the country grows, with over 3 million Ghanaians using crypto. Both countries’ moves proves that there is a growing recognition that regulation is key when it comes to balancing innovation with financial stability. France Ramps Up Oversight France’s banking regulator intensified its scrutiny of Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges as part of its push to tighten anti-money laundering (AML) oversight and assert more influence over the European Union’s crypto framework. According to a Bloomberg report , the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) is conducting confidential AML checks on Binance and dozens of other exchanges, which already began last year. The regulator reportedly instructed Binance in 2023 to improve its risk management systems and internal controls. A representative for Binance told Bloomberg that such “periodic onsite inspections are a standard part of the supervision of regulated entities,” and explained that these reviews are routine to help ensure compliance. These inspections are done to verify adherence to AML and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) regulations, which are central to the EU’s approach to mitigating illicit financial flows in the digital asset sector. When deficiencies are identified, companies are typically given several months to make improvements, usually by expanding compliance teams, hiring information security experts, or enhancing technological safeguards. The latest checks come during France’s effort to take a harder stance on the crypto industry and secure a leadership role in shaping European regulation under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In September, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) suggested that France could block crypto firms from operating locally if they rely solely on licenses from other EU countries, due to concerns over potential regulatory loopholes and inconsistent enforcement across the bloc. MiCA regulation (Source: Hacken ) AMF chair Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani acknowledged that such a move would be a serious breach of trust in the European single market but added that it is still a “possibility we hold in reserve.” Earlier this month, Bank of France governor François Villeroy de Galhau urged the European Union to grant the Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) centralized oversight over the crypto sector. He warned that leaving supervision to national regulators could lead to fragmented enforcement at a time when the digital asset market is expanding across Europe. Ghana Moves to Regulate Crypto by Year-End Other countries are also ramping up their regulation efforts. Ghana’s central bank is accelerating its efforts to introduce crypto regulations by the end of the year, with a bill set to be submitted to parliament in the next few weeks. The move comes just a week after Kenya passed its own law governing the crypto industry. Bank of Ghana (BoG) Governor Johnson Asiama announced during the International Monetary Fund’s meetings in Washington that the country made a lot of progress in drafting the legal framework over the past four months. “That bill is on its way to parliament, hopefully before the end of December we should be able to regulate cryptocurrencies in Ghana,” he said. Asiama added that while passing the law is an important milestone, building the capacity to monitor crypto activity will be crucial. The BoG is developing a new department dedicated to crypto oversight, hiring experts, and training staff to strengthen its regulatory and technological capabilities. The central bank’s position is a big shift from its earlier cautious stance , when it warned the public that cryptocurrencies were not legal tender. Despite the lack of formal regulation, crypto adoption in Ghana surged, with over 3 million people—nearly 9% of the population—estimated to use digital assets. This is according to data from Demandsage . Asiama said the growing demand made it clear that the government “could not leave it,” as there was an obvious need for oversight to prevent misuse and ensure consumer protection. Crypto ownership by country (Source: Demandsage ) To support innovation, the BoG also launched a digital sandbox allowing selected companies to experiment with cryptocurrency services under controlled conditions. People in the industry praised the initiative but urged the country to swift action. Stanbic Bank Ghana’s Isaac Simpson warned earlier this year that Ghana risks being left behind as other African nations, including Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Rwanda, advance with central bank digital currency pilots, regulated exchanges, and digital asset licensing frameworks.",News|Security,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|FIAT|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 13:30:00

53277219,608728,1760708054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53277219.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy in a Bearish Market: The Safest Investments Now,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-market-turns-bearish/,"Quick Facts: 1️⃣ The current bearish market is down to interest rates, excessive leverage, and investor fear 2️⃣ High market leverage is accelerating the fall through ‘liquidation cascades,’ where automatic selling adds massive downward pressure on prices. 3️⃣ New projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are safer investments now, as they’re still in presale, whereas Giggle Fund ($GIGGLE)’s rise proves the power of a philanthropic mission. If you’ve checked your crypto portfolio lately, you’ve probably noticed a chill, or maybe even a freeze! We’re slipping into a crypto winter, also known as a bear market, a prolonged, painful period where asset prices across the board steadily decline. It’s worse than a simple correction; it’s a full-blown downturn defined by negative emotion, with the Fear and Greed Index at 28/100 (high fear) and sinking. So, what exactly is causing this persistent crypto slump? It boils down to three major factors: 1. Interest Rates The connection between interest rates and the bearish market now is less tied to the current rate, which was dropped in the US by 0.25% , but more to the legacy of the tight monetary policy cycle that came before it. The aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes from 2022 to 2024 dramatically contracted global liquidity , stripping away the cheap capital that had previously flowed into speculative assets like cryptocurrency. Although the Fed has started cutting rates, the market remains in a risk-off phase, where high returns on safe assets, such as bonds, continue to draw money away from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. 2. The Domino Effect of Borrowing Crypto markets are known for being highly leveraged. That means many traders use borrowed funds to take out huge positions. It’s great when prices are soaring, but disastrous when they drop, as shared by crypto investor CozyTheCaller on X. When the price dips even slightly, these high-risk positions get automatically sold off by the exchange to prevent the borrower from going bankrupt. This forced selling adds massive and sudden downward pressure on the market, causing a liquidation cascade that can wipe out billions of dollars in a matter of hours and accelerate the overall decline. 3. Fear, Uncertainty, and Regulation Confidence is everything in crypto, but it’s been hard to come by lately. Regulatory uncertainty is a huge deterrent for big institutional money looking to invest. When global trade tensions or geopolitical conflicts flare up, like the recent US-China spat , investors tend to panic and rush for traditional safe havens like gold, leaving crypto behind. High-profile security breaches and collapses of major crypto entities further add to the fear, reminding everyone that the space is still maturing and prone to external shocks. With all this in mind, you might think now isn’t the time to invest in crypto. However, we’ve rounded up a selection of the safest cryptos to buy now — even in turbulent times. Check out Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and Giggle Fund ($GIGGLE) . 1.

Unlike most of the market that has reported losses, $GIGGLE has been climbing , posting 16% gains in the past week and proving the power of purpose. That’s because of its mission to turn crypto into a force for good, transforming speculative trading into positive social impact. This community-driven token is built on the BNB Chain and features ingenious tokenomics where a 5% tax on every trade is automatically converted and donated to GiggleAcademy, supporting children’s education worldwide. 100% of that tax goes to the fund, with no team or dev allocation.

You can buy $GIGGLE now for around $118. Recap: The current bearish market is driven by interest rates, a highly leveraged market, and a lack of confidence. Despite the slump, some of the best crypto to buy now include Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Snorter Token ($SNORT) , and Giggle Fund ($GIGGLE) . Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

This range has become a focal point for traders, offering insight into potential price movements over the coming sessions. The technical picture highlights growing caution among investors. XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 34, signaling that the cryptocurrency is approaching oversold territory. Historically, an RSI below 35 often attracts buyers seeking accumulation opportunities, suggesting that a rebound could be on the horizon if demand picks up. Kamil emphasizes that monitoring trading volumes around this zone will be key in determining whether support will hold or falter. If XRP holds the $2.10 support, a rebound toward $2.80 becomes likely, driven by oversold conditions that often spark short-term buying rallies. Traders could see this as a prime entry point ahead of a potential recovery. Analyst Kamil highlights the $2.70–$2.80 range as a key resistance zone, where selling pressure may test upward momentum. On the other hand, a drop below $2.10 could spark a sharper correction, potentially pushing XRP toward support around $1.50. This would indicate rising selling pressure and a shift in market sentiment, prompting investors to reassess risk and adopt a cautious stance amid broader volatility. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.28 per CoinGecko data. Global Banking Standardization Set to Revolutionize Payments from November 2025 According to renowned crypto observer SMQKE, a historic shift in global finance is on the horizon. From November 2025 , over 11,500 SWIFT member institutions worldwide will operate under a unified messaging standard through ISO 20022 compliance. Therefore, this move is expected to bring unprecedented efficiency, transparency, and interoperability to cross-border payments, reshaping the way financial institutions and corporations transact globally. ISO 20022, the 'universal language of payments,' is revolutionizing financial messaging. By supporting rich, structured data, it enables banks and institutions to exchange transactions seamlessly, cut errors, speed up settlements, and simplify reconciliation. For corporations, this means clearer cash flow visibility, stronger liquidity management, and more accurate reporting. Therefore, ISO 20022 compliance not only boosts operational efficiency but also enhances financial security. Its advanced data structures improve transaction monitoring, helping banks swiftly detect anomalies and meet stricter AML and CTF regulations. Conclusion XRP is at a critical juncture. Holding the $2.10–$2.20 support could trigger a rebound toward $2.80, while a break may push prices down toward $1.50. Traders should monitor these levels closely, as oversold conditions could drive the next decisive move. On the other hand, the November 2025 adoption of ISO 20022 by over 11,500 SWIFT members represents a transformative moment for global finance. From faster, more transparent payments to enhanced security and cross-system integration, the standard promises to redefine how value moves across borders, making global transactions smarter, safer, and more seamless than ever before.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 13:39:46

So everyone’s max-longing because the market’s become super volatile. Most people have lost all of their money, so everyone’s like ‘Well, it can’t go any lower!’… Everything can always get worse…” said Tate.

Once that is in place, once nobody is gonna make it all back with one trade… then we go to all-time high,” he added. Crypto market continues to fall The cryptocurrency market experienced another flash crash in the hours leading up to Tate’s rant, plunging $150 billion in a matter of hours and intensifying the already steady downward trend. Without exception, the top 10 digital assets had fallen sharply on the day. Bitcoin slid 5.6%, while Ethereum ( ETH ) lost 7.16%. At the same time, XRP and Solana ( SOL ) recorded declines of 7.69% and 8.23%, respectively. Cardano ( ADA ) and BNB , however, were hit hardest, plummeting 9.84% and 11.93%. Andrew Tate’s own meme coin itself, Daddy Tate ( DADDY ), is 8.49% in the red as of the time of writing. The downturn was driven by broader macroeconomic concerns, particularly the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, which have affected both digital and fiat markets, pushing investors toward hedges such as gold , which traded at $4,339 per ounce, up another 1.14% on the daily chart.

Tokens such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin have been the “talk of the town” in recent years, resulting in early adopters raking in vast amounts of money. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the new name on the game as we approach 2025, and it’s already looking to be the next millionaire creator. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Established Giant Facing New Challenges Shiba Inu currently has a value of $0.0000123. SHIB has transcended its meme roots and is now the base token that underpins the Shibarium Layer 2 network, NFT collections, and ShibaSwap decentralized exchange. Analysts still think SHIB has promise, but it’s highly unlikely to rally 100 times again, given the size of the market. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is better suited for a faster-growing individual and those seeking potential. Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Slow-Moving Meme Coin Pepe Coin gained global popularity due to the famous internet meme featuring the frog. It quickly gained popularity, and early investors reaped substantial returns. PEPE is currently worth about $0.0000094, making it one of the best meme currencies of the last two years. PEPE may struggle to grow much more without introducing new features or uses to keep long-term investors interested, even as it continues to attract short-term traders. Its popularity has paved the way for the next generation of meme coins, which will be both fun and valuable. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The New Meme Coin Powerhouse with Real Potential Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the newest and most fascinating moniker in the meme coin world. The coin is currently in Stage 13 of its presale, where it costs $0.0022 per unit. It has already raised over $26.9 million and sold more than 95% of its allocation. The rapid rise of its presale indicates that investors are genuinely interested and that an increasing number of people believe Little Pepe could be the next great success story in the crypto space. Little Pepe is building a comprehensive Layer 2 blockchain, designed explicitly for meme projects, unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype. This new network’s goal is to speed up, lower the cost of, and make transactions more scalable, allowing meme token creators to establish and run their businesses more smoothly. Little Pepe is creating the first blockchain for memes, combining humor and utility in a way that no other meme coin has done before. Certik, one of the most reputable blockchain security companies, has looked over the project. This means that investors may trust its smart contracts. Tokenomics are designed to support a thriving economy. They have no taxes on buying or selling, staking rewards, and protection against sniper bots to make sure that launches are fair. The team has also stated that they will distribute $777,000 to appreciate their expanding community. There will also be a 15 ETH Mega Giveaway for the best presale customers in stages 12 through 17, with ten winners each receiving $77,000 in tokens. It has a significant advantage over its competitors because of its Layer-2 infrastructure, fair tokenomics, and strong community support. When the presale, the coin will be listed on two large centralized exchanges, and the launch price is expected to be $0.003. This means that early investors could see significant gains almost immediately when trading begins. Conclusion The race to find the next millionaire maker from meme coins in 2025 is getting hotter. People still know and love Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin, but Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is swiftly becoming the name everyone is watching. Its record-breaking presale, Layer 2 vision, and community prizes make it the best project of the new meme generation. Little Pepe could become the biggest success story among meme coins in 2025 if it keeps going in this direction. It may also create numerous new crypto millionaires.

It’s an online platform that allows users to buy, sell, trade, or swap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. Whether you want to buy crypto with EUR, exchange one token for another, or cash out your holdings, exchanges are the infrastructure that makes it possible. The Two Main Types of Crypto Exchanges 1. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) Centralized platforms act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. They operate much like traditional stock exchanges but deal with digital assets. Examples include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Pros: Easy to use, highly liquid, and support fiat on/off ramps. Cons: Users must verify their identity (KYC), and the exchange holds the funds (custodial model). 2. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) Decentralized exchanges (like Uniswap or PancakeSwap) run on smart contracts, enabling direct, wallet-to-wallet trades without intermediaries. Pros: Greater privacy and full asset control. Cons: No direct fiat support and less intuitive for beginners. Why Crypto Exchanges Matter Exchanges are the on/off ramps of the crypto economy. They connect two worlds — traditional finance and decentralized assets — creating a fiat-to-crypto bridge that allows anyone to enter or exit the crypto market easily. Modern platforms are evolving beyond simple trading venues. Many now offer features like portfolio tracking, lending, and integrated wallets, turning into all-in-one crypto solutions. This is where Clapp comes in. Clapp: A New Generation of Licensed Crypto Exchange As the crypto industry matures, users expect more than just a trading interface — they want security, simplicity, and regulation. Clapp embodies this next stage by offering an all-in-one environment for every crypto operation, from trading and swapping to borrowing and managing digital assets. All-in-One Crypto Platform Clapp eliminates the need to juggle multiple apps for trading, analytics, and cashing out. The platform lets users: Buy and sell crypto directly with EUR Swap crypto pairs instantly at optimized market rates Convert crypto to EUR and withdraw through integrated on/off-ramp services This unified design makes Clapp a convenient EUR-to-crypto gateway for everyday users. Licensed and Compliant Clapp operates as a licensed crypto exchange under a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license in the Czech Republic, granting it full legal authority to serve European users. The company is also pursuing regulatory licenses in Dubai (VARA), Slovakia (CASP), El Salvador, and Mauritius, signaling its commitment to global compliance and transparency — rare qualities in a market still dominated by unregulated players. Built for Security and Trust Security is non-negotiable in crypto, and Clapp integrates Fireblocks, an institutional-grade custody solution trusted by leading financial institutions. This ensures that user funds are protected with multi-layer encryption and segregated wallets, meeting the same standards as top-tier financial custodians. Borrowing and Credit Lines Clapp goes a step further by offering crypto-backed loans, allowing users to borrow fiat without selling their crypto. This feature gives investors liquidity when they need it while keeping their long-term holdings intact — an option increasingly valued in the evolving Web3 economy. Why Clapp Stands Out Clapp’s vision is clear: make crypto operations as intuitive as modern banking. Its blend of regulation, security, and flexibility turns it into more than an exchange — it’s a complete ecosystem for digital finance. Whether you’re buying your first crypto with EUR or managing a diversified digital portfolio, Clapp offers the reliability and simplicity that users expect from a trusted fiat-to-crypto bridge. Final Thoughts The days of using one app for trading, another for cashing out, and a third for managing your crypto are coming to an end.

The collaboration, valued at up to $200 million, combines tokenized gold assets and Bitcoin mining infrastructure, forming a “dual strategy” at the crossroads of traditional and digital finance. DL Holdings has already made its initial $5 million investment in Tether Gold (XAUT) and plans to acquire and distribute up to 100 million XAUT over the next 12 months. Each XAUT token, issued by Tether, is backed by physical gold bars stored in secure London vaults. The company aims to make gold investment accessible on the blockchain for institutional and private investors through brokerage accounts and structured products. Antalpha will provide liquidity, custody, and XAUT-secured lending through its RWA Hub platform, and plans to establish physical vaults in global financial centers to facilitate gold redemption. “We’re developing both the value store and the infrastructure of the digital financial world. By tokenizing physical gold, we’re reimagining the way value is stored and circulated,” said Andy Chen, CEO of DL Holdings and NeuralFin. The partnership, first announced in early October, positions DL Holdings as Tether Gold’s key strategic partner in the Asia-Pacific region. Together with Antalpha, the company will develop yield-enhancing products, secured lending, and structured solutions for high-net-worth clients. Investing in Gold and Bitcoin Infrastructure Amid global inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, gold prices have surged more than 60% year-to-date, while the tokenized gold market has grown beyond $3 billion, becoming the largest segment of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). In parallel, DL Holdings is committing another $100 million to expand its Bitcoin mining infrastructure. The firm has already purchased several thousand high-performance mining machines and is preparing to buy approximately 3,000 Antminer S21s from Bitmain. Current capacity yields about 350 BTC annually, with a medium-term target of 1,500 BTC per year. Antalpha’s Role and the “Golden Triad” As a strategic partner, Antalpha will offer funding, technology support, and risk management, helping to create transparent access channels to Bitcoin for both private and institutional investors. “By investing in large-scale hashrate, we are strengthening the foundation of digital assets. These two strategies—gold and Bitcoin—complement each other and form the core of DL’s competitive advantage in the global financial market,” Chen said. Antalpha is a key financial partner of Bitmain, the world’s largest mining equipment manufacturer, which controls roughly 75% of the global market. The collaboration between DL Holdings, Antalpha, and Bitmain forms a “golden triad” of technology, financing, and scalability aimed at building Asia’s leading Bitcoin mining enterprise. DL Holdings previously tokenized stakes in ByteDance and Kraken, and converted its DL Tower (Hong Kong) and ONE Carmel (USA) properties into real-world assets (RWAs). These initiatives align with Hong Kong’s ambition to become a global hub for digital finance, reinforcing DL Holdings’ role as a pioneer in merging traditional and blockchain-based assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BTC|MINING|XAUT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-17 13:46:22

Despite a relaunch with a new version to revive activity, the NFT space has not recovered enough to generate sufficient activity. OpenSea may pivot to become a multi-asset aggregator, as the NFT market has not generated sufficient activity. The startup will rebuild as a token marketplace, also including memecoins, in a bid to recover lost trading volumes. NFT never really recovered from the 2022 crash. Since then, Opensea has reduced its workforce and has sought new ways of growing trading activity. OpenSea still leveraged its brand into a multi-coin trading platform across 22 chains, tapping the recent meme token craze. The company’s CEO Devin Finzer is overseeing the changes at OpenSea, trying to transform it into a full trading platform. The OpenSea startup still managed to attract millions of website visits, while retaining some NFT auction activity. OpenSea token trading gains traction OpenSea has recovered its volumes dating back to September, as its platform combines NFTs and tokens. NFTs are still used for airdrops and as perks, though not at the same valuation and trading rate. OpenSea has had its best month in the past three years in October, based on a Forbes magazine report . OpenSea regained traction as a multi-asset platform, recently posting peak dollar volumes. | Source: Dune Analytics OpenSea has taken up the model of an aggregator, similar to services like Jupiter, CowSwap, 1inch, and others. The platform also takes 0.9% in fees for every transaction, securing a recurrent source of revenue. As the crypto market accelerated DEX trading, aggregators became one of the most successful apps. As a result, OpenSea achieved over $16M in fees for the past two weeks. At the same time, the regular inflows allow OpenSea to continue its role as an NFT platform for some of its best-performing collections. Newer cohorts of NFT speculators are also appearing, undeterred by the previous price slide of collectibles. OpenSea has now shifted toward traders and speculators, as NFT creators and artists lost some of their importance as customers. OpenSea has retained its royalty mechanisms for some types of NFTs. As the founder of the Bored Ape collection noted, the OpenSea royalties attracted even more creators, building the landscape of high-profile collections, which still retain a high floor price. OpenSea renews marketing with Treasure Chest airdrop OpenSea now aims to keep its brand hot among crypto users. Recently, the platform released another airdrop, rewarding even older users for the gas fees paid for NFTs. OpenSea users had a deadline as of October 15 to connect their wallets and claim the Treasure Chests, securing additional future airdrops. Check your wallets. Treasure Chests are now unlocked 🔓 Some will discover NFTs and tokens.

Top Coins Ready for a Sharp Rebound,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/crypto-bloodbath-or-buying-opportunity-top-coins-ready-for-a-sharp-rebound,"A dramatic fall in cryptocurrency values has created a tense atmosphere in the trading world. Investors are anxious, wondering if this downturn signals danger or a chance to snatch up potential winners. Insights into which digital currencies are poised for a significant recovery are explored, shedding light on possible lucrative opportunities amidst the chaos. Ondo Coin: Is a Bull Run on the Horizon? Source: tradingview Ondo coin is experiencing a significant drop, with a current price ranging from thirty-seven cents to a little over a dollar. It recently lost over twenty percent in just a week. However, there is potential for a comeback. The nearest resistance level is at one dollar and forty-two cents, with the next target at two dollars and seventeen cents. If it manages to break through these levels, it could result in impressive gains, potentially doubling from its current price. With an RSI below forty, it suggests the coin might be oversold, hinting at a possible recovery. Keep an eye on these key levels for potential upward movement. Algorand (ALGO) Price Struggles but Shows Growth Potential Source: tradingview Algorand is currently trading between $0.13 and $0.25, trying to push upward. It faces resistance at $0.30 and shows support at about $0.0586. The coin is moving below its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, which hover around $0.18 and $0.19. This indicates a short-term struggle, but also potential for upward growth. As the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at around 37, the token is close to becoming oversold, meaning it could see a rebound soon. If it breaks past $0.30, the next target is $0.42. A rise to $0.42 from $0.25 would mean a growth of around two-thirds in value. Polkadot (DOT) Bounces Back from Recent Lows, Eyes Stronger Levels Source: tradingview Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading between $1.33 and $4.81, reflecting a bumpy journey as its price dip continues. Despite a recent drop of nearly 29% over the past week, there is potential for growth. DOT's nearest resistance sits at $6.36, and reaching this level would mark a recovery of more than 30% from its upper current range. The long-term goal might be to touch the $9.84 mark, a potential climb of over 100% from today’s bottom price. While the path is challenging, these targets offer a glimpse of hope for investors looking to rebound from recent losses. The road ahead depends on market dynamics and overall sentiment. Conclusion The recent market dip presents a potentially lucrative entry point for investors. ONDO, ALGO, and DOT show signs of resilience and strong recovery potential. Careful analysis suggests these coins may soon experience significant upward momentum. This could be a strategic moment for those looking to capitalize on future gains. The tokens mentioned hold promise for those seeking to diversify their portfolios. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: MrBeast has filed a trademark, aiming to launch a platform offering banking, investment, and crypto services. The filing describes a SaaS-based ecosystem featuring crypto payments and decentralized exchanges. The move signals MrBeast’s expansion beyond content creation into fintech. According to a recent US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) filing dated October 13, the 27-year-old creator has applied to trademark “MrBeast Financial,” a new venture that would offer online banking and crypto-related services. MrBeast Financial Trademark Reveals Plans for Crypto and Banking Platform The application, filed under Beast Holdings LLC, describes MrBeast Financial as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform designed to provide banking, investment, and crypto exchange services. The filing lists capabilities such as crypto payment processing, decentralized exchange (DEX) operations, and other blockchain-based financial services. The submission explicitly identifies “James Donaldson, a living individual whose consent is made of record,” confirming his personal involvement. If approved, MrBeast Financial could become the first major influencer-led banking brand in the United States. Based on USPTO timelines, the trademark will likely undergo its first examination in mid-2026, with final approval or rejection expected by late 2026. MrBeast, who commands over 445 million subscribers, has built a billion-dollar empire through attention-grabbing stunts, giveaways, and large-scale philanthropy. MrBeast just filed trademark to offer crypto services through his new venture MrBeast Financial. FYI, the guy has 446 million subscribers. pic.twitter.com/f1RKDMHN9N — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) October 17, 2025 However, his business portfolio extends far beyond YouTube. He founded Feastables, a snack brand, and MrBeast Burger, a virtual restaurant chain that ran through delivery apps. He has also experimented with tech platforms like ViewStats, a YouTube analytics tool that briefly included an AI thumbnail generator before being pulled after community backlash. The move into finance follows reports from Business Insider that MrBeast’s company, Beast Industries, had previously pitched investors on products like credit cards, personal loans, and cryptocurrency services. The new trademark suggests those plans are moving forward under a unified financial brand. This isn’t the only expansion on Donaldson’s radar. In September, reports surfaced that MrBeast is also planning to launch a mobile phone service, signaling broader ambitions across technology and fintech. MrBeast Accused of Earning $10M From Low-Cap Crypto “Pump and Dumps” As reported, MrBeast has faced allegations of profiting over $10 million from promoting and dumping several low-cap cryptocurrency projects, according to an investigation by on-chain analyst SomaXBT. The sleuth claims MrBeast used his influence to boost token prices through promotional campaigns before cashing out at the top, leaving retail investors with heavy losses. Projects named in the report include SuperFarm ($SUPER), Polychain Monsters ($PMON), SPLYT ($SHOPX), STAK, and Virtue Poker ($VPP). The investigation alleges that MrBeast turned a $100,000 investment in SuperFarm into $9 million, and another $25,000 in Polychain Monsters into $1.7 million, by selling tokens during public trading surges. Similar profits were reported across smaller allocations, with most tokens crashing between 75% and 90% after his exits. SomaXBT’s findings suggest a pattern typical of pump-and-dump schemes, where influencers inflate prices before offloading their holdings. The report compares MrBeast’s alleged conduct to other recent scandals involving celebrities like Andrew Tate and Iggy Azalea, both accused of manipulating token prices earlier this year.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4197 Market Cap $742.98M Trading Volume $217.71M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4623 24-hour Low $0.3984 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 16.20% 50-Day SMA $0.6959 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.7445 Optimism price analysis: OP faces continued downside pressure but nears a short-term accumulation zone TL;DR Breakdown: The daily chart remains bearish but is nearing a possible exhaustion point near $0.36. Short-term indicators suggest oversold conditions, indicating a potential rebound. OP must reclaim $0.45–$0.46 to recover momentum. Optimism 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for October 17, Optimism (OP) is trading around $0.415, down nearly 3% for the day, extending its multi-day bearish sequence. The Bollinger Bands indicate widening pressure, with the lower band at $0.3646 now acting as immediate downside support, while the upper band at $0.8659 marks a distant resistance range. The price remains pinned below the mid-band, signaling a persistently weak trend. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator confirms sustained bearish momentum with the histogram printing consecutive red bars, though their decreasing size suggests sellers may be losing steam. Volume remains moderate, which means any sudden shift could accelerate the next move. If OP loses the $0.36 support, the next zone to watch would be $0.32–$0.30. Conversely, a recovery above $0.45 could signal the beginning of a short-term reversal, opening room toward $0.52–$0.60. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP trades at $0.413, showing signs of sideways consolidation after heavy selling. The Alligator indicator lines are widely separated and angled downward, confirming the existing downtrend, but the green jaw line flattening near $0.43 hints at a potential slowdown. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 32.58 places OP near the oversold boundary, implying sellers might soon run out of momentum. The OBV reading of -66.05M confirms consistent outflows, but the recent flattening in OBV indicates the selling volume could be tapering off. If buying pressure emerges near $0.40, we could see a minor bounce toward $0.44–$0.46, which coincides with the short-term resistance cluster. A clean break above $0.46 could shift momentum briefly bullish. However, a breakdown below $0.39 would invalidate any recovery prospects and resume the bearish leg. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5457 SELL SMA 5 $0.5224 SELL SMA 10 $0.5823 SELL SMA 21 $0.6472 SELL SMA 50 $0.6959 SELL SMA 100 $0.7105 SELL SMA 200 $0.7445 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6370 SELL EMA 5 $0.6668 SELL EMA 10 $0.6927 SELL EMA 21 $0.7099 SELL EMA 50 $0.7080 SELL EMA 100 $0.7178 SELL EMA 200 $0.8540 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism is still under bearish control but may be approaching an accumulation floor between $0.36–$0.40. A rebound toward $0.50 remains plausible if volume strengthens, though failure to hold above $0.40 could invite another downward leg before any real recovery takes shape. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Here’s What We Know,https://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/blackrock-to-go-public-with-ripple/,"Rumors are circulating that BlackRock has partnered with Ripple to tokenize real-world assets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). There has been no confirmation from either party, suggesting that these rumors may not be accurate. Rumors Circulate About BlackRock’s Partnership With Ripple and XRP In an X post, XRP influencer JackTheRippler said that there are rumors that BlackRock is about to announce a partnership with Ripple to tokenize assets on the XRPL. Other XRP influencers, such as CryptoSensei and Bale, also shared the rumor, sparking excitement among XRP community members. Related Reading: Investment CEO Highlights Why Ripple’s XRP Has The Strongest Utility In The Industry However, BlackRock and Ripple have yet to issue an official announcement about the rumored partnership, suggesting these claims may not be true. However, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink confirmed that they are building their own technology to tokenize several of their funds and expand their crypto offerings. The BlackRock CEO noted that tokenization can help crypto-native investors access more traditional assets. He further remarked that if they could tokenize an ETF, they could get these investors into the more traditional long-term retirement products. Notably, the asset manager already has products, such as its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, which runs on the Ethereum network. It is worth mentioning that Ripple already partnered with the fund’s manager, Securitize, to enable off-ramp support for BlackRock’s BUIDL using their RLUSD stablecoin. This has so far been the closest to a partnership between Ripple and BlackRock amid rumors that the asset manager plans to tokenize assets on the XRP Ledger. However, Ripple has so far helped advance upgrades to the XRP Ledger, which could compel institutions like BlackRock to tokenize their funds on the XRPL. This has included the launch of the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard, which is designed to simplify the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). Ripple Expands Into Treasury Markets While rumors of a Ripple and BlackRock partnership do not appear to be accurate, there are other recent developments that provide a bullish outlook for XRP. This includes Ripple’s expansion into the corporate treasury markets through the $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury, a provider of treasury management systems. Related Reading: The XRP Price Roadmap To $8: How An Over 50% Bounce Could Materialize As part of the deal, Ripple and GTreasury will focus on enabling customers to carry out real-time cross-border payments using Ripple’s payment solution, in which XRP serves as the bridge currency. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, Ripple is also working to raise up to $1 billion to establish an XRP treasury company. The crypto firm plans to contribute some of its XRP holdings to set up the firm, while the proposed $1 billion is expected to be raised through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.35, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A crypto whale has lost over $1.4 million to liquidations from long bets on wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Chainlink (LINK). According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, a whale wallet identified as 0x19c4…d26a had open positions on decentralized derivatives exchange Aave using WBTC, ETH, and LINK as collateral. The liquidation occurred when Bitcoin’s price fell below the critical $104,000 level, causing forced sell-offs from several addresses in the derivatives market. Bitcoin slump confirms whale’s $1.45 million liquidation According to Etherscan data shared by PeckShield, the address transferred more than 14.8 ETH (worth roughly $54,700) to an Aave contract, along with over 1.28 million USDC, and made several smaller adjustments between the Aave Treasury and other DeFi entities, such as BuilderNet. #PeckShieldAlert A whale wallet (0x19c4…d26a ), with a long position on $WBTC / $ETH / $LINK via #Aave , has been liquidated for $1.45M after BTC broke below $104K. pic.twitter.com/yEuWcv4RLS — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) October 17, 2025 Automated collateral liquidations see digital assets held as margin sold to cover leveraged losses. PeckShield noted that the total exposure from the mentioned address amounted to approximately $1.45 million. Bitcoin had fallen by 5.3% in the last 24 hours, going below a July low of $104,000 and causing a flurry of liquidations from highly leveraged traders who had bet on a much stronger market rebound. Market trackers placed the king coin’s trading resistance near $107,500 to $110,000, corresponding to the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Technical analysts believe the SMA’s breakdown and a confirmed Head and Shoulders (H&S) chart pattern mean BTC is bearish in the short term. During Friday’s Asian trading hours, another wallet, 0xbf2b…15bd, reportedly went long on WBTC via Aave and was liquidated for approximately $1.5 million after Bitcoin dipped below $108,000. #PeckShieldAlert A whale wallet (0xbf2b..15bd), long on $WBTC via #Aave , has been liquidated for $1.50M after BTC broke below $108K. pic.twitter.com/JKUwSgQaGA — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) October 17, 2025 Market tracker Lookonchain identified another wallet, 0xc2a3, which is down over $10 million on long positions in Ethereum and Bitcoin. Despite having previously earned about $5.5 million in profit, recent market declines have reversed those gains, leaving the address with a net loss of $4.69 million. Data from the analytics platform Hyperdash reveals that the same whale expanded his exposure on Thursday evening, raising his total leveraged positions to $158 million through 19,894 ETH, valued at $80.3 million, and 699 BTC, worth $77.6 million. According to the platform, his ongoing Bitcoin long at 15x leverage showed a position value of $149.3 million, with 1,411 BTC, down 33.35% from entry. Meanwhile, his Ethereum long at 5x leverage carried a $75.4 million value, down 32.28%. The liquidation prices were set at $87,822 for BTC and $2,504 for ETH, meaning the trader was very close to another potential margin call if prices continued to slide. Fear index grows, Trump says tariff threat was a “misunderstanding’ When the White House announced new tariffs targeting Chinese imports, exceeding 100% was set for November 1 last Friday, Bitcoin plunged from a weekly high of $122,000 in minutes. Panic sellers took hold of the leveraged trading markets and deepened the slide to under $110,000 on Bitstamp. However, markets have shown signs of recovery a week later, when President Donald Trump appeared to retract his earlier statement on slapping China with more tariffs. Speaking to reporters on Friday, he said, “The tariffs that were supposed to be imposed on China as of November 1 won’t stand. I think we will be fine with China.” The President’s word caused a mild charge in Bitcoin’s price, which recovered from its multi-week low to trade near $106,000 at the time of this publication. That said, sentiment across crypto markets is still fragile due to the day’s red signals. The Fear and Greed Index currently reads 23, signaling “Extreme Fear.” Open interest per Coinglass’ readings are down 5.1%, funding rates near neutral at 0.0029%, and whale inflows to exchanges up by 17,184 BTC, which spells continued caution among whale accounts.

Right now, one of those windows may be opening around XRP, and it’s no accident that commentator Amonyx has cast this moment as an “incredible opportunity.” But to act wisely, one must parse price action, underlying fundamentals, and looming catalysts with precision. Current Price Landscape and Recent Volatility As of report time, XRP is trading in the range of $2.27, with recent daily data showing an average in the mid-$2.50s. Earlier in October, XRP underwent a sharp intraday collapse from around $2.82 down to as low as ~$1.64 during heavy liquidation sweeps, before partially recovering. Such wild swings underscore how speculative the current regime is—even within what some deem a structural accumulation phase. Volume has spiked during drawdowns, suggesting active repositioning rather than passive exits. But that same volume profile amplifies risk: when support breaks, the fallback is swift. Buying $XRP now at these prices is an incredible opportunity. — Amonyx (@amonbuy) October 16, 2025 Technical Structure: Support, Resistance, and Pattern Risk Analysts like Peter Brandt have warned of a descending triangle pattern forming on XRP’s charts, with a confirmed close below $2.6874 potentially triggering a deeper ~20 % decline. In contrast, bullish scenarios hinge on holding support zones—especially between $2.65 and $2.75—while rallying past resistance in the $3.05 to $3.10 corridor. Without volume confirmation, however, upward attempts will remain fragile. If XRP can break above $3.10 decisively, momentum could carry it toward $3.30 to $3.50 by month’s end. Conversely, failure below $2.65 might test deeper support near $2.30 or even $2.20. Macro and On-chain Catalysts to Monitor Beyond pure charts, several real developments could sway sentiment. The most notable is the emerging news that Ripple Labs is reportedly leading a $1 billion fundraising effort to accumulate XRP via a new digital-asset treasury structure. If executed, this would constitute one of the largest internal commitments to XRP in its history. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 At the same time, Ripple’s acquisition of GTreasury further positions the company to operate at the intersection of corporate treasuries and tokenized assets—an infrastructure move that could favor XRP’s utility narrative. Another massive force lies ahead: the U.S. SEC is currently reviewing six spot XRP ETF applications, with decisions expected between October 18 and 25. Approval would awaken institutional demand, potentially inflecting price significantly. Denial or delays, however, could provoke sharp volatility or sentiment pullback. Prudent Entry Strategy Under Uncertainty Labeling the current price level “an incredible opportunity” is justified only if one pairs boldness with discipline. For medium to long-term holders, staggered accumulation (dollar-cost averaging into the $2.50–$2.80 zone) is a defensible play. Shorter timeframes call for confirmation: wait for a daily close above $3.05–$3.10 on strong volume before committing major capital. On the downside, a breach below $2.65 should trigger cautious revaluation or stop-loss protocols. The Verdict Amonyx’s assertion that “buying XRP now at these prices is an incredible opportunity” resonates precisely because the constellation of technical, on-chain, and corporate signals is unusually aligned—though far from guaranteed. XRP currently sits at a crossroads where it must defend critical support while awaiting catalysts that could validate renewed upside. Those who enter must treat this as a calculated play, not a blind bet. The coming week—driven by ETF rulings and Ripple’s treasury moves—may define whether this window becomes a landmark entry or a gate that slams shut.

Experts believe this positions AVAX as a strong contender for significant recovery in the Layer-1 landscape. The full article delves into why this coin, among others, shows promising potential for growth. Avalanche (AVAX) Eyes Higher Levels Amid Current Price Struggles Source: tradingview The price of Avalanche ( AVAX ) currently hovers between ten and thirty-three dollars, showing significant volatility. Despite recent declines—losing about a third of its value in both the past week and month—AVAX's potential for growth is notable. It has an upward path towards the next resistance at forty-three dollars, which would be roughly a 40% gain from the top of its current range. If bullish trends continue, reaching sixty-five dollars is possible, which would result in a potential surge of nearly 100%. Although recent price changes show struggles, this range could offer opportunities if AVAX bounces back. Conclusion AVAX's cross-chain capabilities could redefine expectations for network efficiency. Analysts believe that AVAX remains a strong contender among Layer-1 networks with its recovery potential. Its innovative approach sets the stage for significant advancements. Competitors like Solana, Cardano, and Polkadot are also making strides, but AVAX’s unique strategies give it a distinctive edge. Continual innovation and cross-chain initiatives will likely bolster AVAX’s standing in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC News Today and Price Zones to Watch,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/bitcoin-breakout-looms-btc-news-today-and-price-zones-to-watch,"Bitcoin's price action suggests the potential for significant movement. Analysts are closely monitoring key levels that could indicate a major shift. The current state of Bitcoin could offer clues about the broader cryptocurrency market. Stay tuned to discover which digital assets might be poised for impressive gains. In the fast-paced and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, where narratives can quickly evolve and attention spans are short, strategic timing and maximum visibility are paramount.

Driven by the tokenzation theme, I think Ether has some way up to go yet - we have a target price range of $42-49. A break below $28 would render our thesis bunk.

Nothing in this note is intended to be investment advice and nor should itbe relied upon to make investment decisions. Please read our full disclaimer here . One More Push To The Summit! by Alex King, CEO, Cestrian Capital Research, Inc. Crypto has been good to me. Not because I was early, but because I was late. Not because I piled in before Big Money, but because I just followed Big Money around, which is my normal investment strategy. As an old person I have seen countless native-crypto enterprises fail, from Mt. Gox onwards. And whilst Wall Street’s shortcomings are well documented, the likelihood of a total wipeout, custodians losing your shares, etc, is just that bit lower in TradFi than it is in DigitalFi. So for most of my investing history I avoided the siren song of Bitcoin and all its lower-order brethren for fear of my hard-earned turning to a pile of ashes and/or ending up in a thumb drive at the bottom of a municipal dump (I know I would be that guy if I used offline hardware wallets) and/or being stolen in a home invasion. Doesn’t mean I didn’t study and watch crypto, and by that I don't mean tuning in to the endless torrent of crypto-influencer garbage that is inflicted daily on the unsuspecting. No swarm of digital hornets for me. I mean watching the theory, use cases and institutionalization of crypto. The now-this-might-get-interesting moment for me was when in 2018 or 2019 I read Life After Google by George Gilder . Before this, the only use cases I could imagine with crypto (meaning Bitcoin, since everything else seemed like scams or hopium to me) were i. price manipulation for the benefit of holders and miners ii. transborder value transfer for holders with no access to the SWIFT system and iii. a store of value which whilst more volatile than the U.S. dollar, was and is less volatile than many other currencies around the world, and also not in and of itself subject to capital controls. When I read the Gilder book, the phrase that kept nagging at me about Ethereum (for this is Gilder’s crypto focus in his tome, following meetings with Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of the Ethereum blockchain system) was “smart contracts”. It took me a while to understand what that meant, but I figured it was important. Crypto as you know was not a protection against the supposed evils of fiat currency when the equity market swooned in 2022. Bitcoin and Ether dumped faster than a recent Nasdaq listee. For a time it looked like these things were just creations of the free-money boom that began in 2009. All the associated stocks - your Coinbases ( COIN ) and whatnot - were in freefall and the SEC was building a big stockpile of howitzers with which to assault the crypto-industrial complex. Yikes. Then this happened: CNBC, 15 June 2023 (CNBC.com) That changed it all in my view, since what’s good enough for Mr. Fink is surely good enough for me. I started trading the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, once it launched. And it became very clear to me that whatever the SEC’s position at the time, that Big Money - the Biggest Of Big Money in fact - was at ease with working with Coinbase ( COIN ), which likely meant that it would work out fine for Mr. Armstrong and company. I had been winning with a small short position in COIN (nothing very meaningful, as I scare easily); I duly closed it to bank the gains as soon as I saw that headline. I continued to ignore all the cryptobabble on the news and on social, and instead continued to trade IBIT according to i. standard technical analysis - it trades just fine to standard securities pattern-recognition methods - and ii. the risk on/risk off quantitative signal systems we run here at Cestrian, some of which are crypto-focused. This has all worked out pretty well. I think Bitcoin has some upside from here, more than the bears think and less than the bulls yell at you. I’m holding IBIT for a little longer yet. Now, back to Ethereum and those smart contracts. Until Wall Street’s “a-ha!” moment as regards tokenization, I confess I thought this had proven to be a bust; and the price performance of Ether vs. Bitcoin agreed with me. But then along came two developments; firstly, the embrace of stablecoins within the GENIUS Act, and secondly the coalescence around the Ethereum blockchain as the database of choice for tokenized asset holdings. The GENIUS Act is a wonderful piece of martial art; truly, it is using one’s opponent’s force to hurt the opponent. The energy in crypto is being used to support the dollar and support U.S. Treasuries, because the more crypto the more stablecoins and the more stablecoins the more collateral, and that collateral comes in the form of none other than Uncle Sam’s finest paper. And just like that - the Old World has bear-hugged the new. Never bet against a Boomer. Ethereum as the database for tokenized assets has catalyzed an upward move in the price of Ether, and I think it has legs yet. To re-hash, a tokenized asset is just a digital version of said asset. Could be a painting, a building, a classic car collection, or a share of AT&T. What was analog and offline can now be digital and online. You can choose your own reason as to why tokenization is being embraced by Wall Street. The folk-hero reason is “to democratize access to previously illiquid elite assets!” like private credit funds and so on. That could be true. Or, it could be that asset owners are seeking new pools of liquidity to keep the bid going. And it could be that the providers of the plumbing might welcome the lack of clarity in securities regulation as regards tokenization . Choose your own ending. Me, I always choose darkness as regards securities markets, so I’m going with “yippee, we get to sell unmovable chunks of private credit funds into 401ks and best of all they might not even be securities yay!! ”. But you could choose life and believe it’s to do with helping people. Don’t let my cynicism drag you down. Anyway, if you want to play on the Ethereum block chain, and Wall Street really does, trust me - then you need some Ether on hand. Why? Because just like you used to have to pay Ma Bell in US Dollars to process your transactions on Tuxedo, now you have to pay the Ethereum People in Ether to process your transactions on their blockchain. In exchange for which, if you “stake” (deposit or lend) your Ether, you’ll be paid a yield. Not the elusive “Bitcoin Yield” that Mr. Saylor is wont to cite but actual yield, albeit paid to you in … more Ether. All of this is why Ether has been on the rise lately. And back to my original take about native crypto vs. Big Money Crypto, you won’t find me buying any of the native stuff. The recent liquidation meltdown in crypto exchanges only supports my resolve to not go near them. Here’s Ether vs. the S&P, the Nasdaq and Bitcoin since the post-Liberation Day lows this year. Ether vs. Bitcoin vs. The Old People (YCharts.com) And here’s where I think Ether can get to before any major correction: Ether Potential Outlook (TradingView, Cestrian Capital Research, Inc) This chart assumes that Ether doesn’t break below $3500 - if it does the next stop is the 200-day simple moving average at $3175, and if that gives way only the Gates of Hades are a definite stop. But if $3500 holds, I think the 5-wave projection model, just standard Fibonacci extensions and retracements, gets Ether to somewhere between $5250-6250. And if that happens? I’m out of here. Because at that point probably the overall market is looking for a rest, and since I don’t much want to hold such a volatile asset on the way down, I’ll take my ball home and wait for support to be found. My choice of instrument in Ether is, it won’t surprise you to learn, the BlackRock ETF, ETHA. This is the biggest and most liquid Ether ETF of all , with the lowest fees of any at-scale Ether ETF. Using the same chart logic as for Ether itself, I think ETHA can hit $42-49 before a material correction; for those who like to use sell-stop-limit orders I would suggest considering such a stop a little way below the Wave 4 low shown on this chart. Consider choosing a not-obvious number so your stop can’t be as easily hunted out as it otherwise might.

While Cardano (ADA) once captured that narrative with its smart-contract ambitions, market data now suggests its momentum toward the next crypto to hit $1 may be fading. In its place, a new coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has captured the spotlight. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, it is priced at $0.035 with over 70% already sold out. The project has raised more than $17.45 million and attracted over 17,220 unique holders. Unlike many speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance blends innovation with strong tokenomics, offering a dual-lending model that combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems for greater capital efficiency. With increasing whale accumulation and surging retail participation, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the best altcoin to buy right now, and potentially the next crypto to hit $1 as DeFi adoption accelerates through 2026. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: Healthy Consolidation Prior to the Next Breakout Cardano (ADA) has entered a consolidation phase after its stellar recovery bounce earlier this month, and the price activity has stabilized in the neighborhood of the $0.70 level. On the 3-day chart, this sideways movement is a sign that the buying interest is holding tight to major levels of support while accumulating liquidity for the next gigantic move. The demand area between $0.68–$0.75 is crucial to the maintenance of the bullish market setup for ADA; retaining a higher level above this area may pave the way for targets around $0.85, $0.95, and the psychological $1.00 level. This cooling-off process appears constructive and may propel the subsequent leg higher for ADA predicated on the condition that BTC remains above $110,000. In spite of the favorable setup for ADA, most traders are also broadening the ambit of their vision towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while gearing for the next wave of market momentum into 2026. Mutuum Finance Grows Quicker than Expected Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already proving to be amongst the most promising new crypto coin projects in the DeFi space with growth already surpassing initial expectations. The current website presale has already attracted over 17,220 traders and has successfully raised a total of over $17.45 million to date. This momentum has positioned MUTM as a top altcoin to buy for investors looking to enter a high-potential DeFi project early. The project is currently in Phase 6 with the token trading at $0.035 amidst the enhanced confidence from investors and the reasonable long-term demand in place. This spectacular growth positions Mutuum Finance as the number-one crypto to invest in 2025 and a strong contender for the next crypto to hit $1 in the upcoming market cycle. In its roadmap, Mutuum Finance will shortly publish its lending and borrowing protocol as a major upgrade to its development in the DeFi ecosystem. Version 1 (V1) will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 with a revolutionary set of decentralized financial instruments such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported for lending and borrowing initially along with collateralization, providing instant access to a safe, affordable, and fully decentralized funding solution. These innovations secure Mutuum Finance’s position as not just a curious new cryptocurrency project to track, but also one of the best altcoin to buy for long-term growth and adoption. Daily Leaderboard Positions Top 5 investors from the past 24 hours invested $796, $535, $505, $474, and $440 respectively in MUTM tokens, a testament to the growing interest and engagement of the community. The player who is ranked #1 every day on the board receives MUTM tokens valued at $500. To qualify, users need only complete a single trade within the 24-hour period, keeping community activity high and liquidity active. This gamified leaderboard is another reason MUTM is widely considered the best altcoin to buy by investors watching emerging top cryptocurrencies. Mutuum Finance has raised over $17.45 million from 17,220 holders in Phase 6, already over 70% sold. Record day buys of $796, $535, and $505 highlight the exploding community activity and momentum. With its lending and borrowing protocol soon to be released, MUTM combines innovation, scalability, and real DeFi utility, making it the next crypto to hit $1 and a top pick for investors seeking early exposure to high-upside tokens. Secure your tokens today and be part of the next explosion of growth in the DeFi market, as MUTM emerges as the next big crypto in the 2025 cycle.

Prices move fast, hype comes and goes, and most investors are left wondering which tokens are worth their time. Among all the noise, three projects under $10 are catching attention: PancakeSwap, Morpho, and the one that really stands out, Little Pepe . What makes Little Pepe exciting is the upside analysts are discussing, with projections of up to a 10,000% increase from its presale price. PancakeSwap (CAKE) PancakeSwap is trading at $2.61 as of October 12. It has been showing some modest gains lately and the weekly charts hint at steady growth. PancakeSwap operates on the BNB Chain and is one of the most active decentralized exchanges on the market. Holding CAKE gives users a voice in governance while also opening staking and liquidity rewards. From a technical view, CAKE’s chart looks lively. Momentum indicators are leaning bullish. It recently broke out of a triangle pattern that had been forming for weeks. If capital continues to flow into DeFi, CAKE could benefit. For a bold outlook, CAKE might push toward $5 to $6 in the next wave. In an aggressive bull market with stronger BNB ecosystem activity, it could even stretch toward $8 to $10. That would mean nearly a 3× to 4× move from where it sits today. Morpho (MORPHO) Morpho is trading around $1.97 as of October 12. Yesterday, it spiked over 20%, which already shows that people are paying attention. Morpho is built around improving the lending and borrowing side of DeFi. The token supply is about 522 million out of a max of 1 billion, so there’s still a lot of room for tokens to circulate. Examining the market action, Morpho is exhibiting bullish energy. The MACD and other momentum signals lean positive. The price has pushed past weeks of flat trading, and daily volumes have climbed, which signals that buyers are backing the move. Large holders have also been adding to their positions, another sign that people with deeper pockets are betting on Morpho’s future. In an aggressive projection, Morpho could climb to the $6 to $10 range if adoption continues. If DeFi lending heats up again and Morpho captures market share, there’s a chance it could even surpass $15 over time. From its current $1.97, that would be close to a 10× return in the best case. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe is a memecoin with utility and serious planning behind it. As of writing, the presale is in stage 13 at $0.0022 . Over 95% of this stage has already been sold with more than $27 million raised so far. Stage 12 closed successfully, showing that demand has not slowed. What sets LILPEPE apart is the combination of meme culture with real infrastructure. It is building on a layer 2 optimized for meme tokens, with features like sniper bot resistance and zero tax trading. It has also passed a Certik audit , which gives it more credibility than most meme projects. Community incentives are fueling massive growth. The $777k giveaway already has more than 455,100 entries, while the mega giveaway for big presale buyers has over 78,500 entries. These campaigns are not just noise. They are helping Little Pepe build one of the most active meme communities right now. Because Little Pepe is starting from a zero market cap base, its upside is significantly larger than that of older tokens. Analysts see potential for a 10000% increase from the presale price. That would take LILPEPE from $0.0022 to roughly $0.22. Early-stage investors are already sitting on gains, and stage 13 buyers could still lock in a 37% upside before launch at $0.0030. With upcoming centralized exchange listings also in the pipeline, the catalysts are strong. Final thoughts For anyone exploring cryptos under $10, PancakeSwap and Morpho are both attractive choices with clear upside potential. CAKE offers maturity and steady growth while MORPHO provides exposure to newer DeFi opportunities. But it is Little Pepe that feels like the breakout candidate. With its presale momentum, whale accumulation, community giveaways, and zero market cap advantage, it has all the ingredients for a massive move. If the bullish projections hold, LILPEPE could be the meme coin that delivers the legendary 10000% increase many investors dream of. To join the presale before the final listing, visit the website , join the Telegram community , follow updates on Twitter , and participate in the 777k giveaway .

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-dont-sleep-on-xrp-heres-why/,"The cryptocurrency market often rewards those who pay attention to subtle shifts before they explode into mainstream awareness. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, seasoned traders know that true opportunities often arise when attention is elsewhere. XRP, Ripple’s digital asset for global payments, is quietly gaining renewed traction—and analysts warn investors not to overlook what could be one of the next major momentum plays. A Market Reawakening Beneath the Surface Periods of low volatility can be deceptive. They often mask the accumulation phase preceding a strong breakout. That’s the quiet space where altcoins like XRP tend to regain strength. As the market digests the latest macro developments and ETF-driven liquidity cycles, XRP has maintained steady on-chain activity, growing institutional engagement, and signs of returning investor confidence—all while trading under historical resistance levels. Don’t Sleep on #XRP pic.twitter.com/SVIzEEbfRF — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 16, 2025 Tom Bruni Highlights XRP and Ethereum as Top Altcoins to Watch In a recent CoinDesk interview clip shared on X by Levi Rietveld, Tom Bruni, a market strategist and head of markets at Stocktwits, identified XRP alongside Ethereum as the two altcoins drawing renewed investor attention. “Bitcoin will always remain a core portion of people’s portfolios,” Bruni noted, “but Ethereum and Ripple (XRP) are two of the altcoins that people are watching for confirmation of a new breath of momentum coming into this market.” This recognition places XRP among a select few assets that analysts believe could lead the next rotation of capital in the altcoin market. Bruni’s comments were shared by Levi Rietveld, a respected crypto commentator on X, who emphasized the strategic importance of XRP’s position in the evolving market landscape. His post reignited conversation within the XRP community, amplifying investor interest in Ripple’s ecosystem and its long-term potential. Regulatory Clarity Strengthens Ripple’s Position A crucial catalyst supporting renewed optimism around XRP is the steady clearing of legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple. Following a series of pivotal rulings and courtroom developments in 2023 and 2025, Ripple and the U.S. SEC have formally brought an end to the years-long litigation that clouded XRP’s regulatory status. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This resolution has reshaped institutional sentiment. With clearer legal boundaries, Ripple has accelerated enterprise partnerships and cross-border payment integrations through RippleNet and its RLUSD stablecoin. The company’s recent acquisition of GTreasury , a SWIFT-certified treasury management platform , further aligns Ripple with global banking networks—an integration that could significantly enhance XRP’s utility in international finance. The Technical and Sentiment Outlook While XRP’s price has consolidated in recent weeks, the underlying sentiment metrics tell a different story. Social engagement has climbed following Rietveld’s viral post, and trading volume on major exchanges has shown a modest but steady uptick. Historical data suggests XRP often precedes sharp upward movements following similar phases of accumulation. Market watchers are eyeing critical resistance zones near previous highs, where a confirmed breakout could validate Bruni’s thesis of a “new breath of momentum.” As traders reassess portfolio allocations, XRP’s combination of regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and community-driven momentum positions it as a key altcoin to watch closely. The Case for Not Sleeping on XRP The message from top analysts is consistent—ignore XRP at your peril. It may no longer command the speculative hype of earlier cycles, but it is gaining something far more valuable: credibility, clarity, and real-world adoption. As Tom Bruni and Levi Rietveld highlighted, XRP stands at a strategic crossroads of regulation, technology, and liquidity. For investors looking beyond short-term noise, XRP’s current calm may well be the precursor to its next major move. In markets like crypto, the quiet phases often separate those who sleep from those who seize the opportunity.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $80.11 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $231.90 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $14.99 Market Cap $557.86M Trading Volume (24-hour) $125.33 Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $16.45 24-h Low $14.43 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) 11.36% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $ 21.48 14-Day RSI 35.46 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 22 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $ 21.91 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENS remains bearish below the 20-SMA at $16.12 with weak buying momentum Support lies between $14.70 and $14.30, while resistance is near $16.50 A breakout above $16.50 could push toward $17.50 to $19.00 otherwise, the trend stays bearish Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView On October 17, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is trading at around $15.02 on the day chart. This indicates a 3.21% decline, continuing its bearish trend. The price remains below the 20-day moving average at $19.02, indicating sustained downward momentum. The RSI at 32.76 suggests the asset is nearing oversold conditions, hinting at potential stabilization or a minor rebound. However, the MACD histogram continues to show widening bearish momentum, confirming selling pressure. If ENS fails to hold the $13.84 support, a deeper correction toward $12.00 could follow. A recovery above $16.50–$17.00 is essential to regain bullish traction and challenge the $19 resistance zone. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis E NSUSD chart by TradingView Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is trading near $14.92, showing a minor 1.63% decline on the 4-hour chart as bearish momentum persists. The price remains below the 20-period SMA at $16.12, indicating strong seller control. The MACD chart reflects weak bullish activity, with the signal line still trending below zero. The Balance of Power reading of -0.58 confirms negative sentiment. Support is seen at $14.73, and failure to hold this level could push prices toward $13.80. However, a rebound above $15.50–$16.00 could signal a short-term recovery toward $17.50, provided buying volume strengthens in upcoming sessions. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 18.97 SELL SMA 5 $ 18.51 SELL SMA 10 $ 19.14 SELL SMA 21 $ 20.27 SELL SMA 50 $ 21.48 SELL SMA 100 $ 23.95 SELL SMA 200 $ 21.91 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 19.85 SELL EMA 5 $ 20.80 SELL EMA 10 $ 22.10 SELL EMA 21 $ 23.60 SELL EMA 50 $ 24.46 SELL EMA 100 $ 23.82 SELL EMA 200 $ 23.24 SELL What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is trading around $14.90, showing persistent bearish momentum as the price remains below the 20-SMA at $16.12. The MACD stays negative, confirming weak bullish momentum, while the Balance of Power (-0.58) signals continued selling pressure. The RSI at 33–38 suggests oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term rebound. However, failure to hold above the $14.70–$14.30 support zone could trigger further declines toward $13.80. For recovery, ENS must close above $16.50, which could pave the way toward $17.50–$19.00. Until then, the market sentiment remains largely bearish and cautious. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $98.47 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $231.90 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The minimum price for ENS could reach $18.84 Month Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price October $18.84 $20.83 $21.42 Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2025 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is forecasted to trade at a minimum of $21.73, an average of $22.53, and a maximum of $23.34 in 2025. This relatively stable range is expected because ENS adoption continues to grow, with integrations into PayPal, L2 networks, and broader Web3 identity use cases supporting consistent demand. Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $21.73 $22.53 $23.34 Ethereum Name Service price predictions 2026 – 2031 Year Minimum price Average price Maximum price 2026 $30.97 $32.10 $38.31 2027 $45.49 $47.09 $55.63 2028 $65.23 $67.11 $80.11 2029 $95.79 $98.47 $114.66 2030 $130.04 $134.96 $166.02 2031 $198.46 $203.86 $231.90 Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2026 In 2026, ENS is projected to reach a minimum of $30.97, an average of $32.10, and a maximum of $38.31. This growth is expected due to rising Web3 identity adoption, L2 integrations reducing costs, potential ENS Layer-2 development, and easing token unlock pressures, which will support stronger demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2027 In 2027, ENS is forecasted to trade between $45.49 and $55.63, with an average of $47.09. This rise is attributed to the wider adoption of Web3 identities, stronger cross-chain interoperability, and ENS’s maturity as a decentralized naming standard. Reduced token unlock pressure and sustained Ethereum ecosystem growth will further support higher valuation potential. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2028 It is expected that ENS will trade between $65.23 and $80.11 in 2028, with an average of $67.11. This growth is anticipated as ENS becomes a key Web3 identity layer, widely used in DeFi, NFTs, and payments, and gaining more recognition around the world. Better scalability, lower costs, and more mature governance will all help maintain high demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2029 In 2029, ENS is forecasted between $95.79 and $114.66, averaging $98.47. Growth is driven by ENS’s role as a universal Web3 identity standard, stronger enterprise and government adoption, and Ethereum’s maturity. Reduced token supply pressures and solidified network effects support higher stability, making ENS a key digital identity infrastructure. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2030 The Ethereum Name Service’s price for 2030 is projected to be a minimum of $130.04. According to expert analysis, ENS could reach a maximum possible level of $166.02 and an average price of $134.96. However, this is anticipated as ENS establishes itself in the crypto space with widespread use in finance, social media, and digital governance. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2031 In 2031, ENS is forecasted between $198.46 and $231.90, with an average of $203.86. This projection stems from ENS’s deep integration into global Web3 and Web2 systems, powering digital identity, payments, and decentralized governance. With entrenched network effects, strong enterprise adoption, and Ethereum’s ecosystem maturity, ENS demand and valuation are expected to rise further.

If you weren’t lucky enough to hop on that rocket ship early, don’t sweat it; there’s still time to catch the next wave. Here are the 4 millionaire-making cryptos you should not miss in 2025. At the top of the list is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , the new token creating a buzz you won’t want to ignore. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the new meme token everyone’s talking about The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale has been selling out quickly, with 26.5% of the total 100 billion token supply already claimed. Stage twelve sold out completely, and stage thirteen is underway at just $0.0022 per token, raising over $1.5 million and counting. This isn’t just another token trying to capitalize on Ethereum; it’s carving out its own lane, blending meme culture with serious cryptocurrency technology. CertiK has audited the project, awarding it a 95.49% security score, which proves that this meme coin is a serious business. With listings planned on two top centralized exchanges and eyes set on the world’s biggest exchange, Little Pepe is poised to make waves in 2025. Early investors are already seeing the momentum, and many are predicting explosive gains. For anyone looking to ride a new crypto wave, LILPEPE is hard to ignore. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one of the four projects that really stand out. It combines community energy, meme culture, and serious blockchain technology in a way that appeals to both new and experienced crypto investors. The fact that it is selling well before the sale shows that the market is paying attention. New listings on exchanges could help LILPEPE reach new heights. Little Pepe is a fun, fast, and possibly life-changing crypto that you should look into. It’s not just a meme token; it’s a comprehensive system that rewards those who get in early, making 2025 the year of substantial profits. Cardano (ADA): the reliable workhorse ADA is currently trading at $0.6478, up 0.65% from the previous day. It appears that it could break out. Due to the bullish triple bottom that the weekly chart has formed, ADA may soon surpass the $0.824 50% Fibonacci level. With the potential to create millionaires along the way, ADA might be prepared to make its consolidation phase an exciting journey. This is due to its fundamentals being strong, and activity on the blockchain is growing. TRON (TRX): the underdog ready to run Next up is TRON (TRX), a token that many investors are sleeping on. At $0.3159, TRX has been quietly building strength, hinting at a major breakout. A consolidation around $0.34, far from its August peak of $0.370, has created a perfect setup for a breakout above resistance at $0.338. If TRX catches momentum, early investors could see returns that feel straight out of a success story. For anyone who’s been waiting for the underdog to shine, this is your chance. Ethena (ENA): the wild card After rising 13.16% over the course of a day, ENA is currently trading at $0.3673, having recovered from significant support levels. This shows that it can handle volatility. Positive correlations with the top ten cryptocurrency assets and volume patterns suggest that a larger recovery may be imminent. For those willing to ride the wave, ENA offers a thrilling combination of risk and reward. Its movements may be unpredictable, but the potential for explosive gains makes it a standout among millionaire-making cryptos this year. Conclusion Missing Bitcoin doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance at crypto wealth. Four projects have the potential to produce millionaires by 2025: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Cardano (ADA), TRON (TRX), and Ethena (ENA). Little Pepe is unique among them because it combines technology, community, and pure hype. You might be able to catch the next cryptocurrency rocket before it leaves the station if you arrive early and keep an eye on the momentum.

People familiar with the situation said France’s Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) has been conducting checks on numerous exchanges since the end of last year. However, they declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the reviews. Sources also said Binance and Coinhouse are part of the group of PSANs currently being examined by the ACPR. The regulator had reportedly also instructed Binance last year to reinforce its risk procedures. Those who fail to meet the French requirements on time could be subject to enforcement measures or denied future MiCA approval. Companies offering crypto services in France face a June 2026 deadline The French reviews are unfolding against a backdrop of growing friction over how EU nations should coordinate crypto enforcement, ten months into the new regulatory regime. Last month, France, Austria, and Italy urged the EU’s markets watchdog to assume direct control over major crypto companies and tighten existing rules, citing inconsistencies in national implementation. Regulators are conducting these checks to ensure that crypto firms comply with the conditions of their PSAN status, particularly their systems for preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. After inspections, companies are generally granted several months by the ACPR to correct shortcomings. The regulator shares its findings with the French Financial Markets Authority, the AMF, and noncompliance could result in penalties or threaten a firm’s eligibility for a MiCA license, which enables EU-wide operations. French crypto service providers have until June 2026 to obtain the new license. To date, the AMF has issued it to only a few players, such as Deblock, GOin, Bitstack, and CACEIS, which Crédit Agricole owns. Regulators have warned Binance to improve its compliance systems French authorities had launched an investigation into Binance over suspected money laundering and tax violations related to its activities from 2019 to 2024. Even after being one of the first international exchanges approved as a digital asset service provider in France in 2022, Binance has continued to receive warnings to enhance its transparency and compliance setup. Last year, the ACPR instructed Binance to enhance its compliance and risk management, according to one source, who added that the regulator frequently encourages firms to develop these departments or secure their IT systems. The Paris-based European arm of Binance has reiterated its full cooperation with regulators and its dedication to aligning with the EU’s evolving regulatory landscape. The European Union plans to implement its digital asset rules by late 2025. According to the AMF’s revised rules, all registered crypto-asset service providers will need to meet stricter operational, security, and reporting requirements by December 30, 2025. Without full MiCA authorization by July 1, 2026, firms may no longer be permitted to operate within the European Union. As recently as September, France had stated that it might seek to prevent some crypto firms licensed in other EU countries from operating domestically, as part of a push to transfer supervision to the bloc’s central securities regulator. Under the EU’s new regulatory regime, crypto companies are flocking to jurisdictions with lower licensing requirements, said Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, President of France’s financial market authority, AMF. MiCA, a wide-ranging slate of digital asset rules that came into force this year, grants crypto firms the ability to apply for licences from individual EU countries, which they can then use as a “passport” to operate across all 27 nations in the bloc.

Though $BTC is down at $105K compared to its $124K peak just ten days ago, it’s still the crown jewel of crypto. Highlighting the coin’s weight, global governments alone hold a whopping 515,223 $BTC , now valued at roughly $54.50B. But despite its dominance, the Bitcoin network itself was never designed for the modern demands of DeFi – particularly when it boils down to speed, scalability, and flexibility. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in – a L2 scaling solution that has raised $24M on presale to make Bitcoin speedier, cheaper, and smart contract-friendly. Solana Block Times 1,200x Faster Than Bitcoin Bitcoin’s throughput is much more limited than newer chains. Take Solana, for instance, it can process over 1.2K transactions per second (tps) in real time, while Bitcoin averages just 6–7 tps. In fact, Bitcoin’s peak performance has only ever topped 7 tps, a far cry from Solana’s eye-boggling 65K tps. Block times are yet another bottleneck. Solana confirms blocks in 0.4 seconds, whereas it takes Bitcoin up to 8 minutes – a tiresome 1,200x longer. Right now, transaction fees on Bitcoin are somewhat pricey at $0.70. Well, at least compared to Solana’s super low $0.0028. Unlike Solana and Ethereum, Bitcoin also doesn’t have smart contract functionality. This means that users can’t access dApps, DeFi protocols, or the best meme coins on the chain… for now. Bitcoin Hyper to Bring Faster & Cheaper Transactions to Bitcoin The L2 scaling solution Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and DeFi-ready. After it goes live this quarter, it aims to bring Solana-level performance to the Bitcoin network by leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . It’s what makes it possible for Solana to handle thousands of tps, after all. A Canonical Bridge will also boost Bitcoin’s utility to greater heights. Because it’ll enable wrapped versions of $BTC to move freely between Bitcoin’s mainnet and the L2, the tokens will be able to be deployed in various Web3 ecosystems quickly and cheaply. For the first time ever, Bitcoin will be able to unlock new cases and broader liquidity, all while retaining the network’s favored security. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus , global mining network, and decentralized validator base make it one of the most secure and censorship-resistant blockchains ever created. Therefore, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t being built on speculation but on one of the strongest foundations in existence. $HYPER Investors Eye Possible 2,300%+ Gains $HYPER is behind the upcoming L2 network, designed to drive scalability, governance, and growth. Token holders are granted lower gas fees, voting rights, and 49% APY staking rewards (that’s provided you lock up your tokens today). A whopping 30% of its total token supply is dedicated to fund development, so you can rest assured that there’ll be continuous innovation, and thus likely token sustainability. You can buy $HYPER on presale for as little as $0.013125, using either $ETH, $USDT, $USDC, or $BNB. After the token’s listed on the top exchanges, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction foresees $HYPER breaking $0.32 before 2026 kicks off. When taking the current price of $HYPER into account, now’s a great time to join for possible gains exceeding 2,300% in the near future. Join the $HYPER presale.

ETH Faces Key Test After Another Sharp Pullback,https://cryptopotato.com/bull-or-bear-eth-faces-key-test-after-another-sharp-pullback/,"Ethereum is trading at $3,780 after falling 6% in the last 24 hours and 13% over the past week. Despite the pullback, market analysts are split on where the asset could move next. While some charts suggest a shift in momentum, others point to a completed retest and the potential start of a new upward trend. Analyst Expects New Leg Toward $10K Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe believes Ethereum may be preparing for its next leg upward. He noted that the asset recently completed a key retest and may break to new highs soon. In his view , “In the coming days, maybe 1–2 weeks, a new leg on ETH starts.” He also added that the retest of the previous resistance zone appears complete, which could open the door for a breakout. Van de Poppe suggested this move could potentially bring Ethereum closer to the $10,000 mark, assuming momentum builds in the short term. On the ETH/BTC pair, Ethereum is holding above a support level near 0.033 BTC, which had acted as resistance earlier in the year. The asset is now around 0.036 BTC, showing signs of stability. The area has been identified as an “ ideal zone for buys ” by traders watching the pullback closely. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Volume has dropped during the retracement. These signals support a possible continuation of the prior trend if this support holds. A 44% rally from June to the recent high adds further weight to the idea of another move upward. MACD Turns Bearish on Weekly Chart At the same time, other indicators are signaling caution. The weekly MACD has turned red, and the MACD line is curling down toward the signal line. According to Satoshi Stacker, IF YOU HOLD $ETH YOU NEED TO SEE THIS! ETH’s MACD has flipped red on the weekly timeframe. If this signal is confirmed at the weekly close, it historically leads into a pattern of a drop, a bounce, and then a further drop with losses ranging from -18% to -80%. pic.twitter.com/LFlojYHzrC — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) October 17, 2025 Previous MACD bearish crossovers on the weekly chart have resulted in losses ranging from 18% to over 80%. While the current signal is not yet confirmed, traders are monitoring for any signs of a deeper correction. Range Bound with Key Levels to Watch ETH is currently trading in a range between $3,530 and $4,800, according to Ali Martinez. The $4,100 level has acted as both support and resistance. A break above $4,800 would signal strength, while a drop below $3,530 could confirm a bearish breakdown.

Speaking on Fox Business Network, Trump said, “It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is. They forced me to do that.” The comment came as Washington and Beijing remain stuck in another round of tense trade talks, this time triggered by China’s tightening control over rare earth exports, a move that hit straight at the core of American tech manufacturing. The announcement followed Trump’s rollout of additional 100% levies on China’s U.S.-bound exports a week earlier, coupled with new export controls on critical software set to take effect by November 1, nine days before current tariff relief expires. Trump said the action was necessary to protect American industries from Chinese dominance in rare earth elements. These minerals, mostly processed in China, are key to products like smartphones, chips, and defense systems. Trump prepares for Xi meeting in South Korea Trump also confirmed he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks, a meeting he previously doubted would happen. “I think we’re going to be fine with China,” Trump said. “But we have to have a fair deal. It’s got to be fair.” The remark was seen as an attempt to strike a diplomatic balance before the summit. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to speak by phone with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to keep trade discussions alive. A senior White House official reportedly told CNBC that the conversation would focus on “ongoing negotiations” between the two nations, though the timing and next steps were not immediately revealed. Officials described the call as part of a continued effort to stabilize relations before Trump’s face-to-face meeting with Xi. The White House’s latest trade measures mark another escalation following Beijing’s export curbs, which tightened the flow of rare earths crucial to U.S. technology manufacturing. These curbs sparked renewed debate over supply chains that remain heavily dependent on Chinese processing capacity. Trump’s 100% tariff announcement, though intended as leverage, has raised fears about rising production costs and potential inflation impacts inside the U.S. Public sentiment turns against Trump’s tariff policies Back home, American public opinion is shifting. The CNBC All-America Economic Survey shows growing pessimism about the economy in the third quarter, with more people worried about jobs, inflation, and cost of living. The same survey revealed Trump’s economic approval rating slid to 42% approval and 55% disapproval, giving him a -13 net rating, the lowest of any CNBC poll during his presidency. Trump’s overall approval also fell to 44%, down from 46%, while disapproval ticked up to 52%. The results continue a trend in his second term where his economic ratings now trail his overall approval, the opposite of what was seen during his first term when strong economic growth bolstered his numbers. The survey of 1,000 respondents nationwide, with a margin of error of ±3.1%, found 53% of Americans blaming Trump and Republicans in Congress for potential fallout from the ongoing government shutdown, while 37% blamed Democrats. The data also show dissatisfaction with key policies: only 34% approve of his handling of inflation and cost of living, while 62% disapprove — the worst of any CNBC survey during his second term. And on tariffs, 56% of respondents disapprove compared to 41% who approve, resulting in a net approval of -15, down from -6 last quarter.

The price rise is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The project’s next price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise to $0.00021673. Husky Inu’s fundraising has also picked up since crossing the $900,000 milestone over the previous weekend. Husky Inu has raised $903,012 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Move To $0.00021610 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00021548 to $0.00021610. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of its presale. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu’s next price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from its current level to $0.00021673. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Fundraising Picking Up Again Husky Inu finally crossed the $900,000 milestone over the previous weekend. The project had struggled to raise funds during the market downturn as investors pulled capital and adopted a wait-and-watch approach in September. While the markets witnessed another spectacular crash last Friday, fundraising has not been impacted by the latest downturn. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Thanks to its dynamic strategy, Husky Inu has raised $902,862 so far, and could reach $900,000 before the end of the month. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. The project has raised $903,012 so far, and remains on track to reach $1,000,000 before its official launch date.

As the next bull run may come, others are discussing how they could convert their existing holdings, such as $1,000 of Solana, into new, high-growth presale projects. An opportunity like this is Ozak AI ($OZ) , an innovative cryptocurrency solution that will use the colossal potential of artificial intelligence and blockchain integration. This is the way you may potentially invest with Ozak AI and multiply your investment 5x. Solana Price Analysis Over the years, Solana has shown great performance, as it has always been among the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. Solana is currently at a price of $ 224.39, but it has fluctuated a little in the past 24 hours. Even though the project has small declines, it is still a strong one with a market cap of 122.64 billion. Nonetheless, the recent drop in the trading volume and minor opposition at the $230 level make many question the short-term opportunities of Solana. This could indicate some consolidation or a potential reduction in its growth curve. To investors in Solana, the question would be, Where can they go now with a high probability of growth? Although the future of Solana is bright, people are starting to consider options that will blend the modern technological achievements with the disruptive nature of cryptocurrency. This is where Ozak AI is involved. What Is Ozak AI? Ozak AI combines AI and blockchain infrastructure, which relies on decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) to improve analytics and automation. The platform is created with the help of the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), which enables aggregating data in real-time to get predictive data to use in market analysis. Its decentralized data processing through smart contract technology and immutable blockchain system guarantees a secure and secure data processing in different fields, such as financial markets, IoT, and capital markets. The project has focused its eyes on the fast-developing crossroad of AI and blockchain, where machine learning algorithms are used to create real-time market predictions and risk analysis. Ozak AI would be of great use to individual and institutional investors because it provides very precise information with the use of machine learning methods such as ARIMA and neural networks. The Ozak AI Presale: An Investment With Pure Potential. The current presale of Ozak AI is a unique chance for an early investor to enter the ground floor of the project that may become even more successful than such already existing assets as Solana. Having a low price of only $0.012 per token, which is currently, Ozak AI is currently presenting a high upside potential. The next phase price increase to $0.014 offers a clear incentive for investors to act quickly. Better still is the current target price of the project of $1.00 per token, which is projected to give a potential 5x payoff at the present point. There is already a high involvement in the presale, as more than 3.66 million dollars have been raised and close to 938 million tokens have been sold, implying that there is a high demand. The presale is currently in Phase 6, further highlighting that the project is gaining momentum as it moves toward its official launch. Ozak AI's Competitive Edge The combination of AI and blockchain technology by Ozak AI is not confined to another presale project. The platform will be in place to facilitate decentralized and secure data aggregation, and therefore, it will make the system very reliable and scalable. Its emphasis on real-time data processing is a game-changer in the industries that need timely, actionable insights like those in cryptocurrency markets, equities, and forex trading. Also, Ozak AI has already partnered with the key industry players, such as Pyth Network to receive real-time financial data, Dex3 to get liquidity features, and Hive Intel to process blockchain data. Such partnerships improve the infrastructure of the platform to provide the speed and scalability needed to process large amounts of financial data. Another high-priority concern is Ozak AI security, and the project has been audited by CertiK, which has ensured that its smart contracts and ecosystem are safe against potential vulnerabilities. How to Make the Flip Consider the case of you having 1,000 in Solana today. The following is how you can market it to Ozak AI: Sell Your Solana: Sell 1,000 SOL of SOL and trade it in either Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins. Participate in the Ozak AI Presale: Go to the Ozak AI presale and link your wallet to buy the token sale. At a token price of $0.012 each, your 1,000 dollars may purchase approximately 83,333 tokens. Hold Long Term: Since the price of $OZ will likely continue to increase during the presale stage and perhaps reach the mark of $1.00, your initial holding might result in substantial gains, in case Ozak AI is a successful company in the AI and blockchain industries. Final Thoughts While Solana continues to be a solid asset, newer projects like Ozak AI present greater potential for higher returns. Ozak AI has the potential to ride the wave of AI and decentralized finance due to the combination of AI and blockchain technology, strong presale dynamism, and a clear roadmap. When you change $1000 of Solana into Ozak AI, you are not only investing in a token but also in the future of AI-based blockchain solutions. Ozak AI is one of the most promising presale projects in 2025, with the right timing and strategic investment, as you might be able to see a higher return than Solana during the next bull run.

In a podcast exchange with Cathie Wood, Lee framed the coming competition through a 1971-style lens, arguing that the end of the gold standard catalyzed a wave of financial engineering that ultimately made dollar-based equities far larger than gold; in his telling, the broad tokenization of money and assets will rhyme with that history, positioning Ethereum’s smart-contract rails to capture the lion’s share of activity. Will Ethereum Flip Bitcoin? Wood set the premise with ARK’s top-down view of crypto’s addressable market by decade’s end. “You know, the ecosystem we expect to hit $25 trillion in 2030, the vast majority of that in Bitcoin,” she said, citing Bitcoin’s role as “a global monetary system, you know, rules based that we’ve been missing since the US went off the gold exchange standard in 1971.” She asked Lee directly: “I’d love to hear your thoughts on why ETH or the ecosystem will surpass Bitcoin.” Related Reading: Ethereum Correction Over? Binance Funding Rates Signal ETH Surging To $6,800 Lee’s answer was to rewind to that same inflection point. “1971 was when Nixon formally withdrew the US from the gold standard. The immediate beneficiary was there was demand and a market to own gold,” he said. But in his telling, the more consequential development was how finance rebuilt itself around an unpegged dollar. “In 1971, the dollar became fully synthetic because it was no longer backed by anything. And so there was a risk that the world would go off the dollar standard. So Wall Street stepped in create products to propagate the future of Wall Street, including…money market funds…credit…mortgage backed securities…futures, et cetera.” He continued, “Dollar dominance by the end of that period…went from 27 percent of GDP terms…to 57 percent of central bank reserves and 80 percent of financial transaction quotes.” For Lee, the market-structure consequence was stark: “The market cap of equities today is 40 trillion compared to two trillion for gold. So in other words, gold is 5 percent of all available assets.” He then drew the crypto corollary. “In 2025, we think everything is now becoming synthetic as we tokenize…as we move not just dollars onto the blockchain, just stablecoins, but we’ll move stocks and real estate.

53281205,608085,1760715024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53281205.jpeg,$1 Billion XRP Buying Pressure Ahead? Ripple Labs Plans New DAT Initiative,https://bitcoinist.com/1-billion-xrp-buying-pressure-ripple-labs-dat/,"Ripple Labs is spearheading an effort to raise at least $1 billion to accumulate XRP via a new digital-asset treasury, or DAT, according to Bloomberg, signaling that the latest bout of market turmoil has not dislodged heavyweight players from advancing aggressive balance-sheet strategies tied to crypto assets. $1 Billion XRP Buying Pressure Ahead? People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg the vehicle would be capitalized through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), with Ripple also planning to contribute some of its own XRP. “Representatives for Ripple did not respond to requests for comment. Exact terms of the transaction remain under discussion and could change,” Bloomberg reported, underscoring that while the plan is live, its contours are not yet finalized. The timing places Ripple’s move squarely against a fragile market backdrop. A week after a heavy selloff triggered record liquidations, sentiment remains brittle. Against that context, the contemplated DAT is notable on several fronts. First, the scale: “Ripple Labs Inc. is leading an effort to raise at least $1 billion to accumulate XRP,” Bloomberg reported, adding that if completed, “it would be the biggest one to focus on XRP.” Second, the structure: a SPAC-funded DAT reflects the 2025 wave of publicly listed token accumulators that have proliferated through reverse takeovers or SPAC listings. Bloomberg observed that “throughout 2025, digital-asset boosters set up an array of publicly listed token accumulators,” noting that “today, there are more than 300 entities holding Bitcoin alone, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.” The Market Backdrop While Bitcoin-focused treasuries dominate that landscape, Bloomberg emphasized that “XRP hasn’t drawn the same level of interest from DAT investors as Bitcoin.” This initiative would attempt to change that balance. By design, a DAT channels committed capital into a defined acquisition mandate—here, XRP—creating programmatic buy-side flow that can be measured against circulating supply dynamics and secondary-market liquidity. The framing of $1 billion in potential purchasing capacity invites obvious questions about incremental demand. Yet the wire also cautions that investor appetite for token accumulators has cooled: “Investors have also gotten more skeptical about DATs, with shares of major crypto accumulators including Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and Japan’s Metaplanet Inc. posting steep declines in recent months.” That skepticism is precisely the environment in which Ripple is attempting to stand up a new vehicle. While XRP-specific accumulation vehicles have been relatively scarce compared to Bitcoin, there are a few already established: In May, sustainable-energy firm VivoPower International announced a $121 million fundraising.Notably, the report comes the same day that Ripple agreed to buy treasury management software provider GTreasury for $1 billion , according to a Thursday announcement.

Ngozi said she’s been personally reaching out to both governments to stop the trade fight before it spins out of control, describing the latest flare-up as “extremely concerning.” She explained that the WTO has been monitoring the situation closely after another surge in tariff tensions between President Donald Trump’s administration and Beijing. “We’re obviously worried at any escalation of U.S.-China tensions,” she said, adding that both sides backed off earlier this year from a tariff battle that could have crippled global supply chains. Ngozi said she hopes that happens again. “We are really hoping the two sides will come together and de-escalate,” she said. “Because any U.S.-China tensions and U.S.-China decoupling have implications not just for the two biggest economies in the world, but for the rest of the world.” The WTO chief said both Washington and Beijing understand how damaging this could be, given how much the world relies on their trade. She said any decoupling that splits the planet into two separate trade blocs would mean “significant global GDP losses in the longer term, up to 7% global GDP losses and double-digit welfare losses for developing countries.” Ngozi said the numbers reflect the harsh reality of what happens when supply chains and investment networks fracture. WTO lowers trade forecast as tariff war reignites Ngozi’s comments came right after the WTO downgraded its global trade outlook. The organization cut its 2026 global merchandise trade growth forecast from 1.8% to just 0.5%, blaming delayed impacts from the Trump tariffs that were reintroduced earlier this year. However, the group raised its 2025 forecast to 2.4%, showing that some recovery might come before another dip sets in. That optimism didn’t last long. Last week, China imposed new export restrictions on rare earth metals, vital for the technology industry, from chips to electric vehicles. In response, Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting next month, effectively escalating what had been a fragile truce. Ngozi said these decisions could “intensify pressures on the system,” stressing that the world hasn’t even begun to feel the full effects of these tariffs yet. She told G20 officials on Wednesday night that global financial stability can’t exist without global trade stability. “Pressures on the system have not eased and may intensify,” she said. “The full effects of recent tariffs are still to be felt. Trade diversion is fueling protectionist sentiment elsewhere. And escalating tensions between the United States and China remain a serious risk.” WTO urges reform and global cooperation amid crisis Despite all this turmoil, Ngozi said the global trade system hasn’t broken apart yet. She pointed out that 72% of world trade is still governed by WTO rules, even though Washington has been signing bilateral trade deals with other countries. She said most WTO members have avoided taking sides in the tariff war, which she called a small sign of restraint amid the most serious policy shock the trade system has faced in eight decades. Ngozi also said the crisis should serve as a wake-up call for reform. The WTO plans to make its system more flexible and efficient, better equipped for the realities of crypto-linked services, digital trade, and green industries shaping modern economies. “There’s absolutely no doubt that there are global problems that cannot be solved by any one country alone,” she said. “You will need global cooperation to do it, and that’s where multilateralism will still be very, very relevant.” She added that for people to value global institutions again, the WTO must reform itself. “At the WTO, we are ready to work on this,” she said. Ngozi also confirmed she held a meeting with U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Joseph Barloon, who was just confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to the WTO. The WTO chief said she’s encouraged that the U.S. removed the WTO from its list of international budget cuts, and talks are underway to settle Washington’s unpaid dues to the trade body.

The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 2% during the ongoing session, with sellers in control. According to JPMorgan analysts, the downtrend is likely due to crypto-native investors rather than institutional investors. The analysts believe traders may be deleveraging overleveraged momentum. Regional banking stress spilling over into crypto has also impacted investor sentiment. Gold Market Cap Surges Gold’s market capitalization reached a staggering $30 trillion on Thursday as its value surged to a new all-time high of $4,357 per ounce. Gold’s market cap is now 14.5 times larger than Bitcoin’s (BTC) market cap, and 1.5 times larger than the combined market capitalization of the “Magnificent 7” tech companies (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla). Unlike a company’s market cap, gold’s market capitalization is calculated by the value of all the gold that has ever been mined. However, it is impossible to know the exact figure. The price of gold has soared this year, rising 64% since January 1 as traders flock to the asset amid geopolitical tensions, tariff uncertainty, and dollar debasement. Analysts believe capital will eventually find its way to BTC once gold’s rally cools. Crypto analyst Sykodelic stated, “Gold added over $300 billion to its market cap today. It’s been adding an entire Bitcoin market cap in one week. I don’t understand how most cannot see that as soon as gold stalls, BTC is going to rip.” Crypto Selloff Driven By Native Investors JPMorgan analysts believe last week’s selloff was driven by crypto native investors rather than institutional players or ETF holders. JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team believe there is very little evidence to support the involvement of institutional players and ETFs in the market crash. The analysts noted minimal outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum. CME Bitcoin Futures also saw minimal liquidations, indicating the downturn was due to deleveraging by momentum and quant traders. Overleveraged traders were caught off guard by a tweet by President Trump. The downturn triggered a cascade of liquidations, leading to one of the largest market crashes on record. Newsmax Plans Bitcoin Treasury News outlet operator Newsmax has announced plans to purchase up to $5 million in Bitcoin and TRUMP over the next year as part of its strategic crypto reserve plan. The company stated that its board of directors approved the plan on Thursday. According to Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy, the TRUMP coin’s success has been impressive. If acquired, it will make Newsmax the first NYSE-listed firm to purchase the token. Referring to Bitcoin, Ruddy called it the gold standard, stating, “We believe it would be an important company marker to add this asset to our company reserves.” The company also plans to make its first Bitcoin purchase soon. However, it has not shared any details about how it plans to fund additional acquisitions. “Additional cryptocurrency acquisitions will be evaluated based on market conditions, operational requirements, and strategic objectives.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to levels not seen since August, falling to a low of $103,516 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum since Friday’s flash crash and extended its downtrend this week, despite a brief recovery over the weekend. The price is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,041. Cryptocurrency markets faced further stress as regional bank stress spilled over into crypto, echoing a similar pattern that unfolded in 2023. The cryptocurrency market has reacted adversely to concerns over US regional banking stocks, which began falling in March 2023. At the time, BTC and other altcoins registered a sharp flash crash before markets rebounded. Trading resource, the Kobeissi Letter, explained in a post on X, “Confused about what's happening with regional bank stocks? Here's the real issue: In March 2023, regional bank stocks collapsed, the crisis was ‘contained,’ but nothing really changed. Banks that took outsized risk were either ‘backstopped’ by the US government or acquired by JPMorgan. As a result, this further incentivized taking on outsized risk, particularly as deposits over the $250,000 FDIC limit are now inherently ‘insured.’” The post went on to explain why markets were crashing, stating, “Today, shares of Zions Bancorp crashed -13% after it disclosed a $50 million charge-off for a loan underwritten by its subsidiary. And, Western Alliance Bank stock fell -12% after it said it’s dealing with a borrower that failed to provide collateral loans in the first position.” BTC traded in bullish territory last week, and began the previous week with a 1.41% increase to $122,318. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday before reaching an intraday high of $125,750 on Sunday. BTC ultimately ended the weekend at $123,520, up 0.87%. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.97% and settled at $124,720, but not before reaching an intraday high of $126.296. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 3% to $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $123,343. Selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC fell 1.32% to a low of $119,713 before settling at $121,714. Source: TradingView BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was made in retaliation for China's imposition of restrictions on rare earth mineral exports. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Monday, ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $115,274. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $109,945. It recovered from this level to reclaim $113,000 and settle at $113,068, ultimately dropping 1.91%. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 2% to $110,804. Bearish sentiment persisted on Thursday as BTC fell below $110,000 and settled at $108,198. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down over 2% at $105,941. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Today’s tape feels different. Both the Altcoin Season Index and the Fear and Greed Index hover at 25, a reading that tilts toward Bitcoin season, yet Bitcoin itself trades only slightly above $105,000 after sliding 13% in a week. That combination leaves altcoin holdings exposed while liquidity rotates quickly between books. Depth did not disappear but migrated. Sellers met bids at lower marks, and volumes jumped where participation concentrates during stress. Data shows BNB near $1,067, down 10% in 24 hours, with a volume of $7.1 billion, up 33%. Sui sits near $2.38, down 11% with $2.35 billion in volume, up 80%. Solana trades near $179, down by 7% with $12 billion in volume, up by 30%. Altcoin Season Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) BNB: Heavy Turnover Into Layered Bids BNB price slipped while volume expanded, a pattern that often represents larger orders executed into resting demand. Reports point to funding turning negative on several venues and basis compressing, two markers of forced positioning rather than steady accumulation. Short-term traders will watch spreads during the next session. Tighter spreads with calmer funding often precede stabilization. Persistent negative funding with fading spot leadership can extend pressure. Binance launches the Together Initiative, a $400M recovery and confidence-rebuilding plan to support users and institutions during this volatile period. Read more https://t.co/35cSkYkTGg — Binance (@binance) October 14, 2025 Sui: Fastest Volume Growth and Sharpest Reset Sui’s largest volume jump of 80% is an outlier in this group. Data indicates rapid repositioning from short-horizon accounts after crowded longs earlier in the week. Intraday ranges widened, then narrowed during the final hours, which suggests early attempts at absorption. A practical approach favors patience near yesterday’s low. The market is looking for smaller wicks, balanced funding, and a session that holds above its own volume-weighted average price before sizing into weakness. Solana: Rotation, Not Strength Solana’s price drop alongside higher trading volume points to risk rotation rather than renewed interest . Data shows that much of the recent activity came from traders unwinding leveraged positions and shifting exposure into more liquid assets. This is a flow-driven session with most movement confined to intraday trading ranges. Large transfers between spot and derivatives venues suggest rebalancing across accounts rather than new accumulation. Until volume normalizes and volatility narrows, Solana’s price action reflects redistribution of positions, not directional conviction. How to Approach This Phase Without Forcing Trades Start with liquidity, not predictions. Identify where depth clusters on books and stage entries near those bands rather than reaching for mid-range quotes. Ladder orders to reduce slippage when conditions are thin. Fear and Greed Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Let volatility cool before leaning in. A session that holds above its own volume-weighted benchmark with declining realized volatility offers cleaner entries than a chase into expanding ranges. Many desks wait for that setup during heavy weeks. Use position sizing that respects uncertain breadth. The index of 25 implies narrow participation. That favors scaling rather than all-or-nothing bets. Concentrate on pairs showing stable spreads and consistent depth. Avoid thin offshoots until funding normalizes. Track rotation indicates instead of headlines. If Bitcoin steadies and the index remains in the high 20s, selective bids often appear in liquid DeFi or exchange-linked names first. If Bitcoin loses nearby support, defense takes priority, and rallies often fade at prior intraday highs. Bottom Line for a Dark Day This sell-off carries high participation, not apathy. BNB shows heavy turnover into layered bids. Sui registers the fastest reset with signs of early absorption. Solana prints large tickets without a major collapse in price. None of that cancels the risk message from the index, yet it outlines a playbook: wait for stabilization markers, respect depth, and let funding tell the story before committing fresh risk.

If successful, the drive could start a new wave of crypto company acquisitions. The family office of Arthur Hayes is adding a new private equity capacity, seeking $250M in funding to allocate to crypto acquisition deals. Maelstrom, managed by the family office of Hayes, is seeking to widen its portfolio with deals of $40M to $75M. The new fund will target medium-sized crypto firms, especially those offering data services or fee-generating platforms. Hayes aims to focus on utility and service firms, including those with developed trading infrastructure or analytics. The funding is expected to have its first results around March 31, 2026, with the funds fully secured by September. Arthur Hayes seeks tokenless projects Crypto VC funding has shifted its priorities and mostly relies on insider funding. External private equity investors have avoided crypto projects since the collapse of the FTX exchange. This year, external private equity have only allocated $1.4B to crypto, down from around $4B in 2021. The fund’s co-founder, Akshat Vaidya, expects to still raise funds from investors that want exposure to crypto companies. Some of the targeted crypto startups offer high cash flow through fees and significant growth, though Vaidya said funds are often incapable of reaching out to invest in those startups. The Maelstrom fund will run under the supervision of Vaidya, along with Hayes and newly hired partner Adam Schlegel. Maelstrom to seek off-chain startups Maelstrom Equity Fund will be registered as a US entity and will target multiple types of investors. Those may include crypto native investors, pension funds, and family offices. Maelstrom will build a long-term portfolio, based on infrastructure companies and assets that will be relevant in the usage of decentralized technologies. The fund will back early-stage equity and token investments, as well as public and private market positions, aiming to fund the industry’s next unicorn. The fund will wrap each acquisition as a special-purpose vehicle, where Maelstrom will be a key investor. The new vehicles will not directly invest in tokens, instead focusing on equity. For that reason, tokenless projects will be highly attractive, as they do not suffer from inflated valuations or market hype. ‘ These kinds of businesses are a lot easier to acquire, ’ said Vaidya. ‘ You can’t artificially inflate valuations with an unused token in the off-chain world. So that’s where we get attractive entry multiples. ’ The key feature of the selected companies will be consistent cash flows. Maelstrom will actively manage the company, enhance its management, and accelerate growth, with a sales strategy focused on a 4-5 year time horizon. Maelstrom’s approach will be unleashed just in time for a series of expected IPOs for crypto companies. The fund also seeks to grab successful analytics and trading platforms, as technological solutions have become more lucrative and sophisticated, while avoiding overly-aggressive token sales. Recent buyouts include Binance’s acquisition of Gopax, as well as Ripple’s $1B deal for GTreasury. Get seen where it counts.

At the time, BTC had retraced slightly since its ATH marked just days earlier, but was still holding strong above $120,000. However, US President Trump threatened China with a new wave of tariffs after saying its authorities had been lying, which sent shockwaves through the market. BTC dumped immediately to under $117,000, which opened the gates of leveraged hell to take place. The cascading effects of overleveraged positions getting forcefully closed resulted in a $19 billion wipeout and a massive BTC plunge to $101,000 (on Binance and a few more exchanges). The altcoins were smashed even harder, with losses of up to 99% in some extreme cases. The dust settled during the weekend, especially after reports that the tension between the two superpowers had de-escalated. Bitcoin even went on the offensive and jumped to $116,000 mid-week, where it faced an immediate rejection. Although the $110,000 support held at first, the bears continued to pressure the asset. It gave in yesterday when Trump met with Russia’s Putin, with a price drop to $108,500. The landscape worsened over the past day, once again on another bloody Friday. BTC initiated another leg down that drove it south to just under $104,000. There was a brief bounce off to over $106,000 after Trump said the tariffs on China won’t stand, but that momentum has faded, and BTC is back at around $105,000 as of press time. This puts its weekly losses at over 13%. While this might sound painful, because it is, the situation with many altcoins is a lot worse, with massive losses from the likes of DOGE (-27%), ADA (-25%), LINK (-27%), XLM (-22%), HYPE (-21.5%), and many others. Market Data Weekly Market Overview: Source: QuantifyCrypto Market Cap: $3.650T | 24H Vol: $273B | BTC Dominance: 57.3% BTC: $105,000 (-13.6%) | ETH: $3,770 (-13.4%) | XRP: $2.27 (-19.5%) This Week’s Crypto Headlines You Can’t Miss Extreme Fear Creeps Back Into the Crypto Market as Bitcoin Tanks by $20K in Days . The overall market sentiment has changed a lot in the span of just over a week, which is seen by the Fear and Greed Index. The metric was above 60 last week, which showed a state of greed, but it tumbled to multi-month lows of under 25 after the most recent correction. Ripple Labs Reportedly Leading $1B Fundraise for XRP Treasury . In times where different companies are ramping up efforts to accumulate BTC, ETH, and a few other altcoins, Ripple Labs has reportedly began an initiative that will allow it to raise $1 billion through a SPAC to create a digital asset treasury focused on accumulating its own token, XRP. Nearly All ETH Held by Companies Was Purchased in Past Quarter Alone . Speaking of altcoins that have became the center of DAT accumulation, data emerged this week indicating that almost all of the ETH purchased by such companies has been accumulated in Q3 2025. Was Last Week’s Deleveraging Event a Necessary Reset for The Bitcoin Market? Glassnode Weighs In . Last Friday’s meltdown had a profound impact on the entire crypto industry, with multiple expers and observers rushing to offer their opinion on why it happened and what’s next. Glassnode, for instance, said it was a necessary reset due to the extremely high leveraged used by some traders. October 10 Crash Exaggerated? Real Crypto Losses Just $2.31B (Analyst) . According to another report, the massive figures of $19 billion in liquidations during last week’s crash were highly exaggerated. It claimed that the actual value was just over $2.3 billion. Peter Schiff Dismisses BTC’s ‘Digital Gold’ Status Following Recent Crash . As we know, Peter Schiff uses every possible opportunity to criticize BTC, and the crash from over $122,000 to under $105,000 allowed him to do so once again. In his latest bashing fest, the economist said this price correction invalidated BTC’s status as digital gold.

At least five new crypto ETFs landed on the SEC’s desk this week alone, showing the growing rush among asset managers to secure approval before the year ends. But with the agency operating under skeletal staffing due to the shutdown, now in its fourth week, nearly all reviews have come to a standstill. Is the U.S. Entering a New Era of Crypto ETFs or Testing the SEC’s Patience? The latest entrant came from VanEck, which on Thursday filed an S-1 form for the VanEck Lido Staked Ethereum ETF. The fund is designed to track the performance of stETH, the liquid staking token issued by Lido, the largest Ethereum staking platform. VanEck’s filing notes that the trust “expects to accrue certain staking rewards through its ownership of stETH,” reflecting the yield-generating nature of Lido’s liquid staking model. Lido currently holds about 8.5 million ETH, worth roughly $31 billion, offering a 3.3% staking yield to depositors. VanEck registered a statutory trust in Delaware earlier this month, indicating early steps toward product launch. Source: DefiLlama While VanEck expands its staking-based ETF lineup, other issuers are experimenting with more complex structures. On Thursday, 21Shares filed for a leveraged crypto ETF offering 2x exposure to the Hyperliquid token (HYPE), marking one of the more unconventional filings of the month. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described it as “so niche… but then you could look up in 3-4 years it’s got a few billion,” calling the current ETF climate “a total land rush.” 21Shares filing for a 2x HYPE ETF. This is the kind of filing where you're like man, that is SO niche, idk.. but then you could look up in 3-4yrs it's got a few billion. Just a total land rush right now, just like with themes, curr hedging and smart beta in eras past. pic.twitter.com/7UiLP5AlnK — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 17, 2025 Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest also added to the pile with three new Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the week. The ARK Bitcoin Yield ETF will pursue income through yield-based strategies like selling options, while the ARK DIET Bitcoin 1 and DIET Bitcoin 2 ETFs are structured to provide partial downside protection with varying thresholds tied to Bitcoin’s quarterly price movements. Meanwhile, Volatility Shares submitted filings for a suite of 3x and 5x leveraged ETFs tied to both crypto and major U.S. stocks. Analysts said the filings included the first-ever 5x ETF proposal in the United States, an aggressive approach that has already raised concerns about regulatory compliance with the SEC’s Derivatives Rule (Rule 18f-4), which limits leverage to 2x. Brian Daly, director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, told Reuters that “it is unclear whether these ETFs would comply” with existing leverage rules. Government Shutdown Stalls SEC—What Happens to Crypto ETFs Now? The SEC’s review process has effectively halted as the federal government enters its 17th day of shutdown , leaving most of its staff furloughed. Only a skeleton crew remains to handle essential operations, freezing dozens of pending filings, including a surge of crypto ETF applications. Around 16 crypto ETFs were awaiting final decisions this month, with at least 21 new applications filed in just the first eight days of October. Without congressional action to reopen the government, the backlog is expected to grow further, pushing deadlines well into November. Source: Congressional Research Service The shutdown began on October 1 after Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Republicans are demanding cuts to address the $37.8 trillion national debt, while Democrats want to preserve healthcare programs and tax credits. Until a resolution is reached, the SEC cannot issue approvals or publish final orders. Additionally, just before the shutdown, the SEC had moved to streamline crypto ETF approvals. In September, it voted to let the NYSE, Nasdaq, and Cboe Global Markets adopt generic listing standards for digital asset and spot commodity ETFs . The @SECGov has instructed issuers to withdraw $LTC , $XRP , $SOL , $ADA , $DOGE ETF filings after new generic listing standards reshaped the path for crypto ETFs. #CryptoETFs #SEC #ETFs https://t.co/2QNm6PmQqe — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 29, 2025 The rule change, first outlined in July, intended to cut approval timelines from 240 days to 75 days , reducing the need for dual filings from asset managers and exchanges. The reform could soon open the door for ETFs tracking Solana and XRP, but for now, filings such as 19b-4 forms and S-1 registrations remain frozen. ETF Inflows Surge Despite Regulatory Pause Despite the ongoing administrative slowdown, global appetite for crypto ETFs remains strong. New data from ETFGI shows total ETF assets climbed to a record $12.7 trillion at the end of September, up 22.7% from $10.35 trillion at the close of 2024. In September alone, U.S. ETFs attracted $152.5 billion in net inflows, the second-highest monthly total on record. That pushed year-to-date inflows to $951.27 billion, already surpassing last year’s full-year record of $740.78 billion. Source: ETFGI The data added that ETF assets have now recorded 41 consecutive months of net inflows, indicating consistent investor confidence despite higher interest rates and market volatility. Balchunas noted that ETFs could reach $1 trillion in assets by the end of the week, given a recent pace of $30 billion in weekly inflows. ETFs are going to hit $1T by the end of the week prob given their $30b a week pace lately, and virtual lock to break last year's $1.1T haul. Also check out the $180b in 1M.. if it were calendar month would be all-time record. Just a torrent of cash. pic.twitter.com/kBRQTLTRsv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 13, 2025 Among standout performers, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has generated roughly $245 million in fees in just 22 months , making it the firm’s most profitable ETF to date. With $97.8 billion in assets, IBIT is on track to become the first ETF to cross the $100 billion mark faster than any in history.

53282201,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86671,1760716816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,No Whales Allowed: How Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Redefines Fair Voting!,https://timestabloid.com/no-whales-allowed-how-zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-redefines/,"Decentralization is supposed to mean equality, yet most networks fall short of that promise. When a few large holders can buy influence, blockchain governance becomes just another form of centralization. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is taking a different path, one where every participant has a real voice. Through its DAO structure and Quadratic Voting system, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) ensures that power is shared fairly, preventing whales from controlling the network’s direction. It’s not just about owning tokens; it’s about building a balanced, participatory system. The upcoming whitelist slots offer early access to those who believe in shaping a blockchain where fairness, transparency, and genuine decentralization truly exist. The Problem with Traditional Governance Many decentralized systems are decentralized in name only. Voting power is often tied directly to token ownership, meaning those with the deepest pockets call the shots. This has led to governance outcomes where a few whales dictate upgrades, treasury allocations, and even the long-term vision of a project. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) was built to correct this imbalance. It recognizes that decentralization isn’t just a technical feature, but a social contract. Real decentralisation should reflect community consensus, not capital concentration. The team behind Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) analyzed how token-weighted systems consistently lead to plutocracy and designed a framework that mathematically minimizes that risk. This ensures the project’s evolution is guided by collective input. The result is a governance structure that resists manipulation and encourages a diverse range of perspectives in shaping the protocol’s future. The Power of Quadratic Voting Quadratic Voting lies at the heart of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)’s fair governance model. Unlike traditional one-token-one-vote systems, this mechanism introduces diminishing returns for large holders. The more votes an individual buys, the more expensive each additional vote becomes. In practice, this creates a balance where collective participation outweighs wealth concentration. Equal opportunity: Small holders can influence outcomes meaningfully. Fairer decision-making: Prevents any single entity from dominating governance proposals. Community-driven outcomes: Reflects broader consensus rather than financial power. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) uses this approach to maintain fairness at every level of its DAO. It transforms governance from a bidding contest into a representation of genuine interest. By doing so, ZKP promotes trust and accountability, essential ingredients for a network designed to last beyond speculative cycles. DAO as the Engine of True Decentralization A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is only as strong as its design. In Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), the DAO isn’t just a symbolic governance feature. It’s actually the operational backbone of the entire ecosystem. Every major decision, from protocol upgrades to ecosystem funding, is determined by community vote through the DAO framework. Key aspects include: Transparent proposals: All governance changes are publicly accessible and verifiable. Quadratic Voting integration: Balances participation across small and large stakeholders. Community treasury: Allocates funds for ecosystem growth and research through transparent voting. This ensures that Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) evolves according to community priorities rather than external agendas. It’s a governance model where collaboration replaces hierarchy and every participant, regardless of token count, plays a role in shaping the network’s path forward. This structure strengthens both fairness and resilience across the project’s ecosystem. Empowering Real Ownership Owning tokens in Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) means more than holding an asset. It means holding influence. By combining Quadratic Voting with DAO-based decision-making, the project gives participants genuine ownership over its direction. The following are the key benefits: Equal voice for small holders: Participation is encouraged, not restricted by capital. Long-term alignment: Governance favors sustainable development over short-term profit. Cultural inclusivity: Developers, users, and builders all have a voice. As the ZKP crypto expands into DeFi, identity, and enterprise integrations, its governance model ensures that growth stays community-first. This network is a system built for participation. The whitelist, which opens soon for signups, offers a chance to become part of a founding era where influence is distributed by engagement, not wealth.

Here’s What Is Forming,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-xrp-is-a-ticking-time-bomb-heres-what-is-forming/,"The crypto market is on edge, and XRP appears to be sitting at the heart of the tension. Volatility has been steadily increasing, liquidity pockets are tightening, and traders are starting to notice a powerful setup forming beneath the surface. While some investors remain uncertain, leading technical analyst ChartNerd believes XRP’s structure is far from ordinary—describing it as a “ticking time bomb” that’s poised for an explosive move. The Growing Tension Around XRP Over the past week, XRP’s market behavior has mirrored a classic “coiling spring” — long periods of sideways movement followed by bursts of volume and price expansion. This type of compression signals that momentum is building, even when the price action seems stagnant. As Bitcoin and Ethereum experience volatile swings, XRP has quietly formed one of the most technically loaded structures on the charts. $XRP is a ticking time bomb https://t.co/XlOv0sGxbk — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 16, 2025 XRP has maintained strong support near its mid-range levels while repeatedly testing upper resistance zones. This repeated test of resistance often precedes a major breakout, especially when supported by volume increases, suggesting smart money may be positioning ahead of a larger move. What ChartNerd’s Analysis Reveals In a detailed chart series shared on X, ChartNerd showcased XRP’s multi-timeframe setup, comparing previous cycle structures to the current one. Each chart points toward a recurring pattern: prolonged consolidation phases followed by vertical price expansions. The analyst highlights several technical formations — including symmetrical wedges and breakout continuations — which historically preceded XRP’s major rallies. These patterns are now aligning again, implying that XRP could be approaching a similar inflection point. ChartNerd’s caption, “It’s all about the bigger picture,” underscores the long-term nature of this setup. According to the analysis, XRP’s current structure mirrors earlier consolidation patterns that ultimately led to explosive surges . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Implications: Explosive Move Incoming The term “ticking time bomb” doesn’t necessarily imply a guaranteed upward explosion — it reflects a state of compressed volatility that can erupt in either direction. If XRP breaks above its long-standing resistance levels with sustained volume, the next leg higher could be swift and significant, potentially revisiting major Fibonacci extension targets. However, the same energy can reverse downward if XRP fails to hold its key moving averages or slips below critical support zones. Traders should remain cautious, as such setups often trigger liquidity hunts before the true trend emerges. Strategic Takeaway for Traders For short-term traders, the focus should be on breakout confirmation and volume validation. A clean daily close above resistance would likely confirm bullish continuation, while failure to maintain key levels could invite sharp retracements. For long-term holders, this phase represents a potential accumulation opportunity — but only with clear risk management. With the broader crypto market showing signs of recovery, XRP’s upcoming move could either mark the start of a new bull leg or a retest of long-term supports. The Bigger Picture ChartNerd’s analysis reiterates that XRP’s technical outlook is about timing and patience. The compression visible on multiple timeframes means a decisive move is imminent — not a matter of if, but when. In the coming weeks, XRP traders may witness one of the most critical breakout attempts since 2021. Whether it detonates upward or downward, the setup confirms one thing: XRP is indeed a ticking time bomb — and the countdown has already begun.
