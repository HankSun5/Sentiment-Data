54365374,627020,1763074803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,List Of 16 Blockchains That Can Freeze Your Crypto On-Chain; Bybit Report,https://bitcoinist.com/blockchains-freeze-your-crypto/,"A new study by Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab has revealed that 16 major blockchain networks can freeze users’ crypto on-chain. This capability allows blockchain foundations or validators to step in and restrict transactions , thereby challenging the core principle of decentralization. While these freezing mechanisms are often employed to prevent hacks , and other security risks, they also raise concerns about control, transparency, and the potential reintroduction of centralized authority in decentralized networks . Bybit has disclosed that its research report is the first large-scale investigation to identify which blockchains possess freezing capabilities and how they operate. Bybit Exposes Blockchains With Crypto-Freezing Powers In a Press Release , Bybit released a new research, unveiling blockchains with fund freezing mechanisms and examining the impact these capabilities have in the DeFi space. The study analyzed a total of 166 different blockchain networks and found that 16 currently possess crypto freezing powers, while 19 could support similar functions in the future. To carry out this research, Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team utilized an AI agent to filter blockchains through in-depth manual code reviews, as most networks do not openly document these features. The research team categorized the freezing capabilities of the 16 blockchain networks into three main mechanisms: Hardcoded Freezing: It is embedded directly in blockchain’s core code, seen in networks like Chiliz (CHZ), Viction (VIC), XDC Network (XDC), Binance Coin (BNB), and VeChain (VET). Configuration-based Freezing: Controlled through validator or foundation settings, found in Harmony (ONE), Havah (HVH), SUPRA, APTOS (APT), EOS, Oasis (ROSE), WAX (WAXP), SUI, LINEA, and WAVES. On-chain Freezing: Executed via system-level contracts, present in blockchains like Huobi ECO Chain (HECO). Bybit has reported that fund freezing occurs when a blockchain locks a user’s assets without their consent . They highlight that these capabilities give these networks a level of control similar to that of traditional banks. The team has also emphasized that the research aims to provide greater transparency on blockchains while laying the groundwork for future studies and risk assessments in the digital asset industry. Real Cases Of Blockchain Fund Freezing Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team has also highlighted real-world incidents where crypto freezing was used to protect users and mitigate losses. Notably, in 2025, the SUI Foundation froze $162 million in assets following the Cetus Protocol hack in May, which resulted in a loss of over $220 million . Following this, Aptos added blacklisting functions to its network. In 2022, the BNB Chain used hardcoded blacklists to contain a $570 million bridge exploit, preventing the attacker from accessing the funds. Notably, in 2019, VeChain set an early precedent by freezing funds after a $6.1 million breach . Meanwhile, Cosmos’s modular account design may allow similar interventions in the future. These cases demonstrate how fund-freezing functions can act as emergency tools during large-scale security incidents . Bybit points out that although centralization remains a concern, many networks are implementing practical safety measures, even if they challenge the principle of complete decentralization, which is the core tenet of blockchain technology.",Crypto News|APTOS (APT|Binance Coin|BNB|BNB Chain|Bybit|Cetus Protocol|chiliZ|CHZ|Cosmos|crypto|crypto adoption|Crypto Market|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency market|DeFi|EOS|Havah|HECO|Huobi ECO Chain|HVH|Lazarus Security Lab|Linea|OASIS|ONE|Rose|SUI|SUI Foundation|SUPRA|VeChain|VET|VIC|Viction|WAVES|WAX|WAXP|XDC|XDC Network,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|SUI|XDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-13 23:00:03

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Upexi has authorized a $50 million share repurchase program, showing a broader shift toward capital preservation even as firms continue to hold massive Solana reserves on their balance sheets. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 Upexi Greenlights Share Buyback Amid 47% Stock Drop Upexi, a Solana-focused digital asset treasury company and consumer brands operator, said its board approved the buyback to provide “flexibility to purchase shares in the open market” depending on market conditions. The company emphasized that the program reflects confidence in its long-term strategy while maintaining a strong treasury position. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 The CEO, Allan Marshall, also added that the repurchase is a tool to enhance shareholder value and will be executed only when returns are attractive. The company’s treasury holds roughly 2 million SOL, valued at $283 million, representing about 0.35% of Solana’s total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Despite a recent decline in Solana’s price, from about $143 to $134, Upexi’s on-chain reserves remain among the largest institutional holdings in the ecosystem. The firm’s crypto-backed position has, however, been mirrored by sharp volatility in its own stock, which has fallen nearly 47% over the past month from a high of $6.50 to around $3.43. Source: Sol Treasury Upexi’s move comes amid a turbulent period for Solana-linked treasuries. According to institutional reserve data, the top 20 Solana treasury and ETF holders control 24 million SOL worth about $3.4 billion, or 3.5% of the total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Around half of these holdings are staked for yield at an average return of 7.7%, while the remainder remains liquid for balance sheet management. Forward Industries (FORD) leads with 6.8 million SOL valued near $966 million, followed by Solana Company (HSDT), DeFi Development Corp (DFDV), Sharps Technology (STSS), and Upexi rounding out the top five. These firms account for roughly 76% of all institutional Solana holdings, showing how companies use digital assets strategically. Solana Treasury Firms Trade Below Asset Value as Institutions Maintain Positions Market data shows that despite Solana’s price drop of nearly 7% in 24 hours, institutional positions have largely remained intact, with no major liquidations reported. Analysts view this stability as a sign of long-term confidence in Solana’s network fundamentals and its growing role as a blockchain for corporate treasuries. Public market valuations differ. Most Solana treasuries are currently trading at a discount to their net asset value (mNAV), indicating investor caution Upexi’s mNAV stands at 0.68, while Forward Industries sits at 0.82, suggesting cautious sentiment in equity markets despite strong on-chain balance sheets. The divergence between treasury value and stock performance has been a defining feature of the DAT sector. Upexi, which reported $66.7 million in net income in its most recent quarter, driven largely by $78 million in unrealized Solana gains, still faces investor skepticism tied to broader crypto market swings. Its stock previously surged more than 600% after revealing its Solana strategy earlier this year, but has since retraced sharply as digital assets weakened. Other treasuries act similarly. On November 6, Forward Industries authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program for flexibility amid volatility. Forward Industries — the Solana treasury company — has filed its Resale Prospectus Supplement with the @SECGov and authorized a $1B share repurchase program. #Solana $FORD https://t.co/kpG7BxEeb8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 4, 2025 Despite the short-term pullback in prices, the overall trend in corporate Solana holdings remains upward. The rise of Solana-focused treasuries marks an evolution from the Bitcoin treasury strategies that dominated earlier cycles. These firms use Solana not only as a store of value but also as a yield-generating asset through staking and validator participation. Companies like DFDV , which stakes its entire 2.2 million SOL holding, illustrate how treasury management in crypto is becoming more active and income-driven.

As the cryptocurrency prepares for its long-awaited Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) debut, the balance of XRP on major exchanges continues to decline. Analysts are warning that an impending supply crisis could spark a significant surge in the XRP price, which is currently more than 34% below its all-time high levels. XRP Supply Shortage To Trigger Parabolic Surge Amidst ongoing market volatility and whale capitulation, crypto market expert Arthur remains positive about XRP, drawing attention to a series of on-chain developments that could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward move. In his post on X social media, the analyst emphasized that an XRP could soon see a supply crisis, which may ignite its next price explosion. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Final Nail In The Coffin For XRP, What This Means According to recent chart data from CryptoQuant, XRP reserves on Binance have fallen to about 2.79 million tokens, marking a sustained decline that began in early 2025. The chart also shows that while XRP’s price has remained relatively stable between $2 and $3, the available supply on almost all major cryptocurrency exchanges has continued to decline drastically. Arthur has revealed that this signals a growing imbalance between supply and demand, which could set the foundation for a bullish move. Arthur has also referenced a prediction made by JPMorgan analysts, who estimated that between $4 to $8 billion could flow into the upcoming XRP Spot ETFs once they launch in the market. This projection indicates confidence in XRP’s future institutional demand and interest as a legitimate digital asset class. The analyst has suggested that increased ETF demand from institutions, combined with limited liquidity, could create a “perfect storm” for a price breakout of XRP. Additionally, the analyst has revealed that the XRP ETF could also see a surge in retail demand, contributing to its projected price appreciation. Currently, reports indicate that approval of XRP Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending. However, prominent analysts like Nate Geraci remain confident that these investment products will be launched soon. Binance XRP Reserve Data Shows Steady Losses Delving deeper into XRP’s supply on exchanges, CryptoQuant’s data shows that the cryptocurrency’s reserve on Binance is sitting at approximately 2.785 billion tokens as of November 12, 2025. Notably, this marks a decrease of over 10 million tokens from the previous day, when 2.795 billion XRP was recorded. Since the beginning of November, Binance’s XRP balance has been declining, hovering just above the 2.7 billion token threshold. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Earlier in October, reserves dipped to 2.74 billion tokens, one of the lowest levels recorded in almost a year. While balances briefly rebounded in mid-October, the latest data shows a renewed downward trajectory, suggesting that selling pressure may have eased and accumulation could be taking place off exchanges.

Whale Alert, the popular blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering movement of 5,969 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This enormous Bitcoin transfer, valued at approximately $596 million, represents one of the most significant movements we’ve seen recently. But what does this massive Bitcoin transfer really mean for the market? What This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Reveals When we see a Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude, several important questions arise. Why would someone move nearly 6,000 BTC in a single transaction? This substantial Bitcoin transfer could indicate several possibilities. The sender might be a large institution repositioning assets, a wealthy individual consolidating holdings, or even an exchange managing internal wallets. The fact that this Bitcoin transfer went to an unknown wallet adds another layer of mystery to the situation. Large Bitcoin transfers often signal significant market movements ahead. Historical data shows that massive movements frequently precede price volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every large Bitcoin transfer indicates immediate market impact. Sometimes these transactions represent routine portfolio management or security measures. Why Should You Care About This Bitcoin Transfer? You might wonder why a single Bitcoin transfer matters to the average investor. The answer lies in market psychology and liquidity. When whales make moves this substantial, they can influence: Market sentiment – Large movements often trigger speculation Price discovery – Significant transfers can affect supply dynamics Investor confidence – Whale activity signals institutional interest Trading volume – Large movements increase overall market activity This particular Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase stands out because of its sheer size and timing. The movement from a known exchange to an unknown wallet suggests the assets are being moved into cold storage or private custody. This Bitcoin transfer pattern often indicates long-term holding intentions rather than immediate selling pressure. Understanding the Impact of Large Bitcoin Transfers Every significant Bitcoin transfer tells a story about market dynamics. The $596 million valuation of this transaction highlights Bitcoin’s continued dominance in the cryptocurrency space. Such substantial movements demonstrate that major players remain actively involved in the ecosystem. This Bitcoin transfer also underscores the importance of transparency in blockchain transactions. Thanks to services like Whale Alert, we can track these movements in real-time. However, the anonymous nature of the receiving wallet reminds us that privacy remains a key feature of cryptocurrency transactions. What This Bitcoin Transfer Means for Future Price Action Analyzing this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at historical patterns. Large movements to unknown wallets have often preceded: Price consolidation periods Increased institutional accumulation Reduced exchange liquidity Long-term bullish sentiment The timing of this Bitcoin transfer coincides with broader market developments that could influence future price trajectories. While we cannot predict exact outcomes, the movement of nearly 6,000 BTC certainly warrants attention from serious market participants. Key Takeaways From This Monumental Bitcoin Movement This substantial Bitcoin transfer serves as a powerful reminder of several crucial market realities. First, institutional-sized movements continue to shape the cryptocurrency landscape. Second, the transparency of blockchain technology allows us to monitor these developments in real-time. Finally, the movement from exchange to private wallet suggests confidence in long-term value preservation. The $596 million Bitcoin transfer represents more than just numbers on a screen. It demonstrates the maturing infrastructure that supports large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and the growing sophistication of market participants. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect to see more of these significant Bitcoin transfers that shape market dynamics and investor strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale transfer? A Bitcoin whale transfer refers to large movements of Bitcoin, typically involving thousands of coins, usually executed by wealthy individuals or institutions known as ‘whales’ in cryptocurrency terminology. Why do large Bitcoin transfers matter? Large Bitcoin transfers matter because they can signal institutional moves, affect market liquidity, influence price sentiment, and indicate accumulation or distribution patterns among major holders. How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? You can track large Bitcoin transfers using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or monitoring services like Whale Alert that specifically report significant cryptocurrency movements. Does moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets affect price? Moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets often indicates long-term holding intentions, which can reduce immediate selling pressure and potentially support price stability or future appreciation. What does a transfer from Coinbase usually mean? A transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet typically suggests assets are moving into private custody for long-term storage rather than immediate trading purposes.

With Bitcoin down by 7% in a month, and with Ethereum down by 11%, traders may be looking for alternatives to boost their portfolios, and one such alternative is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has been enjoying a successful presale. It’s planning to launch a market-first mine-to-earn platform, enabling holders to mine cryptocurrencies without having to invest in expensive hardware. This feature distinguishes it from most other new meme coins, which is why it could rally strongly once it lists in the next few weeks. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 13 November The past few weeks have been rough for the cryptocurrency market, with fears related to an AI-led bubble causing investors to pull funds out of major tokens. This has impacted most cryptocurrencies, even if fundamentals remain generally strong, and the situation may not pick up decisively until the stock market corrects. However, even with average prices remaining subdued, traders may be able to buck the trend by looking to new and up-and-coming coins, with PEPENODE being one of the most promising new tokens around right now. It has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing presale, providing a clear sign of how popular it could become once it launches. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 The main reason for its early success is that it’s offering something no other token in the market is currently offering, which is a mine-to-earn platform. As this term suggests, the platform provides users with the opportunity to earn money from mining, yet in PEPENODE’s case, it doesn’t require the use of expensive mining equipment. Instead, users can build their own virtual mining rigs, using the PEPENODE token itself to acquire and run more mining nodes. The more mining nodes they own, the more they earn from mining. The protocol will pay out rewards in external tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, with more coins coming at later dates. This means that there could be substantial demand for PEPENODE, so as to grow mining rigs. Also, multiplying demand will be the fact that holders can stake the token, with the current yield at 600% APY. How to Buy PEPENODE Early These features mean that PEPENODE is one of the most bullish new tokens in the market, making it arguably the best new meme coin to buy now, or at least one of the best. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with owners able to claim their tokens as soon as its presale ends. Investors can join this sale by going to the PEPENODE website, where the token is currently selling for $0.0011454. This price will rise again tomorrow, so traders wanting to lock in the biggest possible returns should act now. And given the coin’s growing popularity, it could climb well above this price once it launches, especially if it gains listings from big exchanges.

This monumental achievement represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption and investor confidence. What Does This BTC Price Milestone Mean for Investors? The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 signals several important developments. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major corporations and investment funds increase their Bitcoin exposure. Second, retail investor interest typically follows these landmark price movements. However, experienced traders recommend maintaining a balanced portfolio approach despite the excitement. Market analysts point to several factors driving this impressive BTC price performance: Increased institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs Growing global adoption as a hedge against inflation Positive regulatory developments in key markets Limited supply meeting expanding demand How Sustainable Is This Current BTC Price Level? While the current BTC price achievement generates excitement, investors should consider market volatility. Cryptocurrency markets historically experience significant price swings. Therefore, proper risk management remains crucial for all market participants. The technical analysis perspective suggests strong support levels have formed around previous resistance zones. Moreover, trading volume has increased substantially during this upward movement, indicating genuine market participation rather than artificial price pumping. What Should New Investors Know About BTC Price Movements? For newcomers attracted by the impressive BTC price performance, understanding basic cryptocurrency principles proves essential. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls its value. The price reflects collective market sentiment and fundamental adoption metrics. Key considerations for new investors include: Understanding wallet security and storage options Researching reputable exchanges for trading Learning about dollar-cost averaging strategies Recognizing the difference between long-term holding and active trading Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of BTC Price The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 opens new psychological territory for market participants. Historical patterns suggest that after breaking major resistance levels, Bitcoin often experiences consolidation periods followed by either continued upward momentum or corrective phases. Market sentiment appears overwhelmingly positive, though seasoned investors caution against excessive euphoria. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, with adoption metrics continuing to show healthy growth across both institutional and retail segments. Frequently Asked Questions What caused BTC price to surge past $100,000? The price movement resulted from combined factors including institutional investment flows, positive regulatory developments, and increasing global adoption as a digital store of value. Should I invest in Bitcoin at current price levels? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Canary Capital will be the first asset management firm to get an XRP spot ETF approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund will trade under the ticker symbol XRPC. The official listing notice for $XRPC has arrived from Nasdaq. Looks like tomorrow is ON for the launch. pic.twitter.com/zvJ8q3SwpS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 12, 2025 A hybrid XRP ETF managed by REX-Osprey that partially invests in futures has attracted $131 million in assets just a few months after its launch. This reflects Wall Street’s growing appetite for the token. Just as it happened with the first Solana 100% spot ETF launched by Bitwise recently, Canary’s ETF could rapidly surpass its predecessor as this vehicle is 100% backed by XRP reserves. Could this ETF approval mark the beginning of XRP’s next leg up? XRP Price Prediction: Eyes Set at $5 as Institutions Embrace XRP XRP found support at $2.10 recently, following the hawkish comments made by the head of the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago. XRP has bounced off a key support just as the U.S. government shutdown ends, reigniting hopes for a stronger recovery across the crypto market. If the token breaks above the 200-day EMA, it could accelerate toward $3 — a move that would confirm a breakout from the current parabolic setup. With institutional adoption rising, XRP’s long-term outlook remains strong. A surge to $5 looks achievable in the months ahead. Some ultra-bullish projections still point to a $100 target eventually, which would imply a $6 trillion market cap. That’s a stretch for now, but the narrative is gaining steam among believers. Meanwhile, high-upside presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are attracting early investors hoping to capture growth faster. This project reimagines mining by letting anyone earn meme coins through virtual rigs — no hardware required. Over $2 million has already poured into the presale, and the window to get in early is closing fast. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Fun and Hassle-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) enables players to mine meme coins easily, without the need to invest thousands of dollars in hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) transforms crypto mining into a virtual game where players compete to earn real meme coin rewards. Using $PEPENODE tokens, gamers can launch powerful virtual servers, deploy as many rigs as they like, and climb the leaderboard by mining more than their rivals. Top performers will score exclusive airdrops of trending tokens like Bonk ($BONK), along with other premium prizes. To drive value, the game burns up to 70% of the tokens spent on rig upgrades, creating constant deflation as gameplay scales. With $2.1 million raised in just weeks, many consider $PEPENODE as one of the most promising contenders in this meme coin cycle. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can complete the transaction by swapping tokens like USDT or ETH, or simply using a bank card for instant access.

Merz’s announcement is the latest in a growing line of European countries dumping Chinese tech and cutting ties with manufacturers they evaluate to be risks. Germany’s digital sovereignty and national security concerns Merz, in a business conference in Berlin on Thursday, emphasized that Chinese components have no place in next-generation networks. “We won’t allow any components from China in the 6G network,” the German Chancellor said. Germany took a firm stance to exclude Huawei Technologies and other Chinese suppliers from its future communication networks due to concerns about potential security vulnerabilities linked to Huawei equipment. German authorities fear that the Chinese government’s influence over the tech manufacturer potentially creates an opening for espionage within critical telecoms infrastructure, a fear that has been echoed by other Western countries. By banning Huawei from 6G networks, Germany aims to eliminate future risks. Merz said he’d have a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron at an upcoming summit on digital sovereignty. “We’ll discuss with industry what we can do, not only to make ourselves independent from China, but also for example independent from the USA, independent from the big tech companies.” Major operators like Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica will need to adapt new strategies and find alternative suppliers, primarily European technology firms. Europe pushes out Chinese tech Germany’s decision to exclude Huawei from its 6G networks mirrors similar moves by other European countries as the bloc has been intensifying efforts to phase out Huawei and ZTE equipment from member state networks amid shared concerns about Chinese state influence and cybersecurity threats. Germany first made moves to remove Huawei equipment from core network components in 2024. Now, the country has made a stance to totally exclude Huawei and other Chinese suppliers from its future 6G network. Finland and other EU countries have recently announced plans or taken steps to ban Huawei for future network development. Beyond Europe, the US and several other countries have long restricted Huawei’s role in critical telecom projects, citing national security. Germany’s decision is expected to influence supply chains and investment decisions in the telecom market, potentially increasing costs and slowing deployment timelines during the transition away from Huawei. However, Merz notes that total independence from Chinese technology is not possible. “We can’t do that”. He also cautioned business executives to understand the risks of doing business with China, adding that Germany will not always be able to protect them.

After briefly dipping to around $100,700 on Wednesday, BTC remains down roughly 3.5% on the weekly candle. The move is part of a wider trend that has seen long-term holders unload more than 815,000 BTC over the past month. That level of selling has raised alarms among analysts who warn that lower liquidity pockets could drive Bitcoin toward the June 2025 lows near $98,000 if volatility accelerates. The broader market is now watching how Bitcoin behaves around the critical $100,000 region, which has repeatedly been tested throughout the year. Liquidity Mapping Shows Market Vulnerability Crypto analysts following liquidity flow patterns say that Bitcoin’s current range is showing clear pockets of weakness. Trader Daan Crypto noted that a “large cluster of liquidity sits below the local lows at $98,000–$100,000,” suggesting that if selling pressure increases, the market may gravitate toward that zone. He also pointed to upside liquidity targets near $108,000 and $112,000 but stressed that only the first target is currently within realistic reach. According to his assessment, whichever liquidity band breaks first could determine whether Bitcoin enters a sharp short squeeze or a capitulation-style flush. This view is backed by several futures traders who say BTC is increasingly likely to revisit the lower end of its range. Futures trader Byzantine General stated that Bitcoin “is likely to sweep the lows around $98,000,” citing repeated failures to break higher. Data from CoinGlass supports this bearish tilt, showing nearly $1.3 billion in cumulative long leveraged liquidity concentrated around $98,000. That figure has risen sharply since the beginning of the week, indicating that traders have layered bids just below current levels. Repeated Support Retests Signal Structural Weakness One of the more worrying indicators for market analysts is the consistent retesting of support between $102,000 and $100,000. Bitcoin has now returned to that region four separate times since May 2025. Each retest weakens buyers’ conviction and reduces the number of resting bids available to defend the support line. Analyst UBCrypto said the latest bounce resembled a failed breakout attempt and added that the region is “not a level worth buying into” until Bitcoin shows a confirmed shift in momentum. He argued that entering positions slightly higher is preferable if it means avoiding a potential breakdown. Despite this caution, long-heavy positioning remains dominant among retail traders. Hyblock Capital data shows that 68.9% of BTC orders on Binance still lean long, suggesting many believe the $100,000 level will hold. However, the daily and weekly charts both show softening structure at higher time frames. This has increased expectations that Bitcoin may eventually test the liquidity pool near $98,000 before the market finds a stronger footing. Deeper order book support appears to sit just above Bitcoin’s current price, but analysts warn that the market could still be pulled into lower liquidity areas if sentiment deteriorates. If selling from long-term holders continues and short-term traders remain overleveraged, Bitcoin may still face additional downside pressure before recovery attempts strengthen.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-13 23:39:57

At Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025, top VCs revealed they’re operating in what Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures calls a ‘funky time’ – where companies can leap from zero to $100 million in revenue within a single year. Why Traditional Venture Capital Rules No Longer Apply to AI Startups The unprecedented speed of AI innovation has forced venture capital firms to completely rethink their investment strategies. According to Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, the old metrics and timelines have become obsolete. ‘It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients,’ she explained during her keynote address. The rapid scaling capabilities of AI companies mean that investors must evaluate opportunities through an entirely new lens. The New Investment Strategy for AI Companies VCs are now prioritizing factors that were previously secondary considerations. Lee’s research reveals that Series A investors are measuring: Data generation capabilities and proprietary datasets Strength of competitive moats and technical barriers Founders’ track records and technical expertise Product depth and innovation velocity Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures emphasized that even startups achieving rapid growth to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding, indicating how dramatically the investment game has changed. The Critical Importance of Go-to-Market Strategy One of the most significant shifts in venture capital thinking revolves around go-to-market execution. McNeill stated that ‘the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech – they have the best go-to-market.’ This perspective highlights how investors are prioritizing customer acquisition and retention capabilities alongside technical innovation. Traditional VC Focus New AI Startup Focus Technology differentiation Go-to-market execution Long-term revenue projections Immediate revenue velocity Market size analysis Data generation capabilities Team experience Founder technical depth Unprecedented Revenue Growth Expectations The benchmark for success has been radically reset in the AI sector. Where previously startups might have celebrated reaching $10 million in annual revenue within five years, AI companies are now expected to achieve $100 million in revenue within twelve months. This accelerated timeline creates both enormous opportunity and intense pressure for founders and investors alike. Are We Witnessing the Dawn of a New Investment Era? Despite the high stakes and rapid pace, panelists agreed that the AI industry remains in its infancy. Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures noted that ‘there are no clear, outright winners, even in LLMs. There are competitors nipping at their heels.’ This suggests that the current investment frenzy represents just the beginning of a much larger transformation in how venture capital approaches technological disruption. FAQs What are the key factors VCs now consider for AI startup investments? VCs prioritize data generation, competitive moats, founder expertise, and go-to-market strategy over traditional metrics. How has revenue growth expectations changed for AI startups? Companies are now expected to reach $100 million in revenue within a year, compared to traditional timelines of 5+ years for similar milestones. What companies were mentioned in the Bitcoin World Disrupt discussion? The panel featured insights from Cowboy Ventures , DVx Ventures , and Kindred Ventures , with references to OpenAI and Anthropic as benchmarks for product development velocity. Who are the key investors driving this change? Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures, and Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures are among the thought leaders reshaping AI investment strategies. The venture capital industry’s radical transformation in response to AI startups represents more than just a temporary trend – it signals a fundamental restructuring of how innovation gets funded and scaled. As investors continue to adapt their strategies to this new reality, the companies that master both technological innovation and rapid market execution will define the next generation of industry leaders.

The updated buyback allocation forms part of a broader strategy to enhance value capture, staking yield, and governance participation, directly linking tokenholder incentives to platform performance. dYdX votes to approve proposal to triple token buyback rate. Source: Mintscan dYdX approves upgrade for buyback proposal The proposal , numbered #313, was passed by 59.38% of community voters on November 13, and it marks one of the most aggressive revenue-to-buyback ratios among major decentralized protocols. In the past, only 25% of net protocol fees were allocated to DYDX repurchases, with the remainder directed toward operational and treasury functions. The new move is expected to triple the buying pressure on the price. As part of the newly passed framework, the protocol committed three-quarters of its fee revenue directly to buying and staking DYDX , while 5% will be sent to the Treasury SubDAO and 5% to the MegaVault. “Starting today, 75% of protocol fees will be used to buy back DYDX on the open market,” the dYdX foundation confirmed on X. dYdX first launched its buyback mechanism in March 2025, coinciding with the v4 mainnet migration and a planned reduction in emissions by June 2025. The new buyback policy takes effect immediately, and what will naturally follow is a significant reduction in the token’s circulating supply, which could instantly push the DYDX price into an upside trajectory. dYdX prepares for its US debut The decision to update its revenue-to-buyback ratios follows dYdX’s rapid growth across its standalone Cosmos-based chain, where cumulative trading volume recently surpassed $1.5 trillion. It also comes as the exchange gets ready for its US market debut later this year and continues its campaign to remove maker and taker fees on select perpetual pairs to boost liquidity depth. The derivatives-focused exchange, which cuts out the middleman and allows users to transact directly on a blockchain network, was previously not available to American users. It recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, and Eddie Zhang, the company’s president, has revealed plans to expand its offerings by bringing spot trading on Solana and other linked cryptocurrencies to the US by the end of the year. “It’s very important for us as a platform to have something available in the United States, because I think it represents, hopefully, the direction we’re trying to move in,” Zhang said. The company’s decision to enter the US market may be linked to the friendly regulatory environment created by President Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector this year. That embrace has led to the dismissal of several lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets. Upon entering the US, dYdX will slash its trading fees by as much as half “across the board,” to between 50 and 65 basis points, Zhang said. According to him, perpetual contracts will not be available in the US, but it is not entirely off the table and may become a possibility if US regulators eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to be able to offer those products. Already, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have indicated they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the US, so that possibility continues to grow by the day.

The round also included a mix of existing investors, such as Accel, and new backers, including Nvidia and Alphabet’s Google. Cursor’s surge in valuation comes after it raised $900 million in June at a $9.9 billion valuation . The June round saw participation from Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Accel. Per Reuters, the company shared that it has now surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, with sales-led revenue growing 100-fold since the beginning of 2025. Cursor’s code-generation boom drives investor interest Cursor builds software that autonomously generates and completes code, allowing developers to write applications faster and with fewer errors, and the technology has been touted to replace traditional software development. The company’s tools are part of a growing segment of AI known as code generation. Investors see vast commercial potential in this space, as enterprises seek to automate routine programming tasks and accelerate the development of digital products, making tools like Cursor attractive. The new funding round positions Cursor as one of the highest-valued startups in the code-generation market, far outpacing peers such as Replit, which reached a $3 billion valuation in September after raising $250 million. It now joins a short list of AI companies with over $10 billion valuation. Rising valuations meet rising concerns The near-tripling of Cursor’s valuation in such a short period comes amid an increase in venture funding for AI companies. According to reports, global venture capital investment rose 38% year-on-year in the third quarter to $97 billion, with about half of that total flowing into AI-related businesses, according to data from Crunchbase. Investors have been particularly drawn to companies that can demonstrate tangible revenue growth, something Cursor seems to be doing well. By crossing the $1 billion annualized revenue threshold, it joins a small group of AI startups claiming to have achieved substantial commercial traction at scale. However, the frenetic pace of fundraising and valuations of AI companies has led to debates about its long-term market, with some experts, investors, and industry heavyweights like Jeff Bezos predicting that the fate that met the dot-com boom may befall it as well. However, Bezos reportedly stated that irrespective of what happens later in the sector, it’s certain that there will be winners as well as losers, and the society will still benefit from the inventions that will come out of the ‘AI bubble.’ Investors are also spreading their bets to ensure that they find themselves on the winning sides as much as possible. Concerns about overheating went up this week after Japan’s SoftBank Group sold its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia, a move some analysts interpreted as a signal that even the sector’s most bullish investors are beginning to take profits. A defining moment for AI development Founded by a team of former MIT engineers under the umbrella of parent company Anysphere, Cursor has quickly become one of Silicon Valley’s breakout AI success stories. OpenAI was in talks with Cursor’s parent company to acquire the platform, but the deal fell through. The makers of ChatGPT also tried to acquire Windsurf, another code-generation startup, but also left the deal to launch its own platform called Codex. Windsurf itself was later acquired by AI startup Cognition. Anthropic’s Claude Code is also in the picture, and it has reportedly made about $500 million since it debuted this year. So, despite its rapid growth, Cursor faces formidable challenges. Apart from OpenAI and Anthropic, tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are heavily investing in similar AI-assisted development tools. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The guidance under development is expected to help banks and their partners understand how tokenized deposits fit into the existing insurance structure. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is preparing new guidance to help banks understand how deposit insurance should work when deposits are moved onto blockchain or other distributed-ledger systems. FDIC open to integrating blockchain into traditional banking Acting Chair Travis Hill confirmed the plan during an appearance at a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conference. He stated that the agency wants to give financial institutions clearer rules as they integrate digital asset technology into their systems. Hill strongly believes that deposits should not lose their legal status simply because they move from traditional banking platforms into a tokenized form. As he puts it, “a deposit is a deposit.” A tokenized deposit is usually a digital coin that acts as a claim on real funds held by a bank. This concept is different from stablecoins, which are digital tokens that are typically pegged to a fiat currency but are not automatically connected to federally insured deposit accounts. With banks and other financial firms experimenting with blockchain technology, regulators have been under pressure to clarify how existing customer protections like deposit insurance apply in these new environments. Many fintech companies are not banks, so they are not directly covered by FDIC insurance . To offer protection to their customers, they usually partner with FDIC-insured banks, which can make the accounts eligible for pass-through insurance. But this system can fail if the fintech goes out of business or if the way customer accounts are set up is unclear. This has raised concerns about who must cover customer losses when a third-party platform collapses. Rising consumer protection concerns The rise of fintech platforms has caused customers to assume that their digital wallets or app-based accounts are insured, even when the platform itself is not a bank. Pass-through insurance can apply only when certain conditions are met, and regulators have shared concerns about some fintechs that do not communicate these conditions clearly. This concern has grown as more fintech firms explore ways to offer tokenized financial products or integrate blockchain technology into their services. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), a central pillar of the U.S. financial system, designed to protect depositors when banks fail, saw its reserve ratio fall below the level required by law after 2020. The fund is financed mainly by quarterly fees paid by insured banks, known as assessments. The reserve decline after 2020 was due to the surge in deposits across the banking system during the pandemic. To address this, the FDIC has been rebuilding the fund over the past few years. The agency projected earlier this year that the DIF would reach its legal target ratio by the end of 2025, about three years earlier than previously expected.

The ruling , made on Thursday, is a significant development in calculating what could be a substantial payout, potentially as much as £1.2 billion. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) refused Apple permission to appeal its ruling, which found that the tech giant charged “modest levels of commission” and stifled competition on its iOS App Store. However, the tech giant still has one final route of appeal: it can go to the Court of Appeal. The case is one of the largest legal challenges the iPhone maker faces in Europe, as scrutiny mounts worldwide over how the company operates its digital marketplace. Tribunal blocks Apple’s appeal attempt Last month, the CAT found that Apple had engaged in anticompetitive behaviour by creating a competitive advantage in the iOS app distribution market. The panel found it “excessive and unfair” because it refers to Apple charging its usual 30% cut on in-app transactions. The ruling concluded that the fare commission should have been only about 17.5%. Developers were overcharged for nearly nine years. The tribunal also found that developers had passed on half the cost of those inflated fees to consumers, thereby effectively charging millions of British users higher prices for apps and in-app services. On Thursday, the CAT refused Apple’s application to appeal the ruling, stating that Apple had not crossed the threshold required for reconsideration. Apple’s lawyers then requested a 21-day extension to file new papers with the Court of Appeal. The tribunal’s judgment that “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy” also disregarded the value Apple says it offers developers as well as consumers, the company said. The case was brought by Rachael Kent, a British academic, on behalf of approximately 20 million UK iPhone and iPad users. Her lawyers had calculated damages from October 2015 until February 2024, along with interest, at £1.2 billion. Kent said the case has been “a marathon, not a sprint,” but emphasized that last week’s ruling gets consumers “one step closer to seeing money rightfully put back into their pockets. That opens the way for the damages phase to proceed, with the CAT expected to plan additional hearings on how compensation is to be distributed. It is likely to be a process that will take months. Regulatory scrutiny of Apple increases around the world The UK case comes as the iPhone maker faces mounting pressure over its control of app distribution and in-app payments across Europe and the U.S. European regulators have also targeted the tech firm, utilizing new rules designed to curb the power of big tech platforms. In recent years, Apple has been forced to change App Store policies in the Netherlands, South Korea, and across the broader EU bloc. The UK judgment adds to a series of international rulings against the company, which have forced it to reduce fees or allow access for rival payment systems. Industry analysts say the CAT decision could bolster other lawsuits that are in progress against Apple, not only in Europe but also elsewhere. Apple now has a short period in which to request permission directly to appeal its case to the Court of Appeal.

54367116,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=853314,1763078423,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,SUI Silent Comeback: The Underdog Preparing For A $20 Charge,https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-preparing-for-a-20-charge/,"In a latest update, BeLaunch posed the high-stakes question: Could SUI really reach $20 in the next bull cycle? After getting hit hard during the October 10 flash crash, SUI is starting to show strength again, and the charts are now painting a very interesting picture that could signal the beginning of a major turnaround. Potential Scenarios For SUI BeLaunch recently outlined two possible scenarios for SUI’s next move, each with distinct probabilities and implications. According to the analysis, the token is currently at a critical juncture, where its next few moves could determine the broader market‘s direction. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? In the primary scenario, which carries an 8/10 probability, SUI is testing a crucial breakout above the red dashed resistance line. Wave (2) appears to have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3) — typically one of the most impulsive moves in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout at this level could propel SUI toward new highs. The alternative scenario, rated at a 3/10 probability, suggests that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave near the $5.37 region before extending into another corrective phase (Alt Y). Although less likely, BeLaunch noted that traders should still monitor this possibility closely. Technical and On-Chain Alignment Suggests Market Bottom Nearing According to BeLaunch, on-chain fundamentals for SUI are showing early signs of recovery, despite broader market attention remaining elsewhere. The data reveals that Total Value Locked (TVL) has been holding firm around $1.4 billion, though the analyst notes that a move above the $2 billion threshold would mark a more decisive shift in momentum. At the same time, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been climbing gradually, now sitting near 900,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says SUI Price Could Be Heading To $9: 4 Reasons Why BeLaunch noted that despite this encouraging on-chain behavior, SUI’s price remains lagging, a common indicator of a classic accumulation phase. During such periods, investors often underestimate the asset’s underlying strength while long-term players quietly position themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Historically, SUI has shown a tendency to rally within two to four weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin trending upward. If this pattern repeats, it could signal that SUI is currently in a quiet accumulation window before a stronger move to the upside. This alignment between historical behavior and present data gives a subtle yet compelling bullish undertone. Overall, BeLaunch emphasized that the technical and on-chain setup appears robust. Fundamentals are stabilizing, momentum indicators are shifting, and WaveTrend signals are flashing a bottom below 40. If the current trend persists, SUI could soon emerge from consolidation and enter a new bullish phase.

The draft legislation would establish a clear regime for digital-asset spot markets and limit the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering significant implications for the broader crypto industry. Defining Digital Commodities and Oversight Led by Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), the proposed discussion draft aims to grant the CFTC authority over digital-commodity spot markets, while limiting the SEC’s oversight to securities. Under this model, what are currently labelled “major cryptocurrencies” could be explicitly classified as commodities. The draft outlines a framework for trading platforms and intermediaries to register with the CFTC, and introduces protections such as customer-fund segregation, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on affiliated trading. Implications for XRP and the Ripple Ecosystem If enacted, the legislation would have direct relevance to Ripple and its XRP token, which were central to the company’s regulatory dispute with the SEC. Classifying XRP as a commodity would anchor its legal treatment under the Commodity Exchange Act, rather than securities laws. This may ease listing decisions for U.S. exchanges, reduce regulatory uncertainty around institutional participation, and support products such as managed-account or prime-brokerage offerings. Furthermore, the draft’s provisions for self-custody and non-custodial infrastructure suggest that software developers and node operators would not automatically be regulated as financial institutions, a detail that provides clarity for those building on the XRPL ecosystem. The legislation arrives at a moment of important market dynamics. A recent report by CoinShares noted that investment products focused on digital assets recorded over $1 billion in outflows last week. In contrast, XRP was one of the few assets to register $28.2 million in inflows, bucking the broader trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, as trading venues prepare for the launch of spot XRP ETFs and regulatory agencies resume full operations following the U.S. government shutdown , the timing of legislative clarity could be pivotal. The bill, however, remains at the discussion-draft stage and will require negotiation, amendment, and passage before becoming law. Why This Development Matters For market participants, the draft bill signals a major step toward legally defining and stabilizing the regulatory environment for digital assets. By clarifying that tokens such as XRP may fall under commodity rather than securities classification, the legislation could reduce legal risk for issuers, exchanges, and institutional investors. This regulatory clarity can increase confidence in listing decisions, ease the creation of new investment products, and mark a shift toward more structured oversight. For Ripple and its token ecosystem, the draft presents a scenario in which its long-standing position becomes codified in federal law, a transition from legal dispute toward potential legislative alignment. Although the draft represents considerable progress, it is not yet final. The document is still labelled a “discussion draft,” meaning it is subject to change and requires additional stakeholder feedback, committee mark-ups, and eventual full-chamber votes. The pace of passage will depend on the broader legislative calendar, agency readiness, and political dynamics surrounding digital-asset regulation. Observers believe that if the bill advances, the combined effect of institutional inflows, ETF launches, and regulatory certainty could significantly alter the trajectory for XRP and similar assets.

54367344,627185,1763078458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54367344.jpeg,"If The Dogecoin Price Successfully Breaks This Zone, Then Prepare For A Strong Upward Push",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-upward-push/,"The Dogecoin price has spent the past few days attempting to recover from a decline that has affected the entire industry for weeks, shifting from a clear downtrend earlier in the month into a more constructive structure. After dipping below the $0.16 region, buyers began stepping back in to form a series of higher lows and nudging the price into a tighter range between $0.17 and $0.186. The latest candles show Dogecoin trading just beneath a resistance band around $0.186, which is the same zone that capped upside attempts throughout the week. This is where the discussion from BitGuru’s technical outlook comes in, supported by the chart he shared on the social media platform X. Dogecoin Price Trying To Rebound From Downtrend The Dogecoin price is starting to exhibit some sort of push off the early-month lows that saw it reach into the mid-$0.15 region. Between November 5 and 6, Dogecoin was consolidating around this region to create what looks like a bullish beauty, as shown in the price chart below. The chart further shows how the Dogecoin price eventually broke out of this descending structure on November 7 to push toward the mid-$0.18 region. This marked the first sign that momentum was shifting away from sellers, and this might set a sustained advance that changes the tone of Dogecoin’s price action. That transition from lower highs into a more aggressive upward slope set the foundation for the rebound now taking shape. However, Dogecoin is now pressing against an overhead resistance zone around $0.186 that first arose as a result of a downtrend order block on November 2. Technical analysis shows that this price level is now the most important barrier to break. The chart shows a tight cluster of candles forming just beneath this level, with small intraday rejections but no meaningful breakdowns. Price action in this region carries a clear message: bulls are attempting to reclaim control, and the structure is beginning to resemble a pre-breakout consolidation. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: BitGuru On X A Break Above This Zone Could Set Off Strong Rally The critical question now for Dogecoin’s short-term technical outlook is whether it can push cleanly above the resistance at $0.186. BitGuru’s outlook frames this zone as the key decision point. A strong break above it would open the door for continuation, setting the Dogecoin price up for the next impulsive leg higher above $0.2. Failure to break through would not necessarily derail the developing bullish structure, but it could invite a short-lived pullback before another attempt at an upward move. Everything now depends on how Dogecoin behaves at this price resistance, as momentum is clearly building beneath it and a decisive breakout would shift the entire short-term outlook upward. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1764, up by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 00:00:58

Today marks a pivotal moment as Bitcoin options worth $4.1 billion are set to expire, potentially triggering significant price movements and opportunities for traders. What Are Bitcoin Options and Why Do They Matter? Bitcoin options are financial contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell BTC at a set price by a specific date. These Bitcoin options act as hedging tools or speculative instruments, influencing market sentiment. When large volumes expire, like today’s $4.1 billion, they can cause volatility as traders adjust positions. Data from Deribit shows a put/call ratio of 0.62, indicating more call options than puts. This suggests bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $105,000, a level where most options would expire worthless, potentially stabilizing prices. How Could This Bitcoin Options Expiry Affect Prices? Major Bitcoin options expiries often lead to short-term price swings. Here’s what to watch for: Increased volatility as traders close or roll over positions Potential price pressure near the max pain level of $105,000 Liquidity shifts influencing Bitcoin’s immediate direction Moreover, Ethereum options worth $750 million expire simultaneously. Their put/call ratio of 0.64 and max pain at $3,500 could amplify overall market effects. Therefore, monitoring both assets is crucial. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Use? To navigate this event, consider these strategies. First, assess your risk tolerance, as Bitcoin options expiry often spikes volatility. Second, watch key support and resistance levels, like the $105,000 max pain point. Finally, diversify to mitigate sudden moves. Historical data shows that post-expiry, markets frequently stabilize. Thus, long-term investors might view dips as buying opportunities. However, always use stop-loss orders to protect gains. Conclusion: Seize the Moment in Crypto Markets In summary, today’s Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event with $4.1 billion at stake. By understanding the mechanics and staying informed, you can turn potential chaos into calculated advantage. Embrace the volatility, but prioritize risk management to thrive. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiry? It’s when options contracts mature, requiring holders to exercise or let them expire, often affecting prices. How does the put/call ratio influence markets? A ratio below 1, like 0.62, signals more calls, hinting at bullish expectations among traders. What is max pain price in options? It’s the price where most options expire worthless, potentially reducing volatility post-expiry. Should I trade during options expiry? Only if experienced, as high volatility can lead to quick gains or losses; beginners should observe. Do Ethereum options expiries impact Bitcoin? Yes, correlated markets mean large ETH events can influence BTC through overall sentiment shifts. Where can I track options data? Platforms like Deribit provide real-time updates on volumes, ratios, and expiry details. Found this guide helpful?

But that hasn’t stopped everyone from trying to piece together what the hell’s really going on. This new round is supposedly an add-on to the $10 billion raise previously reported back in September, when insiders said xAI was already sitting on a $200 billion valuation. If true, that would shove the AI startup right alongside other massive players like Anthropic and OpenAI, both of which have recently pulled in eye-watering sums in their quest to dominate the foundational model arms race. xAI struggles with Tesla connections, power struggles, and that Memphis mess CNBC’s report had claimed that the new cash was gonna be earmarked for the usual suspects: GPUs. A huge portion of that alleged $15 billion is said to be going straight into the pockets of chipmakers, to buy up the graphic processing units needed to fuel xAI’s data-thirsty algorithms, you know, just like every other nerd in this brutal AI race. That’s not all xAI has going on, as it isn’t just sipping the same Kool-Aid as Tesla, it’s basically drinking straight from the jug. The two are tangled up in more ways than one. Newer Tesla vehicles have xAI’s Grok chatbot baked right into their infotainment systems. Yeah, the same Grok that’s been slammed left and right for spewing inaccurate junk and even worse, pumping out antisemitic trash and other hate speech. And that’s not the end of it. xAI recently launched Grokipedia, an encyclopedia-style platform that was clearly aiming to take on Wikipedia. Instead, it turned into yet another magnet for misinformation and chaos, triggering backlash across the board. Behind the scenes, the financial relationship between Tesla and xAI goes deeper than just software, according to CNBC’s report , which also said that xAI has invested “tens of millions” on Tesla’s energy storage systems, particularly for use at those questionable data centers in Memphis; that’s the battery packs on one hand, and carbon-spewing turbines on the other. Bit of a confusing strategy if you ask anyone who thought Elon was still pushing a green revolution. Safe to say that boat sailed a long time ago. Elon’s side-hustle AI firm has already stirred plenty of controversy with its sudden, aggressive buildout of data centers in Memphis. The facilities, massive and power-hungry, are powered by natural gas turbines. You read that right. Fossil fuels. And researchers in the area have been sounding the alarm about emissions and their impact on the city’s already sketchy air quality. Proxy drama, rejected deals, and a $1 trillion question Last week’s Tesla shareholder meeting stirred the pot even more. As Cryptopolitan extensively reported, investors were asked to vote on two key issues: a proposed investment by Tesla into xAI, and Elon’s monster CEO pay plan, which could eventually net him close to $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares—if, and only if, the company hits some pretty intense milestones. The pay plan passed, obviously. But the xAI investment? Not so much. The board didn’t get enough support to go through with it. Now Tesla’s legal team is apparently weighing “next steps,” as Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, said during the meeting. Which really just means that this weird corporate entanglement between the car company and the AI startup is not ending any time soon. And just to throw more gasoline on the fire, remember: xAI acquired X (formerly known as Twitter) in March, in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion. That decision locked all three of Elon’s worlds (social, automotive, and AI) into a tight, messy knot that no one’s entirely sure how to untangle. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

For Hedera, it’s the entrance of one of the most trusted digital assets in the world. For Bitcoin holders, it has opened up a way for them to ultimately interact with complex financial applications without having to give up the safety and value of BTC. Many in the industry view it as a significant step toward expanding Bitcoin’s presence in decentralized finance (DeFi). The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been excluded from most of these systems due to limitations on its main blockchain related to smart contracts. Bringing WBTC onto Hedera flips that script and gives a new use case to Bitcoin. WBTC is, in fact, the most popular and largest 1:1 BTC tokenized representation on all regulated custodian storage. Any WBTC can also be redeemed at any time for regular Bitcoin. This can be somewhat comforting to those concerned with maintaining trust, as they know their wrapped asset isn’t a synthetic or algorithmic form of their native asset – it’s backed and fully redeemable at any time against real BTC reserves held by a regulated custodian. By enabling WBTC to utilize Hedera, BTC holders can now leverage smart contract capabilities without having to sell the asset or transfer it to more risky protocols. They can lend it, stake it, trade with it, and provide liquidity in a decentralized protocol, all while being exposed to Bitcoin’s underlying value. Hedera is also seeking to add liquidity to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. More liquidity means more activity, more developers, and more options for users. It is an extremely strong vote of confidence from the largest participants in the digital-asset markets that Hedera is going to be one of the leading places for decentralized finance. Hedera enhances DeFi capabilities with wrapped Bitcoin BitGo , the primary custodian underpinning WBTC and a member of the Hedera Council, supported the launch. BiT Global and LayerZero also participated, offering additional support for cross-chain interconnections. Hedera advertises itself as a quick, cost-effective network with predictable fees. Its consensus mechanism is also designed to prevent frontrunning and miner-extractable value (MEV), two issues that can harm users on other blockchains. With WBTC going live on Hedera, Bitcoin holders can wrap their BTC and utilize it across the smart-contracting platforms of Hedera. This facilitates lending and borrowing, trading, liquidity provision, and many other DeFi tricks. Hedera has been gaining traction in DeFi over the past year. Its total value locked (TVL) has increased, and the network has attracted more developers, as well as institutional partners. It is still perceived as one of the larger digital currencies by market cap, even based on the market value of its native token, HBAR. DeFi Bitcoin gains foothold around the world The addition of WBTC on Hedera is also indicative of a broader trend in the space. Bitcoin is no longer viewed solely as a long-term store of value; it’s also increasingly being considered an asset that can support its own financial ecosystem. Supporters of the industry builders argue that they are foolish to sit on all that money. Rather, they envision a system in which BTC can be deployed as a productive asset to lend against, stake with, and trade through – without sacrificing its bedrock identity. At several industry events, it was emphasized that Bitcoin DeFi aims to establish a trustless and permissionless financial layer beyond the scope of Bitcoin. This vision views BTC as collateral and capital, the foundation of a global open finance system. Major exchanges have even flagged “BTCFi” as a trend to watch heading into the medium- and long-term, asserting that this could boost Bitcoin adoption. The listing of WBTC on Hedera could boost the network’s DeFi activity by introducing new users and increasing liquidity. It may incentivize the creation of more tools and financial products that focus on Bitcoin on Hedera as well.

The Altcoin Season Index has climbed to 29, marking a significant step toward what could become a full-blown altcoin season. This upward movement signals growing strength among alternative cryptocurrencies compared to Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator that measures whether Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies are performing better. Created by CoinMarketCap, this index provides valuable insights into market dynamics. When the index approaches 100, it indicates a strong altcoin season where most major alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 29 points, the index has gained one point since yesterday. This gradual increase suggests that altcoins are slowly gaining ground against the crypto giant. However, we’re still far from the official altcoin season threshold of 75. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? The calculation methodology for the Altcoin Season Index follows specific rules that ensure accurate market representation. The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding: Stablecoins Wrapped coins Other pegged assets For an official altcoin season declaration, 75% of these qualifying assets must outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 29 indicates we’re approximately one-third of the way toward this benchmark. Why Should Investors Care About This Movement? The rising Altcoin Season Index matters because it often precedes significant market shifts. Historical data shows that when the index begins climbing steadily, it frequently leads to increased altcoin dominance. This pattern presents potential opportunities for investors looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin. However, caution remains essential. The current Altcoin Season Index level suggests we’re in early stages rather than full altcoin season. Market conditions can change rapidly, so thorough research remains crucial before making investment decisions. What Does the Future Hold for Altcoin Markets? While the Altcoin Season Index increase to 29 shows positive momentum, several factors could influence future movements. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements all play roles in determining whether this trend will continue. Investors should monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly alongside other market indicators. This comprehensive approach provides better context for understanding overall market health and potential investment opportunities. Key Takeaways from the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading The recent Altcoin Season Index movement to 29 points offers valuable insights for crypto market participants. The gradual upward trend suggests growing altcoin strength, though we remain below the official season threshold. This period represents a crucial observation window for investors monitoring market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. It tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets. What does an index score of 29 mean? A score of 29 indicates that altcoins are gaining momentum but haven’t reached official altcoin season status, which requires a score of 75 or higher. How often does the index update? The index updates regularly, with the recent change showing a one-point increase from the previous day’s reading. What triggers an altcoin season? Altcoin season occurs when 75% of top altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, signaling broader market rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Should I invest based on the index alone? No, the index should be one of many factors considered alongside fundamental analysis, market conditions, and personal investment strategy. How reliable is this indicator? While useful for market sentiment, the index works best when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Found this analysis helpful?

According to a blog posted on Thursday, the company detected the campaign in mid-September 2025, after observing abnormal behavior tied to its Claude Code tool. Anthropic is convinced without the shadow of a doubt that the espionage operation was run by a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group and involved infiltrating around thirty high-value targets, including major tech companies, banks, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies across several countries. A few of those attacks succeeded. What made this different from past cyber campaigns wasn’t just who was behind it, but how it was executed. Roughly 80 to 90 percent of the entire attack was run by AI, with human operators stepping in only for a handful of key decisions, says Anthropic. Hackers jailbroke Claude and made it think it was doing legit work The attackers started by building an automated attack framework around Claude Code, Anthropic’s own AI model, and tricked it into thinking it was employed by a cybersecurity company conducting internal testing. They broke Claude’s safety filters through jailbreaking, a tactic that let them bypass built-in protections by feeding the AI small, context-free tasks that looked harmless on their own. Claude didn’t know it was being used for offensive operations because it wasn’t given the full picture at any point. Once the model was in use, the operation moved fast. Claude scanned each target’s network, identified the most sensitive parts of the infrastructure, and summarized the layout for the human operators. Then, it began hunting for vulnerabilities in those systems. Using its built-in coding capabilities, Claude wrote custom exploit code, identified weak points, and retrieved login credentials. It then pulled large volumes of internal data, organized it based on how valuable it might be, and flagged high-access accounts. After the AI gained admin-level control, it created backdoors that gave ongoing access to the compromised systems. And when it was done, Claude wrote up detailed reports of everything it had done (listing usernames, breached systems, and credentials) so the attack framework could use that info for future operations. Although Claude was extremely efficient, it wasn’t flawless. Sometimes it made up passwords or misidentified public data as sensitive. But those glitches were rare, and they didn’t slow down the overall mission. The sheer speed of the AI’s execution, processing thousands of requests per second, put it far ahead of anything a human team could pull off. AI agents now do the work of elite hacker squads—with almost no people involved This campaign is a turning point because it shows how much AI has advanced in just one year. Claude was literally out here running loops, making decisions, and chaining together complex sequences without direct orders. This AI model used tools from the Model Context Protocol, giving it access to external software like password crackers, network mappers, and data retrievers that used to be controlled only by human hands. The Claude system now understands complex instructions, writes exploit code on its own, and manages sophisticated cybersecurity operations with very little guidance. These AI agents aren’t just assisting hackers, they are the hackers. And they’re getting more capable by the day. After discovering the breach, Anthropic immediately began a ten-day investigation, banning the malicious accounts one by one. They alerted the affected organizations, worked with authorities to pass on intel, and expanded their detection systems to catch similar operations moving forward. But the company isn’t pretending this is a one-time problem. The team says these attacks will only become more common, and easier to pull off. That’s because the skills needed to run them are no longer restricted to elite hackers. If someone can jailbreak a model and plug it into the right toolset, they could carry out a massive campaign without needing a team or even deep technical knowledge. Anthropic warns of escalating threats as AI models evolve beyond human oversight The implications are massive, because if teams without deep funding or technical skills can launch nation-scale attacks using automated AI systems, the dystopia is certainly upon us. Anthropic’s Threat Intelligence team warns that while they only tracked the activity through Claude, it’s likely that similar abuse is happening on other frontier AI models. They say this is the beginning of a new standard in cyberwarfare. So why keep releasing models with these capabilities, you wonder? Well Anthropic argues that these same tools are essential for defense, saying that “the AI that carried out the attack was also the same kind used by Anthropic’s analysts to dig through the wreckage, find patterns, and understand the operation’s full scale.” They did promise to improve their models’ internal safety layers though, as well as refine their classifiers for attack detection, and openly publish case studies like this so others in the industry can prepare. Still, Anthropic says it’s not enough to rely on them alone. They’re urging all devs working on large models to invest heavily in safety. And they’re calling on cybersecurity teams to start integrating AI into threat detection, incident response, vulnerability scans, and Security Operations Center automation, because traditional methods aren’t fast enough anymore.

The release lands as a bundle of 11 updates and more than 150 refinements across banking, Bitcoin, commerce and peer-to-peer features. The update focuses on making money movement faster, cheaper and more intuitive in the app. For Bitcoin, Cash App now lets eligible users pay over the Lightning Network in seconds and with no fee, using either BTC or a USD balance after scanning a Lightning QR code. That routing choice means people can tap Lightning speed without needing to hold Bitcoin. Cash App Adds Bitcoin Map and Prepares Stablecoin Transfers for Everyday Use The app also introduces Bitcoin Map, an in-app directory that helps customers find nearby Square merchants and other businesses that accept Bitcoin. Users can locate a store, get directions, and pay directly over Lightning at checkout. Stablecoins are coming next. Cash App said eligible customers will soon be able to send and receive dollar-linked tokens inside the app, giving users a low-friction rail for moving digital dollars alongside BTC. We’ve been busy making some updates at Cash App, all with you in mind Cash App Green – Turn everyday spending into status Borrow – Bridge the gap between payday and bill pay for a flat fee Moneybot – Intuitive, personalized AI money management Afterpay on Cash… — Cash App (@CashApp) November 13, 2025 These steps align with Jack Dorsey’s long-standing Bitcoin thesis, that open protocols should power everyday payments. Cash App already made BTC buying mainstream for millions, and Lightning support pushes that view deeper into point-of-sale and peer-to-peer flows. Cash App Taps AI and Crypto to Build Faster, Smarter and More Open Payment Rails Under the hood, the company also refreshed navigation with AI-driven prompts and rolled out a more flexible benefits program for banking features. The most significant change for crypto users is faster, more flexible transfers via Bitcoin and stablecoins. The timing follows strong crypto engagement in Block’s results. Last week, the company reported nearly $2b in Bitcoin revenue during the third quarter, part of $6.11b in total revenue, with net income of $461.5m and double-digit gross profit growth led by Cash App. For merchants, Lightning acceptance through Square and discovery through Bitcoin Map could bring incremental foot traffic, while stablecoins add a treasury-friendly settlement choice for those who prefer dollars. For consumers, the mix of Lightning and stablecoins offers two clear benefits, near-instant payments and predictable value. Paying with BTC becomes faster and cheaper, while sending a stablecoin avoids price swings when moving funds. With President Trump’s administration leaning into a friendlier posture on digital assets, the policy backdrop adds momentum. If volumes follow, Cash App’s new rails could widen the gap between crypto-curious wallets and truly crypto-native money apps.

Despite a sharp rally over the past year, some analysts argue that XRP remains undervalued compared to its expanding use in cross-border settlements and digital asset liquidity. One such commentator, known as Pumpius, recently outlined a detailed analysis exploring several possible valuation paths for XRP, depending on adoption milestones. His argument rests on the idea that XRP should not be viewed purely as a speculative asset, but as a functional component of international liquidity systems. He maintains that the token’s long-term price trajectory will be determined by transactional demand rather than investor sentiment. Ripple’s Banking License and Regulatory Expansion Pumpius’ first scenario centers on Ripple’s pursuit of a national trust bank charter in the United States, a process initiated in mid-2025. The proposed entity, based in New York, would serve as a limited-purpose trust bank specializing in custody and blockchain infrastructure services. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approves, Ripple could expand into regulated financial services, including stablecoin management, digital asset custody, and the tokenization of traditional instruments such as treasuries and bonds. According to the analysis, such approval could allow Ripple to handle settlement flows exceeding $500 billion annually, positioning XRP as a key liquidity vehicle within its ecosystem. Under these conditions, Pumpius projects that XRP could reach approximately $50 per token. The Corporate Treasury Integration Scenario A second projection focuses on large-scale corporate adoption. Pumpius suggests that if multinational corporations, such as Apple, Tesla, or Amazon, migrate portions of their treasury operations and supplier payments to the XRP Ledger, it could represent up to $5 trillion in annual transaction volume. While major corporations have not yet made such transitions, smaller firms have begun integrating XRP-related services into their operations. For instance, in 2025, VivoPower allocated $19 million of its capital raise to XRP staking through the Flare Network, and Trident Digital committed $500 million toward an XRP reserve.

Pumpius argues that if large-scale corporations adopt similar strategies, the token could potentially rise to $100, given its efficiency as a cross-currency settlement asset. Global Market Tokenization and Long-Term Outlook The final projection addresses XRP’s possible role in tokenizing traditional financial markets. Pumpius estimates that if assets such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds, worth over $100 trillion, were to migrate onto blockchain platforms like the XRP Ledger, liquidity demand would surge significantly. He asserts that such integration could drive XRP’s value above $100,000 per token, assuming it becomes the primary asset facilitating settlement across global capital markets. However, these figures are highly speculative. The analysis assumes extensive institutional and regulatory adoption that has yet to materialize. While the projections offer insight into the potential scale of blockchain-based finance, they remain theoretical. For now, XRP continues to operate as a bridge asset with expanding but still limited real-world usage, and any future valuation will depend on verifiable market adoption rather than projections.

Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming According to on-chain data, a Satoshi-era wallet that had not moved funds for 13 years transferred roughly 12,000 BTC — about $1.4 billion at current prices — in a set of transactions that landed on an exchange ledger. Whale Moves Stir Markets Reports have disclosed that the transfers came as Bitcoin hovered near a key price band. The coin fell about 2% after the activity, a quick reaction as traders guessed the funds might be put up for sale. 🚨 BREAKING SATOSHI ERA WHALE JUST SOLD 12,000 $BTC AFTER 13 YEARS OF HODLING. HE MADE A MIND BLOWING $1.4 BILLION – ONE OF THE MOST PROFITABLE ON-CHAIN SALES EVER. MASSIVE CRYPTO SELL-OFF INCOMING?? pic.twitter.com/NvCo9mamzT — 0xNobler (@CryptoNobler) November 13, 2025 Some market watchers warned that if larger sell orders hit exchanges, positions using borrowed money could be forced to close, which would make price moves sharper. Others said the market’s mood was more nervous than panicked; large transfers often spark anxiety even when no immediate sale follows. Technical Pressure Around Resistance Prominent analyst Ted commented that Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance around $104,000–$105,000. According to his view, holding above $105,000 could encourage renewed buying and push prices toward $107,000. If that fails, he warned that the next clear support sits near $100,000. Traders will watch order books and exchange flows closely in coming sessions to see whether the transferred coins are converted to fiat or simply shifted between wallets. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Based on reports from Chris Kuiper, CFA, the broader selling pressure appears driven more by long-term holders than by panicked sellers. Kuiper pointed to the share of Bitcoin that has remained inactive for one year or longer. That metric usually climbs in slow markets and drops sharply during fast rallies. This time, the decline has been gradual. The pattern suggests steady profit-taking over time rather than a sudden exodus. “Who is selling?” Is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding #bitcoin‘s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying (by ETPs, corporations etc.) I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers). But one data point that gives… pic.twitter.com/9PVoolrtwm — Chris Kuiper, CFA (@ChrisJKuiper) November 12, 2025 Market observers say gradual sales fit a maturing market where older holders lock in gains without trying to time a perfect top. Where past cycles saw abrupt moves from large dormant wallets, the current trend looks more measured. That does not rule out short-term volatility, but it changes how traders interpret big transfers. Related Reading: XRP Has Held Its Ground As Most Altcoins Fall, Market Observers Say For now, the market’s next moves will likely be set by a mix of on-chain flows and how price behaves around the $104,000–$105,000 area. Short-term traders will react to exchange data. Long-term investors may watch the inactive-supply metric and adjust plans more slowly. The transfer of 12,000 BTC is a big piece of information. How traders act on it will determine whether this becomes a headline event or just another moment in Bitcoin’s long rise.
