54365374,627020,1763074803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,List Of 16 Blockchains That Can Freeze Your Crypto On-Chain; Bybit Report,https://bitcoinist.com/blockchains-freeze-your-crypto/,"A new study by Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab has revealed that 16 major blockchain networks can freeze users’ crypto on-chain. This capability allows blockchain foundations or validators to step in and restrict transactions , thereby challenging the core principle of decentralization. While these freezing mechanisms are often employed to prevent hacks , and other security risks, they also raise concerns about control, transparency, and the potential reintroduction of centralized authority in decentralized networks . Bybit has disclosed that its research report is the first large-scale investigation to identify which blockchains possess freezing capabilities and how they operate. Bybit Exposes Blockchains With Crypto-Freezing Powers In a Press Release , Bybit released a new research, unveiling blockchains with fund freezing mechanisms and examining the impact these capabilities have in the DeFi space. The study analyzed a total of 166 different blockchain networks and found that 16 currently possess crypto freezing powers, while 19 could support similar functions in the future. To carry out this research, Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team utilized an AI agent to filter blockchains through in-depth manual code reviews, as most networks do not openly document these features. The research team categorized the freezing capabilities of the 16 blockchain networks into three main mechanisms: Hardcoded Freezing: It is embedded directly in blockchain’s core code, seen in networks like Chiliz (CHZ), Viction (VIC), XDC Network (XDC), Binance Coin (BNB), and VeChain (VET). Configuration-based Freezing: Controlled through validator or foundation settings, found in Harmony (ONE), Havah (HVH), SUPRA, APTOS (APT), EOS, Oasis (ROSE), WAX (WAXP), SUI, LINEA, and WAVES. On-chain Freezing: Executed via system-level contracts, present in blockchains like Huobi ECO Chain (HECO). Bybit has reported that fund freezing occurs when a blockchain locks a user’s assets without their consent . They highlight that these capabilities give these networks a level of control similar to that of traditional banks. The team has also emphasized that the research aims to provide greater transparency on blockchains while laying the groundwork for future studies and risk assessments in the digital asset industry. Real Cases Of Blockchain Fund Freezing Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team has also highlighted real-world incidents where crypto freezing was used to protect users and mitigate losses. Notably, in 2025, the SUI Foundation froze $162 million in assets following the Cetus Protocol hack in May, which resulted in a loss of over $220 million . Following this, Aptos added blacklisting functions to its network. In 2022, the BNB Chain used hardcoded blacklists to contain a $570 million bridge exploit, preventing the attacker from accessing the funds. Notably, in 2019, VeChain set an early precedent by freezing funds after a $6.1 million breach . Meanwhile, Cosmos’s modular account design may allow similar interventions in the future. These cases demonstrate how fund-freezing functions can act as emergency tools during large-scale security incidents . Bybit points out that although centralization remains a concern, many networks are implementing practical safety measures, even if they challenge the principle of complete decentralization, which is the core tenet of blockchain technology.",Crypto News|APTOS (APT|Binance Coin|BNB|BNB Chain|Bybit|Cetus Protocol|chiliZ|CHZ|Cosmos|crypto|crypto adoption|Crypto Market|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency market|DeFi|EOS|Havah|HECO|Huobi ECO Chain|HVH|Lazarus Security Lab|Linea|OASIS|ONE|Rose|SUI|SUI Foundation|SUPRA|VeChain|VET|VIC|Viction|WAVES|WAX|WAXP|XDC|XDC Network,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|SUI|XDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-13 23:00:03

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Upexi has authorized a $50 million share repurchase program, showing a broader shift toward capital preservation even as firms continue to hold massive Solana reserves on their balance sheets. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 Upexi Greenlights Share Buyback Amid 47% Stock Drop Upexi, a Solana-focused digital asset treasury company and consumer brands operator, said its board approved the buyback to provide “flexibility to purchase shares in the open market” depending on market conditions. The company emphasized that the program reflects confidence in its long-term strategy while maintaining a strong treasury position. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 The CEO, Allan Marshall, also added that the repurchase is a tool to enhance shareholder value and will be executed only when returns are attractive. The company’s treasury holds roughly 2 million SOL, valued at $283 million, representing about 0.35% of Solana’s total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Despite a recent decline in Solana’s price, from about $143 to $134, Upexi’s on-chain reserves remain among the largest institutional holdings in the ecosystem. The firm’s crypto-backed position has, however, been mirrored by sharp volatility in its own stock, which has fallen nearly 47% over the past month from a high of $6.50 to around $3.43. Source: Sol Treasury Upexi’s move comes amid a turbulent period for Solana-linked treasuries. According to institutional reserve data, the top 20 Solana treasury and ETF holders control 24 million SOL worth about $3.4 billion, or 3.5% of the total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Around half of these holdings are staked for yield at an average return of 7.7%, while the remainder remains liquid for balance sheet management. Forward Industries (FORD) leads with 6.8 million SOL valued near $966 million, followed by Solana Company (HSDT), DeFi Development Corp (DFDV), Sharps Technology (STSS), and Upexi rounding out the top five. These firms account for roughly 76% of all institutional Solana holdings, showing how companies use digital assets strategically. Solana Treasury Firms Trade Below Asset Value as Institutions Maintain Positions Market data shows that despite Solana’s price drop of nearly 7% in 24 hours, institutional positions have largely remained intact, with no major liquidations reported. Analysts view this stability as a sign of long-term confidence in Solana’s network fundamentals and its growing role as a blockchain for corporate treasuries. Public market valuations differ. Most Solana treasuries are currently trading at a discount to their net asset value (mNAV), indicating investor caution Upexi’s mNAV stands at 0.68, while Forward Industries sits at 0.82, suggesting cautious sentiment in equity markets despite strong on-chain balance sheets. The divergence between treasury value and stock performance has been a defining feature of the DAT sector. Upexi, which reported $66.7 million in net income in its most recent quarter, driven largely by $78 million in unrealized Solana gains, still faces investor skepticism tied to broader crypto market swings. Its stock previously surged more than 600% after revealing its Solana strategy earlier this year, but has since retraced sharply as digital assets weakened. Other treasuries act similarly. On November 6, Forward Industries authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program for flexibility amid volatility. Forward Industries — the Solana treasury company — has filed its Resale Prospectus Supplement with the @SECGov and authorized a $1B share repurchase program. #Solana $FORD https://t.co/kpG7BxEeb8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 4, 2025 Despite the short-term pullback in prices, the overall trend in corporate Solana holdings remains upward. The rise of Solana-focused treasuries marks an evolution from the Bitcoin treasury strategies that dominated earlier cycles. These firms use Solana not only as a store of value but also as a yield-generating asset through staking and validator participation. Companies like DFDV , which stakes its entire 2.2 million SOL holding, illustrate how treasury management in crypto is becoming more active and income-driven.

As the cryptocurrency prepares for its long-awaited Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) debut, the balance of XRP on major exchanges continues to decline. Analysts are warning that an impending supply crisis could spark a significant surge in the XRP price, which is currently more than 34% below its all-time high levels. XRP Supply Shortage To Trigger Parabolic Surge Amidst ongoing market volatility and whale capitulation, crypto market expert Arthur remains positive about XRP, drawing attention to a series of on-chain developments that could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward move. In his post on X social media, the analyst emphasized that an XRP could soon see a supply crisis, which may ignite its next price explosion. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Final Nail In The Coffin For XRP, What This Means According to recent chart data from CryptoQuant, XRP reserves on Binance have fallen to about 2.79 million tokens, marking a sustained decline that began in early 2025. The chart also shows that while XRP’s price has remained relatively stable between $2 and $3, the available supply on almost all major cryptocurrency exchanges has continued to decline drastically. Arthur has revealed that this signals a growing imbalance between supply and demand, which could set the foundation for a bullish move. Arthur has also referenced a prediction made by JPMorgan analysts, who estimated that between $4 to $8 billion could flow into the upcoming XRP Spot ETFs once they launch in the market. This projection indicates confidence in XRP’s future institutional demand and interest as a legitimate digital asset class. The analyst has suggested that increased ETF demand from institutions, combined with limited liquidity, could create a “perfect storm” for a price breakout of XRP. Additionally, the analyst has revealed that the XRP ETF could also see a surge in retail demand, contributing to its projected price appreciation. Currently, reports indicate that approval of XRP Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending. However, prominent analysts like Nate Geraci remain confident that these investment products will be launched soon. Binance XRP Reserve Data Shows Steady Losses Delving deeper into XRP’s supply on exchanges, CryptoQuant’s data shows that the cryptocurrency’s reserve on Binance is sitting at approximately 2.785 billion tokens as of November 12, 2025. Notably, this marks a decrease of over 10 million tokens from the previous day, when 2.795 billion XRP was recorded. Since the beginning of November, Binance’s XRP balance has been declining, hovering just above the 2.7 billion token threshold. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Earlier in October, reserves dipped to 2.74 billion tokens, one of the lowest levels recorded in almost a year. While balances briefly rebounded in mid-October, the latest data shows a renewed downward trajectory, suggesting that selling pressure may have eased and accumulation could be taking place off exchanges.

Whale Alert, the popular blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering movement of 5,969 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This enormous Bitcoin transfer, valued at approximately $596 million, represents one of the most significant movements we’ve seen recently. But what does this massive Bitcoin transfer really mean for the market? What This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Reveals When we see a Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude, several important questions arise. Why would someone move nearly 6,000 BTC in a single transaction? This substantial Bitcoin transfer could indicate several possibilities. The sender might be a large institution repositioning assets, a wealthy individual consolidating holdings, or even an exchange managing internal wallets. The fact that this Bitcoin transfer went to an unknown wallet adds another layer of mystery to the situation. Large Bitcoin transfers often signal significant market movements ahead. Historical data shows that massive movements frequently precede price volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every large Bitcoin transfer indicates immediate market impact. Sometimes these transactions represent routine portfolio management or security measures. Why Should You Care About This Bitcoin Transfer? You might wonder why a single Bitcoin transfer matters to the average investor. The answer lies in market psychology and liquidity. When whales make moves this substantial, they can influence: Market sentiment – Large movements often trigger speculation Price discovery – Significant transfers can affect supply dynamics Investor confidence – Whale activity signals institutional interest Trading volume – Large movements increase overall market activity This particular Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase stands out because of its sheer size and timing. The movement from a known exchange to an unknown wallet suggests the assets are being moved into cold storage or private custody. This Bitcoin transfer pattern often indicates long-term holding intentions rather than immediate selling pressure. Understanding the Impact of Large Bitcoin Transfers Every significant Bitcoin transfer tells a story about market dynamics. The $596 million valuation of this transaction highlights Bitcoin’s continued dominance in the cryptocurrency space. Such substantial movements demonstrate that major players remain actively involved in the ecosystem. This Bitcoin transfer also underscores the importance of transparency in blockchain transactions. Thanks to services like Whale Alert, we can track these movements in real-time. However, the anonymous nature of the receiving wallet reminds us that privacy remains a key feature of cryptocurrency transactions. What This Bitcoin Transfer Means for Future Price Action Analyzing this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at historical patterns. Large movements to unknown wallets have often preceded: Price consolidation periods Increased institutional accumulation Reduced exchange liquidity Long-term bullish sentiment The timing of this Bitcoin transfer coincides with broader market developments that could influence future price trajectories. While we cannot predict exact outcomes, the movement of nearly 6,000 BTC certainly warrants attention from serious market participants. Key Takeaways From This Monumental Bitcoin Movement This substantial Bitcoin transfer serves as a powerful reminder of several crucial market realities. First, institutional-sized movements continue to shape the cryptocurrency landscape. Second, the transparency of blockchain technology allows us to monitor these developments in real-time. Finally, the movement from exchange to private wallet suggests confidence in long-term value preservation. The $596 million Bitcoin transfer represents more than just numbers on a screen. It demonstrates the maturing infrastructure that supports large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and the growing sophistication of market participants. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect to see more of these significant Bitcoin transfers that shape market dynamics and investor strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale transfer? A Bitcoin whale transfer refers to large movements of Bitcoin, typically involving thousands of coins, usually executed by wealthy individuals or institutions known as ‘whales’ in cryptocurrency terminology. Why do large Bitcoin transfers matter? Large Bitcoin transfers matter because they can signal institutional moves, affect market liquidity, influence price sentiment, and indicate accumulation or distribution patterns among major holders. How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? You can track large Bitcoin transfers using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or monitoring services like Whale Alert that specifically report significant cryptocurrency movements. Does moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets affect price? Moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets often indicates long-term holding intentions, which can reduce immediate selling pressure and potentially support price stability or future appreciation. What does a transfer from Coinbase usually mean? A transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet typically suggests assets are moving into private custody for long-term storage rather than immediate trading purposes.

With Bitcoin down by 7% in a month, and with Ethereum down by 11%, traders may be looking for alternatives to boost their portfolios, and one such alternative is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has been enjoying a successful presale. It’s planning to launch a market-first mine-to-earn platform, enabling holders to mine cryptocurrencies without having to invest in expensive hardware. This feature distinguishes it from most other new meme coins, which is why it could rally strongly once it lists in the next few weeks. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 13 November The past few weeks have been rough for the cryptocurrency market, with fears related to an AI-led bubble causing investors to pull funds out of major tokens. This has impacted most cryptocurrencies, even if fundamentals remain generally strong, and the situation may not pick up decisively until the stock market corrects. However, even with average prices remaining subdued, traders may be able to buck the trend by looking to new and up-and-coming coins, with PEPENODE being one of the most promising new tokens around right now. It has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing presale, providing a clear sign of how popular it could become once it launches. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 The main reason for its early success is that it’s offering something no other token in the market is currently offering, which is a mine-to-earn platform. As this term suggests, the platform provides users with the opportunity to earn money from mining, yet in PEPENODE’s case, it doesn’t require the use of expensive mining equipment. Instead, users can build their own virtual mining rigs, using the PEPENODE token itself to acquire and run more mining nodes. The more mining nodes they own, the more they earn from mining. The protocol will pay out rewards in external tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, with more coins coming at later dates. This means that there could be substantial demand for PEPENODE, so as to grow mining rigs. Also, multiplying demand will be the fact that holders can stake the token, with the current yield at 600% APY. How to Buy PEPENODE Early These features mean that PEPENODE is one of the most bullish new tokens in the market, making it arguably the best new meme coin to buy now, or at least one of the best. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with owners able to claim their tokens as soon as its presale ends. Investors can join this sale by going to the PEPENODE website, where the token is currently selling for $0.0011454. This price will rise again tomorrow, so traders wanting to lock in the biggest possible returns should act now. And given the coin’s growing popularity, it could climb well above this price once it launches, especially if it gains listings from big exchanges.

This monumental achievement represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption and investor confidence. What Does This BTC Price Milestone Mean for Investors? The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 signals several important developments. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major corporations and investment funds increase their Bitcoin exposure. Second, retail investor interest typically follows these landmark price movements. However, experienced traders recommend maintaining a balanced portfolio approach despite the excitement. Market analysts point to several factors driving this impressive BTC price performance: Increased institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs Growing global adoption as a hedge against inflation Positive regulatory developments in key markets Limited supply meeting expanding demand How Sustainable Is This Current BTC Price Level? While the current BTC price achievement generates excitement, investors should consider market volatility. Cryptocurrency markets historically experience significant price swings. Therefore, proper risk management remains crucial for all market participants. The technical analysis perspective suggests strong support levels have formed around previous resistance zones. Moreover, trading volume has increased substantially during this upward movement, indicating genuine market participation rather than artificial price pumping. What Should New Investors Know About BTC Price Movements? For newcomers attracted by the impressive BTC price performance, understanding basic cryptocurrency principles proves essential. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls its value. The price reflects collective market sentiment and fundamental adoption metrics. Key considerations for new investors include: Understanding wallet security and storage options Researching reputable exchanges for trading Learning about dollar-cost averaging strategies Recognizing the difference between long-term holding and active trading Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of BTC Price The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 opens new psychological territory for market participants. Historical patterns suggest that after breaking major resistance levels, Bitcoin often experiences consolidation periods followed by either continued upward momentum or corrective phases. Market sentiment appears overwhelmingly positive, though seasoned investors caution against excessive euphoria. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, with adoption metrics continuing to show healthy growth across both institutional and retail segments. Frequently Asked Questions What caused BTC price to surge past $100,000? The price movement resulted from combined factors including institutional investment flows, positive regulatory developments, and increasing global adoption as a digital store of value. Should I invest in Bitcoin at current price levels? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Canary Capital will be the first asset management firm to get an XRP spot ETF approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund will trade under the ticker symbol XRPC. The official listing notice for $XRPC has arrived from Nasdaq. Looks like tomorrow is ON for the launch. pic.twitter.com/zvJ8q3SwpS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 12, 2025 A hybrid XRP ETF managed by REX-Osprey that partially invests in futures has attracted $131 million in assets just a few months after its launch. This reflects Wall Street’s growing appetite for the token. Just as it happened with the first Solana 100% spot ETF launched by Bitwise recently, Canary’s ETF could rapidly surpass its predecessor as this vehicle is 100% backed by XRP reserves. Could this ETF approval mark the beginning of XRP’s next leg up? XRP Price Prediction: Eyes Set at $5 as Institutions Embrace XRP XRP found support at $2.10 recently, following the hawkish comments made by the head of the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago. XRP has bounced off a key support just as the U.S. government shutdown ends, reigniting hopes for a stronger recovery across the crypto market. If the token breaks above the 200-day EMA, it could accelerate toward $3 — a move that would confirm a breakout from the current parabolic setup. With institutional adoption rising, XRP’s long-term outlook remains strong. A surge to $5 looks achievable in the months ahead. Some ultra-bullish projections still point to a $100 target eventually, which would imply a $6 trillion market cap. That’s a stretch for now, but the narrative is gaining steam among believers. Meanwhile, high-upside presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are attracting early investors hoping to capture growth faster. This project reimagines mining by letting anyone earn meme coins through virtual rigs — no hardware required. Over $2 million has already poured into the presale, and the window to get in early is closing fast. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Fun and Hassle-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) enables players to mine meme coins easily, without the need to invest thousands of dollars in hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) transforms crypto mining into a virtual game where players compete to earn real meme coin rewards. Using $PEPENODE tokens, gamers can launch powerful virtual servers, deploy as many rigs as they like, and climb the leaderboard by mining more than their rivals. Top performers will score exclusive airdrops of trending tokens like Bonk ($BONK), along with other premium prizes. To drive value, the game burns up to 70% of the tokens spent on rig upgrades, creating constant deflation as gameplay scales. With $2.1 million raised in just weeks, many consider $PEPENODE as one of the most promising contenders in this meme coin cycle. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can complete the transaction by swapping tokens like USDT or ETH, or simply using a bank card for instant access.

Merz’s announcement is the latest in a growing line of European countries dumping Chinese tech and cutting ties with manufacturers they evaluate to be risks. Germany’s digital sovereignty and national security concerns Merz, in a business conference in Berlin on Thursday, emphasized that Chinese components have no place in next-generation networks. “We won’t allow any components from China in the 6G network,” the German Chancellor said. Germany took a firm stance to exclude Huawei Technologies and other Chinese suppliers from its future communication networks due to concerns about potential security vulnerabilities linked to Huawei equipment. German authorities fear that the Chinese government’s influence over the tech manufacturer potentially creates an opening for espionage within critical telecoms infrastructure, a fear that has been echoed by other Western countries. By banning Huawei from 6G networks, Germany aims to eliminate future risks. Merz said he’d have a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron at an upcoming summit on digital sovereignty. “We’ll discuss with industry what we can do, not only to make ourselves independent from China, but also for example independent from the USA, independent from the big tech companies.” Major operators like Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica will need to adapt new strategies and find alternative suppliers, primarily European technology firms. Europe pushes out Chinese tech Germany’s decision to exclude Huawei from its 6G networks mirrors similar moves by other European countries as the bloc has been intensifying efforts to phase out Huawei and ZTE equipment from member state networks amid shared concerns about Chinese state influence and cybersecurity threats. Germany first made moves to remove Huawei equipment from core network components in 2024. Now, the country has made a stance to totally exclude Huawei and other Chinese suppliers from its future 6G network. Finland and other EU countries have recently announced plans or taken steps to ban Huawei for future network development. Beyond Europe, the US and several other countries have long restricted Huawei’s role in critical telecom projects, citing national security. Germany’s decision is expected to influence supply chains and investment decisions in the telecom market, potentially increasing costs and slowing deployment timelines during the transition away from Huawei. However, Merz notes that total independence from Chinese technology is not possible. “We can’t do that”. He also cautioned business executives to understand the risks of doing business with China, adding that Germany will not always be able to protect them.

After briefly dipping to around $100,700 on Wednesday, BTC remains down roughly 3.5% on the weekly candle. The move is part of a wider trend that has seen long-term holders unload more than 815,000 BTC over the past month. That level of selling has raised alarms among analysts who warn that lower liquidity pockets could drive Bitcoin toward the June 2025 lows near $98,000 if volatility accelerates. The broader market is now watching how Bitcoin behaves around the critical $100,000 region, which has repeatedly been tested throughout the year. Liquidity Mapping Shows Market Vulnerability Crypto analysts following liquidity flow patterns say that Bitcoin’s current range is showing clear pockets of weakness. Trader Daan Crypto noted that a “large cluster of liquidity sits below the local lows at $98,000–$100,000,” suggesting that if selling pressure increases, the market may gravitate toward that zone. He also pointed to upside liquidity targets near $108,000 and $112,000 but stressed that only the first target is currently within realistic reach. According to his assessment, whichever liquidity band breaks first could determine whether Bitcoin enters a sharp short squeeze or a capitulation-style flush. This view is backed by several futures traders who say BTC is increasingly likely to revisit the lower end of its range. Futures trader Byzantine General stated that Bitcoin “is likely to sweep the lows around $98,000,” citing repeated failures to break higher. Data from CoinGlass supports this bearish tilt, showing nearly $1.3 billion in cumulative long leveraged liquidity concentrated around $98,000. That figure has risen sharply since the beginning of the week, indicating that traders have layered bids just below current levels. Repeated Support Retests Signal Structural Weakness One of the more worrying indicators for market analysts is the consistent retesting of support between $102,000 and $100,000. Bitcoin has now returned to that region four separate times since May 2025. Each retest weakens buyers’ conviction and reduces the number of resting bids available to defend the support line. Analyst UBCrypto said the latest bounce resembled a failed breakout attempt and added that the region is “not a level worth buying into” until Bitcoin shows a confirmed shift in momentum. He argued that entering positions slightly higher is preferable if it means avoiding a potential breakdown. Despite this caution, long-heavy positioning remains dominant among retail traders. Hyblock Capital data shows that 68.9% of BTC orders on Binance still lean long, suggesting many believe the $100,000 level will hold. However, the daily and weekly charts both show softening structure at higher time frames. This has increased expectations that Bitcoin may eventually test the liquidity pool near $98,000 before the market finds a stronger footing. Deeper order book support appears to sit just above Bitcoin’s current price, but analysts warn that the market could still be pulled into lower liquidity areas if sentiment deteriorates. If selling from long-term holders continues and short-term traders remain overleveraged, Bitcoin may still face additional downside pressure before recovery attempts strengthen.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-13 23:39:57

At Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025, top VCs revealed they’re operating in what Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures calls a ‘funky time’ – where companies can leap from zero to $100 million in revenue within a single year. Why Traditional Venture Capital Rules No Longer Apply to AI Startups The unprecedented speed of AI innovation has forced venture capital firms to completely rethink their investment strategies. According to Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, the old metrics and timelines have become obsolete. ‘It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients,’ she explained during her keynote address. The rapid scaling capabilities of AI companies mean that investors must evaluate opportunities through an entirely new lens. The New Investment Strategy for AI Companies VCs are now prioritizing factors that were previously secondary considerations. Lee’s research reveals that Series A investors are measuring: Data generation capabilities and proprietary datasets Strength of competitive moats and technical barriers Founders’ track records and technical expertise Product depth and innovation velocity Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures emphasized that even startups achieving rapid growth to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding, indicating how dramatically the investment game has changed. The Critical Importance of Go-to-Market Strategy One of the most significant shifts in venture capital thinking revolves around go-to-market execution. McNeill stated that ‘the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech – they have the best go-to-market.’ This perspective highlights how investors are prioritizing customer acquisition and retention capabilities alongside technical innovation. Traditional VC Focus New AI Startup Focus Technology differentiation Go-to-market execution Long-term revenue projections Immediate revenue velocity Market size analysis Data generation capabilities Team experience Founder technical depth Unprecedented Revenue Growth Expectations The benchmark for success has been radically reset in the AI sector. Where previously startups might have celebrated reaching $10 million in annual revenue within five years, AI companies are now expected to achieve $100 million in revenue within twelve months. This accelerated timeline creates both enormous opportunity and intense pressure for founders and investors alike. Are We Witnessing the Dawn of a New Investment Era? Despite the high stakes and rapid pace, panelists agreed that the AI industry remains in its infancy. Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures noted that ‘there are no clear, outright winners, even in LLMs. There are competitors nipping at their heels.’ This suggests that the current investment frenzy represents just the beginning of a much larger transformation in how venture capital approaches technological disruption. FAQs What are the key factors VCs now consider for AI startup investments? VCs prioritize data generation, competitive moats, founder expertise, and go-to-market strategy over traditional metrics. How has revenue growth expectations changed for AI startups? Companies are now expected to reach $100 million in revenue within a year, compared to traditional timelines of 5+ years for similar milestones. What companies were mentioned in the Bitcoin World Disrupt discussion? The panel featured insights from Cowboy Ventures , DVx Ventures , and Kindred Ventures , with references to OpenAI and Anthropic as benchmarks for product development velocity. Who are the key investors driving this change? Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures, and Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures are among the thought leaders reshaping AI investment strategies. The venture capital industry’s radical transformation in response to AI startups represents more than just a temporary trend – it signals a fundamental restructuring of how innovation gets funded and scaled. As investors continue to adapt their strategies to this new reality, the companies that master both technological innovation and rapid market execution will define the next generation of industry leaders.

The updated buyback allocation forms part of a broader strategy to enhance value capture, staking yield, and governance participation, directly linking tokenholder incentives to platform performance. dYdX votes to approve proposal to triple token buyback rate. Source: Mintscan dYdX approves upgrade for buyback proposal The proposal , numbered #313, was passed by 59.38% of community voters on November 13, and it marks one of the most aggressive revenue-to-buyback ratios among major decentralized protocols. In the past, only 25% of net protocol fees were allocated to DYDX repurchases, with the remainder directed toward operational and treasury functions. The new move is expected to triple the buying pressure on the price. As part of the newly passed framework, the protocol committed three-quarters of its fee revenue directly to buying and staking DYDX , while 5% will be sent to the Treasury SubDAO and 5% to the MegaVault. “Starting today, 75% of protocol fees will be used to buy back DYDX on the open market,” the dYdX foundation confirmed on X. dYdX first launched its buyback mechanism in March 2025, coinciding with the v4 mainnet migration and a planned reduction in emissions by June 2025. The new buyback policy takes effect immediately, and what will naturally follow is a significant reduction in the token’s circulating supply, which could instantly push the DYDX price into an upside trajectory. dYdX prepares for its US debut The decision to update its revenue-to-buyback ratios follows dYdX’s rapid growth across its standalone Cosmos-based chain, where cumulative trading volume recently surpassed $1.5 trillion. It also comes as the exchange gets ready for its US market debut later this year and continues its campaign to remove maker and taker fees on select perpetual pairs to boost liquidity depth. The derivatives-focused exchange, which cuts out the middleman and allows users to transact directly on a blockchain network, was previously not available to American users. It recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, and Eddie Zhang, the company’s president, has revealed plans to expand its offerings by bringing spot trading on Solana and other linked cryptocurrencies to the US by the end of the year. “It’s very important for us as a platform to have something available in the United States, because I think it represents, hopefully, the direction we’re trying to move in,” Zhang said. The company’s decision to enter the US market may be linked to the friendly regulatory environment created by President Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector this year. That embrace has led to the dismissal of several lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets. Upon entering the US, dYdX will slash its trading fees by as much as half “across the board,” to between 50 and 65 basis points, Zhang said. According to him, perpetual contracts will not be available in the US, but it is not entirely off the table and may become a possibility if US regulators eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to be able to offer those products. Already, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have indicated they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the US, so that possibility continues to grow by the day.

The round also included a mix of existing investors, such as Accel, and new backers, including Nvidia and Alphabet’s Google. Cursor’s surge in valuation comes after it raised $900 million in June at a $9.9 billion valuation . The June round saw participation from Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Accel. Per Reuters, the company shared that it has now surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, with sales-led revenue growing 100-fold since the beginning of 2025. Cursor’s code-generation boom drives investor interest Cursor builds software that autonomously generates and completes code, allowing developers to write applications faster and with fewer errors, and the technology has been touted to replace traditional software development. The company’s tools are part of a growing segment of AI known as code generation. Investors see vast commercial potential in this space, as enterprises seek to automate routine programming tasks and accelerate the development of digital products, making tools like Cursor attractive. The new funding round positions Cursor as one of the highest-valued startups in the code-generation market, far outpacing peers such as Replit, which reached a $3 billion valuation in September after raising $250 million. It now joins a short list of AI companies with over $10 billion valuation. Rising valuations meet rising concerns The near-tripling of Cursor’s valuation in such a short period comes amid an increase in venture funding for AI companies. According to reports, global venture capital investment rose 38% year-on-year in the third quarter to $97 billion, with about half of that total flowing into AI-related businesses, according to data from Crunchbase. Investors have been particularly drawn to companies that can demonstrate tangible revenue growth, something Cursor seems to be doing well. By crossing the $1 billion annualized revenue threshold, it joins a small group of AI startups claiming to have achieved substantial commercial traction at scale. However, the frenetic pace of fundraising and valuations of AI companies has led to debates about its long-term market, with some experts, investors, and industry heavyweights like Jeff Bezos predicting that the fate that met the dot-com boom may befall it as well. However, Bezos reportedly stated that irrespective of what happens later in the sector, it’s certain that there will be winners as well as losers, and the society will still benefit from the inventions that will come out of the ‘AI bubble.’ Investors are also spreading their bets to ensure that they find themselves on the winning sides as much as possible. Concerns about overheating went up this week after Japan’s SoftBank Group sold its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia, a move some analysts interpreted as a signal that even the sector’s most bullish investors are beginning to take profits. A defining moment for AI development Founded by a team of former MIT engineers under the umbrella of parent company Anysphere, Cursor has quickly become one of Silicon Valley’s breakout AI success stories. OpenAI was in talks with Cursor’s parent company to acquire the platform, but the deal fell through. The makers of ChatGPT also tried to acquire Windsurf, another code-generation startup, but also left the deal to launch its own platform called Codex. Windsurf itself was later acquired by AI startup Cognition. Anthropic’s Claude Code is also in the picture, and it has reportedly made about $500 million since it debuted this year. So, despite its rapid growth, Cursor faces formidable challenges. Apart from OpenAI and Anthropic, tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are heavily investing in similar AI-assisted development tools. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The guidance under development is expected to help banks and their partners understand how tokenized deposits fit into the existing insurance structure. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is preparing new guidance to help banks understand how deposit insurance should work when deposits are moved onto blockchain or other distributed-ledger systems. FDIC open to integrating blockchain into traditional banking Acting Chair Travis Hill confirmed the plan during an appearance at a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conference. He stated that the agency wants to give financial institutions clearer rules as they integrate digital asset technology into their systems. Hill strongly believes that deposits should not lose their legal status simply because they move from traditional banking platforms into a tokenized form. As he puts it, “a deposit is a deposit.” A tokenized deposit is usually a digital coin that acts as a claim on real funds held by a bank. This concept is different from stablecoins, which are digital tokens that are typically pegged to a fiat currency but are not automatically connected to federally insured deposit accounts. With banks and other financial firms experimenting with blockchain technology, regulators have been under pressure to clarify how existing customer protections like deposit insurance apply in these new environments. Many fintech companies are not banks, so they are not directly covered by FDIC insurance . To offer protection to their customers, they usually partner with FDIC-insured banks, which can make the accounts eligible for pass-through insurance. But this system can fail if the fintech goes out of business or if the way customer accounts are set up is unclear. This has raised concerns about who must cover customer losses when a third-party platform collapses. Rising consumer protection concerns The rise of fintech platforms has caused customers to assume that their digital wallets or app-based accounts are insured, even when the platform itself is not a bank. Pass-through insurance can apply only when certain conditions are met, and regulators have shared concerns about some fintechs that do not communicate these conditions clearly. This concern has grown as more fintech firms explore ways to offer tokenized financial products or integrate blockchain technology into their services. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), a central pillar of the U.S. financial system, designed to protect depositors when banks fail, saw its reserve ratio fall below the level required by law after 2020. The fund is financed mainly by quarterly fees paid by insured banks, known as assessments. The reserve decline after 2020 was due to the surge in deposits across the banking system during the pandemic. To address this, the FDIC has been rebuilding the fund over the past few years. The agency projected earlier this year that the DIF would reach its legal target ratio by the end of 2025, about three years earlier than previously expected.

The ruling , made on Thursday, is a significant development in calculating what could be a substantial payout, potentially as much as £1.2 billion. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) refused Apple permission to appeal its ruling, which found that the tech giant charged “modest levels of commission” and stifled competition on its iOS App Store. However, the tech giant still has one final route of appeal: it can go to the Court of Appeal. The case is one of the largest legal challenges the iPhone maker faces in Europe, as scrutiny mounts worldwide over how the company operates its digital marketplace. Tribunal blocks Apple’s appeal attempt Last month, the CAT found that Apple had engaged in anticompetitive behaviour by creating a competitive advantage in the iOS app distribution market. The panel found it “excessive and unfair” because it refers to Apple charging its usual 30% cut on in-app transactions. The ruling concluded that the fare commission should have been only about 17.5%. Developers were overcharged for nearly nine years. The tribunal also found that developers had passed on half the cost of those inflated fees to consumers, thereby effectively charging millions of British users higher prices for apps and in-app services. On Thursday, the CAT refused Apple’s application to appeal the ruling, stating that Apple had not crossed the threshold required for reconsideration. Apple’s lawyers then requested a 21-day extension to file new papers with the Court of Appeal. The tribunal’s judgment that “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy” also disregarded the value Apple says it offers developers as well as consumers, the company said. The case was brought by Rachael Kent, a British academic, on behalf of approximately 20 million UK iPhone and iPad users. Her lawyers had calculated damages from October 2015 until February 2024, along with interest, at £1.2 billion. Kent said the case has been “a marathon, not a sprint,” but emphasized that last week’s ruling gets consumers “one step closer to seeing money rightfully put back into their pockets. That opens the way for the damages phase to proceed, with the CAT expected to plan additional hearings on how compensation is to be distributed. It is likely to be a process that will take months. Regulatory scrutiny of Apple increases around the world The UK case comes as the iPhone maker faces mounting pressure over its control of app distribution and in-app payments across Europe and the U.S. European regulators have also targeted the tech firm, utilizing new rules designed to curb the power of big tech platforms. In recent years, Apple has been forced to change App Store policies in the Netherlands, South Korea, and across the broader EU bloc. The UK judgment adds to a series of international rulings against the company, which have forced it to reduce fees or allow access for rival payment systems. Industry analysts say the CAT decision could bolster other lawsuits that are in progress against Apple, not only in Europe but also elsewhere. Apple now has a short period in which to request permission directly to appeal its case to the Court of Appeal.

54367116,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=853314,1763078423,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,SUI Silent Comeback: The Underdog Preparing For A $20 Charge,https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-preparing-for-a-20-charge/,"In a latest update, BeLaunch posed the high-stakes question: Could SUI really reach $20 in the next bull cycle? After getting hit hard during the October 10 flash crash, SUI is starting to show strength again, and the charts are now painting a very interesting picture that could signal the beginning of a major turnaround. Potential Scenarios For SUI BeLaunch recently outlined two possible scenarios for SUI’s next move, each with distinct probabilities and implications. According to the analysis, the token is currently at a critical juncture, where its next few moves could determine the broader market‘s direction. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? In the primary scenario, which carries an 8/10 probability, SUI is testing a crucial breakout above the red dashed resistance line. Wave (2) appears to have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3) — typically one of the most impulsive moves in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout at this level could propel SUI toward new highs. The alternative scenario, rated at a 3/10 probability, suggests that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave near the $5.37 region before extending into another corrective phase (Alt Y). Although less likely, BeLaunch noted that traders should still monitor this possibility closely. Technical and On-Chain Alignment Suggests Market Bottom Nearing According to BeLaunch, on-chain fundamentals for SUI are showing early signs of recovery, despite broader market attention remaining elsewhere. The data reveals that Total Value Locked (TVL) has been holding firm around $1.4 billion, though the analyst notes that a move above the $2 billion threshold would mark a more decisive shift in momentum. At the same time, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been climbing gradually, now sitting near 900,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says SUI Price Could Be Heading To $9: 4 Reasons Why BeLaunch noted that despite this encouraging on-chain behavior, SUI’s price remains lagging, a common indicator of a classic accumulation phase. During such periods, investors often underestimate the asset’s underlying strength while long-term players quietly position themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Historically, SUI has shown a tendency to rally within two to four weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin trending upward. If this pattern repeats, it could signal that SUI is currently in a quiet accumulation window before a stronger move to the upside. This alignment between historical behavior and present data gives a subtle yet compelling bullish undertone. Overall, BeLaunch emphasized that the technical and on-chain setup appears robust. Fundamentals are stabilizing, momentum indicators are shifting, and WaveTrend signals are flashing a bottom below 40. If the current trend persists, SUI could soon emerge from consolidation and enter a new bullish phase.

The draft legislation would establish a clear regime for digital-asset spot markets and limit the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering significant implications for the broader crypto industry. Defining Digital Commodities and Oversight Led by Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), the proposed discussion draft aims to grant the CFTC authority over digital-commodity spot markets, while limiting the SEC’s oversight to securities. Under this model, what are currently labelled “major cryptocurrencies” could be explicitly classified as commodities. The draft outlines a framework for trading platforms and intermediaries to register with the CFTC, and introduces protections such as customer-fund segregation, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on affiliated trading. Implications for XRP and the Ripple Ecosystem If enacted, the legislation would have direct relevance to Ripple and its XRP token, which were central to the company’s regulatory dispute with the SEC. Classifying XRP as a commodity would anchor its legal treatment under the Commodity Exchange Act, rather than securities laws. This may ease listing decisions for U.S. exchanges, reduce regulatory uncertainty around institutional participation, and support products such as managed-account or prime-brokerage offerings. Furthermore, the draft’s provisions for self-custody and non-custodial infrastructure suggest that software developers and node operators would not automatically be regulated as financial institutions, a detail that provides clarity for those building on the XRPL ecosystem. The legislation arrives at a moment of important market dynamics. A recent report by CoinShares noted that investment products focused on digital assets recorded over $1 billion in outflows last week. In contrast, XRP was one of the few assets to register $28.2 million in inflows, bucking the broader trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, as trading venues prepare for the launch of spot XRP ETFs and regulatory agencies resume full operations following the U.S. government shutdown , the timing of legislative clarity could be pivotal. The bill, however, remains at the discussion-draft stage and will require negotiation, amendment, and passage before becoming law. Why This Development Matters For market participants, the draft bill signals a major step toward legally defining and stabilizing the regulatory environment for digital assets. By clarifying that tokens such as XRP may fall under commodity rather than securities classification, the legislation could reduce legal risk for issuers, exchanges, and institutional investors. This regulatory clarity can increase confidence in listing decisions, ease the creation of new investment products, and mark a shift toward more structured oversight. For Ripple and its token ecosystem, the draft presents a scenario in which its long-standing position becomes codified in federal law, a transition from legal dispute toward potential legislative alignment. Although the draft represents considerable progress, it is not yet final. The document is still labelled a “discussion draft,” meaning it is subject to change and requires additional stakeholder feedback, committee mark-ups, and eventual full-chamber votes. The pace of passage will depend on the broader legislative calendar, agency readiness, and political dynamics surrounding digital-asset regulation. Observers believe that if the bill advances, the combined effect of institutional inflows, ETF launches, and regulatory certainty could significantly alter the trajectory for XRP and similar assets.

54367344,627185,1763078458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54367344.jpeg,"If The Dogecoin Price Successfully Breaks This Zone, Then Prepare For A Strong Upward Push",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-upward-push/,"The Dogecoin price has spent the past few days attempting to recover from a decline that has affected the entire industry for weeks, shifting from a clear downtrend earlier in the month into a more constructive structure. After dipping below the $0.16 region, buyers began stepping back in to form a series of higher lows and nudging the price into a tighter range between $0.17 and $0.186. The latest candles show Dogecoin trading just beneath a resistance band around $0.186, which is the same zone that capped upside attempts throughout the week. This is where the discussion from BitGuru’s technical outlook comes in, supported by the chart he shared on the social media platform X. Dogecoin Price Trying To Rebound From Downtrend The Dogecoin price is starting to exhibit some sort of push off the early-month lows that saw it reach into the mid-$0.15 region. Between November 5 and 6, Dogecoin was consolidating around this region to create what looks like a bullish beauty, as shown in the price chart below. The chart further shows how the Dogecoin price eventually broke out of this descending structure on November 7 to push toward the mid-$0.18 region. This marked the first sign that momentum was shifting away from sellers, and this might set a sustained advance that changes the tone of Dogecoin’s price action. That transition from lower highs into a more aggressive upward slope set the foundation for the rebound now taking shape. However, Dogecoin is now pressing against an overhead resistance zone around $0.186 that first arose as a result of a downtrend order block on November 2. Technical analysis shows that this price level is now the most important barrier to break. The chart shows a tight cluster of candles forming just beneath this level, with small intraday rejections but no meaningful breakdowns. Price action in this region carries a clear message: bulls are attempting to reclaim control, and the structure is beginning to resemble a pre-breakout consolidation. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: BitGuru On X A Break Above This Zone Could Set Off Strong Rally The critical question now for Dogecoin’s short-term technical outlook is whether it can push cleanly above the resistance at $0.186. BitGuru’s outlook frames this zone as the key decision point. A strong break above it would open the door for continuation, setting the Dogecoin price up for the next impulsive leg higher above $0.2. Failure to break through would not necessarily derail the developing bullish structure, but it could invite a short-lived pullback before another attempt at an upward move. Everything now depends on how Dogecoin behaves at this price resistance, as momentum is clearly building beneath it and a decisive breakout would shift the entire short-term outlook upward. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1764, up by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 00:00:58

Today marks a pivotal moment as Bitcoin options worth $4.1 billion are set to expire, potentially triggering significant price movements and opportunities for traders. What Are Bitcoin Options and Why Do They Matter? Bitcoin options are financial contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell BTC at a set price by a specific date. These Bitcoin options act as hedging tools or speculative instruments, influencing market sentiment. When large volumes expire, like today’s $4.1 billion, they can cause volatility as traders adjust positions. Data from Deribit shows a put/call ratio of 0.62, indicating more call options than puts. This suggests bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $105,000, a level where most options would expire worthless, potentially stabilizing prices. How Could This Bitcoin Options Expiry Affect Prices? Major Bitcoin options expiries often lead to short-term price swings. Here’s what to watch for: Increased volatility as traders close or roll over positions Potential price pressure near the max pain level of $105,000 Liquidity shifts influencing Bitcoin’s immediate direction Moreover, Ethereum options worth $750 million expire simultaneously. Their put/call ratio of 0.64 and max pain at $3,500 could amplify overall market effects. Therefore, monitoring both assets is crucial. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Use? To navigate this event, consider these strategies. First, assess your risk tolerance, as Bitcoin options expiry often spikes volatility. Second, watch key support and resistance levels, like the $105,000 max pain point. Finally, diversify to mitigate sudden moves. Historical data shows that post-expiry, markets frequently stabilize. Thus, long-term investors might view dips as buying opportunities. However, always use stop-loss orders to protect gains. Conclusion: Seize the Moment in Crypto Markets In summary, today’s Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event with $4.1 billion at stake. By understanding the mechanics and staying informed, you can turn potential chaos into calculated advantage. Embrace the volatility, but prioritize risk management to thrive. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiry? It’s when options contracts mature, requiring holders to exercise or let them expire, often affecting prices. How does the put/call ratio influence markets? A ratio below 1, like 0.62, signals more calls, hinting at bullish expectations among traders. What is max pain price in options? It’s the price where most options expire worthless, potentially reducing volatility post-expiry. Should I trade during options expiry? Only if experienced, as high volatility can lead to quick gains or losses; beginners should observe. Do Ethereum options expiries impact Bitcoin? Yes, correlated markets mean large ETH events can influence BTC through overall sentiment shifts. Where can I track options data? Platforms like Deribit provide real-time updates on volumes, ratios, and expiry details. Found this guide helpful?

But that hasn’t stopped everyone from trying to piece together what the hell’s really going on. This new round is supposedly an add-on to the $10 billion raise previously reported back in September, when insiders said xAI was already sitting on a $200 billion valuation. If true, that would shove the AI startup right alongside other massive players like Anthropic and OpenAI, both of which have recently pulled in eye-watering sums in their quest to dominate the foundational model arms race. xAI struggles with Tesla connections, power struggles, and that Memphis mess CNBC’s report had claimed that the new cash was gonna be earmarked for the usual suspects: GPUs. A huge portion of that alleged $15 billion is said to be going straight into the pockets of chipmakers, to buy up the graphic processing units needed to fuel xAI’s data-thirsty algorithms, you know, just like every other nerd in this brutal AI race. That’s not all xAI has going on, as it isn’t just sipping the same Kool-Aid as Tesla, it’s basically drinking straight from the jug. The two are tangled up in more ways than one. Newer Tesla vehicles have xAI’s Grok chatbot baked right into their infotainment systems. Yeah, the same Grok that’s been slammed left and right for spewing inaccurate junk and even worse, pumping out antisemitic trash and other hate speech. And that’s not the end of it. xAI recently launched Grokipedia, an encyclopedia-style platform that was clearly aiming to take on Wikipedia. Instead, it turned into yet another magnet for misinformation and chaos, triggering backlash across the board. Behind the scenes, the financial relationship between Tesla and xAI goes deeper than just software, according to CNBC’s report , which also said that xAI has invested “tens of millions” on Tesla’s energy storage systems, particularly for use at those questionable data centers in Memphis; that’s the battery packs on one hand, and carbon-spewing turbines on the other. Bit of a confusing strategy if you ask anyone who thought Elon was still pushing a green revolution. Safe to say that boat sailed a long time ago. Elon’s side-hustle AI firm has already stirred plenty of controversy with its sudden, aggressive buildout of data centers in Memphis. The facilities, massive and power-hungry, are powered by natural gas turbines. You read that right. Fossil fuels. And researchers in the area have been sounding the alarm about emissions and their impact on the city’s already sketchy air quality. Proxy drama, rejected deals, and a $1 trillion question Last week’s Tesla shareholder meeting stirred the pot even more. As Cryptopolitan extensively reported, investors were asked to vote on two key issues: a proposed investment by Tesla into xAI, and Elon’s monster CEO pay plan, which could eventually net him close to $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares—if, and only if, the company hits some pretty intense milestones. The pay plan passed, obviously. But the xAI investment? Not so much. The board didn’t get enough support to go through with it. Now Tesla’s legal team is apparently weighing “next steps,” as Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, said during the meeting. Which really just means that this weird corporate entanglement between the car company and the AI startup is not ending any time soon. And just to throw more gasoline on the fire, remember: xAI acquired X (formerly known as Twitter) in March, in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion. That decision locked all three of Elon’s worlds (social, automotive, and AI) into a tight, messy knot that no one’s entirely sure how to untangle. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

For Hedera, it’s the entrance of one of the most trusted digital assets in the world. For Bitcoin holders, it has opened up a way for them to ultimately interact with complex financial applications without having to give up the safety and value of BTC. Many in the industry view it as a significant step toward expanding Bitcoin’s presence in decentralized finance (DeFi). The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been excluded from most of these systems due to limitations on its main blockchain related to smart contracts. Bringing WBTC onto Hedera flips that script and gives a new use case to Bitcoin. WBTC is, in fact, the most popular and largest 1:1 BTC tokenized representation on all regulated custodian storage. Any WBTC can also be redeemed at any time for regular Bitcoin. This can be somewhat comforting to those concerned with maintaining trust, as they know their wrapped asset isn’t a synthetic or algorithmic form of their native asset – it’s backed and fully redeemable at any time against real BTC reserves held by a regulated custodian. By enabling WBTC to utilize Hedera, BTC holders can now leverage smart contract capabilities without having to sell the asset or transfer it to more risky protocols. They can lend it, stake it, trade with it, and provide liquidity in a decentralized protocol, all while being exposed to Bitcoin’s underlying value. Hedera is also seeking to add liquidity to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. More liquidity means more activity, more developers, and more options for users. It is an extremely strong vote of confidence from the largest participants in the digital-asset markets that Hedera is going to be one of the leading places for decentralized finance. Hedera enhances DeFi capabilities with wrapped Bitcoin BitGo , the primary custodian underpinning WBTC and a member of the Hedera Council, supported the launch. BiT Global and LayerZero also participated, offering additional support for cross-chain interconnections. Hedera advertises itself as a quick, cost-effective network with predictable fees. Its consensus mechanism is also designed to prevent frontrunning and miner-extractable value (MEV), two issues that can harm users on other blockchains. With WBTC going live on Hedera, Bitcoin holders can wrap their BTC and utilize it across the smart-contracting platforms of Hedera. This facilitates lending and borrowing, trading, liquidity provision, and many other DeFi tricks. Hedera has been gaining traction in DeFi over the past year. Its total value locked (TVL) has increased, and the network has attracted more developers, as well as institutional partners. It is still perceived as one of the larger digital currencies by market cap, even based on the market value of its native token, HBAR. DeFi Bitcoin gains foothold around the world The addition of WBTC on Hedera is also indicative of a broader trend in the space. Bitcoin is no longer viewed solely as a long-term store of value; it’s also increasingly being considered an asset that can support its own financial ecosystem. Supporters of the industry builders argue that they are foolish to sit on all that money. Rather, they envision a system in which BTC can be deployed as a productive asset to lend against, stake with, and trade through – without sacrificing its bedrock identity. At several industry events, it was emphasized that Bitcoin DeFi aims to establish a trustless and permissionless financial layer beyond the scope of Bitcoin. This vision views BTC as collateral and capital, the foundation of a global open finance system. Major exchanges have even flagged “BTCFi” as a trend to watch heading into the medium- and long-term, asserting that this could boost Bitcoin adoption. The listing of WBTC on Hedera could boost the network’s DeFi activity by introducing new users and increasing liquidity. It may incentivize the creation of more tools and financial products that focus on Bitcoin on Hedera as well.

The Altcoin Season Index has climbed to 29, marking a significant step toward what could become a full-blown altcoin season. This upward movement signals growing strength among alternative cryptocurrencies compared to Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator that measures whether Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies are performing better. Created by CoinMarketCap, this index provides valuable insights into market dynamics. When the index approaches 100, it indicates a strong altcoin season where most major alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 29 points, the index has gained one point since yesterday. This gradual increase suggests that altcoins are slowly gaining ground against the crypto giant. However, we’re still far from the official altcoin season threshold of 75. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? The calculation methodology for the Altcoin Season Index follows specific rules that ensure accurate market representation. The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding: Stablecoins Wrapped coins Other pegged assets For an official altcoin season declaration, 75% of these qualifying assets must outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 29 indicates we’re approximately one-third of the way toward this benchmark. Why Should Investors Care About This Movement? The rising Altcoin Season Index matters because it often precedes significant market shifts. Historical data shows that when the index begins climbing steadily, it frequently leads to increased altcoin dominance. This pattern presents potential opportunities for investors looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin. However, caution remains essential. The current Altcoin Season Index level suggests we’re in early stages rather than full altcoin season. Market conditions can change rapidly, so thorough research remains crucial before making investment decisions. What Does the Future Hold for Altcoin Markets? While the Altcoin Season Index increase to 29 shows positive momentum, several factors could influence future movements. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements all play roles in determining whether this trend will continue. Investors should monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly alongside other market indicators. This comprehensive approach provides better context for understanding overall market health and potential investment opportunities. Key Takeaways from the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading The recent Altcoin Season Index movement to 29 points offers valuable insights for crypto market participants. The gradual upward trend suggests growing altcoin strength, though we remain below the official season threshold. This period represents a crucial observation window for investors monitoring market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. It tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets. What does an index score of 29 mean? A score of 29 indicates that altcoins are gaining momentum but haven’t reached official altcoin season status, which requires a score of 75 or higher. How often does the index update? The index updates regularly, with the recent change showing a one-point increase from the previous day’s reading. What triggers an altcoin season? Altcoin season occurs when 75% of top altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, signaling broader market rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Should I invest based on the index alone? No, the index should be one of many factors considered alongside fundamental analysis, market conditions, and personal investment strategy. How reliable is this indicator? While useful for market sentiment, the index works best when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Found this analysis helpful?

According to a blog posted on Thursday, the company detected the campaign in mid-September 2025, after observing abnormal behavior tied to its Claude Code tool. Anthropic is convinced without the shadow of a doubt that the espionage operation was run by a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group and involved infiltrating around thirty high-value targets, including major tech companies, banks, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies across several countries. A few of those attacks succeeded. What made this different from past cyber campaigns wasn’t just who was behind it, but how it was executed. Roughly 80 to 90 percent of the entire attack was run by AI, with human operators stepping in only for a handful of key decisions, says Anthropic. Hackers jailbroke Claude and made it think it was doing legit work The attackers started by building an automated attack framework around Claude Code, Anthropic’s own AI model, and tricked it into thinking it was employed by a cybersecurity company conducting internal testing. They broke Claude’s safety filters through jailbreaking, a tactic that let them bypass built-in protections by feeding the AI small, context-free tasks that looked harmless on their own. Claude didn’t know it was being used for offensive operations because it wasn’t given the full picture at any point. Once the model was in use, the operation moved fast. Claude scanned each target’s network, identified the most sensitive parts of the infrastructure, and summarized the layout for the human operators. Then, it began hunting for vulnerabilities in those systems. Using its built-in coding capabilities, Claude wrote custom exploit code, identified weak points, and retrieved login credentials. It then pulled large volumes of internal data, organized it based on how valuable it might be, and flagged high-access accounts. After the AI gained admin-level control, it created backdoors that gave ongoing access to the compromised systems. And when it was done, Claude wrote up detailed reports of everything it had done (listing usernames, breached systems, and credentials) so the attack framework could use that info for future operations. Although Claude was extremely efficient, it wasn’t flawless. Sometimes it made up passwords or misidentified public data as sensitive. But those glitches were rare, and they didn’t slow down the overall mission. The sheer speed of the AI’s execution, processing thousands of requests per second, put it far ahead of anything a human team could pull off. AI agents now do the work of elite hacker squads—with almost no people involved This campaign is a turning point because it shows how much AI has advanced in just one year. Claude was literally out here running loops, making decisions, and chaining together complex sequences without direct orders. This AI model used tools from the Model Context Protocol, giving it access to external software like password crackers, network mappers, and data retrievers that used to be controlled only by human hands. The Claude system now understands complex instructions, writes exploit code on its own, and manages sophisticated cybersecurity operations with very little guidance. These AI agents aren’t just assisting hackers, they are the hackers. And they’re getting more capable by the day. After discovering the breach, Anthropic immediately began a ten-day investigation, banning the malicious accounts one by one. They alerted the affected organizations, worked with authorities to pass on intel, and expanded their detection systems to catch similar operations moving forward. But the company isn’t pretending this is a one-time problem. The team says these attacks will only become more common, and easier to pull off. That’s because the skills needed to run them are no longer restricted to elite hackers. If someone can jailbreak a model and plug it into the right toolset, they could carry out a massive campaign without needing a team or even deep technical knowledge. Anthropic warns of escalating threats as AI models evolve beyond human oversight The implications are massive, because if teams without deep funding or technical skills can launch nation-scale attacks using automated AI systems, the dystopia is certainly upon us. Anthropic’s Threat Intelligence team warns that while they only tracked the activity through Claude, it’s likely that similar abuse is happening on other frontier AI models. They say this is the beginning of a new standard in cyberwarfare. So why keep releasing models with these capabilities, you wonder? Well Anthropic argues that these same tools are essential for defense, saying that “the AI that carried out the attack was also the same kind used by Anthropic’s analysts to dig through the wreckage, find patterns, and understand the operation’s full scale.” They did promise to improve their models’ internal safety layers though, as well as refine their classifiers for attack detection, and openly publish case studies like this so others in the industry can prepare. Still, Anthropic says it’s not enough to rely on them alone. They’re urging all devs working on large models to invest heavily in safety. And they’re calling on cybersecurity teams to start integrating AI into threat detection, incident response, vulnerability scans, and Security Operations Center automation, because traditional methods aren’t fast enough anymore.

The release lands as a bundle of 11 updates and more than 150 refinements across banking, Bitcoin, commerce and peer-to-peer features. The update focuses on making money movement faster, cheaper and more intuitive in the app. For Bitcoin, Cash App now lets eligible users pay over the Lightning Network in seconds and with no fee, using either BTC or a USD balance after scanning a Lightning QR code. That routing choice means people can tap Lightning speed without needing to hold Bitcoin. Cash App Adds Bitcoin Map and Prepares Stablecoin Transfers for Everyday Use The app also introduces Bitcoin Map, an in-app directory that helps customers find nearby Square merchants and other businesses that accept Bitcoin. Users can locate a store, get directions, and pay directly over Lightning at checkout. Stablecoins are coming next. Cash App said eligible customers will soon be able to send and receive dollar-linked tokens inside the app, giving users a low-friction rail for moving digital dollars alongside BTC. We’ve been busy making some updates at Cash App, all with you in mind Cash App Green – Turn everyday spending into status Borrow – Bridge the gap between payday and bill pay for a flat fee Moneybot – Intuitive, personalized AI money management Afterpay on Cash… — Cash App (@CashApp) November 13, 2025 These steps align with Jack Dorsey’s long-standing Bitcoin thesis, that open protocols should power everyday payments. Cash App already made BTC buying mainstream for millions, and Lightning support pushes that view deeper into point-of-sale and peer-to-peer flows. Cash App Taps AI and Crypto to Build Faster, Smarter and More Open Payment Rails Under the hood, the company also refreshed navigation with AI-driven prompts and rolled out a more flexible benefits program for banking features. The most significant change for crypto users is faster, more flexible transfers via Bitcoin and stablecoins. The timing follows strong crypto engagement in Block’s results. Last week, the company reported nearly $2b in Bitcoin revenue during the third quarter, part of $6.11b in total revenue, with net income of $461.5m and double-digit gross profit growth led by Cash App. For merchants, Lightning acceptance through Square and discovery through Bitcoin Map could bring incremental foot traffic, while stablecoins add a treasury-friendly settlement choice for those who prefer dollars. For consumers, the mix of Lightning and stablecoins offers two clear benefits, near-instant payments and predictable value. Paying with BTC becomes faster and cheaper, while sending a stablecoin avoids price swings when moving funds. With President Trump’s administration leaning into a friendlier posture on digital assets, the policy backdrop adds momentum. If volumes follow, Cash App’s new rails could widen the gap between crypto-curious wallets and truly crypto-native money apps.

The recent announcement of SHIB’s integration with Unity Nodes has sparked a wave of excitement across the crypto sector as the project takes a major step toward real-world applicability. This move strengthens Shiba Inu’s position in decentralized infrastructure and demonstrates that community-driven tokens can evolve into sophisticated ecosystems with real utility. The Unity Nodes partnership allows SHIB to tap into distributed computing solutions and real-world data operations, expanding the token’s reach far beyond its meme origins. According to project contributors, the integration enables new forms of network participation, data processing and on-chain automation that could open the door to entirely new sectors. Investors have praised the move as SHIB’s clearest sign yet that the project intends to build functional use cases that go beyond hype and speculation. But while SHIB expands into real-world utility, another project is climbing the ranks and capturing the attention of long-term investors. RentStac , a platform focused on tokenized real estate and real-world yield, has emerged as one of the most promising players in the rapidly growing RWA (Real World Assets) ecosystem. As markets mature, many investors are beginning to complement speculative holdings like SHIB with more grounded, revenue-generating assets. RentStac is benefiting heavily from this shift, becoming a recurring name in conversations around the future of sustainable crypto income. The parallel rise of SHIB’s technological expansion and RentStac’s RWA positioning highlights how diverse the crypto market has become. On one side, innovative utility projects are proving that blockchain can power real infrastructure. On the other, real-world asset platforms like RentStac are proving that blockchain can create stable, income-driven opportunities tied to physical value. Together, they show how the market is moving toward a more balanced, mature ecosystem. SHIB’s integration with Unity Nodes marks a critical point in its evolution. By tapping into a network that supports decentralized computing, Shiba Inu moves closer to enabling applications in data processing, IoT integration and on-chain automation. These capabilities give SHIB developers new tools to build services that interact with the physical world, from data verification to distributed applications requiring real-time connectivity. Community members see this as the strongest utility step since the creation of Shibarium. The announcement fits into a broader demand for projects that connect blockchain networks with real-world systems. As more industries experiment with decentralized computing and Web3 infrastructure, tokens that support or benefit from these networks see rising relevance. SHIB’s ability to expand in this direction shows that it is entering a phase of functional development rather than remaining purely symbolic or speculative. Yet, even with strong developmental moves, SHIB still operates primarily as a growth-oriented asset. Its value cycles depend heavily on adoption, sentiment and user participation. This has naturally led many investors to seek balance in their portfolios, often looking for additional opportunities that offer stability and predictable performance. RentStac stands out as one of the leading options in this category. RentStac’s appeal stems from its simple but powerful model: connecting digital tokens to real estate income. Instead of relying on speculative market demand, RentStac generates yield from rental properties acquired through structured legal entities. These properties produce real cash flow, and the resulting income is distributed to token holders transparently through blockchain technology. For investors who want predictable returns without losing exposure to the crypto economy, RentStac offers an attractive blend of tradition and innovation. What sets RentStac apart is the emphasis on transparency and real-world verification. While many crypto projects talk about utility, RentStac directly anchors its token to real economic activity. Every part of the system, from property acquisition to revenue distribution, is documented, tracked and recorded on-chain. This lets users see where value comes from instead of relying on complex tokenomics or promises of future development. The rise of real-world asset projects has been one of the defining themes of 2025. Traditional institutions are exploring tokenized bonds, commodities and real estate as blockchain infrastructure becomes more efficient. RentStac has benefited from this trend by positioning itself as a clear, accessible entry point for everyday users to participate in real-estate yield without requiring large capital or complicated management. As a result, it has become one of the most talked-about RWA projects of the year. The contrast between SHIB and RentStac is not a conflict but a reflection of how nuanced crypto investing has become. SHIB’s evolving infrastructure demonstrates innovation, community energy and technological ambition. RentStac embodies stability, real-world grounding and consistent income. Together they represent the two sides of the modern crypto economy: high-growth potential and dependable yield. Investors are seeing the advantage of combining these worlds. As SHIB expands deeper into utility networks like Unity Nodes, it strengthens its long-term relevance. But unpredictable cycles still affect its market behavior. RentStac, meanwhile, focuses on providing stable rental income tied to a tangible asset class that traditionally performs well across economic conditions. This combination is proving appealing to investors who want to embrace the upside of innovation without exposing their entire portfolios to volatility. The Unity Nodes partnership marks a major point of progress for Shiba Inu, but it also highlights a broader shift happening across the market. Utility alone no longer defines success in crypto. Investors want value that can be measured, verified and trusted. That is why RentStac’s traction continues to grow as it delivers something crypto has historically lacked: predictable, real-world-backed returns. What makes RentStac particularly compelling is how well it fits into the narrative of tokenization becoming the next major crypto trend. As more industries bring assets on-chain, platforms that started early and built strong legal structures will likely become leaders. RentStac’s approach, which prioritizes compliance, transparency and property-backed yield, positions it as a serious contender in this expanding sector. As SHIB moves into real-world integration and RentStac strengthens its RWA foundation, the crypto market is showing signs of a long-term transformation. Speculation is no longer the primary driver of adoption. Practicality, proof of value and sustainable income are becoming major themes. SHIB’s Unity Nodes expansion demonstrates how tokens can influence real infrastructure systems. RentStac shows how blockchain can improve traditional investment models. Both represent the next era of crypto development, where usefulness and stability coexist rather than compete. Whether the market is seeking innovation, stability or a balance of both, SHIB and RentStac stand out as central players in the next phase of the industry. As crypto continues to evolve, the combination of real-world integration and real-world yield could define the portfolios of the future.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 01:00:00
54369358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=859200,1763082000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54369358.jpeg,"A $0.035 Token Is Quickly Becoming the Next Big Crypto, Here’s Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/a-0-035-token-is-quickly-becoming-the-next-big-crypto-heres-why/,"There is a new crypto token which is catching attention among all trading groups and forums, it is priced at only $0.035. Shareholders are citing a quick pace in its pre-sale and a roadmap that appears to be prepared to go live. Most of the bigger coins are entangled in lateral designs, however, this new-found initiative is gaining traction among the inventors, and the opportunity may not be more fortuitous than now to identify the next big crypto. Presale Acceleration and Community Growth The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has witnessed an increase in popularity as a rather silent beginning in early 2025, becoming one of the most discussed activities among cryptocurrency traders. The token was introduced at a price of $0.01 and has gone up to reach the current Phase 6 level of $0.035. It is an increase of 2.5x, clean of what it started being. The presale has shifted to the next level and this has increased the demand. The allocation of phase 6 has now gone beyond 86% and indicators suggest that it might end up closing way ahead than projected. Behind the presale, there is good activity that is projected by the numbers. Mutuum Finance has already collected 18.6M and has 17,900 holders. Accessibility is another factor that is driving demand. Recently Mutuum Finance allowed making direct card payments without any purchase limits. This has ensured that large buyers can come in fast without any hustle which has ensured Phase 6 is even further accelerated and more visible. What Mutuum Finance Is Assembling Mutuum Finance is creating a dual lending framework that will cater to the needs of borrowers and lenders in an automated and clean platform. The system is based on the use of mtTokens which update in real time to indicate interest earned on assets provided. This provides the visual understanding of what their yield is, and avoids the manual claiming or complex interfaces. It also has a revenue-based demand loop on the token. Part of the proceeds of the lending activity is spent on buying MUTM on the open market. Open market buying of MUTM is recapitalized to users that place their mtTokens as guarantees on the safety module. This process directly connects usage to token demand and establishes long-term incentive correspondence. Security is addressed early. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit with 90/100 score on Token Scan. There is a $50k bug bounty that can be raised to report a vulnerability in the code and it indicates that the team takes the issue of security building before the protocol is launched seriously. Long-Term Vision This is one of the biggest aspects of the roadmap of Mutuum Finance that comprises their own stablecoin. The interest charged on borrowing would go to the treasury, which would establish a permanent flow of revenue of the platform. A lending ecosystem is anchored by stablecoins, and they should be present to result in more use in volatile market situations. This may appeal to the users that want a more certain borrowing and lending process. According to the argument of analysts who have reviewed the roadmap of MUTM, the possibility of the stablecoin integration could be one of the factors that will push the token up after the platform becomes available. There are models that indicate that the current presale price may move 3x-5x in the event of adoption building and the demand of the stablecoins increases as high as activity. Price support will be facilitated by Oracles over supported assets. The Chainlink-style data feeds used by Mutuum Finance will ensure that collateral is safely valued in the event of fallback sources and aggregated pricing systems. A strong oracle environment eliminates errors in liquidation and secures the end user in times of huge fragmentation. Whale Interest and Fast Allocation The turning point is nearing. The official X channel of the Mutuum Finance assured that the V1 will be deployed to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This version will consist of the Liquidity Pool, the mtTokens, Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, initially supported with the ETH and the USDT. A proper launch window would provide investors with a tangible roadmap to follow. The rising excitement is highlighted by the speed of Phase 6. Big allocations, commonly termed as whale allocations have been realized, a good indicator in any presale. Large buyers will come to the projects where some credible progress is evident and there is an actual utility. Their involvement usually attracts additional interest from small investors. The leaderboard with 24-hour interaction also makes the engagement high. It gives the highest contributor per day an incentive of $500 in MUTM, which enhances competition and constant activity. Together with rapid distribution, security and public release environment, these elements mark Mutuum Finance as one of the most suitable crypto opportunities to the end of Q4 2025. Final Outlook The development of MUTM, as it came out of $0.01 to $0.035 has brought about heads. The key element of its increasing traction is a well-operating lending protocol, a stablecoin program, well-designed oracle architecture, audited software and high presale volumes. With whale interest attaining unprecedented levels and Phase 6 set to become a reality in the near future, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself to become the project that many expect to become the next project to break out in the DeFi space.

Despite a sharp rally over the past year, some analysts argue that XRP remains undervalued compared to its expanding use in cross-border settlements and digital asset liquidity. One such commentator, known as Pumpius, recently outlined a detailed analysis exploring several possible valuation paths for XRP, depending on adoption milestones. His argument rests on the idea that XRP should not be viewed purely as a speculative asset, but as a functional component of international liquidity systems. He maintains that the token’s long-term price trajectory will be determined by transactional demand rather than investor sentiment. Ripple’s Banking License and Regulatory Expansion Pumpius’ first scenario centers on Ripple’s pursuit of a national trust bank charter in the United States, a process initiated in mid-2025. The proposed entity, based in New York, would serve as a limited-purpose trust bank specializing in custody and blockchain infrastructure services. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approves, Ripple could expand into regulated financial services, including stablecoin management, digital asset custody, and the tokenization of traditional instruments such as treasuries and bonds. According to the analysis, such approval could allow Ripple to handle settlement flows exceeding $500 billion annually, positioning XRP as a key liquidity vehicle within its ecosystem. Under these conditions, Pumpius projects that XRP could reach approximately $50 per token. The Corporate Treasury Integration Scenario A second projection focuses on large-scale corporate adoption. Pumpius suggests that if multinational corporations, such as Apple, Tesla, or Amazon, migrate portions of their treasury operations and supplier payments to the XRP Ledger, it could represent up to $5 trillion in annual transaction volume. While major corporations have not yet made such transitions, smaller firms have begun integrating XRP-related services into their operations. For instance, in 2025, VivoPower allocated $19 million of its capital raise to XRP staking through the Flare Network, and Trident Digital committed $500 million toward an XRP reserve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other firms, including Nature’s Miracle and Hyperscale Data, have followed suit, with total institutional commitments surpassing $1 billion by mid-year. Pumpius argues that if large-scale corporations adopt similar strategies, the token could potentially rise to $100, given its efficiency as a cross-currency settlement asset. Global Market Tokenization and Long-Term Outlook The final projection addresses XRP’s possible role in tokenizing traditional financial markets. Pumpius estimates that if assets such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds, worth over $100 trillion, were to migrate onto blockchain platforms like the XRP Ledger, liquidity demand would surge significantly. He asserts that such integration could drive XRP’s value above $100,000 per token, assuming it becomes the primary asset facilitating settlement across global capital markets. However, these figures are highly speculative. The analysis assumes extensive institutional and regulatory adoption that has yet to materialize. While the projections offer insight into the potential scale of blockchain-based finance, they remain theoretical. For now, XRP continues to operate as a bridge asset with expanding but still limited real-world usage, and any future valuation will depend on verifiable market adoption rather than projections.

Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming According to on-chain data, a Satoshi-era wallet that had not moved funds for 13 years transferred roughly 12,000 BTC — about $1.4 billion at current prices — in a set of transactions that landed on an exchange ledger. Whale Moves Stir Markets Reports have disclosed that the transfers came as Bitcoin hovered near a key price band. The coin fell about 2% after the activity, a quick reaction as traders guessed the funds might be put up for sale. 🚨 BREAKING SATOSHI ERA WHALE JUST SOLD 12,000 $BTC AFTER 13 YEARS OF HODLING.

Others said the market’s mood was more nervous than panicked; large transfers often spark anxiety even when no immediate sale follows. Technical Pressure Around Resistance Prominent analyst Ted commented that Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance around $104,000–$105,000. According to his view, holding above $105,000 could encourage renewed buying and push prices toward $107,000. If that fails, he warned that the next clear support sits near $100,000. Traders will watch order books and exchange flows closely in coming sessions to see whether the transferred coins are converted to fiat or simply shifted between wallets. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Based on reports from Chris Kuiper, CFA, the broader selling pressure appears driven more by long-term holders than by panicked sellers. Kuiper pointed to the share of Bitcoin that has remained inactive for one year or longer. That metric usually climbs in slow markets and drops sharply during fast rallies. This time, the decline has been gradual. The pattern suggests steady profit-taking over time rather than a sudden exodus. “Who is selling?” Is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding #bitcoin‘s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying (by ETPs, corporations etc.) I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers). But one data point that gives… pic.twitter.com/9PVoolrtwm — Chris Kuiper, CFA (@ChrisJKuiper) November 12, 2025 Market observers say gradual sales fit a maturing market where older holders lock in gains without trying to time a perfect top. Where past cycles saw abrupt moves from large dormant wallets, the current trend looks more measured. That does not rule out short-term volatility, but it changes how traders interpret big transfers.

The scheme, uncovered by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and its Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), highlights how scammers are weaponizing legitimate systems to deceive victims with alarming precision. Scammers Fake Police Identity Using ReportCyber Data According to the AFP, fraudsters are submitting false reports through ReportCyber, Australia’s official cybercrime reporting tool , using stolen personal details such as phone numbers and email addresses. They then contact victims while posing as AFP officers, claiming the individual has been linked to a crypto-related investigation or data breach. Detective Superintendent Marie Andersson stated that the scheme is highly convincing because scammers use genuine-looking case numbers generated from the fraudulent submissions. “They verify personal information in ways that match common expectations and act quickly to create a sense of urgency,” she noted. In one case, scammers filed a fake report, then called the victim with a matching reference number and alleged that the individual’s name appeared in a cryptocurrency breach. A second caller, impersonating a crypto exchange representative, reinforced the deception and urged the victim to move funds into a “secure cold wallet.” Fortunately, the targeted user hung up before transferring any money. Police also warned that the criminals often spoof official AFP phone numbers to increase credibility. Authorities Urge Vigilance as Scam Activity Surges The AFP stressed that genuine officers will never ask for access to crypto wallets, seed phrases, account passwords, or banking details. Anyone contacted about a ReportCyber submission they did not file is urged to hang up immediately and call 1300 CYBER1. Despite the exploitation of third-party reporting features, officials emphasized that ReportCyber remains secure and continues to be a critical tool in tracking cybercriminals. Every legitimate report, they said, contributes to intelligence gathering and helps prevent future victims from being targeted. Authorities also highlighted that individuals aged 50–70 are disproportionately affected, especially when scams involve crypto ATMs, investment schemes, and social-engineering tactics. Australia Tightens Oversight as Crypto Scams Grow More Sophisticated The warning comes as Australia ramps up enforcement against crypto-related crime. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke recently announced sweeping powers to regulate crypto ATMs, labeling them “high-risk products” associated with money laundering and exploitation. Meanwhile, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has taken down more than 14,000 scam and phishing websites since 2023, including over 3,000 linked to crypto schemes. Regulators report that scammers are increasingly using AI-powered ads, fake exchanges, and impersonation attacks to lure victims. As cybercriminals refine their social-engineering tactics, authorities say vigilance is the strongest defense. “Australians should check for warning signs and protect themselves,” Andersson said. “If something feels off, it probably is.” Cover image from ChatGPT, ETHUSD chart from Tradingview",Crypto News|crypto|ETH|ETH Price|Ethereum|ethereum price|ethusd,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 01:00:59

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is taking a significant step toward establishing clear crypto transfer accounting standards. This potential move could revolutionize how companies report cryptocurrency transactions and bring much-needed clarity to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. What Does FASB’s Crypto Transfer Accounting Review Mean for Businesses? The FASB’s upcoming discussion marks a pivotal moment for corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Currently, many companies struggle with inconsistent reporting methods for crypto transfers. The board will evaluate whether to add comprehensive crypto transfer accounting standards to its formal technical agenda. This review represents a crucial advancement beyond their 2023 accounting rule, specifically addressing when and how companies should remove crypto assets from their books after transfers. Why Is Standardized Crypto Transfer Accounting So Important? Clear crypto transfer accounting rules provide numerous benefits for businesses and investors alike: Consistent financial reporting across all companies Improved transparency for investors and stakeholders Reduced compliance risks and audit challenges Enhanced comparability between organizations Increased confidence in corporate cryptocurrency adoption Without standardized crypto transfer accounting practices, companies face significant challenges in properly valuing and reporting digital asset movements. This lack of clarity can lead to inconsistent financial statements and potential regulatory issues. How Will This Impact Current Crypto Accounting Practices? The FASB’s potential new crypto transfer accounting standards would build upon existing frameworks while addressing specific gaps in digital asset reporting. The review will particularly focus on derecognition criteria – determining exactly when a company should remove crypto assets from its balance sheet following transfers. This clarity is essential for proper financial reporting and audit compliance. Moreover, this initiative follows the recent addition of stablecoin accounting classification to the FASB’s agenda. Together, these projects demonstrate the board’s commitment to creating comprehensive digital asset accounting standards that keep pace with technological innovation. What Challenges Might Companies Face During Implementation? While standardized crypto transfer accounting brings numerous benefits, businesses should prepare for some implementation hurdles: Training accounting staff on new procedures Updating internal control systems Ensuring compliance across multiple jurisdictions Managing transition periods effectively Addressing technical complexities of blockchain transactions However, these challenges are manageable with proper planning and the long-term benefits of clear crypto transfer accounting standards far outweigh the temporary implementation difficulties. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Accounting Standards The FASB’s proactive approach to crypto transfer accounting signals a maturing regulatory landscape for digital assets. As cryptocurrency continues gaining mainstream acceptance, standardized accounting practices become increasingly crucial. This move could accelerate corporate cryptocurrency adoption by providing the financial reporting clarity that businesses and investors demand. Companies currently engaged in cryptocurrency transactions should monitor these developments closely. Early adoption of emerging crypto transfer accounting best practices can provide competitive advantages and demonstrate commitment to transparent financial reporting. Frequently Asked Questions What is the FASB’s role in cryptocurrency accounting? The Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for public companies in the United States. Their work on crypto transfer accounting aims to create standardized reporting methods for digital asset transactions. When will these new accounting standards take effect? The timeline depends on whether the project gets added to the formal agenda and subsequent development phases. Typically, new accounting standards undergo several rounds of review and public comment before final implementation. How will crypto transfer accounting differ from traditional asset accounting? Crypto transfer accounting must address unique aspects of digital assets, including blockchain verification, wallet transfers, and the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions that differ from traditional financial instruments. What should companies do to prepare for these changes? Businesses should document current crypto accounting practices, train accounting staff on blockchain basics, and establish robust internal controls for digital asset management while monitoring FASB developments. Will these standards apply to all types of cryptocurrencies? The initial focus will likely cover major cryptocurrencies with established markets, but the framework may evolve to include various digital assets as the standards develop and the market matures. How will this affect companies’ financial statements? Standardized crypto transfer accounting will provide clearer guidelines for balance sheet presentation, revenue recognition, and disclosure requirements related to cryptocurrency holdings and transactions.

Data shows that more than 149 million XRP, worth roughly $336 million, exited exchanges within a 24-hour window. The movement comes at a time when market conditions are somewhat choppy , yet accumulation trends appear to be strengthening as investors are likely adjusting positions ahead of a potential new source of demand. This potential new source of demand is the possible launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US this week. Massive XRP Outflows From Crypto Exchanges The latest exchange-reserve data captures a significant decline of millions of XRP on crypto exchanges in the past few days, placing total reserves across tracked platforms at approximately $6.63 billion as of November 13. Such sudden outflows can only be interpreted as a sign that investors are moving tokens into private storage rather than preparing to sell. The size of the withdrawal in recent days, more than two percent of available exchange supply, marks one of the more notable single-day reductions seen in recent months and has raised questions about where the liquidity is going. The reserve contraction is coincidental with rising anticipation around a possible Spot XRP ETF debuting this week. Canary Capital’s Form 8-A filing gives Nasdaq the framework to list the fund as early as November 13 once regulatory procedures are finalized. The prospect of an ETF has already become a focal point for traders, largely because similar developments for Bitcoin and Ethereum led to major inflows and surges in demand following approval. Even without a final green light, the setup alone appears to be influencing behavior on-chain, as whales and long-term holders position early in case a fresh wave of institutional interest begins to form. Can The Price React Positively? A drop in exchange reserves this large reduces the amount of XRP immediately available for trading and creates the conditions needed to increase buying pressure. Investors who move tokens off exchanges tend to have a longer time horizon, which naturally limits short-term sell pressure. If the ETF goes live on schedule and draws meaningful capital, the reduced supply on exchanges may intensify price reactions. Whether this translates into a sustained price uptrend depends on how much demand the ETF launch ultimately generates. Recent examples in the market include the steady inflows into the two Spot Solana ETFs in the US, which have attracted consistent demand since their launch. Even so, there is a growing belief among market watchers that a Spot XRP ETF could draw far deeper liquidity than its Solana counterparts, given the asset’s larger global footprint and institutional investors. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.50, up by 3.8% in the past twenty-four hours.",XRP|bitcoin|Canary Capital|Ethereum|Nasdaq|ripple|Spot Solana ETFs|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 02:00:04

Market participants are closely monitoring this condensed timeline, which could have significant implications for XRP adoption and liquidity. Upcoming ETF Review Schedule Key dates in the approval cycle include Canary Capital on November 13, Franklin Templeton from November 14 to 18, and Bitwise on November 19 and 20. CoinShares and 21Shares are scheduled between November 20 and 22, while Grayscale and WisdomTree are expected toward the end of the month. This sequence represents a concentrated review period for some of the largest names in the ETF industry. These firms collectively manage assets exceeding $1.5 trillion. Even modest allocations to XRP-focused products could materially affect the market, enhancing both liquidity and institutional credibility. Approval would signal regulatory acceptance and provide portfolio managers access to XRP in a fully compliant, brokerage-ready format. Implications for Market Accessibility and Liquidity ETF approval would expand XRP’s accessibility to institutional investors previously limited by mandate restrictions. Regulated inflows from these products would establish a more systematic approach to price discovery, reducing reliance on speculative market movements. Such inflows would also strengthen liquidity, supporting more efficient trading and settlement on the XRP Ledger. Moreover, integrating XRP into regulated investment frameworks mirrors the trajectory Bitcoin experienced following its spot ETF approvals. It would mark an important step in legitimizing the asset, positioning it as an allocation-ready instrument within traditional investment portfolios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Influence on XRP Price Dynamics XRP’s price has faced downward pressure from declining moving averages and broader corrective trends. The introduction of institutional inflows through ETFs could shift this dynamic by creating predictable demand cycles. Payment volume on the XRP Ledger recently exceeded the billion-dollar mark, indicating robust network activity capable of supporting larger capital flows. Market observers suggest that even a single early ETF approval could change perceptions, potentially initiating a period of sustained institutional engagement. With multiple reviews occurring almost consecutively, November presents a significant opportunity for XRP to experience its first coordinated wave of regulated demand in years. While approvals are not guaranteed, the current schedule reflects the growing interest of institutional investors in XRP. If these ETFs are sanctioned, it would represent a notable development in the token’s integration into mainstream finance, increasing both visibility and credibility among portfolio managers and investors.

Fidelity Research Boss Breaks It Down,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whos-selling-bitcoin-fidelity-research-boss/,"Visible buying from spot bitcoin ETPs and corporates has not translated into decisive upside, leaving traders to ask a blunt question: who is supplying the market? For Chris Kuiper, CFA, vice president of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, the answer is clear. “ ‘Who is selling?’ is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding bitcoin’s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying,” he wrote on X on November 12. “I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers).” Kuiper points to a simple but powerful on-chain gauge: the percentage of outstanding bitcoin that has not moved for at least one year. Glassnode’s “Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years Ago” rises in bear markets as coins age in place and investors sit on unrealized losses, then typically falls sharply when bull markets let those same investors exit into strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name “As you can see in the chart below, this line goes up during bear markets … and then usually a dramatic decline as these longer-term holders sell into the strength of a bull market,” Kuiper explained. What stands out to him today is that “with this cycle” the drawdown is “a relatively gentle slope down.” When bitcoin hit new highs earlier this year, the long-term-holder line “didn’t plunge,” he said. Instead, the market has been experiencing “a consistent slow bleed as the market has slowly moved sideways and up.” That slow bleed aligns with what Kuiper says he hears from the client side. “Bitcoin’s performance has recently lagged gold’s, even the S&P, and people are getting tired,” he wrote. Many investors, in his view, had been positioned for a textbook four-year cycle blow-off and were “waiting to sell into the historically strong seasonality of October and now November.” When October’s typical strength did not materialize and year-end approached, “long-term holders are looking to make year-end tax and positional changes, calling it a day with the gains they already have.” Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why The Glassnode chart shows how different this looks from past cycles. In the 2017–2018 run-up and subsequent reversal, the share of coins last active more than a year ago rolled over violently as price spiked and then collapsed. In the current cycle, the curve that represents long-term-holder supply has been trending lower since 2023, but without the vertical collapse normally associated with euphoric distribution. On-chain analyst Julio Moreno of CryptoQuant added another layer by reframing the same dynamic as “1-year inactive supply drawdown” in percentage points of total supply. “Here’s another way to visualize this,” he replied to Kuiper, “by looking at the 1-year inactive supply drawdown in terms of % of total Bitcoin supply.” Moreno quantified the last three major cycles. In 2017–2018, 1-year inactive supply declined by about 20 percentage points of total supply. In the 2021 cycle, the drawdown was around 10 percentage points. In the 2024–2025 period so far, the decline is again roughly 10 percentage points. The CryptoQuant chart, which uses an inverted scale, renders that as a purple wave that rises as more long-dormant coins are spent or reallocated. This means that long-term holders have already released a volume of supply comparable to the 2021 cycle, even if it is still well below the 2017–2018 peak. What differs is the tempo. Rather than a short burst of profit-taking at the top, the market has absorbed roughly a 10-percentage-point reduction in inactive supply over a longer, choppier price path. Kuiper welcomed the alternative visualization, replying simply: “Great chart!” He also made clear what he will be monitoring from here. “I will be watching this slope along with some other metrics to gauge seller exhaustion,” he said. For now, he argues that “the positive fundamental developments and lackluster price action continue to diverge.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,609.

A federal judge in Texas has ordered Apple and OpenAI to respond to allegations that the two companies conspired to reduce competition in emerging markets for artificial intelligence. U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman of the Northern District of Texas denied Apple and OpenAI’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit . In the written order, Pittman did not disclose his reasoning but ordered both sides to file additional filings explaining themselves. The ruling does not decide whether Musk’s companies will ultimately succeed. Instead, it allows the system of justice to do its job. This procedural victory enables XCorp to initiate the process of collecting evidence, taking witness depositions, and advancing to trial. Apple and OpenAI defend themselves XCorp and xAI argue that Apple’s decision to build OpenAI technology into iPhones and iPads is a move to lock them and other rivals out of major consumer distribution points for AI. The lawsuit argues that Apple’s moves leave OpenAI as the dominant player in mobile AI with a limited product offering, making it difficult for other companies to compete or attract customers. Musk’s companies argue that this agreement is a disaster for consumers, as it limits choice and restricts the development of new AI tools. They also argue that the partnership between Apple and OpenAI represents another unfair consolidation of power in a nascent industry, which could constrain global competition. In court papers, Apple rejected the claims as false and misleading. Its lawyers emphasised that an exclusive agreement with OpenAI did not bind the company, and that the company’s plans still included working with other developers in AI. They say that the iPhone has always been a multi-application platform, so consumers are not trapped into OpenAI’s choices; competition has always been free to coexist alongside it. OpenAI also responded in kind, calling the lawsuit a mere “instrument of Musk’s campaign of lawfare.” In a statement, the group mentioned Musk’s personal friendship and business ties to the outfit’s CEO, Sam Altman — they were co-banished from OpenAI over 10 years ago. OpenAI’s lawyers described the litigation as a meritless effort to settle old scores, rather than address any legitimate competitive concerns. OpenAI is independent, and any Apple product integration occurred as part of a legal business activity — once more, not the tentacles of a plot to suffocate the competition. Legal experts say both companies are involved in a broader fear of competition in the world of artificial intelligence, where market shares and strategic partnerships (and animosities among menageries of brainy people who work there) can often rub up against each other in ways that confound differences between competition and innovation, not to mention corporate behaviour at the digital technology’s bleeding edge. Court sets stage for next moves Now, both sides must file additional paperwork with the court. They will flesh them out more. If the case goes to trial, it could be months or even years before a final judgment is rendered. The case, XCorp. v.. Apple, 25-cv-00914, is being heard in the Fort Worth division of the Northern District of Texas. If Musk’s companies prevail, the ruling could alter the way Apple and OpenAI conduct business in the AI space. Competitors may be able to access markets more easily, and consumers may face a greater number of choices in AI products. The case highlights the growing tensions in the AI industry, and more broadly, as large tech companies strive to integrate their technologies into consumer products at an unprecedented pace. Cases like this one could help determine who sets the rules for AI in smartphones and beyond. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On-chain data showed that the project has initiated $2 million to $3 million daily buybacks since October 28th. Aster DEX has also repurchased more than 143.38 million ASTER tokens since the launch of its buyback initiative. Those tokens account for 7.11% of the network’s supply. Aster DEX funds its buyback program via protocol revenue and treasury . @Aster_DEX has executed $214.03M in total buybacks, with $2M-$3M daily buyback since Oct 28th. • 143.38M $ASTER tokens repurchased • 7.11% of circulating supply offset • Funded through protocol revenue and treasury continuous value return to holders pic.twitter.com/wg00hpBNxY — Tokenomist (@Tokenomist_ai) November 13, 2025 Aster’s current buyback lasted for 35 days until November 9, which allowed for the S3 airdrop to begin after the complete buyback. The tokens from the initiative will be prioritized for distribution, while any shortfall will be unblocked from the airdrop allocation pool to ensure full distribution. The decentralized exchange has funded its buyback program via its protocol revenue and treasury to ensure continuous value return to holders. It allocated 70-80% of its Season 3 (S3) trading fees to fund the buyback initiative and reward community participants through activities like trading volume and holding duration. The results of the program were released by the team after the conclusion of the S3 phase, with subsequent airdrops and buybacks coming in future seasons. The record buyback comes as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) purchased over $2 million ASTER tokens, triggering speculative demand. He also revealed that he’s not a trader but buys digital assets and holds. At the time of publication, ASTER’s price had dropped more than 4.6% in the past 24 hours to $1.09. The digital asset has surged by approximately 6.3% over the past 7 days but is down by about 21.33% over the past 30 days. ASTER had dropped by 11% during the October 10 market crash, with its total value locked also plummeting by nearly 25%. Crypto expert Peters predicted that the token could rise to $10 in response to the buyback initiative. Aster surged by 15% in response to CZ’s recent presidential pardon. Crypto analyst, Crypto Patel, compared ASTER’s growth potential to BNB. He argued that the token could become the next BNB within four to five years if its adoption continues climbing at the current pace. The analyst’s projections suggest that the token‘s current buyback program could ignite its next rally. On-chain data revealed that Aster’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped from its record $2.44 billion on October 10 to around $1.5 billion at the time of publication. On-chain data showed that the exchange’s average daily fee reached $1.75 million over the past seven days. Aster’s fees in the last 30 days reached $60 million, with its total fees amounting to $732.4 million. Aster DEX integrates new trading pairs Aster DEX has also integrated new trading pairs and boosts for tokens like HEMI and AT. The initiative was aimed at enhancing the exchange’s fee-generating activity during Stage 3. Aster DEX is also doubling down on buybacks in response to support token stability amid uncertain market conditions. Aster’s buyback amount surged by 50%, burning $7,500 every minute. Aster’s previous buyback campaign distributed $200,000 in ASTER tokens as rewards within days after launch. On-chain data shows that the project has also become a leader in DEX trading volume. The recent repurchase program incentivized the project’s users to reach particular trading volume and balance goals for both Spot and Perpetual accounts. The project had encountered problems after DeFiLlama delisted its trading volume data on October 5, prompting the launch of the buyback program. The analytics platform detected suspicious trading volumes that closely mirrored Binance’s. Co-founder Oxngmi noted that Aster’s data correlated almost perfectly with Binance’s perpetual pairs, including ETH/USDT and XRP/USDT. Aster’s removal resulted in short-term selling pressure, which caused a 10% drop in a single day. The exchange’s trading volume was relisted after weeks, reigniting concerns over transparency in decentralized markets and the growing influence of data platforms. Get seen where it counts.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.93 Market Cap $3.22B Trading Volume $415.13M Circulating Supply 540.62M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $6.61 24-h Low $5.70 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 40.96% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 59.47 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.28 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 15 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $5.15 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is stabilizing with an interim base forming around $5.80 as momentum cools. A break above $6.00 could trigger a recovery toward $6.40. If ICP loses support at $5.75 to the bears, traders can anticipate a further dip closer to $5. ICP 1-day price analysis As of November 14, ICP is trading around $5.909 after several days of steady retracement from $8.90. Today’s slight green candle hints at early stabilization, but the broader structure still reflects cooling momentum. The Bollinger Bands remain wide, showing that volatility from last week’s explosive move is still being absorbed. The price is currently sitting above the mid-band at $5.183, a long-standing support level that has not been broken in the past days. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in positive territory, though the histogram continues to shrink, which suggests the correction is still controlled and not indicative of a trend reversal. The Chaikin Money Flow at 0.07 indicates marginal inflows, enough to suggest that buyers are present but not aggressive. If ICP maintains close above $5.80–$5.90, it may begin forming a base for another attempt toward $6.50 and later $7.20. A drop below $5.50, however, would weaken this outlook and expose the mid-band support at $5.18, which becomes critical for preserving the recent uptrend. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP is trading around $5.887 after a consistent decline over the past sessions. The Alligator lines are all trending downward, indicating that the broader intraday structure remains bearish. However, the appearance of the recent green candles suggests market stabilization. The MACD remains in bearish territory, though the histogram is noticeably lighter, indicating weakening downward momentum. This fading bearish pressure supports the possibility that ICP could be building a short-term bottom around $5.75–$5.85. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A decisive break above $6.00 would mark the first meaningful sign of a rebound, opening the path toward $6.21 and eventually $6.40, where the blue Alligator jaw sits as strong resistance. If price loses $5.75 again, the structure becomes vulnerable, risking a deeper pullback toward $5.60 or even lower. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.87 BUY SMA 5 $6.53 SELL SMA 10 $6.64 SELL SMA 21 $4.89 BUY SMA 50 $4.28 BUY SMA 100 $4.65 BUY SMA 200 $5.15 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.99 BUY EMA 5 $4.67 BUY EMA 10 $4.60 BUY EMA 21 $4.78 BUY EMA 50 $5.04 BUY EMA 100 $5.23 BUY EMA 200 $5.80 BUY What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is stabilizing across both timeframes, with the daily chart showing a controlled pullback and the 4-hour chart forming a tentative base around $5.80. A break above $6.00–$6.06 could align both trends toward a recovery targeting $6.21–$6.40. On the other hand, a drop below $5.75 risks extending the correction closer to $5. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25?

Binance has made an important announcement that affects GAL token holders. The exchange will temporarily suspend Binance GAL deposits through the Ethereum ERC-20 network starting 3:00 a.m. UTC on the 19th. This development requires immediate attention from anyone using Binance for GAL transactions. What Does This Binance GAL Deposits Suspension Mean for You? When Binance suspends GAL deposits via ERC-20, it means you cannot send GAL tokens to your Binance wallet using the Ethereum network during this period. However, this only affects deposits – withdrawals and trading will continue normally. The suspension specifically targets the ERC-20 version of GAL tokens, so other deposit methods remain available. Why Would Binance Suspend GAL Deposits? Exchange maintenance and upgrades often prompt temporary suspensions. Common reasons include: Network security enhancements Wallet system updates Technical optimizations Compliance requirements These measures ensure your assets remain secure while improving platform functionality. The Binance GAL deposits suspension follows industry best practices for maintaining robust exchange infrastructure. How to Continue Your GAL Transactions During This Period While ERC-20 deposits pause, consider these alternatives for your Binance GAL deposits: Use other supported networks for GAL transfers Check Binance announcements for specific network alternatives Monitor official channels for restoration updates Plan transactions around the maintenance window What Every Crypto Trader Should Know About Network Suspensions Network suspensions are common in cryptocurrency exchanges. They demonstrate proactive platform management rather than indicating problems. The temporary nature of this Binance GAL deposits suspension means normal operations will resume after maintenance completion. Protecting Your Assets During Exchange Maintenance Always verify official announcements before making deposits. Double-check network compatibility and maintain backups of your transaction details. The Binance GAL deposits suspension serves as a reminder to stay informed about exchange updates. Looking Ahead: What to Expect After the Suspension Once Binance completes the maintenance, GAL deposits via ERC-20 will resume with potentially improved security and efficiency. The exchange typically provides clear communication about restoration timing through official channels. In summary, the temporary Binance GAL deposits suspension represents routine maintenance rather than cause for concern. By understanding the reasons and alternatives, traders can navigate this period smoothly while anticipating enhanced platform performance afterward. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the GAL deposit suspension last? Binance hasn’t specified an end date, but such suspensions typically last from a few hours to several days. Monitor official announcements for exact restoration timing. Can I still withdraw GAL tokens during this period? Yes, withdrawals remain operational. Only deposits via ERC-20 network are affected by this temporary suspension. Will this affect GAL token trading? No, GAL trading pairs will continue normally. The suspension only impacts deposits through the specified network. Are my existing GAL tokens safe on Binance? Absolutely. Your stored GAL tokens remain secure in your Binance wallet. The suspension only affects new deposits. What alternative networks can I use for GAL deposits? Check Binance’s deposit page for available network options.

This yield-bearing stablecoin offers multiple advantages for crypto enthusiasts. First, it provides a safe haven during market fluctuations, as the peg ensures stability. Second, the built-in yield mechanism means your assets work for you without active management. Additionally, integration into Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem allows for seamless use in lending, borrowing, and trading. Are There Any Challenges to Consider? While promising, this yield-bearing stablecoin faces hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny on real-world assets could impact growth.

54372266,https://cryptonews.com/?p=451851,1763088792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54372266.jpeg,OCC Urged to Reject Sony Bank’s Effort to Join the Crypto Banking Sector,https://cryptonews.com/news/sony-bank-crypto-plan-challenged-us-banking-lobby/,"A leading US banking group has urged regulators to stop Sony Bank’s crypto venture, warning against its plan for a national trust that would issue a dollar-pegged stablecoin . Sony stunned markets last month when its banking arm filed to form Connectia Trust , a federally chartered institution that would issue a $1-backed stablecoin, manage the reserves behind it, and provide digital asset custody and management. If approved, Sony would join a short list of major firms seeking national digital bank status, alongside Coinbase, Circle, Paxos, Stripe and Ripple. In a Nov. 6 letter to the OCC, the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) said it “strongly opposes” Sony Bank’s application and argued the proposal leans on an impermissible reading of trust bank powers. Group Accuses Sony Of Seeking Bank Benefits Without Obligations Further, the group warned that customers could confuse a stablecoin with a bank deposit, even though national trust banks are barred by statute from taking deposits. Sony has filed with the @USOCC to create Connectia Trust, a national crypto bank set to issue a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin #Sony #Stablecoin #OCC https://t.co/6vGJud8E7W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 ICBA said trust charters exist for fiduciary work like estate planning and investment management, not for deposit-style products. It asked the OCC to reject the plan, warning it could mislead customers and create risks in a failure. The group said Connectia would “engage in the business of banking” without FDIC insurance or Community Reinvestment Act obligations, a structure it called an end run that captures the benefits of a bank charter without the full rulebook. ICBA added that Connectia would not have to reinvest in low and moderate-income communities, even as it could gather funds from them. Critics Say Sony’s Application Lacks Key Details On Reserves And Redemption On payments, ICBA pointed to the deposit-like functionality of stablecoins, which can move electronically, be spent at the point of sale, and be redeemed one-for-one for dollars, features it said mirror checking accounts that trust banks are not allowed to offer. The filing also raises Bank Holding Company Act issues, ICBA said, because national trust banks can escape holding-company supervision only if they meet strict conditions. The letter questioned whether Connectia’s non-fiduciary custody plans and potential payment features would satisfy those tests, a failure that could pull Sony’s corporate parents into bank holding company regulation. Transparency became a second front. The public version of Sony’s application omits key details, ICBA said, including reserve composition, redemption mechanics in stress, the projected issuance scale, and contingency plans for runs or cyber events. It asked the OCC to demand a fuller business plan before any decision, arguing that approving under a veil of secrecy would set a poor precedent. Group Warns OCC Lacks Tools To Resolve Large Stablecoin Collapse ICBA also questioned whether the OCC could safely resolve Connectia if it failed. The agency has not appointed a receiver for an uninsured national bank since 1933, and its rules were written for traditional trust companies, not a large stablecoin issuer connected to volatile crypto markets and complex blockchain infrastructure. A run on a Connectia token could force rapid sales of Treasuries and spark broader stress, the letter said. Handing off crypto custody during a receivership would require coordinating key shards and signing systems, a process the OCC has never performed, and any failure could permanently strand customer assets. ICBA’s bottom line was blunt, the OCC should deny the application because Connectia’s model exceeds the traditional scope of trust banks, mimics demand deposits, and fails the trust exemption under the Bank Holding Company Act. It added that approval would weaken the historical separation of banking and commerce and tilt the field against community banks.

What began as a retail-driven movement powered by early adopters and crypto enthusiasts has evolved into a market increasingly shaped by institutional capital, from BTC ETFs absorbing billions in inflows to corporations and hedge funds adding BTC to their balance sheets. Why Institutional Accumulation Has Changed Bitcoin Volatility The narrative around Bitcoin has undergone a fundamental transaction. According to the Arch Network post on X, the institutional participant in Bitcoin is no longer emerging; it’s already established. Spot Bitcoin ETF now holds over 1 million BTC, which is roughly 5% of the total supply. Daily inflows through mid-2025 have averaged between $300 and $500 million, with a cumulative asset close to $60 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Recovers Past $105K as Shutdown Relief and Whale Buying Fuel Bullish Reversal Furthermore, the reach of this integration is global, with more than half of the world’s top asset managers now having indirect exposure to BTC through these accessible ETF structures. However, while this level of adoption is bullish, a significant challenge is that most of this BTC remains idle in cold storage. This model secures exposure but fundamentally does not generate return. Presently, for the institutions managing trillions in assets, the model is losing relevance. A productive BTC stack that combines robust security with consistent yield generation is becoming the natural next step for capital markets. An ambassador at NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, Trader Onur, has highlighted that Bitcoin ETF recorded $524 million daily inflows on Tuesday, marking the biggest since the crash. The derivatives market is flashing similar signals that smart money just stacked $8.5 million in BTC longs. This shows retailers are still nervous, but institutions are quietly positioning. If the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) print is favorable, it could set the tone for the year-end momentum. How Flows Can Confirm Or Contradict Market Mood The selling momentum in Bitcoin spot ETF flows has stalled for now. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that the BTC price has held the $100,000 region for now, as a lot of outflows and bad sentiment have taken place. However, the BTC price is also failing to push higher on the back of it. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Battleground — This Price Range Will Decide the Next Cycle Phase As Daan noted, ETF flow data is a lagging indicator and useful mostly in hindsight. Nonetheless, when large outflows occur and the price refuses to drop further, it could be considered as short-term bullish absorption. Additionally, when heavy inflows fail to lift the price higher, it can signal local tops. These patterns have played out multiple times in this cycle, and they often occur at the key pivot zones where market direction shifts. Daan believes that it’s still valuable to watch how the price behaves around major ETF in- and outflow days.

According to reports, the SHIB ecosystem is now expanding into the telecommunications sector through its alliance with Unity Nodes, signaling a significant shift from speculative trading and investments toward real-world functionality. This development positions the popular memes coin at the forefront of a multi-trillion-dollar industry that powers global connectivity and digital infrastructure. Shiba Inu Enters $2 Trillion Market With Unity Nodes A publication released on Tuesday, November 11, reveals that Shiba Inu has officially partnered with Unity Nodes, a decentralized telecommunications network. This alliance marks a pivotal moment for SHIB as it transitions from a community-driven meme coin to a technology-integrated digital asset with practical use cases. More importantly, through this collaboration, Shiba Inu has entered a telecom quality assurance market estimated to be worth around $2 trillion annually. The partnership introduces direct utility to SHIB while offering new earning opportunities for its holders. Moreover, the move strengthens the meme coin’s position in a sector that relies on continuous innovation and large-scale infrastructure. Notably, the report indicates that Unity Nodes operates a blockchain-based mobile edge network that spans multiple countries and carriers. Its system enables everyday users to participate in verifying and improving telecom infrastructure through decentralized participation. Additionally, the network operates within a structured framework, where users can install the Unity application on their mobile devices to make verification calls that pass through specific nodes. Switch Nodes handle call routing, Validation Nodes ensure each device functions properly, and finally, Earth Nodes log any performance issues. This data is then stored on-chain to create a transparent Proof-of-Service record that telecom operators can access through an API. In return, users earn crypto rewards for helping test and maintain the network. New Utility And Rewards For The SHIB Community According to the publication, Shiba Inu’s partnership with Unity Nodes comes with a series of exclusive benefits designed for token holders . Notably, SHIB is now accepted as a payment method within Unity Nodes through a decentralized gateway built in accordance with the official brand standards. Users will also be able to purchase Nodes using Shiba Inu and receive SHIB-branded NFT licenses that can be freely traded on secondary markets. This provides greater visibility and expands the cryptocurrency’s presence across blockchain platforms. Unity Node payments completed with Shiba Inu also come with additional advantages. Rather than receiving 200 Unity Licenses per node, users who pay with SHIB tokens can earn more at no extra cost, including a 5% license bonus, which further encourages token use within the telecom network. Alongside this, rewards for Unity Node operators can be distributed directly in SHIB. What’s more, the Shiba Inu team automatically earns referral rewards when purchases are made using its official referral code, granting them Unity Licenses that can be used, leased, or traded.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 03:00:58

GAIB, an innovative crypto AI startup focused on GPU tokenization, just dropped its highly anticipated tokenomics structure. This groundbreaking announcement reveals how the project plans to distribute its 1 billion tokens, with a remarkable 40% dedicated to community growth and engagement. What Makes GAIB Tokenomics So Revolutionary? The GAIB tokenomics model represents a significant shift toward community-centric distribution. Unlike many projects that prioritize investors and insiders, GAIB’s approach demonstrates genuine commitment to building a strong, engaged community. The total supply of 1 billion GAIB tokens follows this allocation breakdown: 40% to community – The largest share for ecosystem growth 20.7% to core contributors – Rewarding the development team 19.8% to early contributors – Recognizing initial supporters 19.5% to ecosystem – Fueling platform development Why Does Community Allocation Matter in GAIB Tokenomics? Community-focused GAIB tokenomics creates a powerful incentive structure that benefits everyone involved. When 40% of tokens go to the community, it ensures widespread distribution and reduces centralization risks. This approach aligns perfectly with blockchain’s core principles of decentralization and community governance. Moreover, the GAIB tokenomics model encourages active participation. Community members who contribute to network growth, provide liquidity, or participate in governance can earn rewards. This creates a virtuous cycle where engaged community members help the project succeed while being fairly compensated. How Will GAIB Tokenomics Impact GPU Tokenization? GAIB’s innovative approach to GPU tokenization combined with its community-first GAIB tokenomics could set new standards for AI crypto projects. By allocating nearly half of all tokens to community development, the project ensures that: Network effects accelerate through broad distribution Governance becomes truly decentralized Long-term sustainability improves through community ownership Innovation thrives with diverse participation What Challenges Might GAIB Tokenomics Face? While the GAIB tokenomics structure appears promising, successful implementation requires careful execution. The project must ensure transparent distribution mechanisms and prevent token concentration. Additionally, maintaining community engagement over time presents an ongoing challenge that the team must address through continuous innovation and clear communication. The remaining allocations in GAIB tokenomics also serve crucial purposes. Core contributors need adequate compensation to continue development, while early contributors deserve recognition for their risk-taking. The ecosystem fund ensures resources for future growth and partnerships. Conclusion: A New Era for Community-Driven Projects GAIB tokenomics represents a bold step toward truly community-owned AI infrastructure. With 40% of tokens dedicated to community growth, this model could inspire similar approaches across the crypto space. The success of GAIB tokenomics will depend on execution, but the vision sets a compelling precedent for future projects. Frequently Asked Questions What is the total supply of GAIB tokens? The total supply is 1 billion GAIB tokens, distributed across four main categories according to the published GAIB tokenomics. How can community members earn GAIB tokens? Community members can earn tokens through various activities including providing liquidity, participating in governance, contributing to ecosystem growth, and engaging in community programs. When will GAIB tokens be distributed? Specific distribution timelines will be announced by the project team, following their roadmap and token release schedule. What makes GAIB tokenomics different from other projects? The 40% community allocation is significantly higher than many comparable projects, demonstrating strong commitment to decentralized ownership and community governance. Can the tokenomics model change in the future? While the initial GAIB tokenomics is set, future adjustments may occur through community governance proposals and voting mechanisms. What is GPU tokenization? GPU tokenization involves creating digital tokens that represent access to or ownership of GPU computing resources, enabling decentralized AI and computing services.

On November 13, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a staggering $867.35 million net outflow, marking the second-largest single-day withdrawal in history. This dramatic movement signals potential shifts in investor sentiment and market dynamics that could impact your cryptocurrency investments. What Caused This Massive Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflow? The recent $867.4 million outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs represents a significant market event. According to Trader T, this marks the second-largest single-day withdrawal after August 1. Several factors contributed to this substantial movement, including market volatility and changing investor strategies. The scale of this outflow suggests institutional players might be repositioning their portfolios amid current market conditions. Which Bitcoin Spot ETFs Were Most Affected? The outflow distribution reveals crucial insights about market leadership. Grayscale Mini BTC led with $318.20 million in outflows, followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT at $257.18 million . Other significant withdrawals included: Fidelity’s FBTC: $119.93 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $64.50 million Bitwise’s BITB: $47.03 million This pattern indicates widespread caution across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs providers rather than isolated concerns. How Do Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflows Impact the Market? Large-scale outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs can create substantial market pressure. When investors withdraw funds, providers often need to sell underlying Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption requests. This selling pressure can potentially drive Bitcoin prices lower and increase market volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that these movements represent short-term sentiment rather than long-term fundamental changes. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Spot ETFs Performance? While the $867.4 million outflow seems alarming, historical data shows that Bitcoin spot ETFs often experience cyclical patterns. Previous large outflows were typically followed by periods of stabilization or renewed inflows. Investors should monitor whether this represents a temporary adjustment or the beginning of a longer-term trend. The resilience of Bitcoin spot ETFs will be tested in the coming weeks as market conditions evolve. Should You Be Concerned About Bitcoin Spot ETFs Stability? The current situation with Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows requires careful consideration rather than panic. These investment vehicles have demonstrated robustness through various market cycles. The diversity among Bitcoin spot ETFs providers means that risk is distributed across multiple institutions. However, investors should maintain diversified portfolios and stay informed about market developments affecting Bitcoin spot ETFs performance. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. Why do Bitcoin spot ETFs experience outflows? Outflows occur when investors sell their ETF shares, which can happen due to profit-taking, risk management, or shifting market sentiment. How does this outflow compare to historical data? The $867.4 million outflow is the second-largest single-day withdrawal on record, following only the August 1 outflow. Will this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large outflows can create selling pressure, but Bitcoin’s price is influenced by multiple factors beyond ETF flows. Should I sell my Bitcoin spot ETFs? Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market research rather than reacting to single events. How can I track Bitcoin spot ETFs performance? Most financial platforms provide real-time ETF data, and specialized cryptocurrency news sources offer regular updates and analysis. Found this analysis of Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows helpful?

This massive sell-off primarily punished optimistic investors who bet on prices rising, creating one of the most significant liquidation events in recent months. What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? Market volatility struck with unexpected force, catching many traders off guard. The crypto futures liquidation cascade began when key support levels broke across major cryptocurrencies. This triggered automatic closing of positions that couldn’t meet margin requirements. The domino effect amplified losses throughout the derivatives market. Several factors contributed to this dramatic crypto futures liquidation event: Sudden price drops across major cryptocurrencies Leveraged positions becoming unsustainable Automatic margin calls activating simultaneously Market sentiment shifting rapidly Bitcoin Bears the Brunt of Futures Carnage Bitcoin experienced the heaviest damage in this crypto futures liquidation storm. The flagship cryptocurrency saw $273 million in forced position closures. More importantly, a staggering 82.54% of these liquidations came from long positions. This indicates most traders were betting on price increases when the market turned against them. The scale of Bitcoin’s crypto futures liquidation demonstrates how leveraged trading amplifies market movements. When prices move against highly leveraged positions, the results can be devastating for traders. Ethereum and Solana Join the Liquidation Party Ethereum wasn’t spared from the crypto futures liquidation frenzy either. The second-largest cryptocurrency witnessed $228 million in forced closures. Long positions accounted for 71.49% of ETH liquidations, showing similar optimism among Ethereum traders. Solana experienced the most lopsided crypto futures liquidation ratio. With $52.02 million in closed positions, an overwhelming 90.72% came from long contracts. This suggests Solana traders were particularly bullish before the market reversal. Why Were Long Positions Hit So Hard? The disproportionate impact on long positions reveals crucial market psychology. Most traders entered the market expecting prices to rise. This collective optimism created vulnerability when the trend reversed. The crypto futures liquidation event serves as a stark reminder that markets can move against majority sentiment. Key reasons long positions dominated the crypto futures liquidation statistics: Prevailing bullish market sentiment Overconfidence in continuing uptrends Excessive leverage on long positions Underestimation of downside risks How Can Traders Protect Against Future Liquidations? This crypto futures liquidation event provides valuable lessons for risk management. Traders can implement several strategies to avoid similar situations. Proper position sizing becomes crucial during volatile periods. Additionally, using stop-loss orders can prevent catastrophic losses. Effective protection against crypto futures liquidation includes: Using lower leverage ratios Setting appropriate stop-loss levels Diversifying trading strategies Monitoring market conditions closely What Does This Mean for Crypto Markets? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events often signal market inflection points. While painful for affected traders, these corrections can create healthier market conditions. They flush out excessive leverage and reset sentiment to more realistic levels. The aftermath of this crypto futures liquidation may present buying opportunities for patient investors. However, traders should remain cautious until volatility subsides and new trends establish. Key Takeaways from the $553M Liquidation Event This significant crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder about market risks. The dominance of long position closures highlights the danger of herd mentality. Successful trading requires balancing optimism with prudent risk management. Remember that crypto futures liquidation events are inherent to leveraged trading. They represent the market’s mechanism for removing unsustainable positions. While devastating for some, they contribute to overall market efficiency. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when traders can’t meet margin requirements for their leveraged positions. This typically happens during rapid price movements against their trades. Why were long positions hit harder than shorts? Most traders held long positions expecting price increases. When the market reversed suddenly, these optimistic bets became unsustainable, triggering massive liquidations. How can I avoid futures liquidation? Use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and avoid overconcentration in single positions to reduce liquidation risk. Will this liquidation affect spot prices? Yes, large futures liquidations can impact spot prices due to forced selling pressure and changed market sentiment, though the effect is usually temporary. Is this the largest liquidation ever? While significant at $553 million, larger liquidation events have occurred during major market crashes, particularly in 2021 and 2022. Should I avoid futures trading after this? Futures trading carries inherent risks. This event highlights the importance of proper risk management rather than suggesting complete avoidance. Found this analysis helpful?

This dramatic movement raises crucial questions about investor confidence in these relatively new financial products. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Seeing Massive Outflows? The data from TraderT reveals a concerning trend for spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s fund alone accounted for $137.37 million in outflows, representing the largest single withdrawal among all providers. This substantial movement from such a major financial institution signals potential shifting sentiment toward Ethereum-based investment products. Several factors could explain this trend: Market volatility concerns Profit-taking strategies Broader cryptocurrency market conditions Regulatory uncertainty How Did Other Major Players Perform? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) followed BlackRock with significant outflows of $67.91 million. Meanwhile, their Mini Ethereum Trust (ETH) saw $35.82 million exit. The most alarming aspect? Not a single spot Ethereum ETF recorded net inflows for the day. This uniform pattern across all providers suggests this isn’t an isolated incident but rather a broader market movement affecting the entire spot Ethereum ETFs ecosystem. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? For current Ethereum investors, these spot Ethereum ETFs outflows present both challenges and opportunities. While large-scale withdrawals can create short-term price pressure, they also may indicate market corrections that savvy investors can leverage. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor institutional behavior – Large players often signal market shifts Diversify your portfolio – Don’t rely solely on spot Ethereum ETFs Watch for patterns – Single-day movements may not indicate long-term trends Will Spot Ethereum ETFs Recover From This Setback? The future of spot Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain but not necessarily bleak. Historical data shows that cryptocurrency investment products often experience volatility in their early stages. However, the sheer scale of this outflow, particularly from established players like BlackRock, warrants close attention from anyone involved in spot Ethereum ETFs. Market analysts suggest watching for: Follow-up trading patterns over the next week Institutional commentary on Ethereum’s prospects Broader cryptocurrency market performance Regulatory developments affecting spot Ethereum ETFs Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH price movements without owning the actual digital asset. Why is BlackRock’s outflow significant? BlackRock is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and their substantial outflow from spot Ethereum ETFs may indicate changing institutional sentiment toward Ethereum investments. Should I be worried about my Ethereum investments? While concerning, single-day outflows don’t necessarily predict long-term trends. Monitor the situation and consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. How often do ETF outflows of this magnitude occur? Large outflows are relatively uncommon for established ETFs but can occur during market uncertainty or when major investors rebalance their portfolios. Can spot Ethereum ETFs affect Ethereum’s price? Yes, significant movements in spot Ethereum ETFs can influence Ethereum’s market price due to the large volumes involved and their impact on market sentiment. Where can I track spot Ethereum ETF flows? Platforms like TraderT, Bloomberg, and financial data providers regularly update ETF flow information for spot Ethereum ETFs and other cryptocurrency products. Found this analysis helpful?

The Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner revealed plans to completely exit BTC mining operations within two years, marking one of the most significant strategic shifts in the crypto mining industry. Why Did Bitfarms Stock Crash So Suddenly? The market reaction was swift and severe. When Bitfarms disclosed its intention to convert all mining facilities into AI and high-performance computing data centers, investors responded with immediate selling pressure. This Bitfarms stock decline reflects investor concerns about several key factors: Abandoning proven Bitcoin mining revenue streams Uncertainty about AI market competition Significant capital expenditure requirements for conversion Timeline risks during the two-year transition period What Does the Bitfarms Transition Timeline Look Like? Bitfarms has outlined a phased approach to this massive operational overhaul. The company’s 18-megawatt facility in Washington will lead the transformation, with completion targeted for December 2025. This initial conversion serves as a critical test case for the broader strategy. The success or failure of this first facility will likely determine the pace of subsequent conversions and could significantly impact Bitfarms stock performance throughout the transition. Is This the Beginning of a Mining Industry Trend? The Bitfarms decision raises important questions about the future of Bitcoin mining. While AI and high-performance computing represent growing markets, the move away from Bitcoin mining comes at a time when the industry faces several challenges: Increasing energy costs affecting mining profitability Growing regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions Bitcoin halving events reducing mining rewards over time Intense competition from larger mining operations This strategic pivot suggests that Bitfarms stock performance may now be tied more to tech sector trends than cryptocurrency markets. What Are the Potential Benefits for Bitfarms Stock Long-Term? Despite the immediate negative market reaction, the transition could offer substantial long-term advantages. The AI and high-performance computing markets are experiencing explosive growth, potentially providing: More stable revenue streams compared to volatile crypto mining Access to government incentives for technology infrastructure Partnership opportunities with major tech companies Diversification away from single-asset dependence However, the success of this strategy depends on execution and market timing, factors that will continue to influence Bitfarms stock valuation. How Should Investors Approach Bitfarms Stock Now? For current and potential investors, the situation requires careful analysis. The dramatic Bitfarms stock drop presents both risk and opportunity. Key considerations include: Monitoring the Washington facility conversion progress Assessing management’s ability to execute complex operational changes Evaluating the competitive landscape in AI data services Considering the company’s financial position during transition Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitfarms stock drop 18%? Bitfarms stock fell sharply because investors reacted negatively to the company’s announcement that it will exit Bitcoin mining entirely and convert to AI data centers over the next two years. When will Bitfarms complete the transition to AI? The company plans to complete the first facility conversion in Washington by December 2025, with the full transition expected to take approximately two years. Will Bitfarms continue mining Bitcoin during the transition? Yes, Bitfarms will gradually phase out Bitcoin mining operations while simultaneously converting facilities to AI data centers over the two-year timeline. How will this affect Bitfarms stock long-term? The long-term impact on Bitfarms stock depends on the success of the AI transition, market conditions, and whether the company can establish itself in the competitive AI infrastructure space. Are other Bitcoin miners making similar moves? While some mining companies are exploring diversification, Bitfarms represents one of the first major public miners to announce a complete exit from Bitcoin mining for AI. What happens to existing Bitcoin mining equipment? Bitfarms will likely sell or repurpose existing mining hardware as it converts facilities to support AI and high-performance computing workloads.

Whale Alert reported a staggering 202,107,199 USDT moved from an unknown wallet to OKX exchange, valued at approximately $202 million. This enormous transaction represents one of the largest single transfers we’ve seen this month, potentially signaling significant market movements ahead. What Does This Massive USDT Whale Transfer Mean? When we see a USDT whale transfer of this magnitude, it typically indicates one of several scenarios. Large investors might be preparing to make substantial purchases of other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, institutional players could be moving funds between wallets for security or operational reasons. The destination – OKX exchange – suggests this capital might soon enter active trading markets. Understanding whale movements helps traders anticipate potential price swings. However, remember that correlation doesn’t always equal causation. While large transfers often precede market movements, they don’t guarantee specific outcomes. Why Should You Care About Whale Transactions? Tracking USDT whale transfer activity provides valuable insights because: Large movements can indicate institutional interest They often precede significant price volatility Whale behavior influences market sentiment They reveal accumulation or distribution patterns This particular transaction stands out due to its sheer size and the unknown nature of the sending wallet. The mystery adds an intriguing layer to market analysis. How Do Whale Transfers Impact Crypto Prices? The recent USDT whale transfer to OKX could influence markets in several ways. First, having $202 million worth of stablecoins on an exchange means this capital is positioned for immediate deployment. If the whale decides to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other major cryptocurrencies, we could see substantial price appreciation in those assets. Conversely, if this represents profit-taking or position unwinding, it might signal upcoming selling pressure. The key is monitoring subsequent trading activity from the receiving wallet address. What Makes This USDT Whale Transfer Different? Several factors make this USDT whale transfer particularly noteworthy. The timing coincides with ongoing market consolidation, suggesting potential accumulation. The unknown origin wallet adds mystery, while the OKX destination indicates possible Asian market involvement given the exchange’s strong presence in that region. Market analysts will be watching closely for: Follow-up transactions from the same wallet Large buy orders on OKX Price movements in major cryptocurrencies Similar whale activity on other exchanges Key Takeaways From This Whale Movement This substantial USDT whale transfer reminds us that major players continue operating behind the scenes. While retail investors focus on daily price charts, institutional and whale activity often drives longer-term trends. The movement of $202 million demonstrates significant confidence in cryptocurrency markets despite recent volatility. Successful traders monitor these signals while maintaining balanced portfolios. Remember that whale watching should complement, not replace, fundamental and technical analysis. Frequently Asked Questions What is a whale transfer in cryptocurrency? A whale transfer refers to large cryptocurrency movements by wealthy investors or institutions. These transactions often influence market prices and sentiment due to their substantial size. Why do whales move USDT to exchanges? Whales typically transfer USDT to exchanges when they plan to trade for other cryptocurrencies, withdraw fiat currency, or reposition their portfolios for market opportunities. How can I track whale transactions? You can monitor whale activity using blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens or through specialized services like Whale Alert that report large transactions. Should I follow whale trading patterns? While whale movements provide valuable insights, they shouldn’t be your sole trading strategy. Consider them as one factor among many in your market analysis. What risks come with following whale activity? The main risk involves timing – by the time whale transactions are public, prices may have already moved. Also, whales sometimes make misleading moves to influence markets. How often do large USDT transfers occur? Significant USDT transfers happen regularly, but $200 million+ transactions remain relatively rare and typically indicate major institutional activity. Found this analysis helpful?

54374321,627100,1763092811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54374321.jpeg,Early Bitcoin Whale Sells Over $600M in BTC After 13 Years of Holding,https://bitcoinist.com/early-bitcoin-whale-sells-600m-btc-after-13-years/,"Bitcoin continues to face strong resistance as it struggles to reclaim higher supply levels, with price action stalling below the $105,000 mark. The market remains caught between cautious optimism and lingering fear, as selling pressure persists but downside momentum appears to be fading. According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, whales have continued to offload significant portions of their holdings in recent days, contributing to the ongoing headwinds in the market. However, despite this selling activity, analysts note growing signs of buyer absorption around the $100,000 zone, where strong demand has repeatedly prevented further declines. This balance between distribution and accumulation has split analyst opinions — some expect Bitcoin to dip further before stabilizing, while others see this phase as a reaccumulation zone that could precede a move toward new all-time highs. As the market navigates this critical stage, liquidity concentration and whale behavior remain key indicators to watch. If selling pressure continues to ease and demand sustains near current levels, Bitcoin could be setting the foundation for its next major impulse. OG Whale Sells $600 Million in Bitcoin Amid Market Uncertainty According to data from Arkham Intelligence, one of Bitcoin’s earliest and most prominent holders, Owen Gunden, has recently offloaded a significant portion of his holdings — a move that has caught the attention of market analysts. Gunden, who has held Bitcoin since late 2011, was sitting on approximately 11,450 BTC valued at $1.4 billion just a month ago. However, recent on-chain activity shows that he has sold around 6,100 BTC, worth roughly $616 million, reducing his holdings to $542 million. This large-scale selloff comes at a critical time for Bitcoin, as the asset consolidates near the $100,000–$105,000 range amid mounting selling pressure from whales. Gunden’s decision to take profit after over a decade of holding suggests a combination of profit realization and market caution, particularly as macro uncertainty and liquidity stress weigh on risk assets. While some view this as a bearish signal, others argue that such sales often mark the late stages of a distribution phase, where long-term holders transfer coins to new investors during consolidation. If Bitcoin maintains strong support near $100K despite this heavy selling, it could indicate deep market demand and the potential for a renewed accumulation phase. Bitcoin Consolidates as Bulls Defend the $100K Level The daily Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a consolidation phase, trading around $103,000 after multiple attempts to rebound from the $100,000 psychological support zone. Despite persistent selling pressure and fading momentum, buyers continue to absorb liquidity near this level, keeping the structure relatively stable. Price action shows a series of lower highs since mid-September, reflecting ongoing market hesitation and the dominance of short-term sellers. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages (blue and green lines) are currently acting as dynamic resistance levels, with BTC repeatedly failing to close above them. Meanwhile, the 200-day moving average (red line) provides a long-term anchor, currently positioned near $98,000, which remains the next major support level to watch. Until then, the market is likely to remain range-bound, consolidating within the $100K–$105K corridor. A breakdown below $100K could trigger further downside pressure, while a successful defense may set the stage for a recovery toward the $110K–$115K range in the coming weeks.

Recent data reveals a massive wave of institutional Bitcoin buying during market dips, with over $405 million worth of BTC moving from major exchanges to custody solutions. This strategic move suggests strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite short-term market fluctuations. What Does This Institutional Bitcoin Buying Mean? According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, institutional investors have been actively accumulating Bitcoin during recent price corrections. Over a nine-hour period, we witnessed 4,094 BTC transferred from prominent exchanges including Coinbase, Cumberland, Galaxy Digital, and Wintermute to Anchorage Digital addresses. This institutional Bitcoin buying pattern typically indicates: Long-term investment strategies rather than short-term trading Confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value Strategic accumulation during perceived market opportunities Why Are Institutions Buying Bitcoin Now? The timing of this institutional Bitcoin buying spree reveals much about market sentiment. When prices dip, sophisticated investors often see opportunity rather than risk. This recent activity suggests institutions believe current levels represent attractive entry points. Moreover, the scale of this institutional Bitcoin buying – $405 million in a single day – demonstrates substantial conviction. How Does Institutional Bitcoin Buying Impact Markets? When major players engage in significant institutional Bitcoin buying, it creates several market effects. First, it reduces available supply on exchanges, which can lead to price appreciation when demand increases. Second, it validates Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Third, this institutional Bitcoin buying often encourages retail investors to follow suit, creating positive momentum. Key Players in Recent Institutional Bitcoin Buying The entities involved in this institutional Bitcoin buying represent some of the most respected names in digital assets. Their participation lends credibility to the movement: Coinbase – Leading cryptocurrency exchange Cumberland – Prominent trading firm Galaxy Digital – Full-service digital asset platform Wintermute – Major liquidity provider Anchorage Digital – Institutional-grade custody solution What Can We Learn From This Institutional Bitcoin Buying Trend? This wave of institutional Bitcoin buying teaches us valuable lessons about market dynamics. Institutions typically have longer investment horizons and more sophisticated analysis capabilities than retail traders. Their collective action suggests they see fundamental strength in Bitcoin that outweighs short-term price concerns. This institutional Bitcoin buying behavior often precedes broader market recoveries. Conclusion: Institutional Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future The recent $405 million institutional Bitcoin buying spree sends a clear message: sophisticated investors remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. While retail investors might panic during dips, institutions see these moments as accumulation opportunities. This institutional Bitcoin buying pattern reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class and suggests continued institutional adoption ahead. Frequently Asked Questions What is institutional Bitcoin buying? Institutional Bitcoin buying refers to large-scale purchases of Bitcoin by corporations, investment firms, hedge funds, and other professional investment entities rather than individual retail investors. Why do institutions buy Bitcoin during dips? Institutions typically have long-term investment strategies and view price dips as opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices, believing in the fundamental value proposition. How does institutional buying affect Bitcoin prices? Large institutional purchases can reduce exchange supply, increase demand, and create positive market sentiment, often leading to price appreciation over time. Which institutions are most active in Bitcoin buying? Major players include cryptocurrency exchanges, trading firms, asset management companies, and corporations adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. Should retail investors follow institutional buying patterns? While institutional activity provides valuable market signals, retail investors should conduct their own research and invest according to their risk tolerance and investment goals. How can I track institutional Bitcoin buying activity? You can monitor blockchain analytics platforms, exchange flow data, and institutional custody movements to track large-scale Bitcoin purchases.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Investors Are Extremely Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that’s present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Next Major Move Comes After This Range, Analyst Says The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents the sentiment using a scale running from 0 to 100. All values above 53 correspond to a net sentiment of greed, while those below 47 imply fear in the market. The indicator being between these two cutoffs naturally suggests a neutral mentality among the investors. Besides these three main zones, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former takes place below 25 and the latter above 75. Currently, the Fear & Greed Index is in one of these zones. As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 15 at the moment, firmly inside the extreme fear territory. Sentiment among investors was already poor on Wednesday, but this latest value is even worse. The deterioration of sentiment is a result of Bitcoin retracing its recent recovery. While traders may be highly bearish toward the market right now, BTC and other assets don’t necessarily have to live up to expectations. In fact, if history is anything to go by, cryptocurrencies have often shown moves that directly go contrary to the crowd’s opinion. Many major tops and bottoms in the sector have formed alongside a sentiment of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Given this, it’s possible that the latest foray into extreme fear could also lead to a bottom for Bitcoin and others. When that might happen, however, is anyone’s guess. The latest extreme fear sentiment is the strongest since early March, but the low back then didn’t coincide with BTC’s real bottom. That said, Bitcoin did find a temporary turnaround just a few days after, which lasted until the end of the month. In April, the market crashed again, and the Fear & Greed Index declined to a low of 18. This time, the extreme fear sentiment was enough to reignite real bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why It now remains to be seen whether the current low in the indicator will be enough for the market to reach a bottom, or if sentiment will worsen still.

Across Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.77%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.35% and New Zealand’s benchmark fell 1.58%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng opened lower, while China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.16% after fresh data showed retail sales and industrial output slowed in October, dampening hopes for a recovery. Bitcoin’s drop erased recent gains fueled by optimism around institutional inflows. The token traded below $100K for the first time this month, as liquidity thinned and momentum faded. Traders said renewed institutional conviction will be key for the next leg higher. Maja Vujinovic, who leads digital assets at FG Nexus, said markets are currently under multiple layers of strain, with macro and tech-related risks combining with selling by long-term holders and a slowdown in institutional demand. Bitcoin ETF's have seen a net flow of -$963.7M over the past 9 trading days, with the trend turning right as $BTC rebounded to $115K back on October 28th.

The Euro Stoxx 50 also lost 0.83% as inflation jitters and weak corporate earnings weighed on sentiment. Fed Officials Signal Caution, Dimming Hopes For Near-Term Policy Easing Treasury yields climbed as traders dialed back bets on a December rate cut, with CME FedWatch data showing odds for easing dropping to about 46% from over 60% a day earlier. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said rates should remain restrictive to curb inflation , while St. Louis Fed chief Alberto Musalem noted limited room to ease without fueling price pressures. Their remarks reinforced market expectations that the Fed may stay on hold longer. The White House added to the gloom, saying October’s unemployment data may not be released following a record 43-day government shutdown that had already delayed key reports and clouded visibility on the economy. The pullback came as traders shifted from rate-cut euphoria to a more sober outlook on inflation, pushing risk assets lower and prompting a flight to safety.

Market data indicates a sharp rebound in both sectors, prompting many investors to seek the next breakout token and reassess their top altcoin picks. As confidence builds, Bitcoin attempts to stabilize after recent pressure, while Ethereum shows signs of steady recovery. Additionally, new entrants are rushing into emerging projects, such as Apeing ($APEING), a meme coin that is garnering notable interest around its whitelist. Many now view whitelist access as an opportunity to build stronger ROI potential during the early phases. With volatility returning, the demand for top altcoin picks continues to grow across the market. Apeing Captures Whitelist Attention As Risk Appetite Returns Apeing ($APEING) enters the scene during one of the most active periods for memecoins this season. Rising market interest supports a stronger push toward its growing whitelist, which has attracted an impressive wave of early supporters. Traders looking for top altcoin picks often focus on community strength, energy, and identity. Apeing fits that trend with a brand built around degen culture and a commitment to fun, clear communication, and community involvement. As memecoins rise again, FOMO spreads much faster. Early whitelist access often gives supporters a psychological boost, especially when the market expands rapidly. This scenario frequently appears in fast-moving cycles where new meme projects outperform larger assets for short periods. Many traders recall past cycles where early whitelist entries yielded strong returns, prompting them to act sooner. With traders hunting for top altcoin picks during renewed volatility, Apeing stands out as one of the emerging names catching attention. Joining The Apeing Whitelist During Growing FOMO Waves Many traders now rush to secure a spot on the Apeing whitelist as excitement builds across the memecoin market. Access remains simple and direct, which increases participation during periods of rising FOMO. You start by visiting the official Apeing website , where the whitelist portal sits clearly displayed for early users. After that, you add your email address to the whitelist section to register your interest. Once you complete the signup, a confirmation message arrives by email. This confirmation signals your whitelist position and keeps you updated as the project moves through its audit phase. Traders often act quickly at this stage since early access can help position them for stronger ROI when market energy increases. Ethereum Gains Strength As Traders React To Market Rebound Ethereum reacts to the NFT and memecoin rebound as traders rotate funds back into large-cap assets. Its price reclaimed the $3,583 level after reaching a monthly low of $3,250. Weekly performance shows more than 6% growth, which attracts traders searching for top altcoin picks with more stability. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,526 after hitting an intraday low of $3,380, indicating steady interest despite minor fluctuations. Rising optimism also connects to macroeconomic movement. The United States prepares to vote on a bill that could end the federal shutdown. Market history shows that renewed government stability often brings fresh liquidity into risk-on assets. Traders remember past events where easing macro pressure allowed large-cap coins to recover quickly. If the shutdown ends, Ethereum may gain more traction as capital flows back into major networks. Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure While Market Energy Shifts Bitcoin continues to struggle despite rising activity in the market. Its price sits around $103,922 after failing twice to break above the $105,000 level. Traders point to a two-and-a-half-week downtrend that still controls short-term movement. Consolidation now occurs above the $101,477 support level, which typically serves as a base during uncertain periods. Even with pressure, BTC can still shift momentum if buyers regain control. A push above $105,000 could open a path toward $108,000. Past cases show Bitcoin often takes longer to recover compared to faster-moving assets. If Bitcoin breaks resistance, broader market sentiment could improve. Many traders now monitor Bitcoin but also explore alternative assets, such as Apeing, for faster potential returns. Conclusion Crypto momentum grows stronger as memecoins return to the spotlight. Traders move back into risk assets, fueling demand for top altcoin picks that can thrive in fast conditions. Ethereum builds steady strength, Bitcoin watches for a breakout, and Apeing ($APEING) continues to pull attention through its active whitelist. Rising FOMO pushes more participants to act early as the market heats up. With fresh energy and new opportunities forming each week, smart investors should join the Apeing whitelist to secure their spot before the presale kicks off. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQ on the Top Altcoin Picks in 2025 Why is Apeing gaining so much whitelist attention? Growing interest in high-volatility assets and renewed risk appetite push traders to seek early positions. Apeing benefits from this momentum, especially as FOMO increases. How does the rebound in NFTs and memecoins impact top altcoin picks? Rising activity signals stronger market confidence and encourages traders to search for high-potential assets. Many use this period to identify new opportunities. Is Ethereum or Bitcoin better positioned during this market phase? Ethereum moves with stronger momentum due to its role in DeFi and network activity, while Bitcoin faces resistance. Both remain important but respond differently to market conditions. Summary Apeing ($APEING) attracts early attention through its growing whitelist as traders react to rising FOMO and hunt for new opportunities. Ethereum shows signs of recovery as macro stability improves, while Bitcoin struggles to break resistance. Market behavior mirrors past cycles where traders rotate into high-potential assets during rebounds. With volatility on the rise, interest in whitelist entries and breakout tokens remains high.

Related Reading: Winklevoss Twins Back Zcash (ZEC) Treasury Company With $58M Investment First Spot XRP ETF Begins Trading On Thursday, the first single-token XRP spot ETF began trading on Nasdaq, smashing the initial performance expectations of multiple experts after clearing the last regulatory hurdles this week. Following the launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC), the investment management firm asserted its conviction that “XRP Ledger represents a leading framework for global payments — purpose-built for interoperability and real-world settlement.” Notably, Canary Capital recently completed its 8-A filing for its XRPC ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and received the stock exchange’s green light on Wednesday afternoon. The Thursday launch comes amid the end of the US Government shutdown, which officially lasted 43 days and was forecasted to delay the long-awaited Altcoin ETFs until its conclusion. For context, the SEC was expected to approve multiple crypto-based investment products between early October and November, after the regulatory agency postponed the decision deadline in Q3 and released new generic listing standards for the products. However, the second wave of crypto-based investment products arrived despite the government setback, with the first set of ETFs launching over two weeks ago. On October 28, Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin and Hedera ETFs and Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) began trading after filing 8-A forms with the SEC. As crypto journalist Eleanor Terret explained, the launch was possible because an open government wasn’t required to continue the process, and the 8-A filings are “just as important” as the S-1 forms, since they register ETF shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Canary’s XRPC To Challenge BSOL’s Debut Ahead of the launch, multiple experts predicted that Canary’s spot XRP ETF could see strong demand and reach between $15 million and $35 million in volume on its first day. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, initially suggested that the investment product could hit $17 million in volume. Following the first half-hour, the XRP ETF saw $26 million in volume, the analyst noted, breaking past his original expectations. As a result, Balchunas suggested that the XRPC had a “good shot” at surpassing BSOL’s first-day volume and becoming the biggest ETF launch of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitwise’s SOL Staking ETF recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, which surged to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its first day with around $57 million in volume, beating all other launches of this year.

In the afternoon, analyst James Seyffart noted that Canary’s XRP ETF had recorded around $46 million in volume by the half-day mark, with a few more hours of trading ahead. The analyst initially suggested that XRPC could see around $34 million in volume on day one. “This is almost guaranteed to be near the top of the list for 2025 launches and still has a shot at beating $BSOL for the top spot,” Seyffart concluded.

Related Reading: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect ETH price is currently hovering above the $3,400 support zone after a volatile week marked by ETF outflows, declining volume, and intense bearish sentiment. Shutdown Resolution Lifts Market Sentiment as ETH Reclaims Stability The broader crypto market reacted positively to news of the shutdown’s resolution, helping Ethereum climb 3.18% on the day and outperform Bitcoin with a 3% gain. Analysts now expect ETH to rise toward $3,814 by November 18, representing a potential 10.37% short-term upside. Despite the improved macro backdrop, Ethereum remains in a challenging technical position. Key support lies at $3,333 and $3,300, while resistance at $3,590 and $3,666 will determine whether ETH can break its current downtrend. ETF products continue to show weakness, with all nine Ethereum ETFs recording zero inflows and a combined $107 million in outflows, suggesting institutions remain cautious. Vitalik Buterin Unveils Scaling Outlook as DeFi Matures Globally Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added optimism to the week by outlining a refreshed scaling roadmap and highlighting DeFi’s evolution into a viable global savings tool. He emphasized that the DeFi ecosystem is now “night and day” safer compared to 2020, citing better security audits, stronger protocols, and improved user-fund recovery mechanisms through innovations like the “walkaway test.” Central to Buterin’s roadmap is Ethereum’s ongoing Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling strategy. With rollups, data availability upgrades, and new high-throughput solutions, such as systems already achieving over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin believes Ethereum is on track to support the next wave of DeFi adoption. He urged developers to maintain Ethereum’s core values: openness, censorship resistance, and interoperability. Buterin warned that abandoning these principles risks turning Ethereum into a “walled garden,” undermining the ecosystem’s global mission. Institutional RWA Demand Surges as ETH Eyes Breakout Above $3,700 A growing bright spot for Ethereum is the explosive expansion of tokenised real-world assets (RWAs). More than $200 billion worth of RWAs now sit on-chain, driven by major institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The BUIDL fund’s tokenised Treasury products, built natively on Ethereum, showcase the network’s rising importance in traditional finance. Institutional RWA assets have surged nearly 2,000% since January 2024, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals even as short-term volatility persists. Related Reading: European Banking Regulator Says EU Crypto Framework Addresses ECB’s Stablecoin Concerns Technically, Ethereum remains in a descending channel from its failed August rally toward $5,000. Analysts note that a decisive breakout above $3,700 could flip market structure bullish and reopen paths toward $4,700, especially if macro stability continues after the shutdown settlement.

In a recent video, he voiced a strong belief that the token is nearing a pivotal moment. His message was direct and urgent, emphasizing that those waiting on the sidelines may regret not taking action while the price remains low. Belief in XRP’s Value and Utility Time Traveler argued that XRP’s price has been held back compared to other major digital assets that have recently gained substantial value. He pointed to examples, such as Chainlink and Solana, referencing how their prices have surged over time. “Just one of those is like $20 now,” he said, using their performance to illustrate what he believes could be XRP’s next stage of growth. He rejected any notion that XRP is less valuable or less capable than its competitors, saying that the opposite is true. “It’s the best asset,” he insisted, citing XRP’s established role as a utility token designed for efficient global transfers. His remarks align with the view held by many long-term holders that XRP’s strength lies in its function as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. I'm running out of opportunities to tell you this. Time is accelerating. pic.twitter.com/xo8a0OpIYy — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) November 11, 2025 A Sense of Urgency Among Supporters The tone of his message sounded urgent. “If you don’t start buying XRP right now, you’ll never see these prices again,” he warned, stressing that investors who hesitate may miss a crucial opportunity. He compared the situation to previous moments in cryptocurrency history when early-stage assets later became highly valuable, urging followers not to overlook what he considers a similar setup for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His appeal also carried a personal note, emphasizing his frustration with skeptics who remain unconvinced despite what he sees as clear signs of appreciation to come . “I don’t want you to see that later and then find out the hard way,” he said. He noted that even modest investments, he added, could become significant over time. Why His Message Resonates with the XRP Community Many XRP supporters share Time Traveler’s belief that the token is positioned for a major breakout . They argue that its regulatory clarity, technological infrastructure, and integration with payment systems could create sustained demand once broader market conditions align. By calling XRP “the best utility crypto for transfers,” Time Traveler reaffirmed a central point of confidence within the community: XRP’s core purpose of facilitating real-world financial activity distinguishes it from purely speculative assets.

According to Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb, the current crypto downturn might be much less concerning than it appears. In a recent social media analysis, he provided compelling historical context that could change your perspective on market conditions. Why This Crypto Downturn Feels Different Haseeb’s assessment comes from deep industry experience. He suggests that many investors have forgotten the true severity of past market collapses. The current crypto downturn, while noticeable, lacks the systemic risks that characterized previous crises. When we examine market fundamentals rather than just price movements, the picture becomes clearer. The underlying technology continues to advance, institutional adoption grows steadily, and regulatory frameworks are becoming more defined. These factors create a much more stable foundation than during previous market stress periods. Remembering the 2022 Market Collapse To understand why the current crypto downturn seems manageable, we need to recall what real market stress looks like. Haseeb vividly described the 2022 sequence of events that created genuine panic: Terra-LUNA ecosystem collapse Three Arrows Capital failure FTX exchange implosion Genesis and BlockFi bankruptcies NFT market valuation crash This period represented what Haseeb called a house of cards scenario . Multiple interconnected failures created domino effects that threatened the entire digital asset ecosystem. Banks faced liquidity crises, stablecoins lost their pegs, and regulatory pressure intensified dramatically. What Makes the Current Situation Different? The current crypto downturn primarily involves price corrections rather than fundamental breakdowns. Unlike 2022, we’re not seeing: Major exchange collapses Systemic stablecoin failures Widespread institutional bankruptcies Regulatory emergency interventions Market infrastructure has matured significantly. Exchange reserves are more transparent, lending practices have improved, and risk management across the industry has evolved. This crypto downturn reflects normal market cycles rather than structural weaknesses. Key Indicators Showing Market Strength Despite the current crypto downturn, several positive indicators suggest underlying strength: Developer activity continues growing Institutional investment pipelines remain active Network usage metrics show steady adoption Regulatory clarity is improving globally These fundamentals matter more than short-term price movements. They represent the real value being built in the cryptocurrency space, regardless of market sentiment fluctuations. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility How should investors approach this crypto downturn? Consider these strategies: Focus on long-term fundamentals rather than daily price action Diversify across different blockchain projects and use cases Maintain appropriate risk management and position sizing Use volatility as an opportunity for strategic accumulation The current environment may actually present better entry points for long-term investors. Historical patterns suggest that buying during fear periods often yields better returns than buying during euphoria phases. Conclusion: Perspective Matters in Market Cycles Haseeb’s analysis provides valuable context for understanding market cycles. The current crypto downturn, while uncomfortable, lacks the systemic risks that made previous corrections truly dangerous. Market infrastructure has matured, regulatory frameworks are developing, and fundamental adoption continues. This perspective doesn’t mean ignoring risks, but rather understanding their relative severity. The crypto downturn we’re experiencing represents normal market behavior rather than ecosystem collapse. For informed investors, this distinction makes all the difference in navigation strategy. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this crypto downturn last? Market cycles vary in duration, but current indicators suggest this could be a shorter correction phase. Most analysts expect stabilization within several months based on fundamental strength. Should I sell during this crypto downturn? Panic selling rarely produces good outcomes. Consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Many experienced investors use downturns to accumulate positions at better valuations. What signs should I watch for recovery? Key recovery indicators include increasing trading volumes, positive regulatory developments, institutional investment flows, and improving market sentiment metrics. How does this compare to previous bear markets? This downturn appears less severe than 2018 or 2022 bear markets. The absence of major exchange failures or stablecoin collapses suggests better underlying ecosystem health. Are cryptocurrency fundamentals still strong? Yes, core fundamentals remain robust. Developer activity, network usage, and institutional adoption continue growing despite price volatility. What protection exists against another FTX-style collapse? Significant improvements include better exchange transparency, proof-of-reserves requirements, enhanced regulatory oversight, and improved industry risk management practices.

This massive market move has sent shockwaves through trading communities worldwide, highlighting the extreme volatility and risks inherent in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation happens when traders using leverage get their positions forcibly closed by exchanges. This occurs when their collateral can no longer cover potential losses. The recent $310 million crypto futures liquidation represents one of the largest hourly wipeouts we’ve seen this year, demonstrating how quickly markets can turn against leveraged positions. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Occur? Several factors converged to trigger this dramatic crypto futures liquidation event. First, unexpected market volatility caught many traders off guard. Second, over-leveraged positions amplified the impact of price movements. Third, cascading liquidations created a domino effect that accelerated the process. Sudden price drops triggered margin calls High leverage ratios magnified losses Automated systems executed forced closures Market sentiment shift accelerated selling pressure How Can Traders Avoid Future Liquidation Events? Protecting yourself from crypto futures liquidation requires careful risk management. Always use proper position sizing and avoid excessive leverage. Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels and maintain adequate margin buffers. Remember, the $310 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder that markets can move violently against even the most confident traders. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? This significant crypto futures liquidation event has several implications for the broader market. It may lead to reduced leverage offerings from exchanges and increased caution among traders. However, it also presents buying opportunities for those with available capital. The $1.02 billion in 24-hour liquidations suggests we’re seeing a major market reset. Essential Risk Management Strategies To survive future crypto futures liquidation waves, implement these proven strategies. Use maximum 5x leverage for most trades. Diversify your portfolio across different assets. Monitor markets closely during high volatility periods. Most importantly, never risk more than you can afford to lose in any crypto futures liquidation scenario. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when your position’s maintenance margin falls below required levels, forcing automatic closure by the exchange. How can I calculate my liquidation price? Most exchanges provide liquidation calculators. Generally, higher leverage means your liquidation price moves closer to your entry price. Can I prevent forced liquidation? Yes, by adding more collateral, reducing position size, or using lower leverage ratios before reaching critical levels. What happens to my funds after liquidation? The exchange uses your remaining collateral to cover losses, and any leftover funds return to your account balance. Are all exchanges’ liquidation mechanisms the same? No, different exchanges use varying methods like partial liquidation, auto-deleveraging, or insurance funds to handle liquidations. How often do large liquidation events occur? Major crypto futures liquidation events typically happen during periods of extreme volatility or unexpected news developments.

Meanwhile, the US dollar continues to show dollar weakness amid growing economic uncertainty that has traders questioning the global economic recovery timeline. Why are Asian currencies struggling to gain momentum? Most Asian currencies traded within narrow ranges as market participants digested the latest economic data and central bank signals.

Ripple dropped for four consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since November 10. It dropped even as the spot XRP ETF launched in the United States. Canary XRP ETF had a strong debut The XRP price remains in a deep bear market after plunging by almost 40% from its highest level this year. This decline happened even as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC). The XRPC ETF had a strong debut, with the first-day volume of over $58 million. It also attracted millions of dollars in inflows as Wall Street placed a bet in the fourth-biggest coin in the crypto industry. Most importantly, more XRP ETFs will be launched in the coming weeks now that many of them have been listed on the DTCC platform. This includes ETFs by companies like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and 21Shares. Why XRP price dropped after the ETF launch The XRP price remained on edge for a few reasons. First, the decline was in line with the performance of the crypto market crash that saw Bitcoin and most altcoins plunge. Bitcoin price plunged to $97,200, while Ethereum plunged by 10% in the last 24 hours to $3,125. Other top tokens like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). The total market cap of all coins dropped by over 5.4% in the last 24 hours to $3.26 trillion, meaning that investors have lost over $1 trillion this year. The XRP price is crashing as a sense of fear prevails in the market. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has moved downwards to the fear zone of 22. The state of fear is demonstrated in the performance in the futures market. Data shows that XRP’s futures open interest dropped to $3.65 billion, down from the year-to-date high of over $10 billion. Falling open interest is a sign that investors are using less leverage to bet on the coin. Historically, cryptocurrencies do well when the open interest is rising. Another sign is the performance of the futures funding rate, which has remained flat in the past few weeks. It even moved downwards below zero on Friday. A falling funding rate is normally a sign that investors in the futures market expect the token future price to be lower than the spot one. All this is happening because of the giant liquidation that happened on October 11 when tokens worth over $610 million were wiped out. Ripple price death cross pattern XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals have contributed to the ongoing XRP price crash that has pushed it from a high of $3.66 in July to the current $2.29. It has continued to form a series of lower lows and lower highs as the downtrend continued. Ripple price has now formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages have crossed each other. The token remains below the Supertrend indicator and the Ichimoku cloud.

This stunning Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most significant achievements in cryptocurrency history, with BTC trading at $98,032 on the Binance USDT market according to Bitcoin World market monitoring. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The current Bitcoin price surge didn’t happen overnight. Several key factors have contributed to this impressive upward movement. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major corporations and investment firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has boosted investor confidence significantly. Market analysts point to multiple catalysts behind this Bitcoin price surge. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event creates natural supply constraints, while global economic uncertainty drives demand for decentralized assets. Additionally, technological improvements in the Bitcoin network have enhanced its utility and security features. How Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Compare to Previous Highs? This current Bitcoin price surge represents a substantial breakthrough compared to previous market cycles. The $98,000 level marks a crucial psychological barrier that many traders had been watching closely. Historical data shows that when Bitcoin breaks through major resistance levels, it often creates momentum for further gains. Consider these key comparisons: Previous all-time high: $69,000 in November 2021 Current trading level: $98,032 represents 42% increase Trading volume: Significantly higher than previous peaks Market sentiment: More institutional participation What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This Bitcoin price surge presents both opportunities and considerations for cryptocurrency investors. For long-term holders, the breakthrough validates their investment strategy and demonstrates Bitcoin’s growing store of value proposition. However, new investors should approach with careful research and risk management. Key considerations for investors: Diversification remains crucial despite the impressive Bitcoin price surge Volatility management through proper position sizing Long-term perspective rather than short-term speculation Security measures for digital asset storage Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? Market experts remain cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of this Bitcoin price surge. Technical analysis suggests strong support levels have formed, while fundamental factors like increasing adoption and limited supply continue to provide tailwinds. However, investors should always prepare for potential corrections in volatile markets. The current Bitcoin price surge reflects growing mainstream acceptance and technological maturity. As more traditional financial institutions integrate Bitcoin services and more countries establish clear regulatory frameworks, the foundation for continued growth appears solid. Nevertheless, responsible investing practices remain essential. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $98,000? The Bitcoin price surge resulted from combined factors including institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, supply constraints from the upcoming halving, and increased global demand for alternative assets. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this price surge? While timing markets is challenging, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, investors should only allocate funds they can afford to lose and maintain a diversified portfolio. How high could Bitcoin price go from here? Predictions vary widely among analysts, with some projecting six-figure prices within the next year. However, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. What risks should I consider during a Bitcoin price surge? Key risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, technological risks, security concerns, and potential market corrections after rapid price increases. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price surge? This depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Some investors take profits during surges, while others maintain long-term positions. How can I safely buy Bitcoin during a price surge? Use reputable exchanges, enable security features like two-factor authentication, store assets in secure wallets, and only invest through regulated platforms when possible.

Banks claim stablecoin perks amount to “indirect interest,” while Coinbase insists the law applies only to stablecoin issuers and warned that banks are trying to control how consumers use their own money. Despite the pressure, Coinbase’s policy chief Faryar Shirzad says he is still confident that regulators will rely on the law’s plain text rather than expand its scope. Coinbase Clashes With Banks Crypto exchange Coinbase sharply criticized a coalition of US banking groups for urging regulators to ban merchant rewards, cashbacks and discounts tied to stablecoin payments, calling the proposal “unamerican” and an overreach that goes beyond what the law requires. The dispute centers on the GENIUS Act, which bars stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield to token holders. Banking lobbyists argue this prohibition should extend indirectly to crypto exchanges and affiliated businesses, as they claim rewards offered by third parties amount to “indirect interest” if those entities have financial ties to the stablecoin issuer. Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad rejected that interpretation in a post on X , and called on regulators to “stick to the statutory text.” He also warned that bank lobbyists are trying to dictate how Americans use their own money after a stablecoin is issued. He argued that the banking sector’s stance is rooted in fear that stablecoins could disrupt the traditional financial system, where banks rely heavily on customer deposits to support lending. That concern isn’t unfounded. In fact, a US Treasury estimate from April suggested widespread stablecoin usage could pull more than $6.6 trillion in deposits out of banks. Coinbase also claims stablecoins could meaningfully reduce merchant payment costs, including the more than $180 billion in card fees paid by US retailers in 2024. If third-party rewards programs are shut down, Coinbase argues, merchants and consumers would be pushed back toward traditional card networks that benefit from high fees. Banking groups, however, seem determined to block any stablecoin-based payment model that could erode bank deposits or challenge entrenched payments infrastructure. Crypto exchanges have clear incentives to defend stablecoin usage , as higher stablecoin payment and trading activity generates additional revenue. Many exchanges issue branded credit cards offering crypto rewards or cashbacks, a model Coinbase now worries could be jeopardized if regulators adopt the banks’ interpretation. Even so, Shirzad said he is still hopeful that “common sense will prevail” and that regulators won’t expand the GENIUS Act’s restrictions beyond what Congress intended.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 05:30:00

This Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal represents a strategic shift that could signal important market trends for the popular decentralized exchange token. What Does This Galaxy Digital UNI Withdrawal Really Mean? When institutional players like Galaxy Digital move assets off exchanges, it typically indicates a long-term holding strategy. The recent Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal involved 324,000 UNI tokens removed from Binance and Bybit, suggesting the company sees value in accumulating this asset rather than trading it actively. This type of movement often precedes price appreciation because it reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. Moreover, institutional Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal actions frequently influence retail investor behavior and market sentiment. Why Are Exchange Withdrawals So Important? Understanding the significance of exchange movements helps decode market psychology. Here’s why this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal matters: Reduced selling pressure – Tokens moved to cold storage cannot be immediately sold Long-term confidence – Institutions typically hold assets they believe will appreciate Market sentiment indicator – Large withdrawals often precede bullish movements Supply dynamics – Less circulating supply can lead to price increases The timing of this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal comes as the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, making the move particularly noteworthy for UNI token holders and potential investors. How Does This Impact UNI Token Investors? For current UNI token holders, this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal could be interpreted as a positive signal. When respected institutions demonstrate confidence in an asset through accumulation rather than distribution, it often validates the investment thesis for retail participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that while the Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal suggests optimism, it doesn’t guarantee price appreciation. Market conditions, broader crypto trends, and UNI-specific developments will ultimately determine the token’s performance. What Can We Learn From Institutional Moves? Tracking institutional activity like this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal provides valuable insights into market sentiment. Institutions typically conduct extensive research before making significant moves, making their actions worth monitoring for retail investors. The pattern of withdrawing assets from exchanges for long-term holding has historically preceded major bull runs in individual tokens and the broader market. This particular Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal fits that pattern, suggesting potential accumulation phase beginning. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Market Movements The recent Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal represents more than just a transaction – it’s a statement of confidence in UNI’s long-term value proposition. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, institutional moves like this deserve attention from anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets and investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is the significance of withdrawing tokens from exchanges? Withdrawing tokens from exchanges typically indicates a long-term holding strategy since assets moved to private wallets are less likely to be sold immediately. How much UNI did Galaxy Digital withdraw? Galaxy Digital withdrew 324,000 UNI tokens worth approximately $2.4 million from Binance and Bybit exchanges. Does this mean UNI price will increase? While large withdrawals often precede price increases due to reduced selling pressure, many factors influence cryptocurrency prices beyond single institutional moves. Why is Galaxy Digital’s move important? As a respected institutional player, Galaxy Digital’s actions often influence market sentiment and can signal confidence in specific assets. Should I buy UNI because of this withdrawal? Investment decisions should be based on comprehensive research and personal risk tolerance, not just single institutional movements. How can I track similar institutional moves? Various blockchain analytics platforms and crypto news services track large wallet movements and exchange flows for major cryptocurrencies.

The stablecoin’s recent surge to its highest point since April has crypto investors on high alert, as historical patterns suggest this could signal an approaching bear market. Let’s explore what this Tether dominance increase means for your portfolio and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What Does Rising Tether Dominance Actually Mean? Tether dominance refers to USDT’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Currently sitting at $184 billion, this stablecoin has become the go-to safe haven during market turbulence. When investors get nervous about volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they often flock to Tether as a digital dollar alternative. This flight to safety creates the Tether dominance patterns we’re seeing today. Why Should You Care About Tether’s Market Position? The current Tether dominance level matters because it coincides with significant market pressure. Bitcoin has dropped 11% this month alone, while other major cryptocurrencies follow similar downward trajectories. Historical data reveals that rapid increases in Tether dominance frequently occur at the beginning of bear markets. Moreover, this shift often aligns with technical indicators like the MACD crossing above the zero line. Consider these key implications of rising Tether dominance: Increased market uncertainty and risk aversion Potential prolonged cryptocurrency price declines Higher trading volume in stablecoins versus volatile assets Reduced liquidity across altcoin markets How Can Investors Navigate This Tether Dominance Environment? Understanding Tether dominance patterns provides valuable insights for portfolio management. During periods of high Tether dominance, consider rebalancing your holdings toward more stable assets. Many experienced traders use these signals to adjust their risk exposure and protect their capital. However, remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results – always conduct your own research. What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Markets? While current Tether dominance levels suggest caution, they don’t necessarily predict long-term market direction. Cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and can shift rapidly. The increasing Tether dominance does highlight growing investor preference for stability during uncertain times. Monitoring these trends helps you make informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions. To summarize, the rising Tether dominance serves as an important market indicator that demands attention. While it suggests potential bearish conditions ahead, smart investors use this information to strategize rather than panic. By understanding what drives Tether dominance changes, you can better position yourself for whatever market conditions emerge. Frequently Asked Questions What is Tether dominance? Tether dominance measures USDT’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market value. It indicates how much of the market’s value is held in this particular stablecoin. Why does rising Tether dominance signal a bear market? When Tether dominance increases, it typically means investors are selling volatile cryptocurrencies and moving into stablecoins. This risk-off behavior often precedes or accompanies market downturns. How high has Tether dominance reached? Tether dominance has climbed to its highest level since April, with USDT’s market cap reaching $184 billion amid broader cryptocurrency market declines. Should I sell my cryptocurrencies when Tether dominance rises? Not necessarily. While rising Tether dominance suggests caution, it should be one of many factors in your decision-making process. Consider your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and market analysis before making changes. What other indicators should I watch with Tether dominance? Monitor Bitcoin dominance, trading volumes, MACD indicators, and broader market sentiment alongside Tether dominance for a comprehensive market view. Can Tether dominance predict market bottoms? Historically, extremely high Tether dominance has sometimes coincided with market bottoms, as it indicates maximum fear and potential buying opportunities, though this isn’t guaranteed.

Here's Why and the Latest Data!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-drop-sharply-heres-why-and-the-latest-data/,"The cryptocurrency market has seen a sharp sell-off in recent hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $97,000, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. The downtrend wasn't limited to Bitcoin and spread to altcoins as well. Ethereum (ETH) fell 9.1% to $3,180, Ripple (XRP) fell 6.6% to $2.30, Solana (SOL) fell 8% to around $142, Binance Coin (BNB) fell 5%, Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 6.3%, and Cardano (ADA) fell 7.4%. The decline is attributed to the prolonged shutdown of the US federal government, which prevented the Fed from reaching key economic indicators. The decline is driven by the growing likelihood that the Fed will hold interest rates steady in December. As investor confidence eroded, Bitcoin fell back below $100,000, and riskier assets experienced a major correction. Liquidation pressure in the futures market also increased simultaneously, amplifying losses. According to Coinglass data, the majority of the liquidations over the past 24 hours came from long positions. A total of $891 million in long positions were liquidated, while $132 million in short positions were liquidated. The data predicts that if Bitcoin falls below $95,000, long liquidity on major centralized exchanges (CEX) could reach $723 million. Conversely, if Bitcoin rises above $99,000, short liquidity is estimated to be around $718 million. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Drop Sharply!

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is down 4% this week as the market remains bearish. The price continues to hold above the $3,000 support, but buyers appear absent, which may extend the downtrend. With sellers in control since the start of November, momentum indicators such as the MACD and RSI are starting to look oversold on lower timeframes, including the 4-hour. A bullish divergence is also appearing, which gives hope for a relief rally soon. Looking ahead, Ethereum may bounce to recover some of the recent losses, but the resistance at $3,800 could stop any attempts at a significant reversal. Source: TradingView Ripple (XRP) Surprisingly, XRP is up 3% compared to the same period last week. Despite this brief bounce, the momentum remains bearish, and the price is struggling to stay above the $ 2.30 support. The current performance is largely tied to the launch of the first spot XRP ETF this week. One positive aspect is that the sell volume has been declining since October, which could signal that bears are becoming exhausted. That could allow buyers to return. The key resistance is found at $2.43. Looking ahead, XRP remains in a challenging position, but there is a real chance that buyers can reverse this trend if the support at $ 2.30 is defended effectively. Source: TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA remains close to 50 cents despite several attempts to move higher. The bias is bearish, and the price closed the week with a 3% loss. There is simply no force to push the price higher at this time. While the momentum indicators show some exhaustion on the sellers’ side, this downtrend can continue for some time until buyers return. Key support levels are found at 50 and 45 cents. Looking ahead, ADA needs to break away from this downtrend. That starts by moving above 60 cents. However, this seems like a challenging task now. Source: TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin lost its sparkle in the past few weeks as its price continues to make lower lows. The price is down 5% this week and has also lost the support at $1,000, which has now become resistance. This is bearish. The next significant support is found at $900. Should that fail as well, buyers could then retreat to the $800 level. With momentum favouring bears right now, it is unlikely for any recovery to happen any time soon. Looking ahead, best to let BNB correct and find a key support that can hold before considering any exposure. Source: TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) If we zoom out, HYPE has been making lower highs since September. This puts the price action in a bearish trend with strong support around $36. However, repeated tests of this level could lead to a breakdown with lower lows. At the time of this post, the momentum is bearish and the price closed the week with a 4% loss. The optimism and hype that once characterised this cryptocurrency seems to have vanished. But this could also present an opportunity to accumulate at a discount. Looking ahead, HYPE needs to hold above $36 to stop the downtrend. Any failure there will see sellers encouraged to continue their pressure.

In a surprising revelation, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi has made it clear that the company’s Kraken US listing isn’t happening anytime soon. This strategic decision comes despite growing anticipation in the crypto community about when one of the world’s largest exchanges would make its market debut. Why Isn’t Kraken Rushing Its US Listing? During a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Sethi explained the company’s thoughtful approach. Kraken maintains strong financial health as a private entity, eliminating any urgent need for public funding. The company effectively manages its risks and operates from a position of strength rather than necessity. This calculated delay in the Kraken US listing reflects several key advantages: Financial independence without shareholder pressure Greater operational flexibility in a volatile market Ability to focus on long-term strategy over quarterly results Reduced regulatory complexity during market uncertainty What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The delayed Kraken US listing actually signals positive news for the broader crypto ecosystem. When a company of Kraken’s stature can afford to wait, it demonstrates the maturity and resilience of the cryptocurrency industry. Private companies maintaining strong financial positions without public markets indicate healthy industry fundamentals. Moreover, this approach allows Kraken to: Continue innovating without public market scrutiny Weather regulatory changes more effectively Maintain strategic focus on user experience and security Build stronger foundations before public exposure How Does This Compare to Other Crypto Exchanges? Kraken’s stance on its US listing timeline differs significantly from some competitors who rushed to public markets. This patience reflects Sethi’s confidence in the company’s current trajectory and financial management. The decision suggests that Kraken values strategic timing over being first to market. The company’s approach highlights several benefits of remaining private: Avoiding short-term market pressures Maintaining control over company direction Reducing compliance costs and complexity Focusing on core business operations What’s Next for Kraken’s Growth Strategy? While the Kraken US listing remains on the distant horizon, the company continues to expand its services and global presence. Sethi emphasized that being private doesn’t limit their ambition—it actually enhances their ability to execute long-term plans without quarterly performance pressures. The company’s current priorities include: Enhancing platform security and features Expanding into new markets and services Building stronger regulatory relationships Developing innovative crypto products Conclusion: Strategic Patience in a Rapid Market Kraken’s deliberate approach to its US listing demonstrates remarkable confidence in an industry known for rapid moves. This calculated patience suggests that when Kraken eventually does go public, it will be from a position of undeniable strength rather than financial necessity. The delay ultimately benefits users and the broader crypto ecosystem by allowing continued focus on innovation and security. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Kraken delaying its US listing? Kraken’s CEO states the company is financially strong and doesn’t need immediate public funding, allowing them to focus on long-term strategy without quarterly pressure. When does Kraken plan to go public? No specific timeline has been announced. The company considers going public a future possibility rather than an immediate priority. How does this affect Kraken users? Users benefit from continued focus on platform improvements and security without the distractions of public market requirements. Is Kraken financially stable without going public? Yes, according to CEO Arjun Sethi, the company maintains strong financial health and effective risk management as a private entity. Will Kraken consider listing outside the US? The current discussion focuses specifically on US listing plans, though the company operates globally and could consider other markets. How does this compare to Coinbase’s approach? Kraken is taking a more patient approach compared to Coinbase’s earlier public listing, reflecting different strategic priorities.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Booking Profits In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the supply of the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs). These are referred to as the investors holding their coins for a period longer than 155 days, without selling or involving them in a transaction on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their long holding times are usually considered to be resolute entities. Despite their resilience, however, there are times when even these diamond hands can decide to part with their holdings. One such time happens to be right now. As the below chart shared by Glassnode shows, the Bitcoin LTHs have been reducing their supply recently. This latest wave of selling from the LTHs isn’t their first for the cycle. As is apparent in the graph, these HODLers sold into both the 2024 rallies as well. In between these selloffs, their supply was rising with significant speed. Something to note is that while LTH selling is instantly registered in the chart, the same isn’t true for buying. When the LTH supply grows, it doesn’t mean any accumulation is happening in the present. Rather, what it implies is that some coins were bought five months ago, which have now been held long enough to clear the LTH threshold. The last wave of coin maturation into the LTH cohort peaked in mid-2025. Since then, the group has been shedding coins at a variable rate. The latest trend has clearly been that of acceleration, as the below chart visualizes. The accelerating wave of distribution from the LTHs has arrived as Bitcoin has been suffering from bearish momentum. It’s possible that some of the HODLers are thinking this could be their last chance to take profits, so they have decided to exit.

Historically, bull markets have sustained so long as fresh demand has kept coming in to absorb the selling from the diamond hands, so it remains to be seen whether the price plunge will be met with an injection of demand, or if this selling will lead into an extended bearish phase for Bitcoin.

In his words, “The math behind XRP is simple because it’s built to bridge every major asset class.” He linked to a YouTube video , featuring remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. At the Ripple Swell 2025 conference , Garlinghouse explored XRP’s structure supporting its role as a global liquidity bridge that connects markets for bonds, foreign exchange, commodities, and tokenized assets. In the video, Aljarrah explained that most people view XRP merely as a cryptocurrency to trade. Whereas, in reality, it was engineered to serve as a foundational mechanism for global value transfer . He argued that its design enables it to efficiently move trillions in liquidity, positioning it as a settlement instrument for both institutional and cross-border payments. This, according to him, makes the asset’s high valuation a matter of utility and necessity rather than speculation. The math behind $XRP is simple because it’s built to bridge every major asset class, bonds, FX, commodities, and tokenized debt. As global liquidity consolidates through drops, price becomes a function of utility. That’s how $10,000+ per XRP is achieved. https://t.co/58xzv1KvUv — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 10, 2025 Fractionalization and Liquidity Efficiency A key component of Aljarrah’s reasoning centered on XRP’s fractional divisibility. Each token can be divided into 1 million smaller units known as drops. He explained that this allows transactions of any size, from micro to institutional scale, without friction. For example, at $10,000 per XRP, a single drop would equal one cent , maintaining usability for small payments and improving efficiency. “A $1 billion cross-border payment at $1 per XRP requires $1 billion XRP,” he said. “At $10,000 per XRP, that same payment only requires $100,000 XRP.” He stated that this dynamic reduces slippage, stabilizes volatility, and accelerates settlement times, enhancing XRP’s role as an institutional-grade liquidity solution . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply, Demand, and Global Financial Scale Aljarrah highlighted that XRP’s fixed 100 billion supply and global liquidity demand mathematically justify a higher valuation. The fundamental analyst referenced $7 trillion in daily FX trades and $700 trillion in derivatives. This explains that even small adoption levels could require XRP to represent significant value. Using cross-border payments as an example, he said that if 1% of $150 trillion in annual volume, or about $1.5 trillion, were bridged by $25 billion in circulating XRP, “each XRP would represent $60,000 in bridged value.” Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Vision Garlinghouse’s closing remarks at Swell 2025 highlighted Ripple’s growth and its integration with major financial institutions , payment providers, and ETF issuers. He described the moment as “the rewiring of financial infrastructure.” Aljarrah added that XRP’s finite supply, liquidity, and utility form a system where “the price is infinite if you really think about it.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $8.99, driven by increasing adoption and ecosystem growth. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could experience a substantial surge, potentially reaching a maximum price of $20.88 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its current price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price dropped by 8.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.3 and $2.85, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for November 14 shows that NEAR current value has fallen back to $2.3 after failing to support itself above the $3.00 mark. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR declines toward $2.3 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the NEAR Protocol price rose to $3.20 mark before finding significant resistance levels resulting in a sharp drop below $2.00. However, after a brief stay below the level, the price rose sharply to the $3.00 mark before finding resistance. The rejection at the level sent NEAR back to the $2.3 mark where it trades at press time. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The technical indicators suggest declining bullish momentum as NEAR falls towards the $2.3 mark. The EMAs are below the mean position, and the latest data shows rising bearish pressure. The RSI also shares this sentiment as the indicator fell to 48.41 from the 70.00 index level and suggests room for further downward movement in short term. The converging Bollinger Bands suggest increasing volatility, indicating that the $2.30 level may hold the weekend. NEAR price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour price chart of NEAR shows that NEAR crashed to the $2.3 mark before finding support. Buyers are strongly defending any further decline as NEAR broke below immediate Fib channels. Sellers are currently dominating as they consolidate the price around EMA trend lines.

NEAR Protocol distinguishes itself in the cryptocurrency market capitalization, emphasizing scalability, usability, and developer-friendliness. It aims to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, catering to developers and end-users. NEAR’s innovative technology and user-centric approach make it attractive for institutional adoption and mainstream adoption of blockchain applications. With a focus on user experience and developer tools, NEAR Protocol is positioned to drive significant medium term growth in the decentralized application ecosystem. Its potential to disrupt traditional industries and capture market share in the blockchain space makes it an intriguing investment opportunity for those interested in innovative technology solutions. Why is NEAR down? NEAR records a sharp drop to the current $2.3 mark after the bulls failed to maintain the momentum above the $3.00 mark. Will NEAR recover? NEAR protocol price has seen a massive selloff in the last thirty days as price fell from near the $3.00 mark to the current $2 price level. However, analysts believe that this bearish momentum will be short-term, predicting a price range of $2.25 and the $5.5 by the end of 2025. Will NEAR reach $10? In the past few days NEAR observed a quick recovery to the $2.80 level where it faced short-term resistance and crashed back below the $2.70 mark. Will NEAR reach $20? NEAR protocol price is expected to cross the $20 threshold by 2031 This supports the long term forecast as the industry continues to see increasing adoption across the mainstream. The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth. If NEAR continues its current trajectory, it can reach $50 in the next several years. Does NEAR have a good long term future? Yes, NEAR has a good long-term future due to its innovative technology, focus on scalability and strong ecosystem development, which supports a favorable price prediction.

Recent data reveals a startling trend: long-term Ethereum holders selling their assets at the fastest pace since December 2021. As ETH prices declined from their late August peak, investors who held the cryptocurrency for 3 to 10 years are now liquidating approximately 45,000 ETH daily based on a 90-day moving average. Why Are Ethereum Holders Selling Now? According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this represents the highest level of selling activity from this particular cohort in nearly two years. These aren’t day traders or short-term speculators – these are the investors who weathered previous market cycles and believed in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Their decision to sell now raises important questions about market sentiment and future price direction. Understanding the 45,000 ETH Daily Exodus The scale of this selling pressure is significant. Consider these key points: 45,000 ETH represents approximately $70 million in daily selling pressure This selling comes from holders with 3-10 year investment horizons The 90-day moving average smooths out temporary fluctuations This marks the highest selling level since the 2021 market peak What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? When long-term Ethereum holders selling accelerates, it typically signals several market dynamics. First, it indicates profit-taking after significant price appreciation. Second, it may reflect concerns about upcoming market conditions or regulatory developments. However, it’s crucial to remember that market bottoms often form when weak hands capitulate and strong hands accumulate. Historical Context of Ethereum Holder Behavior The current selling pattern mirrors December 2021 activity, which preceded a substantial market correction. However, market conditions today differ significantly. Ethereum’s ecosystem has matured, with growing institutional adoption and technological improvements. The fundamental value proposition remains strong despite short-term price pressure from Ethereum holders selling their positions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For current investors, this data provides valuable signals: Monitor on-chain metrics for early trend detection Diversify your portfolio across different time horizons Consider dollar-cost averaging during volatility Focus on Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Market Impact of Sustained Selling Pressure The consistent selling by long-term Ethereum holders creates immediate price headwinds. However, this redistribution of assets can lead to healthier market structure over time. New buyers entering at lower prices may establish stronger support levels. The key question remains whether this represents a temporary adjustment or a fundamental shift in investor sentiment toward Ethereum. The trend of Ethereum holders selling at current levels provides crucial market intelligence. While concerning in the short term, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of Ethereum’s development trajectory and growing adoption. Market cycles typically see ownership transfer from weak to strong hands during periods of uncertainty. Frequently Asked Questions How significant is 45,000 ETH in daily selling? 45,000 ETH represents substantial selling pressure, equivalent to approximately $70 million daily at current prices. This level of activity from long-term holders is particularly noteworthy. Why are long-term holders selling now? Long-term holders may be taking profits after price appreciation, rebalancing portfolios, or responding to changing market conditions and regulatory concerns. Does this signal a market top for Ethereum? While increased selling from long-term holders often precedes price corrections, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a permanent top. Market dynamics are complex and influenced by multiple factors. How reliable is Glassnode’s data? Glassnode is a respected on-chain analytics provider with reliable tracking methodologies. Their 90-day moving average provides a smoothed view of trends. Should I sell my Ethereum because holders are selling? Investment decisions should be based on your individual strategy, risk tolerance, and research rather than following crowd behavior. What happens after this selling wave ends? Historically, when long-term holder selling subsides, it often marks a potential accumulation phase and can precede price recovery. Found this analysis insightful?

The crypto world just witnessed a staggering XRP transfer of 92,634,593 tokens to Coinbase, worth approximately $214 million. This monumental transaction, reported by Whale Alert, has sent ripples through the entire digital asset space. What Does This Massive XRP Transfer Mean? When an unknown wallet moves nearly 93 million XRP to a major exchange like Coinbase, it typically signals one of several possibilities. The sender might be preparing to sell, which could temporarily impact XRP’s price. Alternatively, they could be moving funds for security reasons or institutional purposes. This particular XRP transfer represents one of the largest single movements we’ve seen this year. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Large Transfers? Large cryptocurrency movements often serve as market indicators that savvy investors monitor closely. Here’s why this matters: Price volatility potential – Large sell orders can temporarily depress prices Market sentiment indicator – Whale movements often precede market shifts Liquidity changes – Exchange transfers affect available trading supply Institutional interest – Massive moves may signal larger market players entering or exiting How Do Whale Alerts Help Crypto Traders? Platforms like Whale Alert provide real-time tracking of significant blockchain transactions. This XRP transfer detection gives traders valuable insights. However, remember that not every large movement means immediate selling. Sometimes whales transfer between their own wallets or move funds for custody purposes. What’s the Real Impact of This XRP Movement? While the numbers seem dramatic, the actual market impact depends on several factors. If the whale sells gradually, the price effect might be minimal. If they dump all at once, we could see temporary price pressure. The key is understanding that one XRP transfer doesn’t necessarily dictate long-term market direction. Smart Strategies for Reacting to Large Crypto Transfers When you see news about significant cryptocurrency movements, consider these approaches: Don’t panic sell based on single transactions Monitor trading volume and price patterns Research broader market context Consider your own investment timeline and strategy This massive XRP transfer reminds us that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and occasionally unpredictable. While whale movements capture attention, successful investing requires looking beyond individual transactions to understand broader market trends and fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions What is a whale in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales transfer to exchanges? Whales typically transfer to exchanges when they plan to sell, trade, or sometimes for enhanced security measures and institutional management. Should I sell when I see large transfers? Not necessarily. Large transfers don’t always mean immediate selling. Consider your investment strategy and market context before making decisions. How reliable is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is generally reliable for tracking large blockchain transactions, but always verify information through multiple sources. Can whale movements predict price changes? While whale movements can indicate potential price volatility, they’re not perfect predictors. Many factors influence cryptocurrency prices. What’s the largest XRP transfer ever recorded? While this 92 million XRP transfer is substantial, larger transfers have occurred, including several over 100 million XRP in past years. Found this analysis helpful?

The team behind AerodromeFi and VelodromeFi has announced a full merger of the two protocols to create AERO, a next-generation decentralized exchange launching on Ethereum and Circle’s Arc blockchain. The merger combines two of the most prominent DEXs built on Base and Optimism, setting the stage for a more unified, capital-efficient liquidity layer. The Merger That Rewrites the DEX Playbook Both Aerodrome and Velodrome have been powerhouses in their ecosystems. Aerodrome operates on Base, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, while Velodrome has anchored liquidity on Optimism. Now, they’re joining forces under one banner. The new platform, AERO, will consolidate the best of both designs. According to Dromos Labs, Aerodrome holders will receive 94.5% of the new token supply, while Velodrome holders will receive 5.5%. In other words, Aerodrome effectively absorbs Velodrome, turning two liquidity engines into one streamlined protocol. Both $AERO and $VELO tokens will be converted into the upgraded AERO token. The aim is to eliminate fragmentation between Dromos’ ecosystems and strengthen cross-chain liquidity. “This is a step toward simplifying DeFi,” one community member wrote. “Instead of two DEXs competing for the same users and liquidity, we’ll have one platform that unites everything.” Built for a New Era of DeFi AERO will officially launch on Ethereum and Arc, Circle’s newly developed Layer-1 blockchain. Arc has quickly gained attention as a compliance-ready DeFi network, integrating Circle’s stablecoin infrastructure and fiat on/off ramps. By choosing Arc as one of its launch chains, Dromos Labs is signaling that it sees regulated, transparent DeFi as the future. Running AERO across Ethereum and Arc bridges the gap between open DeFi and institutional-grade finance, two worlds that have historically remained apart. Ethereum brings deep liquidity and developer activity. Arc brings speed, compliance, and access to new capital pools. Together, they create the foundation for a hybrid financial network, one where liquidity, governance, and rewards can move seamlessly. Dromos Labs’ Strategic Play This merger isn’t just a token swap, it’s a strategic move by Dromos Labs to redefine how DEXs grow. Both Aerodrome and Velodrome were developed in-house by Dromos Labs, each serving as experimental ecosystems for liquidity incentives and governance models. Velodrome built its success on Optimism’s early DeFi boom, introducing gauge voting and ve-tokenomics to reward long-term participants. Aerodrome followed on Base, adapting similar mechanics to Coinbase’s fast-growing Layer-2. Now, Dromos wants to take those lessons and combine them into one cross-chain DEX with deeper liquidity, simpler incentives, and broader reach. The merger creates a single liquidity engine, backed by both communities, governed under one upgraded token. It’s consolidation done the right way, merging innovation, not killing it. Why the Numbers Matter The token allocation says a lot about where Dromos sees value. Aerodrome, which commands greater liquidity and activity, takes 94.5% of the new supply. Velodrome, still influential but smaller in volume, gets 5.5%. That balance ensures fair representation without diluting governance efficiency. The conversion process will be handled through on-chain snapshots, ensuring holders of both tokens receive their new AERO allocations transparently. The merger effectively retires $VELO and $AERO in their current form, combining them into a single, utility-rich asset that powers the entire AERO ecosystem. With one governance token, a unified reward structure, and cross-chain liquidity mechanics, AERO aims to become a cornerstone DEX for Ethereum’s next growth cycle. The Arc Advantage Circle’s Arc blockchain may prove to be the game-changer here. Arc is built for regulated on-chain finance, integrating stablecoin settlements, enterprise-level KYC tools, and fast transaction throughput. For Dromos Labs, launching AERO on Arc means tapping into a fresh liquidity base that traditional DeFi protocols often can’t access. By bridging Ethereum and Arc, AERO positions itself at the intersection of retail DeFi and institutional liquidity. Analysts believe this approach could set a new standard for how decentralized exchanges operate across multiple layers, blending the speed of modern L1s with the liquidity depth of Ethereum. Community and Ecosystem Response The announcement sparked strong reactions across Crypto X, especially from the Aerodrome and Velodrome communities. Many see the move as a natural evolution rather than a surprise. Both DEXs were built by the same team, shared similar architecture, and served parallel purposes on their respective chains. One viral post by @zoomerfied captured the sentiment perfectly: [ ZOOMER ] AERODROME AND VELODROME TO MERGE INTO ONE PROTOCOL, ""AERO"" AND LAUNCH ON ETHEREUM AND CIRCLE'S ARC – AERODROME HOLDERS TO GET 94.5% OF THE NEW TOKEN WITH VELODROME HOLDERS GETTING 5.5%: DROMOS CONFERENCE — zoomer (@zoomerfied) November 12, 2025 Within hours, AERO trended across DeFi circles, with discussions around what the unified token model might mean for future yield strategies and cross-chain governance. What It Means for DeFi The merger highlights a growing trend, protocol consolidation. As DeFi matures, projects are realizing that scaling isn’t just about expanding to new chains; it’s about uniting liquidity and users under stronger, simpler models. With AERO, Dromos Labs is not only cutting redundancy but also building a framework for interoperability that could influence future protocol mergers. The project’s ability to operate across Ethereum, Optimism, Base, and now Arc positions it at the crossroads of innovation, compliance, and community governance. If executed well, AERO could set the benchmark for what a next-generation DEX looks like: unified liquidity, cross-chain incentives, and institutional accessibility, all under one ecosystem. A Single Brand, a Singular Vision For Dromos Labs, the merger is both symbolic and strategic. Two strong brands, Aerodrome and Velodrome, are becoming one identity built to last. Instead of managing separate token economies and fragmented liquidity pools, AERO will serve as the central hub for the Dromos ecosystem. It’s a fresh start for both communities and a signal that DeFi is evolving beyond chain tribalism. In a space often dominated by competition, AERO represents collaboration, and consolidation with purpose. As the countdown to launch begins, one thing is clear: AERO isn’t just merging two DEXs. It’s merging the next phase of decentralized liquidity. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

In just its first 30 minutes of trading, the fund recorded a $26 million trading volume, setting the tone for what could be one of 2025’s biggest ETF debuts. By the end of the full trading day, projections point to a staggering $338 million in total volume, easily surpassing competitors like $BSOL, which clocked in at just $57 million on its own launch day. The Canary Spot $XRP ETF now has 223.7M tokens worth $557M at XRP's current price of $2.50. According to Nasdaq, the XRPC ETF is priced at $26.57 after opening at $40. pic.twitter.com/JiZxyBdxyM — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) November 13, 2025 The crowd isn’t just watching, they’re diving in headfirst. A New Chapter for XRP Launched in 2012, XRP was designed for fast, low-cost global payments. Built on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain optimized for speed and efficiency, XRP has long been positioned as the “bridge asset” connecting traditional finance to digital liquidity. While Bitcoin fights to be digital gold and Ethereum powers decentralized finance, XRP’s mission has always been simple, move value fast, cheap, and anywhere in the world. That same utility narrative is what fuels excitement behind this ETF. For years, XRP’s institutional potential has hovered just out of reach. Now, Canary Capital’s spot ETF finally opens that door, bringing XRP exposure to a much broader range of traditional investors. $XRPC ETF to crush it on Day 1! Kudos @CanaryFunds First 30min: $26M volume Projected full trading day (~6.5 hrs): $338M Vs $BSOL : $57M full day $XRP ETF already eyeing the throne as 2025's biggest launch. — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) November 13, 2025 The Launch Numbers Tell the Story It’s rare for a crypto ETF to come out swinging this hard on day one. But $XRPC didn’t waste a second. Opening price: $40 Current price: $26.57 (according to Nasdaq) Tokens held: 223.7 million XRP Fund valuation: $557 million (based on XRP’s current $2.50 price) That’s a serious opening move, and it puts $XRPC squarely in contention for 2025’s biggest ETF launch. For the XRP community, this moment feels like redemption. After years of regulatory uncertainty and legal battles, seeing a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF go live marks a defining shift in the asset’s journey. It’s not just about one product. It’s about validation. The ETF listing signals that institutional players are ready to treat XRP as a mature, investable digital asset, not just a speculative coin. Canary Capital’s Ambition Canary Capital has built a reputation for spotting opportunities ahead of the curve, and this ETF might be its boldest play yet. The firm’s Canary XRP ETF (the “Fund”) offers direct exposure to XRP without the need for investors to handle wallets, exchanges, or private keys. That simplicity could be a game-changer for traditional finance participants who’ve been hesitant to enter the crypto space. And it’s easy to see why the confidence is high. With XRP’s clear use case in cross-border payments and the growing appetite for tokenized assets, $XRPC arrives at a perfect intersection of utility and accessibility. Ripple Effect Across the Market The $XRPC launch also sent subtle ripples across the wider crypto market. XRP’s spot price climbed to $2.50, reflecting renewed interest and optimism around the token’s mainstream integration. Traders are already speculating whether the ETF’s success could spark similar products for other high-utility assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs paved the way, XRP’s entry broadens the field, particularly for assets with real-world payment and settlement use cases. Analysts say it’s a sign that crypto ETFs are evolving beyond store-of-value plays. Instead, they’re starting to represent practical blockchain ecosystems. Canary Capital is proud to announce the launch of the spot XRP ETF – $XRPC Launched in 2012, XRP was designed for fast, low-cost global payments and operates on the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain built for efficiency.

The XRP community has waited over a decade to see the asset recognized at this level, and Canary’s timing couldn’t be better. As more traditional investors look for diversified exposure to blockchain ecosystems, $XRPC positions itself as the go-to vehicle for XRP adoption. The question now is simple: Can it sustain the momentum? With $557 million already under management, a roaring first-day volume, and the full force of the XRP community behind it, Canary’s $XRPC ETF may well be writing the first page of XRP’s next big chapter.

The drop represents a major pullback from January’s peak of more than 9 million, when the network surged amid the memecoin boom that brought record transaction activity. Active Solana addresses number has dropped to a yearly min of 3.3M In Jan, it recorded a peak of around 9M amid the hype of memes Despite the decline, its activity still remains noticeable. @Pumpfun maintains high performance: daily rev of $1M+, and its share reaches ~90% pic.twitter.com/P1x6YVxwE0 — CryptoLabs (@cryptolabsio) November 13, 2025 According to data from @SolanaFloor, the decline signals a potential cooling phase for one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in crypto. Network activity, once fueled by speculative tokens and high retail engagement, appears to be consolidating after months of hypergrowth. From Boom to Cooldown Earlier this year, Solana became the epicenter of crypto’s memecoin mania. Tokens like BONK, WIF, and dozens of low-cap airdrops pushed daily transactions and wallet activity to record highs. Retail traders rushed in, new wallets exploded, and Solana’s performance as a fast, cheap Layer-1 drew praise from across the industry. But since that frenzy faded, data shows activity has been steadily declining. Many of the wallets created during the memecoin run have gone dormant, leaving behind a thinner base of active participants. Prediction Markets: Odds of $SOL reaching a new all-time high before 2026 on @Polymarket have fallen sharply to 6%, down from 56% just a month ago, reflecting a major shift in market sentiment. pic.twitter.com/iyYGcEdgqf — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) November 13, 2025 While this pullback looks sharp, analysts argue it’s part of a normal cycle. Solana’s on-chain numbers have often reflected speculative waves, activity spikes during token hype phases, then cools as markets correct. Prediction Markets Reflect Cooling Sentiment The slowdown in network activity is also being reflected in prediction markets. Odds of Solana ($SOL) reaching a new all-time high before 2026 on Polymarket have fallen dramatically to 6%, down from 56% just a month ago. That’s a stunning shift in sentiment, highlighting how traders are reassessing Solana’s near-term trajectory after a strong run earlier this year. Despite this dip in optimism, Solana remains one of the best-performing crypto assets of 2025, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum over several quarters. The latest data may suggest a short-term pause rather than a long-term reversal. ETF Flows Tell a Different Story Interestingly, while on-chain activity has dropped, institutional inflows into Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tell a different story. For 12 consecutive days, Solana ETFs recorded $18.1 million in inflows, even as Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs together saw outflows totaling $461 million. Cumulative inflows into Solana ETFs have now reached $369 million, a sign that institutional investors remain confident in the network’s long-term fundamentals. These inflows contrast sharply with the narrative of retail fatigue. While smaller traders step back, large investors appear to be positioning for the next phase of Solana’s growth, possibly linked to its expanding DeFi, NFT, and gaming ecosystems. “Institutions aren’t leaving Solana,” another post from @SolanaFloor noted. “ETF inflows continue to climb, showing conviction in the network’s resilience.” ETF DATA: For the 12th consecutive day, @Solana ETFs recorded $18.1 million in inflows, while $BTC and $ETH saw combined outflows of $461 million. Cumulative inflows into Solana ETFs have now reached $369 million. pic.twitter.com/PLpdTe79Le — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) November 13, 2025 Reading Between the Metrics The divergence between retail activity and institutional participation paints a nuanced picture. Active wallet counts are often tied to retail sentiment, which can be volatile and driven by short-term hype. ETF inflows, however, tend to reflect deeper strategic positioning, investors betting on Solana’s infrastructure, scalability, and developer traction rather than memecoin trends. Solana’s fundamentals remain strong. The network continues to lead in transaction throughput, maintain low fees, and attract builders through its developer grants and hackathons. Major protocols like Jupiter, Marinade, and Tensor still see consistent engagement, and new liquidity initiatives continue to emerge. The coming quarters may reveal whether the current dip in activity is a natural cooldown or an early sign of broader fatigue across the Solana ecosystem. A Broader Context for Solana The entire crypto market has seen shifts in activity distribution this quarter. Bitcoin and Ethereum have dominated headlines due to ETF dynamics and macro developments, while Layer-1 ecosystems like Solana and Avalanche have faced alternating surges and slowdowns. In Solana’s case, its strength lies in speed and accessibility. As the network matures, its ability to retain users beyond speculative trading, through sustainable DeFi, GameFi, and social applications, will determine its staying power. Analysts believe Solana’s biggest challenge isn’t performance, but user retention. Once the hype of memecoin trading cools, networks must offer consistent reasons for users to stay engaged, such as yield opportunities, decentralized identity tools, or integrated consumer apps. What’s Next for Solana Market watchers will be keeping a close eye on several indicators in the coming weeks: Whether daily active users stabilize above the 3M mark How ETF inflows behave as Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to see outflows The pace of developer activity and upcoming protocol launches If institutional accumulation continues, Solana could emerge from this phase stronger, with a more balanced mix of retail and professional participants. But if activity continues to fall, it may signal a deeper cooling period ahead of 2026. For now, Solana’s story remains one of contrasts, slowing wallets, rising institutional inflows, and a community debating whether this is consolidation or decline. One thing is clear: the network’s fundamentals remain intact, even as its hype cycle pauses for breath. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin gains support across party lines when messaging aligns with each group’s core values. Democrats respond to financial inclusion narratives, while Republicans and Independents favor themes of energy stability and transaction freedom. Independents are the most likely to own Bitcoin. The study draws on survey data collected in June 2025 by polling firm Cygnal, analyzing how Democrats, Republicans, and Independents respond to different narratives surrounding Bitcoin. Study Finds Bitcoin Messaging Splits Along Party Values The results show that Democrats resonate most with messaging tied to financial inclusion, particularly Bitcoin’s ability to expand access for underserved communities. Republicans and Independents, meanwhile, responded strongly to arguments highlighting energy-grid stability from Bitcoin mining and the right to transact without government interference. Despite the contrasting motivations, the report found one striking trend. Independents are twice as likely as Republicans to own Bitcoin, and more than five times as likely as Democrats. The findings arrive at a time when digital assets have taken on a larger role in US politics. Bitcoin has been positioned by the Trump administration as a driver of financial innovation in 2025, a shift from the more cautious stance seen under the previous administration.

The polarization, the institute argues, stems from how Bitcoin is framed rather than what it is. The BTC Policy Institute argues that pro-Bitcoin policymakers must shift their approach to focus less on investment upside and more on how Bitcoin aligns with voters’ values. “Advocacy initiatives should prioritize value-based messaging over appeals to personal financial gain,” the report states. The institute says Bitcoin can appeal across party lines when framed through shared values such as financial inclusion, protection from authoritarian control, and sustainable technological innovation. These narratives, it says, could help build bipartisan backing for legislation such as the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, while reducing polarized reactions to crypto policy. “Policymakers across the aisle can leverage these insights to advance legislation that appeals to voters’ shared values of financial freedom and democracy,” the report concludes. CFTC’s Caroline Pham Declares End to Regulatory “Turf War” With SEC In September, CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham declared an official end to the long-standing “turf war” between the CFTC and the SEC over crypto and financial market oversight. Speaking at a joint SEC-CFTC roundtable on Monday, Pham described the collaboration as a “new day,” marking a historic shift toward unified regulatory efforts. The event, held on September 29, brought together key industry figures including Polymarket’s Shayne Coplan, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, and Kalshi co-founder Tarek Mansour, who discussed the next phase of regulatory harmonization between the two agencies. Pham emphasized the need for cooperation to enhance market efficiency and innovation. “Our financial markets fuel America’s growth,” Pham said, adding that regulators must work together to eliminate friction that hampers economic potential. “By working together, we can bring real value to our markets and to the American people.” The post Study: Bitcoin Wins Support From Both Parties When Messaging Aligns With Their Values appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Adoption|Bitcoin|United States,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-14 07:10:07

According to CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young, there’s no need to panic just yet. The cryptocurrency expert has identified a crucial price level that could determine whether we’re entering a genuine Bitcoin bear market or experiencing normal market fluctuations. Let’s explore why $94,000 represents such an important threshold for Bitcoin investors. What Defines a Bitcoin Bear Market? Understanding market cycles is essential for successful cryptocurrency investing. A Bitcoin bear market typically occurs when prices decline significantly from recent highs, often accompanied by negative sentiment and reduced trading volume. However, Ju Ki-young’s analysis introduces a more precise definition based on investor behavior and purchase patterns. The CryptoQuant CEO emphasizes that market conditions shouldn’t be judged by short-term price movements alone. Instead, he focuses on the average purchase price of investors who bought Bitcoin between six and twelve months ago. This approach provides a more reliable indicator of true market sentiment. Why is $94,000 So Critical for Bitcoin? Ju Ki-young’s research reveals that $94,000 represents the average entry price for medium-term Bitcoin investors. When prices remain above this level, most recent buyers remain in profit territory. This creates psychological support that prevents widespread selling pressure. Consider these key factors about the $94,000 benchmark: It reflects actual investor behavior rather than technical indicators It represents the break-even point for many medium-term holders It serves as a psychological barrier against panic selling It indicates whether the market structure remains healthy How Should Investors Approach Current Market Conditions? Given this analysis, what should Bitcoin investors do right now? Ju Ki-young advises against making hasty decisions based on temporary price movements. Instead, he recommends monitoring the $94,000 level closely while maintaining a long-term perspective. The CryptoQuant CEO suggests that waiting for clear confirmation of a Bitcoin bear market provides better results than reacting to every price dip. This patient approach helps avoid emotional trading decisions that often lead to losses. What Historical Patterns Support This Analysis? Previous Bitcoin market cycles show similar patterns where specific price levels acted as crucial support zones. When these levels held, markets typically recovered and continued their upward trajectory. When they broke, genuine bear markets often followed. Historical data reveals that investor cost basis has consistently proven to be a reliable indicator of market health. The current analysis extends this concept by identifying the precise price point that matters most for today’s market conditions. Key Takeaways for Bitcoin Traders As we navigate uncertain market conditions, remember these essential points from Ju Ki-young’s analysis. The $94,000 level represents more than just a number – it’s a critical indicator of market sentiment and investor psychology. Until Bitcoin breaks below this crucial support, there’s little evidence to suggest we’re entering a genuine Bitcoin bear market . Therefore, maintaining perspective and avoiding panic-driven decisions remains the wisest approach for most investors. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly defines a Bitcoin bear market? A Bitcoin bear market occurs when prices decline significantly from recent highs, typically by 20% or more, and remain depressed for an extended period with negative investor sentiment. Why is $94,000 specifically important? This price represents the average purchase price for investors who bought Bitcoin between six and twelve months ago, making it a critical psychological support level. How reliable is CryptoQuant’s analysis? CryptoQuant is a respected analytics platform with a track record of accurate market insights, though all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks. Should I sell if Bitcoin approaches $94,000? Investment decisions should be based on your individual strategy and risk tolerance, not solely on any single price level or analysis. What other indicators should I watch? Consider monitoring trading volume, institutional activity, regulatory developments, and broader market sentiment alongside price levels. How long might a potential bear market last? Historical Bitcoin bear markets have varied from several months to over a year, depending on market conditions and external factors.

London, UK – February 5-6, 2026 — The third edition of the Digital Assets Forum (DAF) , organized by the European Blockchain Convention (EBC) , will take place at Convene, 122 Houndsditch , in the heart of London’s financial district. After two sold-out, one-day editions , the forum now expands to two full days , reflecting accelerating institutional adoption and London’s strategic position as Europe’s capital markets hub for digital assets. DAF3 will gather leading figures from asset management, family offices, banks, hedge funds, and digital-asset firms – representing €3 trillion in AuM – creating a powerful platform for high-level networking, deal-making, and insight exchange . The expansion includes a dedicated 1:1 meetings program , AI-powered networking app , and private meeting zones designed to maximize meaningful connections between investors and innovators. “After two fully sold-out editions, it was clear the market needed more space, both literally and figuratively,” says Victoria Gago , Co-Founder of EBC. “This year’s two-day format gives institutions and crypto leaders the time and structure to forge real partnerships and tackle the most important developments shaping the future of finance.” “We’re moving into an era where every asset, from funds to real estate to carbon credits, can exist on-chain,” adds Daniel Salmerón , Co-Founder of EBC. “DAF3 is where traditional and digital finance meet to define how this transformation will happen: securely, transparently, and at scale.” The event arrives as tokenization becomes one of finance’s fastest-moving frontiers. Analysts forecast over $16 trillion in tokenized assets by 2030 , while leading firms launch products spanning treasuries, credit, and real estate. Digital Assets Forum 3’s agenda goes beyond tokenization and DeFi, covering market structure, custody, AI’s role in finance, stablecoins, compliance, and banking innovation .

Many thought the Chancellor would turn to raising income tax to cover the budget deficit , as she warned on Monday that without it, it would necessitate severe cutbacks in capital spending. Insiders say her shift was motivated by fears that hiking income tax bands would stir up discontent in the party and anger the electorate. Economists said the tax hike could raise up to $65 billion The OBR has been informed of the change by Chancellor Reeves, who announced a package of “major measures” for inclusion in his 26 November Budget. Previously, economists have suggested that raising income tax could bridge a gap of as much as £50 billion ($65 billion) – but doing so would undermine Labour’s promise on taxation. In one of her recent addresses, Reeves signaled she might consider an income tax hike, even though she had earlier promised to stick to Labour’s manifesto. On Monday, she told the BBC that sticking to the pledge would force cuts in capital spending, which could harm productivity. However, party members, including Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, had raised concerns that breaking the manifesto would tarnish confidence in politics. Now, the FT says Reeves is leaning instead on a “smorgasbord” strategy aimed at raising £30 billion ($39 billion), potentially including a gambling duty and higher property taxes at the top end of the market. It also noted that the chancellor may opt to extend the freeze on income tax thresholds. Before, the plan under consideration involved a 2p hike in income tax, coupled with a 2p reduction in national insurance, designed to ease the burden on workers and place it on other groups, with economists projecting over £6 billion ($7.8 billion) in revenue. Reeves ditched plans to impose more charges on lawyers and accountants Earlier, Reeves also pulled back from a multibillion-pound measure that would have hit lawyers, accountants, and private clinicians. She had intended to introduce changes expected to raise £2 billion ($2.6 billion) annually, about 7% in partnership levy. However, she has since abandoned the plan after the Treasury warned that it would encourage avoidance and reduce overall revenue, especially in the artificial intelligence and tech sectors. Accountancy firms and city officials had also cautioned against the rate. The Treasury estimated it would cut revenue by £400 million ($525 million) in 2029-30. There is still growing discussion over taxing rich Britons who relocate to low-tax countries. Reeves proposed a 20% tax on their UK assets, but officials worry about its impact on economic growth. Before, she had also suggested introducing the two-child benefit cap to address the issue of child poverty; however, her recent U-turn on income tax has complicated the matter further. Nonetheless, the UK government still needs to bridge the shortfall. So far, the chancellor has attributed the current slowdown in the economy to Trump’s tariffs, as well as rising inflation and borrowing costs inherited from the previous government. She also blamed the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose downgraded productivity forecasts are expected to create a £20 billion shortfall in her existing plans.

XRP, Filecoin or Opter?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-altcoin-is-money-flowing-into-in-november-xrp-filecoin-or-opter/,"Traders searching for the next strong altcoin this month are increasingly gravitating toward the OPTER token as momentum shifts across the market. With XRP and Filecoin (FIL) showing slower movement in recent weeks, many investors are exploring assets tied to active platforms and real trading incentives. Opter’s live ecosystem, presale activity, and reward-driven trading model have made it one of the most talked-about opportunities for November. Why XRP and Filecoin are losing market interest XRP has historically been one of the most traded altcoins, but the past month has been dominated by sideways movement. Traders are waiting for new catalysts, and in the meantime, many are reallocating toward assets with more immediate upside. Despite XRP’s strong brand, its price action has not kept pace with the renewed interest in younger, utility-focused projects. FIL has hit similar challenges. Filecoin remains an important name in the Web3 storage sector, yet trading activity around FIL has cooled as network usage fluctuates and investor enthusiasm fades. For many short-term traders, FIL no longer offers the same near-term potential as emerging altcoins that are tied to active platforms, real fees, and ongoing reward systems. As a result, Opter has become an attractive alternative for those looking for an asset tied to a live product rather than speculative future demand. Why the OPTER token is attracting fresh liquidity Opter is gaining attention because it offers something different. The platform is more than just another altcoin project. It is a perpetual trading platform that is already live, processing trades with on-chain transparency and providing the speed traders expect from centralized exchanges. This combination sets it apart from XRP and FIL, which do not offer built-in trading ecosystems. The presale is another major catalyst. The presale is live at $0.02 in Stage 1, and early buyers are positioning themselves before the price automatically increases in the next phase. Unlike traditional presales, users can either buy tokens directly or earn them through trading. For every $100,000 in trading volume, participants receive 1,200 OPTER, often receiving more value in tokens than they spend in fees. With only 400 million tokens available in the presale, demand has been building quickly. How the Opter XP System changes trader engagement One of the strongest points of interest is the Opter XP System, which rewards traders based on their activity, PnL, and position duration. Instead of passive holding, users level up through real trading, unlocking Prestige ranks and earning higher reward multipliers. This progression turns Opter into far more than a standard decentralized perpetual exchange. It becomes a competitive trading environment where skill and consistency matter. These XP levels feed directly into seasonal rewards. Through the Opter Airdrop, traders receive tokens based on their XP and Prestige, creating an ongoing incentive structure. Combined with buybacks, token burns, and staking rewards funded by platform fees, the OPTER token benefits from both short-term activity and long-term growth of the ecosystem. Why Opter stands out this month Investors are rotating toward platforms that offer utility and clear reward mechanics. XRP and FIL remain major names, but neither currently matches Opter’s blend of transparency, volume growth, and gamified trading. As more traders look for altcoins tied to live products and continuous incentives, the OPTER token is emerging as one of the strongest contenders for capital inflows this month. Stage 1 is live at $0.02 , and early traders are already earning XP, farming OPTER , and moving up the leaderboard. If you are looking for the next altcoin with real utility and growing momentum, this is the moment to level up with Opter .

Altcoins like Story (IP), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), Jupiter (JUP), and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are the top laggards. So, will crypto go back up following this crash? Why the crypto crash is happening The crypto market crash is happening for several reasons. The most notable one is that investors are coming to terms with the $20 billion liquidation that happened on October 11 after Donald Trump announced a 130% tariff on Chinese goods. Over 1.6 million traders were liquidated. Since then, many investors have remained in the sidelines and many more have stopped using leverage completely after observing the risks involved. Additionally, many investors have opted to stop it altogether, which is evidenced by the falling futures open interest, which has moved to the lowest level in months. The rising risk has led to increased fear among investors, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index moving downwards to 25. Crypto prices normally fall when there is fear in the market. Additionally, the crypto market crash is because Bitcoin price has formed numerous bearish chart patterns , including a death cross and s double-top on the daily chart. It also formed a rising wedge pattern on the weekly chart, pointing to more downside in the near term. The crypto market crash also happened as demand from American investors. Data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have shed billions of dollars in assets in the past few months. READ MORE: Here’s why the XRP price is crashing as XRPC ETF inflows soar Will crypto go back up? History suggests that the crypto market crash will end and trigger more gains in the coming weeks or months. For one, while this correction is painful, it is not the worst thing that happens in the past 16 years. The Bitcoin price has dropped by 22% from its highest level this month. Historically, the coin has had steeper dives than that. For example, Bitcoin price dropped by 31% from its highest level in January to its lowest point in April. Before that, the coin crashed by 35% from its highest level in March and its lowest level in August last year. Its other big bear market was in January 2024, when it dropped by over 20% within weeks. In all these scenarios, Bitcoin has always bounced back and moved to a record high. This is in line with what a report by Bitfinex said : “The takeaway is that whales are not dumping in fear but gradually taking profits into a softer ETF demand environment — a pattern observed repeatedly in prior cycles. These rebalancing periods typically reset positioning and volatility before the next leg higher, once inflows and liquidity conditions improve.” Catalysts for the crypto market There are potential catalysts that will drive the crypto market higher in the coming months. First, the ongoing crash has brought the valuations of most tokens much lower in the past few weeks. With many of them being highly oversold, there is a likelihood that investors will start to buy the dip soon. Second, the Federal Reserve will maintain a dovish tone in the coming months, especially when Donald Trump replaces Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chair. The mentioned candidates, like Rick Rieder and Kevin Hassett, have all hinted that they support low interest rates. Crypto prices tend to do well when the Fed is cutting rates. Third, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started approving spot altcoin ETFs, most of which have had strong inflows. Hedera ETF has attracted over $76 million in inflows, while Solana funds have gained over $370 million in assets. As such, the ongoing divergence between inflows and price movement will likely end, with top coins rebounding.

As the presale accelerates toward the $2 million milestone, investors and analysts alike are calling it the best crypto to buy now in November , thanks to its real-world objective of integrating traditional banking with blockchain speed. But how did this little-known project rise so fast, selling over 110 million tokens in just weeks? Read on to find out why Digitap is attracting global interest, how it solves key financial concerns, and what makes it one of the most promising altcoins to buy now . Digitap’s $2 Million Surge: The Rise of a New Financial Revolution The Digitap presale is generating excitement among investors as it approaches the $2 million milestone, having sold over 110 million tokens in just a few weeks. Analysts, including Blockchain Reporter , are calling it the best crypto presale of 2025 , and for good reason. Digitap isn’t simply another crypto project; it’s transforming how money moves across borders. By marrying the speed and transparency of blockchain with the reliability of traditional banking, Digitap addresses one of global finance’s biggest challenges: delayed and expensive cross-border transactions. In a market predicted to surpass $620 billion by 2032 , Digitap’s real-world utility provides it with a powerful edge. Its unique omni-bank architecture enables customers to manage both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies from a single, secure platform, resulting in tremendous investor interest. As attention develops and momentum grows, Digitap’s rise feels less like hype and more like the start of a financial revolution. The Hidden Challenge Behind the Banking While the goal of a unified financial world is appealing, it comes with genuine obstacles. Bridging traditional banking with blockchain isn’t just about technology; it’s about trust, regulation, and accessibility. Many existing cryptocurrency platforms fail to comply with banking regulations, while traditional banks remain hesitant about adopting digital assets. This gap leaves billions still unbanked or unable to utilize contemporary financial instruments. Without clear legislation or solid infrastructure, many projects fail to deliver on their claims. That’s why investors are being cautious about where they invest their money, seeking solutions that are both compliant and innovative. In this uncertain environment, projects like Digitap stand out as the best crypto to buy now in 2025 , creating a secure, regulated bridge between fiat and crypto. However, the question still arises: can such ambitious platforms retain compliance while scaling globally? Digitap: Bridging Traditional Banking and Blockchain Innovation Digitap is a single financial platform that combines traditional banking systems with blockchain technology to simplify the transfer of money globally for individuals and businesses. Instead of managing multiple wallets, bank accounts, and completing KYC checks, Digitap enables users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds easily between fiat and cryptocurrency through a single, secure, mobile-first platform. Its automated currency routing engine provides rapid, low-cost, and transparent transactions, while offshore-friendly compliance frameworks preserve privacy without sacrificing legality. At the center of this ecosystem is the $TAP token , which drives payments, staking, governance, and ecosystem expansion. With a finite supply and several burn mechanisms, $TAP was created for long-term sustainability and scarcity. The presale is underway at $0.0297 in Round 2, with over 76% already sold out, and the price is scheduled to rise to $0.0313 soon. Over 110 million tokens have been sold, raising $1.7 million, making Digitap one of the top altcoins to buy in November . Digitap and the Future of Global Finance Digitap’s rise comes at a defining moment for finance. The world is witnessing a major convergence of traditional banking, digital assets, and real-time payments, and Digitap is at the center of this revolution. With more than 1.4 billion people remaining unbanked and another 2 billion underbanked, Digitap’s mobile-first omni-bank can deliver first-time financial access to billions. Its ability to blend blockchain settlement with conventional banking rails, such as SWIFT and SEPA, places it perfectly within a market estimated to expand from $371.6 billion in 2025 to $620.15 billion by 2032. As demand for frictionless, borderless payments grows, Digitap’s combination of utility, compliance, and user empowerment provides it a big competitive edge. With over 120,000 wallets connected and growing investor interest, Digitap is not just a fad; it’s part of the next financial revolution and one of the best crypto presales to invest in now before the price soars. Why Digitap Could Be the Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Digitap isn’t just another crypto project; it marks the beginning of a financial revolution. By solving genuine challenges in cross-border payments and combining fiat with blockchain, it’s defining a new standard for global banking. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES With the presale now nearing $2 million, enthusiasm is mounting rapidly.

Thierry Ehrmann, founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com , has always stated “ there can be no Artificial Intelligence without human intelligence” , and Artprice firmly believes this principle should guide the responsible and enlightened use of such technologies in the service of journalistic excellence. The virtuous circle of global indexing: how Artprice News, PR Newswire and Perplexity AI are creating the best possible information ecosystem for the art market. The deep operational alliance between Artprice News, its historical partner PR Newswire (Cision) and Perplexity AI creates an unprecedented information ecosystem, based on a virtuous strategic circle of indexing, dissemination and editorial enhancement that simultaneously benefits the three players and, above all, end-users worldwide. This synergy is based on a sophisticated technical architecture which ensures that art market news – produced daily by the Artprice News teams – achieves optimal global visibility, while simultaneously feeding the search capabilities of Perplexity AI with exceptional reference content, respecting the copyright of Artprice News. With nearly 30 years of experience, Artprice by Artmarket has established itself as the leading global source of art market information. Its strength rests on its unique and unparalleled foundations: – Over 35 million auction results and indices covering more than 890,000 artists – The world’s largest documentary archive (owned by Artprice): 210 million images and engravings of works of art from manuscripts and auction catalogues from 1700 to the present day – A global network of 7,200 partner auction houses continuously updates its databases via its dedicated Intranet, reaching over 9.3 million members worldwide. This unique position within the Global Art Market was recognized, among other destinctions, by a reputational study conducted during the 36th Congress of the International Committee of Art History (CIHA, Lyon 2024), where Artprice ranked as the Top of Mind art market information source among more than 1,000 participants from 60 countries. Artificial Intelligence at the heart of an editorial revolution Artprice’s transformation is not limited to the scale of its distribution. It relies on a revolutionary technological infrastructure integrating its proprietary AI applications, Intuitive ArtMarket® and Blind Spot AI® , the fruit of decades of algorithmic development. This proprietary AI, developed for Artprice News to optimize its vertical news feeds (among other uses) and structured with highly sophisticated data from Perplexity AI, leverages a massive volume of data from its 180 proprietary vector databases. Artprice’s algorithms are capable of analyzing billions of anonymized logs, tens of millions of artworks, and identifying extremely complex, cross-cutting artistic trends that elude the academic, institutional and commercial worlds. Tokenization of historical data for Artprice’s 2026 Annual Art Market Report Artprice possesses the world’s largest collection of manuscripts and auction catalogues, dating from 1700 to the present day. Appraised by a leading specialist in 2025, this unique collection has been valued at 43 million euros and is the art market’s equivalent of the Great Library of Alexandria, representing an exceptional heritage that is currently being integrated into its proprietary AI, Intuitive ArtMarket®, with systematic tokenization of historical information, notably ahead of Artprice’s 32nd Annual Report on the Global Art Market, scheduled for publication in March 2026. This tokenization process has already been completed for 18 million high-quality images, all analyzed and annotated by Artprice historians and experts, contributing to a unique corpus of historical information that allows our loyal users to discover new and previously unexplored dimensions of the art market. Institutional recognition and our 2025-2030 vision Artprice by Artmarket has twice been awarded the “Innovative Company” label by the French Public Investment Bank (BPI). The company aims for a third award in 2026, confirming its leadership in technological innovation applied to the art market. At the World Summit for Action on Artificial Intelligence, hosted by France in February 2025, Artprice presented its 2025-2030 strategic plan, which positions the company as a global leader in AI for art market information. This roadmap envisions the development of multiple energy-efficient and highly specialized AI systems, each tailored to one of Artprice’s departments, thus creating an unparalleled AI ecosystem in its sector. PR Newswire’s global infrastructure: 122 countries, 11 languages: an unparalleled network After 28 years of collaboration with PR Newswire (Cision) for the distribution of its press releases, the deployment of Artprice News in 122 countries and 11 languages relies primarily on PR Newswire’s global infrastructure as the world’s largest press release distribution network for over 70 years. This distribution power is based on its unparalleled technical and relational foundations in the industry: A global media network with more than 500,000 broadcast points. PR Newswire boasts the world’s largest distribution network, encompassing over 440,000 newsrooms, news feeds and professional subscribers. This network includes direct partnerships with the world’s leading news agencies such as AFP, DPA, Associated Press, Reuters, and Bloomberg, ensuring the full redistribution of news stories via the platform. These stories are then disseminated to over 8,000 news sites, including Yahoo! Finance, Google News, MSN, Wall Street Online and hundreds of other high-traffic news platforms. Comprehensive linguistic and geographical coverage. Unlike other distribution services that are limited to a few markets, PR Newswire covers more than 122 countries and 11 languages, enabling Artprice, and now Artprice News, to disseminate its analyses and news in the 11 strategic languages of the global art market for the past 28 years: French, English, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, and Russian. This multilingual capability is essential for reaching collectors, institutions, and professionals in their native languages, from the Persian Gulf to the Asia-Pacific region, and from Latin America to Eastern Europe. Real-time alerts to more than 440,000 newsrooms, websites, live feeds, journalists and 270,000 bloggers and influencers. Every news item published by Artprice for over 28 years, and now Artprice News via PR Newswire, is instantly notified to over 710,000 journalists, newsrooms, bloggers and influencers listed in Cision’s proprietary database, segmented by nearly 200 sectors and areas of expertise. These media professionals are alerted in real time via the PRNewswire For Journalists (PRNJ) platform according to their personalized selection criteria (topic, country, language, sector). For the art market, this means that every record-breaking sale announcement, every emerging trend, every institutional appointment identified by Artprice News immediately reaches specialized journalists in art media, the culture sections of national newspapers, luxury magazines, and international financial publications. SEO excellence and AI-powered indexing: PR Newswire’s technical dominance Beyond human dissemination, PR Newswire’s technical infrastructure ensures exceptional visibility in traditional search engines and new AI-augmented search engines, creating the essential bridge to Perplexity AI and its users. Absolute leadership in SEO and AI search: An exhaustive independent analysis conducted by Semrush (considered the best SEO software suite by 35% of its S&P 500 clients) in October 2025, demonstrated PR Newswire’s overwhelming dominance over all its competitors in critical areas of digital visibility. This technical performance explains why Artprice News dispatches, once distributed via PR Newswire, benefit from rapid indexing, optimal ranking and sustained visibility in search results. Artprice press releases since 1999, and now Artprice News itself, distributed via PR Newswire, frequently appear in featured snippets on Google, Google News and Google Discover, significantly increasing their organic visibility. For over 28 years, Artprice has patiently built and expanded its global network with thousands of hours spent with its teams and those of Cision PR Newswire. Artprice News content, which focuses on the Art Market – a YMYL (Your Money, Your Life) field, where the accuracy of information is critical for the financial decisions of collectors and investors – thus benefits from a considerable boost in authority and credibility simply by its association with the PR Newswire platform. Perplexity AI: real-time indexing and free access to Artprice News dispatches It is precisely this excellent SEO performance, multi-channel distribution and editorial authority that makes Artprice News dispatches particularly attractive to AI-enhanced search engines like Perplexity AI. Hybrid indexing powered by Perplexity AI Unlike traditional generative AI models that rely solely on pre-trained (and often outdated) data, Perplexity AI performs real-time web searches using its AI-driven hybrid indexing infrastructure. This informational freshness is exceptional: nearly 780 million monthly searches, guaranteeing the most recent information, including Artprice News dispatches published just a few minutes ago, immediately available to its users. Selection and citation criteria by Perplexity AI. When faced with a user query, Perplexity AI does not simply find relevant pages: it selects, prioritizes and cites the sources it deems the most reliable and relevant. High Domain Authority: Perplexity AI prioritizes sources from high-authority domains. Artprice.com, Artmarket.com, and PRNewswire.com, with their exceptional authority as demonstrated by Semrush (more referring domains than all their competitors), benefit from an ‘authority score’ that automatically places their content in a favorable position. Reliability and sources verifiability: studies on Perplexity AI demonstrate that it exclusively favors recognized academic, institutional and journalistic sources. Artprice, with its 28 years of global authority on the art market and its 180 proprietary and authoritative databases, perfectly matches the profile of an extremely reliable source that Perplexity AI naturally seeks. Perplexity AI’s free access to Artprice News dispatches: a win-win strategy For Perplexity AI: access to exceptionally authoritative, constantly updated content covering a specialized field (the art market) with unparalleled expertise. Artprice News dispatches allow Perplexity AI – while respecting Artprice’s copyright – to respond accurately, reliably, and up-to-date to the tens of thousands of daily queries concerning auctions, sales records, art trends, major exhibitions and the economics of the art market. Perplexity AI can thus offer its users world-class information, free of charge, which enhances the quality of its service and the loyalty of its 300 million active users, encouraging them to subscribe to Artprice, particularly through its Comet® agentic browser. For Perplexity AI users: when a user asks Perplexity AI a question related to the art market – such as “What are Basquiat’s recent sales records?” or “What are the principal trends in the contemporary art market in 2025?”, or “Who won the Marcel Duchamp Prize this year?” – the AI will systematically scan, select, and quote Artprice News dispatches distributed via PR Newswire, as these represent the most authoritative, up-to-date, and reliable sources available on the web. Users thus benefit from exceptionally high-quality answers sourced from the world leader in art market information, with clickable quotes allowing them to directly access the full dispatches for further research. For Artprice News: each citation by Perplexity AI represents editorial validation by AI, signaling to hundreds of millions of monthly users that the authoritative art market information comes from Artprice. This massive visibility, combined with the quality backlinks generated by the citations (both within the Perplexity AI interface and in articles by journalists who use Perplexity AI and its agent-based Comet® browser for their research), creates a virtuous circle of reputation and authority. Global distribution via PR Newswire → optimal indexing by Google, Bing and other traditional search engines + alerts to 710,000 journalists. Excellent SEO performance → high visibility in organic searches + priority indexing by Perplexity AI. Frequent citations by Perplexity AI → massive exposure to 100+ million monthly users + qualified traffic to the full news stories. Highly qualified traffic and engagement → potential new subscribers for Artprice subscription-based services + increased domain authority. Increased authority → even more frequent citations by Perplexity AI and accumulated media coverage → the virtuous circle perpetuates and amplifies itself. Evidence of the virtuous circle: performance measures and empirical validation This virtuous circle is not theoretical: it is measured, documented and quantified by independent data: 12,600 media mentions in 6 months: A case study published by Cision PR Newswire demonstrates that Artprice obtained more than 12,600 media mentions worldwide in six months thanks to its distribution via PR Newswire, with whom it has been a preferred partner since 1999, an exceptionally high figure that testifies to the massive use of its content by international media. Double the mentions in AI search: PR Newswire generates twice as many mentions in AI-assisted searches as its competitors, empirically confirming that content distributed via this platform – including Artprice dispatches – benefits from maximum visibility in search engines like Perplexity AI. Higher qualified traffic: Studies on user behavior show that traffic from Perplexity AI has above-average session time and engagement, as users arrive already convinced of the relevance and reliability of the cited source. Perplexity AI’s exponential growth: with growth from 650 million annual queries in 2024 to 780 million monthly queries in 2025, and a valuation of $9 billion after only three years in existence, Perplexity AI is establishing itself as the third largest global search ecosystem, multiplying Artprice News’ potential exposure accordingly. A triangle of excellence dedicated to providing authoritative information on the Art Market In conclusion, the ecosystem formed by Artprice News (28 years of editorial expertise and its proprietary AI), PR Newswire (global infrastructure and SEO excellence) and Perplexity AI (real-time indexing and AI-augmented search) constitutes a unique model in the information industry. A highly virtuous triangle: By allowing Perplexity AI free access to its dispatches, Artprice News is not engaged in philanthropy; the company is strategically investing in its position as a global reference source cited by Artificial Intelligence, ensuring that every professional, collector, investor or art enthusiast who queries an AI application about art market-related matters receives a response citing Artprice by Artmarket as a global authority source. This exceptional visibility will inevitably translate into a growth in paid subscription to Artprice’s services. Hundreds of millions of users worldwide – whether using Google, Bing, Perplexity AI or other platforms – thus gain access to the most reliable, up-to-date and comprehensive art market information, exclusively sourced from Artprice. This positioning – impossible to reproduce for competitors who do not have Artprice’s historical expertise, the practice and knowledge of PR Newswire’s infrastructure and all the new AI search engines – constitutes a decisive competitive advantage for the decade 2025-2035, a period during which information searching will migrate massively to conversational interfaces powered by Artificial Intelligence and agentic browsers.

That project, in 2025, can be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency DeFi coin gradually gaining popularity with early adopters. A large community, an elaborate roadmap, and actual on-chain applications place MUTM in the mindset of many as one of the hottest players in the early stages by the year 2026. How Mutuum Finance Works The transparency and efficiency of a lending and borrowing platform are being constructed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It has a system that links both borrowers and lenders based on two fundamental markets operating on smart contracts. The first one is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. In this case, lenders put their assets in liquidity pools, and the assets are represented by mtTokens. These mtTokens automatically record the amount of accrued interest to the lender. Taking an example, when a user deposits the assets of for example 10 ETH, they would get the mtTokens which will increase in value with time depending on the demand to lend. The second model is at a Peer-to-peer (P2P) level. It enables the participants to take increasingly customized loans where the borrower has an option of taking a loan that has a variable and stable interest rate. Variable rates vary with the demand in the market whereas the stable rates are not very high but do provide foreseeable repayment conditions. The channel reduces risk by using obvious Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios. Advancement and Development Mutuum Finance presale has had solid traction since it was launched around the beginning of the year 2025. In Phase 1 the token began at $0.01, and currently, in Phase 6 it is priced at $0.035, which is a 2.5x rise. The project has already garnered up 18,000 holders, and it has already raised up to $19 million which is a pointer of increased confidence on the long term vision of the project. A total of 45.5% (approximately 1.82 billion tokens) out of 4 billion total token supply has been distributed to the presale. Out of this figure, 796 million tokens are already sold, and Phase 6 is more than 86% filled. The price and number of tokens during each presale phase are set in stone, i.e., the stages will be sold out sooner as the demand increases. This arrangement of the market automatically causes the price of the token to rise due to the inflow of additional buyers. The community activity has also contributed significantly in ensuring that the activity is maintained. The project will also have a 24-hour leaderboard, awarding the best contributor on a daily basis with $500 in MUTM. This day in day out rivalry brings daily excitement and openness in the presale. Security and Expert Outlook Mutuum Finance is on the verge of a technical breakthrough. Based on the official announcement of the team on X , the launch of the V1 testnet will happen in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia network. The initial one will contain the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, as this will be a basis of having the fully functional lending platform. Security is a priority-based measure. Mutuum Finance has passed a CertiK audit achieving a 90/100 score in the Token Scan program and is currently running a 50k bug bounty program to report vulnerabilities. These steps develop faith that the protocol is taking seriousness on stability and reliability. The measured project advancement and open process of development are the two positive aspects pointed out by analysts who are following the project. Confirmed V1 testnet is imminent with good presale performance, people view that the token may be in the launch price at the current value of $0.06, and may even rise after the lending platform is available. Stablecoin and Layer- 2 Expansion Plans In addition to loaning and borrowing, Mutuum Finance will launch its stable coin that is pegged to the USD. This property will be one of the primary components in the ecosystem. The team is also getting ready to implement Layer-2 to enable transactions to be faster and cheaper. Reduced charges and fast service will be very important in DeFi lending sites which are based on real-time updates and rapid liquidations. The upgrades will also allow the system to be more scalable and it will be in effect to deal with larger volumes once it is adopted further. Combined, these plans demonstrate that Mutuum Finance is not thinking small with its first product. Long-term functionality and the constant evolution of the networks are created to make the roadmap more appealing, and MUTM is one of the most promising top crypto projects that will be active in 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto coin that is discussed in the DeFi world. The steady track of the presale, its rising number of holders as well as its consistent roadmap are reasons why several investors believe it is one of the finest cryptocurrency projects to keep an eye on even in the next market cycle. At the current level of development, 2026 might be the year when Mutuum Finance becomes a full-fledged DeFi.

Key Takeaways: The FDIC plans to issue guidance on tokenized deposits and introduce a stablecoin application process by late 2025. Acting Chair Travis Hill said blockchain-based deposits should retain the same legal protections as traditional deposits. Tokenization and stablecoins continue to accelerate, with RWAs surpassing $24 billion. Speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Fintech Conference on Thursday, Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill said the agency intends to clarify how deposit insurance applies when deposits are issued or represented on a blockchain. Travis Hill Says Tokenized Deposits Should Keep Same Protections Hill has previously expressed support for tokenization and reiterated his belief that the technological format should not change the underlying legal protections. “My view for a long time has been that a deposit is a deposit,” Hill said, according to Bloomberg . “Moving a deposit from a traditional-finance world to a blockchain or distributed-ledger world shouldn’t change the legal nature of it.” Interest in real-world asset tokenization has surged across Wall Street and global regulators this year. Excluding stablecoins, the value of tokenized real-world assets topped $24 billion in the first half of 2025, driven largely by tokenized private credit and US Treasurys, according to RedStone. BlackRock has been one of the most aggressive adopters, launching its tokenized money market fund BUIDL in 2024, which quickly became a dominant product in the RWA sector. The FDIC has made it easier for banks to engage in crypto-related activities. This is one of the best ways to mainstream crypto further. Thanks @FDICgov and Acting Chairman Travis Hill. pic.twitter.com/f3amLOZwsc — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 28, 2025 Hill also revealed that the FDIC is working on a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance, with a formal proposal for an application process expected before the end of 2025. The regime stems from the agency’s responsibilities under the GENIUS Act , which directs US regulators to craft consistent rules for stablecoin oversight. While it remains unclear how many institutions plan to seek FDIC approval, Hill said staff are developing standards around capital requirements, reserve backing, and risk management for banks seeking to issue FDIC-regulated stablecoins. Stablecoins remain one of the fastest-growing segments of the digital asset market, with a combined market capitalization of $305 billion as of Friday, per DefiLlama. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management.

The drop in investment, encompassing both private and public projects, reflects the deepening of structural challenges in China’s economy. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the slowdown is affecting investment, spending, trade, and factory output, raising concerns about the country’s ability to control its economy. Investments in China fall to the lowest level ever Property investments are declining rapidly due to developers experiencing fewer sales , less available capital to borrow, and an increase in unfinished housing projects. At the same time, companies are concerned about weak demand at home and abroad, so they are spending less on new projects. Experts say these weaknesses could have a lasting impact on the country for many months if the government does not address them promptly. Factories now have fewer orders, so they’re producing less because industrial output increased by only 4.9% in October, lower than the 6.5% growth in September. Some analysts suggest that factories worked harder in September to complete orders before the long holiday, which is why the slowdown in October appears worse. However, the decline still shows that the industrial sector is losing speed. China has to depend on local demand because the country is selling fewer goods abroad. Global demand has weakened, as other countries face their own economic problems, and analysts say the combination of domestic and international weakness makes it harder for companies to recover. Customers are also spending less due to low wages in the falling economy. Most families are concerned about job security, income growth, and the property market, so they are spending less, which in turn reduces investments in new goods and services. Retail sales rose by only 2.9% in October, marking the fifth consecutive month of slowing growth. Economists suggest that the government can increase subsidies for home appliances, electric cars, and certain services. However, China needs long-term changes to make households feel more secure, so lawmakers need to improve social welfare, income distribution, and job security. China’s economy is facing pressure from weak spending Both domestic and global problems are affecting China’s growth, but the government is acting carefully rather than quickly to boost the economy. Businesses are uncertain about the future due to economic changes and reforms; as a result, many companies are not investing in new projects or hiring additional staff. Customers are also saving more and spending less because job growth is slow and incomes are rising slowly, which in turn drags the economy down. Trade tensions with the U.S. also exacerbated the situation. However, President Trump and Xi reached a deal late in October that could help lower tariffs and increase exports in the future. Nevertheless, even with this new arrangement, demand from other countries remains unpredictable. China’s trading partners in Europe have also raised concerns about the volume of Chinese goods entering their countries, which could create future friction in global trade. It could also limit China’s ability to sell to some countries, as they also want to reduce their dependence on the Asian country. The National Bureau of Statistics in China said officials will “actively support the implementation” of current policies. That means the government is cautious and wants to avoid excessive borrowing. Yet, despite those pledges, Beijing has already thrown its support behind approximately 1 trillion yuan ($141 billion) worth of stimulatory projects for infrastructure, local government, and other areas central to spurring economic expansion in recent weeks.

The tech company said SIMA 2 helps DeepMind advance beyond simple on-screen actions and move toward AI that plans and explains itself, as well as learn through experience. The firm said the launch marked a significant step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). DeepMind also warned that SIMA 2 has important general implications for the future of robotics and AI-embodiment. SIMA 2 thinks for itself and takes actions in interactive environments SIMA 2 is our most capable AI agent for virtual 3D worlds. 👾🌐 Powered by Gemini, it goes beyond following basic instructions to think, understand, and take actions in interactive environments – meaning you can talk to it through text, voice, or even images. Here’s how 🧵 pic.twitter.com/DuVWGJXW7W — Google DeepMind (@GoogleDeepMind) November 13, 2025 The tech company released the first version of SIMA (Scalable Instructable MultiWorld Agent) in March. Google said the AI agent learned hundreds of basic skills by watching the screen and using virtual keyboard and mouse controls. The firm also acknowledged that the latest version of the AI agent takes things a step further by allowing the AI to think for itself. Google DeepMind also revealed that Gemini powers the AI agent. The tech company stated that integrating SIMA 2 and Gemini helps the AI agent understand a user’s high-level goal, perform complex reasoning, and skillfully execute goal-oriented actions in games. The firm said SIMA 2 is the company’s most capable AI agent for virtual 3D worlds. DeepMind found that interacting with the agent felt less like giving it commands and more like collaborating with a reasoning companion about the task at hand. According to the announcement, SIMA 2 goes beyond following basic instructions to thinking, understanding, and taking actions in interactive environments. The AI agent will allow users to interact with it through text, voice, or even images. Google said its Gemini AI model helps SIMA 2 interpret high-level goals and talk through the steps it intends to take. The firm added that Gemini helps the new human-centered agent collaborate within games with a level of reasoning the original system could not achieve. The tech company also reported stronger generalization across virtual environments. DeepMind confirmed that SIMA 2 completed longer, more complex tasks, including logic prompts, screen-drawn sketches, and emojis. Google said the ability gets SIMA 2’s performance closer to that of a human player on a wide range of tasks. The firm also noted that the AI agent had a 65% task completion rate, compared to 31% by SIMA 1. DeepMind found that SIMA 2 interpreted instructions and acted inside entirely new 3D worlds generated by Genie 3. The project was released last year, which creates interactive environments from a single image or text prompt. The tech company said SIMA 2 could orient itself, understand goals, and take meaningful action in worlds it had never encountered until before testing. Google argued that the human-centered agent is now far better at carrying out detailed instructions, even in worlds it’s never experienced before. The firm said SIMA 2 can transfer learned concepts from one game to another, connecting the dots between similar tasks. DeepMind finds gaps in SIMA 2 that need to be addressed Researchers noted that the agent switched into self-directed play after learning from human demonstrations. The agent used trial and error, along with feedback generated by Gemini, to create new experience data. The new experience data includes a training loop where SIMA 2 attempted the tasks it generated and fed its own trajectory data back into the next version of the model. Although DeepMind hailed SIMA 2 as an advancement in artificial intelligence, the research also found gaps that need to be addressed. Google identified gaps, including working within a limited memory window, struggling with very long, multi-step tasks, and facing visual-interpretation challenges seen in 3D AI systems. DeepMind revealed that SIMA 2 served as a testbed for skills that could be used in robotics and navigation in the future. The firm said its SIMA 2 research offers a strong path towards applications in robotics and also AGI in the real world. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This crucial update requires immediate attention from anyone involved in THORChain trading. What Does Binance Delisting RUNE Mean for Traders? When Binance delists RUNE perpetual futures, it means the trading pair will no longer be available for futures trading after November 19 at 9:00 AM UTC. This decision impacts traders in several important ways: Existing positions must be closed before the delisting date No new positions can be opened after the deadline Traders need to adjust their strategies accordingly Why Would Binance Delist RUNE Futures Contracts?

Bitcoin Miners Have Sent 71,000 BTC To Binance In November As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post , November has seen the miners send a notable amount of Bitcoin to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The on-chain metric of interest here is the “ Miner to Exchange Flow ,” which measures the total number of tokens that wallets connected to miners are sending to a given centralized exchange. When the value of this metric is high, it means the chain validators are sending large amounts to the platform. Generally, miners transfer to an exchange when they want to sell, so this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the BTC price. On the other hand, the indicator being at a low level suggests miners aren’t making that many deposits to the exchange. Such a trend can be a sign that this cohort is choosing to hold BTC, which can naturally be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow for Binance, the largest digital asset exchange by trading volume: As displayed in the above graph, the Binance Bitcoin Miner to Exchange Flow has seen spikes of a significant scale in this month so far, particularly concentrated around the post-crash lows. Given the timing, it’s possible that miners made the transactions to panic sell. In total, these chain validators have transferred 71,000 BTC to the exchange, worth more than $7 billion. November’s inflows are only a continuation of the trend from October, when miners deposited a total of 200,000 BTC across the month. Miners are entities that need to regularly sell to pay off their running costs in the form of electricity bills, so some distribution from them is normal. The scale at which they have deposited to Binance recently, however, may be worth noting. The inflows into Binance this month have coincided with a decline in the Bitcoin Hashrate , a measure of the total amount of computing power connected to the network by the miners. This metric may be considered as a gauge for the sentiment among the chain validators. Bitcoin miners pushed the Hashrate to a new all-time high (ATH) in October, but the price decline that has followed since, as well as the fact that the network Difficulty has spiked, has forced miners to pull back on their upgrades. BTC Price Bitcoin has seen another setback during the past day as its price has retraced to the $101,300 level.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miner Exchange Inflows|Bitcoin Miners|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 08:00:32

As of press time, the price sits at $97,1000, down 6% over the last 24 hours and 4% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, volume remains high, and sellers continue to control the market. Traders are watching key levels to assess whether more downside is likely. Price Rejected at $107K, Trend Turns Lower The $107,000 zone once again acted as unbreakable resistance. Bitcoin failed to move above it, then quickly reversed. Michaël van de Poppe noted the rejection led to a move below $100,000, which swept the previous lows. He said a move back above $100,700 is needed to change the current trend. Rejection at $107K triggered a potential test on the downside. That took place.

However, in order to change that, a reclaim of… pic.twitter.com/4eBAJNcpGa — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) November 13, 2025 Notably, the short-term structure shows consistent lower highs and lower lows. Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that BTC has now broken below the June low around $98,000. He also noted that both the daily 200EMA and 200MA have been lost. These are widely followed by traders and funds, and their loss suggests trend weakness. Daan added that spot selling has picked up. He observed 14 consecutive 15-minute red candles, showing steady sell pressure. Some short covering could take place around this area, but resistance remains above. On-Chain Data Points to Thin Support Below Glassnode’s URPD chart shows that most BTC was last moved around $95,930, with around 230,728 units at that price. This level now acts as a major support zone. Ali Martinez, a market analyst, pointed out that the next key levels are $82,045 and $66,900. They also show high UTXO activity, with 135,789 BTC and 213,578 BTC moved there. Between $95,930 and $82,000, the chart shows lower on-chain activity. This means fewer holders have history in that range, so the price could drop quickly if the current support breaks. In addition, analyst Crypto Patel commented that BTC dropped as expected after retesting the $106K–$107K zone, adding that the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci range is now key. “If it fails, BTC could slide below $80K.” Source: Crypto Patel/X As CryptoPotato reported , the $94,000 area is also being watched. It aligns with the 66-week exponential moving average and an unfilled CME futures gap. These gaps are often filled later, so this zone may still draw a price. Whales and Miners Send Coins to Exchanges Large BTC holders have started moving units to Binance. Inflows had been quiet in the past months but have now increased. This shift in behavior has added to selling pressure. Miners have also stepped up their exchange activity. Their transfers have risen in the fourth quarter, adding more supply to the market. Combined with whale activity, this has kept price action weak.

Binance has officially announced its support for KDA withdrawals, allowing Kadena holders to manage their assets with ease until January 12, 2026. This move enhances user control and flexibility in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. What Does Binance’s Support for KDA Withdrawals Mean for You? Binance’s decision to enable KDA withdrawals until 3:00 a.m. UTC on January 12, 2026, marks a significant step for Kadena investors.

While KDA withdrawals are beneficial, users should be aware of potential hurdles. For instance, network delays can occasionally occur during high traffic periods.

Yet, as the cryptocurrency market grows, not every investor wants autonomy and control. Some are looking for structure, regulation, and accountability. That distinction formed the core of software engineer and XRP community figure Vincent Van Code’s recent remarks about the Grayscale XRP Trust , which he described as a vehicle “designed for institutions — funds, wealth managers, and family offices — that need to show regulators, auditors, and insurance firms that they’re playing by the book.” Van Code’s perspective highlights the increasing participation of institutional investors who require regulated pathways to invest as an important factor behind XRP’s future growth potential. These investors represent large pools of capital that cannot enter the market through typical retail methods. A lot of people are asking me: ""Why would anyone buy the Grayscale XRP Trust when they could just hold XRP in their own wallet or use Coinbase Custody?"" Here’s the simple answer Grayscale’s XRP Trust isn’t made for everyday investors. It’s designed for institutions —… https://t.co/jzNO63rxEd — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) November 12, 2025 Institutional Access Through Regulation According to Van Code, “most big investors can’t legally self-custody crypto.” While major institutional players are entering the XRP market , their internal compliance policies demand third-party custodianship, insurance, and audit verification. The Grayscale XRP Trust satisfies those requirements by holding XRP through Coinbase Custody Trust Company, a New York State-regulated entity with insured cold storage and SOC certifications. Grayscale then manages valuation, accounting, and reporting to ensure transparency. This structure makes it possible for institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the tokens. As Van Code explained, instead of “owning XRP,” these investors hold trust shares, which represent real XRP under regulated oversight. A Pathway Toward Broader Market Integration Van Code connected the trust model to the process that has already played out with Bitcoin. He described a progression from a private trust to an OTC product to an ETF, suggesting that XRP could follow a similar route as financial products mature. The emergence of XRP trusts and potential exchange-traded funds gives institutions a compliant entry point, ultimately supporting price stability and market liquidity. This shift could bring long-term benefits to XRP’s market standing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional demand tends to favor assets that demonstrate regulatory clarity and operational transparency. The Grayscale XRP Trust, by offering a professionally managed, auditable investment structure, positions XRP to attract these investors. Bridging Traditional Finance and Digital Assets Van Code noted that “retail investors want control” while “institutions want compliance, insurance, and clean audits.” Their coexistence strengthens XRP by balancing liquidity from individuals with credibility from large investors. As regulated products like the Grayscale XRP Trust grow, they pave the way for XRP ETFs, encouraging institutional participation, market stability, and integration with traditional financial systems .

Recent analysis suggests that the normalization of TGA liquidity might trigger exactly that. According to experts, historical patterns indicate we could see substantial Bitcoin price movement within days. What Does TGA Liquidity Mean for Bitcoin Price? The Treasury General Account (TGA) serves as the U.S. Treasury’s operating cash account. When funds get released from this account, it injects liquidity into financial markets. This liquidity often finds its way into various assets, including cryptocurrencies. The current situation mirrors historical patterns that previously benefited Bitcoin price action. Glassnode co-founders Yann Happel and Jan Allemann, through their Negentropic X account, have identified a crucial pattern. They note that funds are now flowing from the TGA following the recent government shutdown resolution. This development could significantly impact Bitcoin price trends in the coming weeks. Why Historical Precedent Matters for Bitcoin Investors The 2019 government shutdown provides a compelling case study. During that period, Bitcoin experienced a notable rebound exactly 12 days after liquidity normalized. This historical correlation suggests we might see similar Bitcoin price movement patterns now. Key factors supporting this analysis include: Liquidity injection timing – The peak crunch has passed Market sentiment improvement – Conditions are stabilizing Historical validation – Previous patterns repeating How Much Liquidity Are We Talking About? The estimated $150 billion release represents substantial market-moving power. This capital injection could provide the upward momentum needed for a significant Bitcoin price increase. Analysts suggest the worst market conditions have passed, creating ideal circumstances for Bitcoin price appreciation. Market participants should watch these key developments: TGA fund release progression Bitcoin price reaction in coming days Overall market liquidity indicators Institutional investment patterns What This Means for Your Bitcoin Strategy Understanding these macroeconomic factors can help investors make informed decisions about Bitcoin price exposure. The 12-day timeline provides a specific window to monitor potential Bitcoin price movements. However, remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The analysis concludes that market conditions are improving significantly. With the liquidity crunch behind us, the environment appears favorable for Bitcoin price growth. This could represent an important opportunity for those tracking Bitcoin price trends. Frequently Asked Questions What is the TGA? The Treasury General Account is the U.S. Treasury’s primary operating account at the Federal Reserve. How does TGA liquidity affect Bitcoin price? When funds release from TGA, it increases market liquidity, which often flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Why 12 days specifically? Historical data from the 2019 shutdown showed Bitcoin rebounding 12 days after liquidity normalized. Is this guaranteed to happen again? While historical patterns are compelling, market conditions can vary, so nothing is guaranteed. How much liquidity is being released? Analysts estimate approximately $150 billion in funds are becoming available. What other factors could affect Bitcoin price? Regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and broader market sentiment all play roles. Found this analysis helpful?

BlackRock's IBIT, usually a good performer, experienced an outflow of $256.6 million. The FBTC of Fidelity reported redemptions totaling $119.9 million. U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $869.9 million in net outflows on Thursday, representing the second-largest withdrawal since these investment vehicles launched. The mass exodus reflects growing caution among investors as the price of bitcoin declined sharply. Other outflows originated from Grayscale's GBTC and funds managed by Ark, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, Invesco, Valkyrie, and Franklin Templeton. All significant bitcoin ETF providers recorded net withdrawals throughout the session. The largest outflows were recorded on a single day, February 25, 2025, when the funds experienced an exit of $1.14 billion. The numbers on Thursday represent a major change in investor sentiment toward cryptocurrency exposure. Institutions Pull Back Amid Economic Uncertainty According to Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at Kronos Research, the withdrawals were a ”risk-off reset.” Economic indications are not all positive, and institutions are decreasing their exposure to volatile assets . According to Liu, large outflows are indicative of a risk-off reset, which occurs when institutions withdraw in response to macroeconomic noise. He observed that short-term momentum is under pressure, but there is long-term structural demand for Bitcoin . The outflows coincide with deteriorating market conditions across multiple asset classes. Investors are reallocating capital from high-risk investments to safer alternatives. Min Jung, a research associate at Presto Research, stressed the broad nature of the sell-off. Markets are witnessing widespread de-risking as uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy intensifies. ”Investors are pulling capital from higher-beta assets and rotating into safety, reflecting uncertainty around the Fed's path and deteriorating macro sentiment,” Jung explained. Bitcoin Price Drops Below $98,000 At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $97,184, suggesting a 6.34% decline in the last 24 hours. BTC price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Liu described the drop as a ”liquidity let-down” where cascading liquidations met thin order books. Buyers have concentrated their demand between $92,000 and $95,000, creating a potential support zone. ”Until fresh flows refill the books, volatility stays front and center,” Liu said. Justin d'Anethan, head of research at Arctic Digital, identified current levels as critical support. A break lower could push prices into the lower $90,000 range. ”I suspect those levels would be seen by many as a buying opportunity, especially for all those left on the sidelines when BTC, not that long ago, was pushing past the mid $120Ks,” d'Anethan noted. The market's recent high above $120,000 now appears distant as selling pressure mounts.

Regulators are moving to separate settlement-grade instruments from the rest of the market. The message was blunt and aimed squarely at issuers that operate without strict oversight. Regulators Draw A Clear Line According to Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Chia Der Jiun, some unregulated stablecoins have a “patchy record of keeping their peg.” He warned that sudden losses of confidence in those tokens can resemble money-market fund runs from 2008. Chia added that such coins are “not suitable as safe settlement assets for large wholesale transactions.” His remarks came in a keynote at the Singapore FinTech Festival and make clear that the city-state intends to favor well-capitalized, closely supervised issuers for settlement uses. Rules Focus On Reserves And Redemption Based on reports, MAS is preparing legislation that builds on a regulatory framework released on Aug. 15. The framework sets reserve backing and redemption reliability as the main tests for eligibility. In short: issuers must show credible backing and practical ways for users to redeem tokens. Over time, Chia said, if certain stablecoins grow big enough to affect the wider system, rules will need tightening and cross-border cooperation will be required. Access to central bank facilities was mentioned as a possible future step for truly systemic tokens. Numbers Point To Bigger Stakes According to a Binance Research report, the global stablecoin market passed $300 billion in total capitalization in October 2025. Daily average transaction volumes reached $3.1 trillion. Monthly stablecoin payments have topped $10 billion as of August 2025, with 63% of that volume tied to B2B activity. These numbers show why regulators are paying attention. They also help explain why USDT and USDC remain dominant players as use moves beyond trading into payments and business flows. Bitcoin’s rise above $120,000 has also been cited as one factor increasing overall market activity. CBDCs And Tokenized Bank Money On The Table Chia also outlined MAS’s broader view of settlement assets, mentioning wholesale central bank digital currency and tokenized bank liabilities. The regulator’s BLOOM initiative — Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multicurrency — is testing how those instruments might work together inside a tokenized finance system. Financial firms and clearing networks were urged to run trials under the initiative so practical issues can be spotted early.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-finance-platform-matrixport-issues-bear-market-warning-for-bitcoin-btc-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto finance platform Matrixport, in its latest market assessment, warned that Bitcoin's price movements were similar to past “mini bear market” periods and that the market may have entered a small-scale bear trend. Matrixport: Bitcoin May Have Entered a “Mini Bear Market,” Market at a Critical Turning Point According to the report, the current outlook points to a critical period that requires investors to be more careful about risk management. Matrixport emphasizes that the market is showing signs of weakening, both in terms of fund flow and macroeconomic conditions. According to the agency's analysis, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have slowed significantly in recent weeks. While both short-term investors and long-term institutional funds are reducing their positions, there is no new macroeconomic catalyst that will strengthen the market again at this stage. The analysis underlines that the future direction of the Bitcoin price depends largely on the policy decisions to be taken by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in the future. Matrixport stated that the market is currently at a significant breaking point, and that critical structural price levels and macro indicators will determine whether the market will enter a deeper decline or enter a gradual bottoming process in the coming period. The agency urges investors to exercise strict risk control in an environment of uncertainty, closely monitor changes in market sentiment, and be prepared for a period in which volatility may increase. *This is not investment advice.

The best casinos have become multi-chain ecosystems, allowing users to deposit and withdraw across several networks — from TRON (TRX) and Solana (SOL) to stablecoins like Tether (USDT). Players today value speed, anonymity, and freedom over traditional payment rails. Multi-chain casinos are bridging that gap, giving gamblers flexibility and control over their funds while maintaining full transparency through blockchain technology. Below, we explore what makes multi-chain casinos so appealing, and review the top crypto gambling sites in 2025. Why Multi-Chain Casinos Are Taking Over Until recently, most crypto casinos were tied to one or two blockchains — usually Bitcoin and Ethereum. That’s changing fast. High gas fees and slower transactions have driven both developers and players toward faster, cheaper networks such as TRON and Solana, along with stablecoins for volatility-free gaming. Key Advantages of Multi-Chain Casinos Faster Transactions: Solana and TRON enable near-instant deposits and withdrawals, making traditional payment delays obsolete. Lower Fees: Sending USDT via TRON costs a fraction of a cent — a massive advantage for active players. Stable Value: Stablecoins like USDT minimize volatility, allowing players to gamble without worrying about sudden price swings. Broader Access: Multi-chain integration means you can deposit in Bitcoin, bet with TRX, and withdraw in USDT — all on the same platform. Decentralized Trust: On-chain betting ensures fairness and auditability, giving users transparency at every step. 🥇 Dexsport Casino — Multi-Chain Support and Total Transparency Accepted Coins: BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRX, SOL, and 30+ othersGames: 10,000+ including slots, sports, and live tablesWelcome Bonus: 480% across first three deposits + 300 free spins Dexsport.io stands out as one of the most complete multi-chain casinos in the industry.

Fee-Free Banking: Deposits and withdrawals across 20+ blockchains — including Solana, TRON, and BNB Chain — are instant and cost nothing. Real On-Chain Betting: Every wager is logged publicly, so results can be verified in real time. Flexible Bonuses: The 480% welcome package and 15% cashback in stablecoins are applied transparently and can be tracked through your wallet. Dexsport feels like the blueprint for the next generation of crypto gambling — fast, private, and genuinely multi-chain. 🏅 Vave Casino — Sleek, Reliable, and TRX-Friendly Accepted Coins: BTC, ETH, LTC, USDT, TRXGames: 7,500+Bonus: 100% up to 1 BTC + 100 free spins Vave Casino combines a modern interface with solid technical infrastructure. Its TRON integration ensures lightning-fast payments with almost zero network fees, and the casino processes withdrawals in under ten minutes. The platform is known for its real-time RTP tracker, an unusual but welcome feature that lets users see the theoretical return of each game before they play. For slot enthusiasts and casual gamblers alike, Vave is a strong, balanced option — reliable, secure, and fully crypto-native. 💎 Jackbit — Fast Solana Transactions and Competitive Rewards Accepted Coins: BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, DOGEGames: 8,000+Bonus: 125% up to $1,000 + cashback rewards Jackbit appeals to Solana users who prefer speed and straightforward rewards. Its Solana deposits confirm in seconds, and withdrawals are typically processed within minutes. The site offers a blend of slots, live casino games, and sports betting — all accessible without KYC for small to medium stakes. Where Jackbit shines is in its regular slot tournaments and VIP cashback system, which reward frequent players without unnecessary hoops or bonus restrictions. ⚡ 7Bit Casino — Veteran Platform with USDT Stability Accepted Coins: BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, USDTGames: 10,000+Bonus: Up to 5 BTC + 100 free spins 7Bit Casino is one of the oldest names in crypto gambling, but it has evolved well with the times. Its support for TRC-20 USDT makes it ideal for players who want to gamble without dealing with price swings or high gas fees. The layout is more classic than modern, but it’s fast and easy to navigate. With a provably fair system, broad coin support, and quick withdrawals, 7Bit remains a solid, trustworthy pick for stablecoin users. 💠 CoinCasino — Balanced Multi-Chain Simplicity Accepted Coins: BTC, ETH, TRX, SOL, USDTGames: 6,000+Bonus: 200% + 100 free spins CoinCasino doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it executes the basics extremely well. It accepts multiple chains, including Solana and TRON, and supports USDT as both a deposit and betting currency. The withdrawal system is clean, and payouts are consistent — something that can’t always be said of newer platforms. Its interface is minimalist but efficient, appealing to users who want to focus on gaming rather than gamification. 🧩 What to Look For in a Multi-Chain Casino As multi-chain casinos proliferate, choosing the right one depends on your priorities. Here’s what matters most in 2025: Blockchain Variety More networks mean lower fees and flexible betting options. Stablecoin Support Reduces volatility, ideal for regular players. Transaction Speed Solana and TRON offer near-instant confirmations. Transparency On-chain betting ensures fairness and prevents manipulation. No-KYC Access Preserves user privacy and global accessibility. Final Thoughts The rise of multi-chain crypto casinos marks a clear evolution in online gaming.

Platforms like Dexsport , Vave, and Jackbit are leading this transformation, supporting networks like TRON, Solana, and BNB Chain, alongside stablecoins such as USDT. For players seeking speed, transparency, and cross-chain flexibility, these casinos represent the most advanced options in 2025.

54383622,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=853628,1763111529,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54383622.jpeg,Bitcoin Maximalism Is Fading As Top Altcoins Like PEPENODE Rise,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-maximalism-fading-top-altcoins-pepenode-rise/,"What to Know: Bitcoin’s ETF-driven evolution into digital gold is softening strict maximalism and encouraging more diversified crypto portfolios. Capital is rotating into top altcoins with real narratives, especially in infrastructure, AI and DePIN rather than pure speculation. PEPENODE mixes meme culture with gamified virtual mining and multi token rewards to keep holders engaged. For most of crypto’s history the script was simple: own Bitcoin, ignore everything else. That mindset is fading. Bitcoin now behaves more like digital gold, while the real experimentation (and much of the upside) is shifting to newer chains and app layers. Spot Bitcoin ETFs accelerated that shift. Many veteran holders in the US are moving coins from self custody into ETF wrappers to gain tax advantages and easier reporting without giving up long term $BTC exposure. Yes, OG whales definitely aren’t selling their Bitcoin for nothing – they’re going the ETF way. On chain, that unlocks fresh capital that no longer needs to sit idle. Instead of chasing random memes, that capital is rotating into infrastructure and narrative rich plays. High throughput networks like Avalanche, DePIN platforms such as Peaq and experimental designs like Kaspa’s blockDAG are drawing serious research time from investors who once swore they would never touch an altcoin. In this more mature market, Bitcoin can remain the macro anchor, while the upside shifts toward the top altcoins that pair clear stories with working products and lean tokenomics. Meme coins still matter, but they now need actual hooks. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) tries to be one of those hooks. It blends Pepe style culture with a mine to earn model that turns virtual mining into a browser based strategy game. With more than $2.1M already raised at a presale price of $0.0011454 and 605% staking rewards, it gives rotated Bitcoin profits a defined, higher risk lane. PEPENODE’s Mine-To-Earn Model And Presale In One Snapshot PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) starts from a basic problem – most crypto presales and staking pools are passive: you buy, you lock, you wait, and attention fades long before launch. The project’s whitepaper instead describes a virtual mining simulator. After TGE, holders will build a server room inside a web app by buying Miner Nodes and upgrading Facilities with $PEPENODE. A dashboard tracks simulated hashrate, energy use and rewards so it feels like running a mining farm without hardware, noise or power bills. PEPENODE also plugs into existing meme liquidity instead of ignoring it. Leaderboards and bonus pools aim to pay rewards not only in $PEPENODE but also in some of the best meme coins such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. One active position can become exposure to several assets, which appeals to traders who prefer to keep their stack working instead of parked in a single token. On the funding side, the presale runs as a community first public sale with no private rounds or insider allocations. Pricing began around $0.001 and sits at $0.0011454 in the current stage, with $ETH, $BNB, $USDT and card payments accepted. Here’s how to buy PEPENODE now. Early staking yields at 605% are live alongside the raise and are designed to step down as more tokens are locked, encouraging commitment rather than quick flips. Our $PEPENODE price prediction sees a potential high near $0.0031 in 2025, with a 2026 range between roughly $0.0022 and $0.0077 if the game ships on time and user numbers grow. From a presale level around $0.0011454, that translates into indicative moves of about 2.7x at the first target and up to roughly 6.7x at the top of the 2026 band. For investors who now hold Bitcoin exposure through ETFs and want a defined risk sleeve for growth, PEPENODE offers a narrative that lines up with the wider rotation into utility driven altcoins and interactive on chain products. Consider PepeNode when shaping your next altcoin sleeve. This article is informational only, not financial advice; cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and can lead to full loss of invested capital.

The backing of the GAIN AI Act shows the growing competition for AI chips in the U.S. The Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2025 (GAIN AI Act) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on October 31, 2025. U.S. Senator Jim Banks (R-IN), a Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, stated that the Act ensures American-made technology is used to support U.S. security and economy before being transferred to foreign adversaries. U.S. pushes AI export limits for security According to the WSJ report, the GAIN AI Act is supported by AI startup Anthropic. The report stated that Microsoft openly endorsed the proposal, while representatives from Amazon’s cloud division told Senate staff members that they also backed it. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is among the prominent Democrats who favor the GAIN AI Act. He maintained that the bill is crucial to strengthening American leadership in AI and averting future chip shortages. Notably, the proposed legislation reflects Washington’s attempt to prioritize American interests in the face of concerns that China would utilize access to AI technologies to enhance its military capabilities. “As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.” -Gina Raimondo, U.S. Commerce Secretary. Raimondo added that limiting the export of AI chips ensures that enemies cannot use AI technologies to gain a tactical military edge. She claimed that by preserving the technology, the U.S maintains both global stability and its capacity for innovation. Earlier this year, the Trump administration unveiled an AI Action Plan to achieve its goal of solidifying America’s position as a global leader in AI. The AI Action Plan primarily focused on the private sector and largely sidestepped a critical battlefield for AI’s future by establishing standards for its application in the military. China and Russia have made significant investments in AI, sparking a global technological arms race. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China stressed the importance of “intelligentized warfare,” incorporating AI into all facets of its military tactics. On the other hand, Russia has concentrated on creating AI-enabled systems for automated command centers, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare. According to FutureWerx, the United States’ export controls are intended to counteract China and Russia’s breakthroughs by preventing rivals from obtaining essential AI components. Nvidia pushes back as export rules tighten Nvidia, which controls approximately 80% of the market for AI chips, has spent $3.5 million this year on a vigorous lobbying campaign against the measure. The tech firm claimed that the GAIN AI Act could lead to even stricter export regulations from Washington and potentially distort international semiconductor markets. Last month, Cryptopolitan reported that the White House reportedly faced tensions with Nvidia over trade regulatory policies imposed on U.S. export controls on semiconductors. According to the report, Nvidia reported that Strict export restrictions on its chip shipments would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. The strict export laws were implemented following the tech company’s announcement that it would construct $500 billion worth of AI servers in the U.S. over the next four years, with assistance from partners like TSMC. On July 4, 2025, the U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration lifted restrictions on the export of chip design software to China. The U.S. Commerce Department informed all three companies, Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens, that the export restrictions put in place in May had been lifted. The U.S. stopped selling China essential software tools used to design semiconductors in late May, in retaliation for Beijing’s effective stifling of rare earth exports, which rekindled tensions between the two nations after a trade truce was reached in Geneva earlier that month.

ONDO and HYPE are catching eyes with their impressive performance and potential. This piece explores if these two coins are set to become major players. Dive in to uncover the factors driving their potential ascent. In the crypto world, how people see a project isn't just about the numbers; the story you tell is huge. Outset PR excels in making sure your brand's narrative hits the market perfectly, giving blockchain and Web3 projects a big boost right when they need it most. Ondo Finance: Preparing for a Promising Surge in the Next Altcoin Season Ondo Finance is making waves in the crypto world. It's a project focused on providing structured finance products for DeFi. This means it aims to help investors earn steady returns by managing financial risks well. As we look at the potential for a new altcoin season, Ondo's innovative approach becomes appealing. The team behind it is strong, and they aim to create safer investment options within the crypto space.

Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter?

54384264,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/trust-vs-algorithms-outset-pr-maps-asias-split-in-crypto-media-traffic,1763112371,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/54384264.jpeg,Trust vs. Algorithms: Outset PR Maps Asia’s Split in Crypto Media Traffic,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/trust-vs-algorithms-outset-pr-maps-asias-split-in-crypto-media-traffic,"The race for crypto visibility in Asia is intensifying as the region cements its role as a global driver of digital asset adoption. A new report from Outset PR , a crypto-native public relations agency, reveals a divide in how audiences across East and Southeast Asia find crypto news, pitting trust-based readership against AI-driven discovery. South Korea and Japan Lead Asia’s Crypto Media Traffic The latest Outset PR report was based on Similarweb data from more than 170 crypto-related media outlets across ten Asian countries in the second quarter of 2025. Led by Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé, Outset PR’s team evaluated not only traffic but also engagement metrics, revealing how audiences interact with crypto news platforms in markets including Hong Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore. The report found that South Korea accounted for about 60% of all regional crypto media traffic (an estimated 57 million visits). Japan followed with 12% (11.7 million visits). Source: outsetpr.io The top-performing outlet was South Korean CoinReaders, a crypto publication that produces content in the native language. More than half its traffic comes directly from users visiting the site intentionally, reflecting brand loyalty and reader trust rather than algorithmic exposure. This sentiment mirrors a wider behavioral trend in Asia, where users tend to favor established, reputable media sources. Audience Trust Defines Asia’s Crypto Media Outset PR’s previous report underscores this point. In Eastern Europe , direct traffic to crypto outlets made up around 45% of total visits in Q2 2025. In Asia, the figure was nearly 55%—a sign of deep-rooted reader loyalty and repeat visitation. This reflects a cultural preference for reliability over novelty. Readers in Asia tend to rely on experience-based trust when selecting information sources. But while this trust-based model defines mature markets like South Korea and Japan, other parts of the region are already experimenting with new discovery channels. AI Referrals Gain Ground in China The same study reveals that AI-driven discovery is rapidly changing traffic dynamics in China. 528BTC, a Chinese crypto outlet ranked fourth regionally, receives over a quarter of its referrals from AI aggregators. BlockBeats, another leading Chinese-language media platform, reveals that around 11% of total visits come through AI referral links. As one surveyed publisher observed, “Some of our sites saw traffic decline as users began relying on AI tools like ChatGPT instead of Google.” Another added, “AI summarization reduces clicks, but it also rewards clear, structured content. We’re now optimizing for model visibility – not just search.” These comments illustrate how publishers are beginning to adjust content strategies for AI-driven visibility as they prepare for a new period in media optimization. A Market Balancing Trust and Technology Across all publishers tracked, AI-driven visits accounted for an average of 18% of referral traffic, with some outlets seeing figures as high as 68%. The uneven distribution points to a dual market reality: some regions still revolve around trusted, repeat readership, while others are shifting toward algorithmic discovery and machine-driven exposure. Outset PR and the Data Behind the Report Behind the findings stands Outset PR , the only data-driven crypto PR agency that systematically tracks the performance of crypto media outlets across regions. Unlike traditional communications firms that rely solely on reach metrics or ad spending, Outset PR integrates analytics to optimize campaign efficiency, maximize organic exposure, and cut unnecessary costs. By analyzing patterns in traffic sources, audience engagement, and publication impact, Outset PR refines where and how projects should tell their stories. Powering this analytical approach is Outset Data Pulse , a proprietary intelligence reporting system developed by Outset PR. It provides consistent benchmarking of crypto media performance across markets and delivers actionable intelligence for PR and marketing teams worldwide. Outset Data Pulse goes beyond surface metrics. It maps how media dynamics intersect with adoption trends, algorithm shifts, and user behavior, revealing hidden patterns that shape legitimacy, discovery, and influence in the crypto narrative. For the crypto community, it serves as an early-warning system — signaling when sentiment or coverage patterns begin to shift. For PR professionals, it offers scalable tools to act on those insights quickly, adjusting campaigns in real time. Conclusion Asia’s crypto media landscape is moving on two parallel tracks. South Korea and Japan demonstrate the strength of loyalty-based engagement, while China’s publishers lead in adopting AI-integrated visibility. Outset PR’s findings suggest that the next phase of growth will depend on how effectively media outlets balance these forces. The winners will likely be those who combine trust, transparency, and human identity with technological adaptability so they could capture both the confidence of traditional readers and the curiosity of AI-driven audiences.

Early Investors Point to This Emerging DeFi Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-crypto-to-surge-600-early-investors-point-to-this-emerging-defi-token/,"In each and every market cycle, there comes a project silently booming and then a big headline. Many early investors anticipate that in Q4 2025 the project may be Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi crypto that develops the full-scale lending protocol, which is designed in the most efficient and transparent way and has the ability to be long-term sustainable. Whereas the bigger cryptocurrencies have already reflected on their potential growth, Mutuum Finance has not yet reached that point, and therefore, investors could gain exposure prior to the listing and the live product rollout. DeFi System at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing application that aims to streamline the process of users getting yield or accessing liquidity without using intermediaries. This protocol operates on two complementary markets, i.e. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), that collaborate for the greatest possible flexibility and stability. In P2C model, users are able to lend assets in common liquidity pools and are given in exchange of mtTokens. These tokens serve as evidence of deposit and they earn interest in the course of time. The P2P model gives more direct interactions between borrowers and lenders. It has both unpredictable and predictable borrowing rates, whereby the user is allowed to control the risk based on his or her approach. Variable rates will fluctuate with the need of the market and stable rates are predictable when the loan is to be repaid over a long period. Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios of borrowed funds secure each position of a borrowed loan and indicate the amount that can be borrowed within the value of the collateral. Presale Performance and Investor Momentum Presale data of the project is pointing out an increased traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was launched in the early presale in 2025 (at $0.01), and at Phase 6, the price has increased to $0.035, being 2.5x higher than it was at the initial stage. The present stage is more than 86% billed indicating that the retail and the institutional buyers have high demands. To date, the project has raised $18.7 million, registered 18,000 of holders and sold 796 million tokens. Phase 1 investors might see more than 500% MUTM appreciation in the case of the token being priced at its actual debut price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance also has a leaderboard with prizes of MUTM in the form of $500 in MUTM to the top performer of the day in order to maintain a high level of engagement. The team recently indicated that the users can acquire MUTM using cards now, eliminating the former restrictions and making the process easier to access by international participants. Testnet Launch, Audit and Analyst Outlook Mutuum Finance assured in X that V1 protocol will roll out on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The initial one will present the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot to establish the background of the mainnet launch and even wider lending power. The high consideration of the transparency and safety, which are characteristics of the platform, have drawn the attention of the analysts, as well. The CertiK audit has a 90/100 Token Scan score, indicating a great level of smart-contract security. The team also operates a bug bounty initiative of $50,000. Analysts are positive by viewing these developments as developmental achievements. One project where MUTM could increase 5x-6x in the short term of the initial post-launch phase in case of adoption expectations. Stablecoin Plans and Layer-2 Expansion Mutuum Finance does not just have lending as a potential source of growth. The system is scheduled to roll out its own USD pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burnt at request. The team has also announced Layer-2 deployment that will enhance the speed in transactions and low gas costs on the side of the users. This growth is essential to the scaling, as Layer-2 networks can make lending and borrowing cheaper and faster. The buy and distribute mechanism of the protocol also provides long-term demand in the market. One of the revenue streams of the platform buys MUTM in the open market, and acquired tokens are re-distributed to stakers of the mtTokens in the Safety Module. This brings about an incessant pressure of purchase that boosts a long-term holder directly. These are the elements that make the Mutuum Finance, according to the words of many analysts, a potential top crypto to buy now to place it in the top 2026 list because of these elements: stablecoin integration, Layer-2 functionality, and revenue redistribution. Investors Project 600% Upside Potential A product that has been audited, a developing model of DeFi and steady traction of presale could put Mutuum Finance in a strong position as the year 2021 starts. Analysts point to lower-cost DeFi tokens tending to perform well in early bull markets, and as MUTM has an accessible price of $0.035 on entry, there is much more room for an increase than with existing assets. The 600% price increase to prices of around %0.25 is not far-fetched as long as the lending protocol is adopted and the adoption of stablecoins grows in the anticipated manner. The model is directly connected with the activity of the platform, generating value rather than relying on the sentiment completely. There are numerous big tokens that are already priced to maturity, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a unique chance at the crossroads of early development and viable innovation in DeFi. Having raised an initial amount of $18.7 million, 18,000 holders, audited code, and its impending V1 release, the project has gained a consistent momentum with actual progress to support its cause. Provided that the growth upon which it currently bases itself persists, within a near future Mutuum Finance might cease being a rise to fame and become one of the best place to hold long-term DeFi exposure and potentially achieve the 600% upside that many of its initial investors are currently projecting by the year 2026.

This massive transaction reveals how sophisticated players are positioning themselves in the current market landscape. Who Is This Mysterious Anonymous Whale? An anonymous whale recently acquired 9,945 ETH through over-the-counter trades executed via major platforms including FalconX, Wintermute, and Coinbase. This substantial purchase demonstrates the continued confidence large investors have in Ethereum’s long-term potential. The same entity has previously demonstrated remarkable trading prowess, having earned an impressive $94 million from swing trading activities. Why Are Anonymous Whale Movements So Significant?

This anonymous whale utilized three major OTC providers to complete their substantial Ethereum acquisition. The strategy demonstrates professional execution and careful planning that characterizes sophisticated market participants. What Can We Learn From This Anonymous Whale’s Strategy? The previous $94 million profit from swing trading suggests this anonymous whale possesses exceptional market timing and analysis capabilities. Their current massive Ethereum accumulation might indicate: Bullish outlook on Ethereum’s future Strategic accumulation during current market conditions Portfolio rebalancing toward established cryptocurrencies Long-term holding strategy despite market volatility Why Should Retail Investors Monitor Anonymous Whale Activity?

How can I track whale movements? You can monitor whale activity through blockchain analytics platforms, on-chain data tools, and specialized cryptocurrency tracking services that identify large transactions. Should retail investors follow whale trades? While whale movements provide valuable market insights, retail investors should conduct their own research rather than blindly following large trades, as whales may have different investment horizons and strategies. What does a large ETH purchase indicate? Substantial Ethereum purchases often signal confidence in the asset’s future performance and can indicate accumulating positions before potential price movements.

The price has dropped from around $0.0000005704 to $0.0000005281, reflecting an estimated decline of about 7.4%. As of today, PEPE exhibits a clear bearish trend, dropping from around $0.000059 to the $0.000052 zone, with weak recovery attempts. Each bounce near $0.000054 faces selling pressure, showing limited buyer strength. Overall, the price remains under steady downward pressure, signaling cautious sentiment among traders. At the time of writing, PEPE was trading at $0.000005264, representing a 10% decrease in the last 24 hours. PEPE price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) PEPE Shows Early Signs of Stabilizing After Prolonged Downtrend According to recent data from Pepe Whale, PEPE has been moving in a sustained downtrend, with each attempt to bounce resulting in a lower high. This behavior reflects consistent selling pressure and weak momentum from buyers. The price temporarily stabilized in a small consolidation zone near $0.00000680, but it eventually broke down, signaling that the market was not ready to shift out of the bearish structure. As a result, PEPE continued drifting lower toward its next support region. Currently, the chart indicates early signs of the price stabilizing after the recent decline. The selling pressure is slowing, and a minor rebound structure is beginning to form. If buyers strengthen their position, PEPE could attempt a short-term recovery toward the $0.00000680–$0.00000800 zone, which now stands as the next key resistance area. A move into this region would indicate improved sentiment, although the overall trend still requires a strong breakout to shift to a bullish stance. PEPE Struggles Near Support as Bearish Momentum Dominates PEPE continues to move in a clear downtrend on the 1-day chart, forming lower highs and gradually grinding lower after each brief bounce. The price has slipped back toward a major support zone near $0.00000520, which has been tested multiple times. Overhead, the closest resistance sits around $0.00000580–$0.00000600, where previous rallies have repeatedly stalled.

54385175,https://invezz.com/?p=2967803,1763112694,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Kraken joins Ripple and Tether in sidestepping the crypto IPO craze,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/14/kraken-joins-ripple-and-tether-in-sidestepping-the-crypto-ipo-craze/,"Kraken has no immediate plans for an IPO, even though earlier reports suggested the crypto exchange was looking to go public by 2026. Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi isn’t concerned about missing out on the IPO frenzy, emphasizing that the company remains financially strong and won’t “race to the door as quickly as possible.” “We have enough capital on our balance sheet today as a private company,” Sethi said during an interview with Yahoo Finance. Kraken’s financials remain strong Reports that Kraken was preparing for a public listing have been circulating since mid-2024 and gained more traction this year, and that’s not surprising given how the regulatory climate in the United States has improved under pro-crypto President Donald Trump. A number of Kraken’s direct competitors, like Circle, Bullish , and Gemini, have made headlines with their public listings, as Wall Street’s response has been largely enthusiastic. For instance, Circle’s June IPO raised over 1.1 billion dollars and sent its stock surging by more than 160% in the days after going public, briefly pushing its market cap above $23 billion. Meanwhile, Gemini made a splash with its debut earlier this year, joining a growing list of crypto-native firms tapping into public markets. Yet, Kraken’s hesitation to go public finds strength in the business fundamentals that continue to support its long-term strategy. Last month, Kraken published its third-quarter earnings report, where it posted a record-breaking quarter with total revenue reaching 648 million dollars, a 47% increase over the previous quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA came in at $178.6 million, marking a 124% jump, while the exchange saw its total transaction volume climb to $561.9 billion, even as broader crypto markets remained volatile. Much of this growth stems from consistent expansion efforts and new products launched globally over the past year. For instance, earlier this month, Kraken rolled out regulated crypto-collateral perpetual futures trading for European clients, allowing them to use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and select stablecoins as margin. Offered under full EU regulatory compliance, the new service has opened up more capital-efficient trading options for both institutions and active traders. Kraken has also emerged as a leading player in the tokenized stocks market with its xStocks launch in June, offering access to 60 US equities for international clients through a partnership with Backed. At the same time, the company has made key acquisitions to deepen its presence in traditional financial infrastructure. Most recently, Kraken acquired Small Exchange for $100 million, which granted it a Designated Contract Market license from the CFTC, a move that fits into Kraken’s long-term plan to build a fully regulated US-based derivatives venue. Given these developments, it’s not surprising that Kraken feels no urgency to fast-track its Wall Street debut, especially as it continues to secure substantial private funding. In September, the company closed a $500 million funding round without a lead investor, placing its valuation at $15 billion. Participating members included investment firms, VCs, and CEO Arjun Sethi himself through Tribe Capital and his personal capacity. Leading crypto firms skip IPO hype Kraken now joins a select group of major crypto firms that are not rushing to list on public markets despite favorable conditions. Blockchain payments company Ripple, for instance, has given a similar explanation when asked about its IPO plans. When asked, company president Monica Long made it clear that Ripple has “no plan, no timeline” for a listing, as the company sees little value in going public at this stage and prefers to focus on scaling its products and infrastructure while remaining privately funded. Tether, the stablecoin issuer behind the largest dollar-pegged token USDT, has also shown no interest in pursuing a public listing. Instead, it continues to focus on strengthening its market dominance and expanding into new financial infrastructure plays, including recent investments in payment platforms, data security ventures, and the artificial intelligence sector.

That future is here as Alibaba, the Chinese tech titan, embraces tokenization for its B2B cross-border payment systems. This groundbreaking move signals a major shift in how global commerce operates, leveraging digital tokens to simplify complex financial processes. What Is Tokenization and Why Is Alibaba Adopting It? Tokenization converts traditional assets like currencies into digital tokens on a blockchain. For Alibaba, this means creating tokenized U.S. dollars and euros for B2B transactions. Chairman Kuo Zhang confirmed this strategy, highlighting its potential to reduce delays and fraud in cross-border trade. Essentially, tokenization acts as a digital bridge between different financial systems. How Will Alibaba’s Tokenization Partnership with JPMorgan Work? Alibaba plans to collaborate with JPMorgan, a leader in blockchain technology. JPMorgan brings its own tokenization expertise to the table, ensuring a smooth implementation. Together, they aim to build a system where businesses can transact using tokenized currencies without traditional banking hurdles. This partnership combines Alibaba’s vast e-commerce network with JPMorgan’s financial innovation. Key benefits of this tokenization initiative include: Faster settlements : Transactions that once took days could complete in minutes Enhanced security : Blockchain technology reduces the risk of fraud and errors Lower costs : Cutting out intermediaries saves money for businesses Global accessibility : Small and medium enterprises can compete internationally What Challenges Might Arise with Tokenization in B2B Payments? While tokenization offers numerous advantages, it’s not without challenges. Regulatory compliance across different countries remains a significant hurdle. Moreover, businesses must adapt to new technological standards. However, Alibaba’s partnership with established financial institutions like JPMorgan helps address these concerns through proven frameworks. How Could Tokenization Reshape Global Trade? Tokenization has the power to democratize international business. By streamlining payments, it enables smaller companies to engage in cross-border trade more easily. This aligns with broader trends in digital transformation, where blockchain solutions are becoming mainstream. As more corporations adopt similar approaches, we might see a new era of efficient global commerce. In summary, Alibaba’s move into tokenization marks a pivotal moment for B2B payments. It combines innovation with practicality, offering tangible benefits for businesses worldwide. This step not only modernizes financial operations but also sets a precedent for other tech giants to follow. Frequently Asked Questions What is tokenization in simple terms? Tokenization turns real-world assets like money into digital tokens that can be securely transferred on a blockchain. When will Alibaba launch tokenized payments? While no exact date is confirmed, the company has announced plans to implement this technology soon in collaboration with partners. Are tokenized payments safe? Yes, blockchain-based tokenization offers enhanced security through encryption and decentralized verification. How will this affect small businesses? Small businesses can benefit from lower transaction costs and faster international payments, leveling the playing field. What currencies are being tokenized? Alibaba specifically mentioned tokenized U.S. dollars and euros for initial implementation. Will this replace traditional banking? Not immediately, but it could reduce reliance on intermediaries for certain types of transactions over time.

Meanwhile, the Sterling retreat continues as British economic concerns mount. For cryptocurrency investors watching these traditional currency movements, understanding these forex market dynamics could reveal crucial patterns for digital asset correlations. Why is the Dollar facing a weekly loss despite recent gains? The Dollar weekly loss pattern emerges despite Friday’s upward movement due to several key factors. Federal Reserve policy uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on market sentiment. Recent economic data has shown mixed signals, leaving traders uncertain about future interest rate decisions. The currency movements reflect this confusion, with the Dollar index down approximately 0.8% for the week. Sterling retreat: What’s driving the British currency downward? The Sterling retreat has become increasingly pronounced throughout the trading week. Several economic indicators have contributed to this decline: Weaker-than-expected retail sales data Political uncertainty surrounding upcoming elections Bank of England’s cautious approach to rate cuts Manufacturing sector contraction Currency Pair Weekly Change Key Drivers USD/GBP +1.2% Sterling weakness, Dollar resilience EUR/USD -0.5% ECB policy divergence USD/JPY +0.8% BoJ intervention concerns Forex market reactions to global economic shifts The broader forex market is experiencing significant volatility as traders reposition their portfolios. Currency movements have been particularly sharp in emerging markets, where central banks are responding to Dollar strength. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming meetings will be crucial for determining whether the Dollar weekly loss trend continues or reverses. Federal Reserve policy impact on currency stability Federal Reserve decisions remain the primary driver of Dollar movements. Recent comments from Fed officials suggest a more cautious approach to rate cuts than markets had anticipated. This has created the perfect storm for the current Dollar weekly loss situation, where short-term gains mask underlying weakness. Actionable insights for currency traders Successful navigation of these currency movements requires careful strategy: Monitor Federal Reserve communications closely Watch for breakouts in key currency pairs Consider correlation with cryptocurrency markets Implement proper risk management techniques The current Dollar weekly loss scenario, combined with the ongoing Sterling retreat, highlights the fragile nature of global currency markets. While Friday’s Dollar gains provide temporary relief, the underlying trends suggest continued volatility ahead. The Federal Reserve’s next moves will be critical in determining whether this represents a temporary correction or the beginning of a more significant trend reversal in forex market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What companies are most affected by these currency movements? Multinational corporations like Apple and Microsoft face significant impacts from Dollar fluctuations in their international revenue. Which financial institutions are monitoring this situation? Major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs provide regular analysis on currency movements. Are there notable figures commenting on these trends? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey frequently address currency market developments.

Ark Invest Buys $15.6 Million in Circle Shares; Increases BitMine and Bullish Positions The company purchased $15.56 million worth of Circle Internet Group stock, along with millions of additional investments in BitMine and Bullish stock. These purchases were made through three different ETFs affiliated with Ark Invest.

In early May, WLD experienced a notable surge, quickly positioning itself among the top-performing altcoins. This rise coincided with a spike in activity surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly those related to OpenAI.

The token finds support near $0.72–$0.73, while resistance remains around $0.74, marking important zones for potential price reactions. Intraday swings between $0.71 and $0.74 indicate active buying and selling, highlighting short-term trading opportunities. On November 14, 2025, Worldcoin is trades at $0.7315, reflecting a 24-hour decline of 8.19%. The token has experienced a sharp drop from its intraday high of $0.8014 to a low of $0.7029. Recent market activity shows increased volatility for WLD, with fluctuations driven by broader crypto market sentiment and trading activity on Ethereum and Optimism chains. As of now, WLD holders are navigating price retracements, while analysts monitor potential support levels to gauge stability. Worldcoin daily price chart: WLD faces bearish pressure as it drops toward $0.73 The daily chart shows a clear downtrend following WLD’s peak near $0.80 earlier in the session. Price action indicates a series of lower highs and lower lows, with resistance forming around $0.74 and support near $0.72. The sharp midday decline suggests strong selling pressure, while minor rebounds indicate some buying interest at lower levels. Technical indicators point to continued volatility, with the 24-hour moving average now trending downward, confirming short-term bearish sentiment. WLD/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term bounce if buyers re-enter. Market participants should watch for consolidation around $0.72–$0.73, which may provide a temporary floor before the next price movement. Worldcoin 4-hour price chart: WLD shows volatile swings and potential short-term breakout On the 4-hour chart, WLD shows sharper intraday swings, with notable dips around $0.71 followed by quick recoveries to $0.74. This indicates active buying near support levels and short-term speculative trading. The moving average on this timeframe aligns with the daily trend, reinforcing short-term bearish momentum but highlighting minor recovery attempts.

Given the current price action, WLD may continue to face short-term pressure as sellers dominate near the $0.74 resistance zone. However, the support range between $0.72 and $0.73 could act as a temporary floor, offering potential entry points for buyers looking for short-term rebounds. If WLD breaks below $0.72, a deeper retracement toward $0.70 or lower could occur, reflecting heightened market caution. On the other hand, sustained buying around support levels could stabilize the token, leading to minor recoveries toward $0.74–$0.75 in the coming sessions. Traders should monitor intraday swings closely, as the volatile price behavior suggests that short-term opportunities may arise, but risks remain elevated. Consolidation around key levels may precede the next decisive move, either continuation of the downtrend or a temporary reversal. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) currently shows high short-term volatility, with price swings driven by broader market sentiment and speculative trading. For risk-tolerant traders, this presents opportunities to capitalize on intraday movements near key support and resistance levels. However, the recent downtrend and potential for further retracements suggest caution for long-term investors. Those considering WLD as a long-term investment should closely monitor market conditions, broader crypto trends, and the token’s ability to stabilize above $0.72 before committing significant capital. Overall, WLD may appeal more to active traders seeking short-term gains rather than conservative investors looking for stable long-term growth. Why is the WLD Price Down today Worldcoin’s (WLD) price decline today is largely driven by heightened selling pressure following its recent intraday peak near $0.80. Traders reacted to profit-taking and broader negative sentiment in the crypto market, which has impacted other tokens on Ethereum and Optimism chains. In addition, the sharp drop reflects a combination of short-term speculative trading and cautious investor behavior as WLD tests key support levels around $0.72–$0.73. The increased volatility suggests that market participants are weighing both the potential for a rebound and the risk of further declines, leading to active buying and selling swings throughout the day. External factors, such as broader market trends, regulatory news, or shifts in investor sentiment toward digital assets, can also influence WLD’s movement, contributing to today’s downward trajectory. Recent news Mythical Games, a leading Web3 studio, is set to integrate Worldcoin’s World ID into its popular titles, including NFL Rivals, FIFA Rivals, and Pudgy Party. This collaboration aims to revolutionize online gaming by introducing proof-of-humanity verification, ensuring that every player is a verified human without compromising privacy. Will Worldcoin reach $5? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Worldcoin is projected to reach up to $5 by 2031. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? The WLD coin is exhibiting a recovery trend; therefore, many may consider investing in the token, as it may have a promising long-term future and could be viewed as a good investment. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Will it go over, or is there still hope in the TA charts for a rebound? While the charts are suggesting that a strong bounce from Bitcoin could take place from here, the negative economic factors weighing on the global economy are telling a different story. With recession odds climbing, arguably due to the yield curve inversion and tariffs, how can Bitcoin buck this trend? Bitcoin on the edge Source: TradingView This is what Bitcoin on the edge looks like. If the major trendline fails, a descent to $91,000 is probably next. That said, from a technical analysis perspective, this is a perfect place for a rebound. The major trendline stretches back over 15 months and this would be the fourth touchpoint, which would serve to validate the trendline and make it even more robust as support. If the bulls are able to save the day here, the ensuing bounce would need to take out the above resistances, with $107,000 being the key resistance level that could lead $BTC back to the all-time high if it is surpassed. More than $1 billion liquidated in a few hours Another factor to consider is that more than $1 billion in value has been liquidated over the last 24 hours. This is one of the biggest wipeouts this year, but at the same time whales (aka the smart money) are buying the dip. According to CryptoQuant, more than 4,000 BTC were accumulated by whales in just a few hours this morning as the price dipped below $98,000. One last chance at $91,000? Source: TradingView There is no beating around the bush on the daily chart. The stark facts speak for themselves. If the $BTC price falls through the major trendline there is potentially one last chance for the bulls at $91,000. There are no more chances and no more lines in the sand after this - it would be an entry into a bear market, pure and simple. Even in such a situation, if the bear market scenario were to play out, all bear markets so far have seen the price come down to retest the tops of all previous bull markets. If this is to be the case here, from $90,000 it would only be another $21,000 (23%) drop to get to the 2021 top at $69,000, a total retracement of 43% from the all-time high. In comparison, the 2021/2022 top to bottom retracement was 77%. Perhaps this would be a sign of much shallower bull and bear markets to come. A perfect bullish scenario could still be the result Source: TradingView The weekly chart also spells out the clarity of the situation right now. It can be seen that there is the possibility of what would probably have to be a candle wick coming down to $91,000. However, given how this trendline has been tested so far, it would be more likely perhaps for the price to rise back up and finish above $100,000 by the end of the week. This would be the perfect bullish scenario. At the bottom of the chart is the key element. This shows the Stochastic RSI indicators just about hitting the bottom. The same thing happened in April this year, and the subsequent price rise back then was 66%. The same price rise from the current price level would take $BTC to $160,000.

However, institutions remain bullish into year-end, with many planning to increase crypto allocations as regulatory clarity improves. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are among the best crypto presales that align with today’s market: one solves throughput; the other captures rotation with community utility. Quant ($QNT) provides listed exposure to interoperability, trading on major exchanges with a market cap around the $1B+ zone. Pessimism spiked after this week’s drawdown. Derivatives funding reset, retail mood turned sour, and headlines called out defensive positioning across majors. As expected, Bitcoin is at the heart of it, after dipping below $100K for the second time this month, trading at $97,216 at the time of writing. Institutions haven’t packed up. Surveys and flow updates point to cautious optimism into year-end, with a meaningful share of allocators preparing to add on regulatory clarity and the continued mainstreaming of ETFs and tokenized products. 🗓️ Several recent polls and briefings indicate many plan to increase digital-asset exposure over the next three to 12 months, even as they hedge for more volatility. Some 80% of investors still see Bitcoin as a valuable investment, while 70% prefer it to cash on a five-year plan. That split view – retail fatigue vs institutional preparation – creates a pocket for builders and early-stage narratives. Infrastructure bets with clear utility can compound when the market turn arrives, while cultural tokens with sticky communities can surprise the upside on rotation. Within that frame, here are three names to watch: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – both presales positioned for the next leg – and Quant ($QNT), a listed interoperability play already liquid on major exchanges. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer-2 With SVM Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching a pragmatic fix to Bitcoin’s throughput gap: a Bitcoin-anchored Layer-2 that taps the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver low-latency, low-fee transactions and smart contracts, while staying aligned with Bitcoin’s security ethos. In simple terms, it aims to bring Solana-like performance to Bitcoin without forcing developers to abandon familiar tooling. That’s the kind of infrastructure institutions prefer: tangible utility, a clear roadmap, and credible throughput. The presale is already well capitalized, reaching the $27M milestone yesterday. However, a massive $502.6K whale buy has since boosted the presale raise to $27.5M+. That right there is a solid indication of investor confidence in this Layer-2 project. These figures matter because execution runway + fair initial pricing are what let builders ship during choppy markets. Right now, $HYPER is priced at $0.013275 with staking at 42% APY. From a return framework, our price prediction for $HYPER hints at a potential and $0.08625 by the end of 2026 if mainnet milestones, early dApps, and DAO governance land on schedule. 💰 Based on today’s presale price, that implies a ~5.5x upside – ambitious, but grounded in a roadmap that targets real usage, not vibes. ➡️ Check our guide to buying $HYPER if you’re thinking of joining the presale. If Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 consistently delivers low-cost, high-throughput rails for $BTC settlement and programmatic finance, it should attract builders chasing order flow when risk comes back on. Consider it a conviction-weighted presale for those hunting utility over pure beta. 🚀 Secure your $HYPER today before the next price increase. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Meme Culture With DeFi-Native Hooks Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans straight into trader culture – the sleepless, levered, ‘one more candle’ energy – then pairs it with a presale funnel that’s fast to use and heavy on community loops. The hook isn’t just memes. The project’s roadmaps sets out trading competitions, staking, and planned integrations that can keep activity sticky after the novelty fades. In a market where attention ricochets, utility-adjacent memes are the ones that tend to survive. The Maxi Doge presale has raised $4M+ to date, with the current price at $0.000268 and a 77% staking APY. Be sure to read our guide on how to buy $MAXI if this meme coin is right up your alley. That presale raise matters, by the way. That’s because social coins usually need both a treasury buffer and early participation to reach the first listings with momentum. If rotation picks up from majors into meme coins, tokens with strong onboarding and recurring events typically capture disproportionate flows. 💰 Because of this, we expect $MAXI to see a post-launch surge, which would reflect its outstanding presale performance. Based on the raw numbers, investor participation, and Maxi Doge’s unapologetic ecosystem, this could become one of the best crypto presales to buy before 2026. Maxi Doge’s branding is loud, but the mechanics – onboarding, competitions, staking – aim to sustain engagement rather than just farm attention. If you want a higher-beta ticket with a clearer plan than a vanilla meme coin, this is the one to watch. 🚀 Buy your $MAXI now by visiting the official presale website. 3. Quant ($QNT) – Interoperability for the Multi-Chain Reality On the listed side, Quant ($QNT) remains a steady pick for cross-chain plumbing. Its Overledger architecture focuses on connecting disparate ledgers and enabling multi-chain applications – the kind of ‘boring’ middleware that enterprises actually need. In a market drifting back toward fundamentals, that narrative resonates more than empty metaverse promises. Quant’s market cap sits around the $1B+ mark, with a price above $90 at the time of writing. Access is easy. $QNT trades on major centralized venues – Coinbase and Binance among them – with active $USD and $USDT pairs and healthy depth. 💡 If you want liquid exposure to an interoperability thesis without taking presale risk, this is a straightforward allocation that still benefits from any 2026-style build-out of tokenized assets and multi-chain apps across finance and enterprise. Interoperability also fits the current macro read. Institutions scaling in prefer neutral picks that enable compliance-friendly workflows, cross-ledger data sharing, and modular deployments. If the next wave of adoption is tokenized real-world assets, enterprise settlement, and ETF-adjacent wrappers, networks that connect the pipes should see durable demand. 🚀 Head to Binance or other leading exhanges to invest in $QNT today. Recap: Risk is elevated, but signals into the weekend lean constructive. Retail is defensive, institutions are preparing, and that split rewards clear narratives. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets Bitcoin scalability with an SVM-powered Layer-2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) merges meme energy with engagement mechanics. Quant ($QNT) offers liquid exposure to interoperability as a service. Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Always do your own research and manage risks wisely before investing.

The latest model accounted for nearly 80% of all Apple phone purchases in China since its September 19 release date, according to Counterpoint’s findings. The launch attracted crowds of several hundred shoppers to the company’s main Beijing location on opening day, showing continued customer interest even as local rivals Xiaomi and Huawei ramp up competition. The positive results come as China’s overall mobile phone industry struggles with weak buyer appetite. The country’s smartphone sector saw sales slip 2.7% during the third quarter when measured against the previous year, Counterpoint reported. Looking at both major markets, the iPhone 17 range outperformed its predecessor by 14% when comparing the first ten days of availability in the United States and China. These numbers provide the earliest concrete measure of how shoppers responded in Apple’s two largest markets. The standard iPhone 17 model, priced at $799, attracted significantly more buyers than the equivalent version from last year. Industry watchers credit three key improvements: a better screen, increased storage capacity, and the new A19 processor chip. On the premium end, the iPhone 17 Pro Max proved especially popular with American buyers. The high-end device drew customers who purchased their previous phones during the pandemic years and held off on replacing them until now, Counterpoint noted. The company’s most expensive handset features its strongest camera system yet, better cooling technology, and the most substantial design changes seen in several years. iPhone revenue remains critical despite AI setbacks The California-based tech company still generates roughly half its total income from iPhone sales. Apple has maintained healthy sales numbers despite stumbles in developing artificial intelligence capabilities. Chinese buyers continue waiting for the company to launch Apple Intelligence features in their country. Last month, Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook traveled to China and committed to increasing the company’s financial commitments there. This came despite warnings from President Donald Trump about potential taxes on goods manufactured overseas. Cook held talks with Li Lecheng, China’s Minister of Industry and Information Technology . The minister pushed Apple to strengthen ties with Chinese parts suppliers. Cook responded by promising greater collaboration with the country. China remains Apple’s largest market beyond American borders and serves as a crucial production center for the company. Apple’s manufacturing diversification continues Though Apple has worked to spread its manufacturing operations beyond China in recent years, including growing phone assembly work in India, the country still produces most iPhones through partnerships with Foxconn Technology Group and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. The company plans to grow its American manufacturing footprint while building production capabilities in additional countries. Apple is getting ready to manufacture new home technology products in Vietnam to reduce reliance on Chinese factories. The sales figures highlight Apple’s ability to maintain its position in a challenging market where domestic brands have gained ground and overall demand remains sluggish.

Cardano (ADA) is still one among the most popular layer-1 blockchain platforms but has shown lower price appreciation and has yet to capitalize on its on-chain development successes. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already moving quickly as the next crypto to hit $1, focusing on risk-adjusted lending with an automatic risk-balancing function in the DeFi crypto market that will dominate the upcoming adoption cycle. At only $0.035 in price, new investors are looking to capitalize on the best crypto to buy prior to mainstream adoption. As the next crypto to hit $1, the contest is no longer ADA among meme coins but mainstream maturity vs. exponential growth. Cardano (ADA) Technical Outlook At the current stage, Cardano (ADA) is still in the process of establishing an ABC corrective move after its drop and still lacks strong momentum as sellers take over. The price chart recognizes that there is robust resistance situated within the $0.65–$0.66 range. If ADA fails to break above $0.66 with enough strength and instead holds below it, then there might be further downturn movement towards the $0.53–$0.50 area. Only after managing to break above $0.66 with confidence will there be a possibility to experience some form of resurgence with medium-term potential. As some investors are taking a second look at the potential ADA has to offer in the near term, others are finding newer investment alternatives within the market; this is the key reason that attention has shifted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the best crypto to buy for early exposure and potential growth. Moving on to Phase 2 in the Roadmap, Building Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is already moving forward in Phase 2 of its development roadmap, entitled “Building Mutuum,” which focuses on the technical development of the platform. In this stage, the development team is working on coding smart contracts and performing extensive internal testing on the DApp to build the front-end and back-end components. This stage also encompasses the development of sophisticated features for the platform and incorporating risk parameters and analytics to improve the dependability and efficiency of the platform before the testnet launch. Once Phase 2 has been finished, Mutuum Finance will move on to Phase 3, Finalizing Mutuum. This is the final stage of preparation that precedes its launch on the mainnet with V1 on the Sepolia testnet. Phase 3 will include activities such as testing on the testnet environment with a bug reporting system integrated. A Defining Milestone: V1 Protocol Launch The soon-to-be-unleashed V1 version is set to be a watershed event in the life history of Mutuum Finance. The testnet version will enable functions such as the establishment of the liquidity pool, use of the mtToken, use of the Debt Token solution, and use of the Liquidator Bot solution on the platform. The aim here is to enable the use of popular cryptocurrencies such as ETH and USDT. The environment here will enable the full functionality test of the product before proceeding to release further functionalities to more cryptocurrencies. The full product will be rolled out in 2026. Momentum Builds as Phase 6 Nears Completion As Phase 6 is about to complete its allocation fully, the momentum with which Mutuum Finance has gained lately shows no signs of slowing down. The fact that the project has had such success with its presale and that the development roadmap has been rather clear has led to it becoming a best crypto to buy in 2025. The V1 testnet launch has further added to the buzz among investors and developers. The systematic development and increase shown by Mutuum Finance has been impressive. The crypto market is uncharted territory, and to see such organized development and growth has been impressive. As Phase 6 is almost complete, the project has shown promising development. Mutuum Finance has already managed to raise over $18.8 million with almost 18,000 contributors, with Phase 6 over 90% sold and priced at $0.035. Phase 7 pricing climbs to $0.04. The project’s DeFi solution with twin lending, V1 testnet launch, and excellent roadmap development puts MUTM in the list of top cryptocurrencies to invest in with the potential to be the next crypto to hit $1. For investors looking to secure the best crypto to buy before the market moves higher, Mutuum Finance offers a unique combination of real utility, clear roadmap, and high adoption momentum. With strong fundamentals and Phase 6 almost sold out, MUTM is positioned to become the next crypto to hit $1.

The initiative follows previous efforts to diversify its international asset reserves with cryptocurrencies. Czech Central Bank Launches Bitcoin, Crypto Portfolio On Thursday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) announced the creation of a $1 million “test portfolio” of digital assets to “gain practical experience” with holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies while implementing and testing related processes over the next two to three years. In an official press release, the financial supervisor revealed that it had made its first-ever digital asset purchase, acquiring mostly Bitcoin and other undisclosed cryptocurrencies, including a USD-pegged stablecoin and a tokenized deposit. The purchase was approved by the Czech central bank board on 30 October 2025, following discussions of an analysis about potentially incorporating investments in other asset classes. The portfolio’s structure is set to “allow the CNB to compare various types of digital assets and their different properties” and test how to use, trade, keep them in their accounts, and audit these holdings. The Czech central bank stressed that the purchase occurred outside its current international reserves and that there are no plans to add Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to these reserves in the near future. The announcement also emphasized that the total amount invested “will not be actively increased.” However, smaller-scale operations “will continue to be made to test operational readiness in various market situations and maintain the CNB’s preparedness for executing transactions on this market.” CNB To Explore Future Of The Financial System The Czech National Bank explained that the project aims to “gain practical experience with blockchain-based technologies, which may fundamentally affect the operation of the financial and payment system in the future.” Based on this, the banking authority considers it appropriate to start testing and evaluating digital assets in depth, arguing that “only practice will reveal the details and difficulties of day-to-day operation,” including technical administration of keys and multi-level approval processes, crisis scenarios and security mechanisms, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance verification. CNB Governor Aleš Michl shared that he initially thought of creating a test portfolio in January 2025 to examine decentralized Bitcoin from the central bank’s perspective and evaluate its potential role in diversifying their reserves. As reported by Bitcoinist, Michl proposed allocating up to 5% of CNB’s $146 billion in foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin, amounting to roughly $7.3 billion at the time. Nonetheless, the CNB Board did not approve the Governor’s proposal. Now, he asserted that “new ways of paying and investing will emerge rapidly in the years ahead,” and it’s time for the Czech central bank to “be more forward-thinking, more visionary.” It is realistic to expect that, in the future, it will be easy to use the koruna to buy tokenised Czech bonds and more besides – with one tap an espresso; with another an investment such as a bond or another asset that used to be the preserve of larger investors. As a central bank, we want to test this path. The central bank also unveiled the launch of another project, the CNB Lab innovation hub, aiming to oversee the testing of technologies and trends that could affect the functioning of the financial market and the conduct of monetary policy in the future. “In addition to testing digital assets and blockchain solutions, the CNB Lab will try out AI tools, support innovations in the area of payments – including instant payments – and run other projects related to the digitalisation of the financial sector,” the statement reads.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin in Czech Republic|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto portfolio|Czech Central Bank|Czech National Bank|national bitcoin reserve|Stablecoins|Test Crypto Portfolio|tokenized deposits,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 10:00:27

JPMorgan Points To A Key Threshold,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/how-low-can-bitcoin-price-go-jpmorgan/,"JPMorgan has put a numerical marker under this Bitcoin cycle, telling clients that the market’s “pain threshold” now sits near $94,000 — a level the bank frames as both a mining-economics floor and an answer to the question of how low spot can realistically trade before fundamentals start to bite. According to reporting by The Block, the analyst team led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou argues that “Bitcoin’s downside from current levels appears to be ‘very limited,’” because they “see its support price at around $94,000.” How Low Can Bitcoin Go? The core of the call is JPMorgan’s updated estimate of Bitcoin’s production cost. In their latest note, cited by The Block, the analysts say the all-in cost to mine one bitcoin has risen from about $92,000 to roughly $94,000 as network difficulty has surged over recent months. That jump in difficulty forces miners to deploy more hashpower per block, lifting the marginal cost per coin. The team reiterates a framework they have used in prior cycles, stressing that “the bitcoin production cost has empirically acted as a floor for bitcoin,” so a higher cost mechanically pulls the support zone higher as well. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name On JPMorgan’s numbers, the ratio of spot price to production cost now sits just above 1.0, close to the lower end of its historical range. That implies miners’ operating margin is thin and that there is limited room for an extended move far below the modeled cost without triggering stress in the mining sector. From that perspective, the bank’s $94,000 level is not presented as a precise line in the sand, but as a statistically grounded region where downside risk becomes compressed because miners’ incentives to keep selling into weakness deteriorate. The same note keeps a much more optimistic medium-term scenario in place. JPMorgan reiterates a 6–12 month upside case around $170,000 per bitcoin, derived from a volatility-adjusted comparison with gold. As summarized by The Block, the analysts estimate that Bitcoin currently “consumes” around 1.8 times more risk capital than gold, yet still has a smaller market capitalization — roughly $2.1 trillion versus about $6.2 trillion in private-sector gold investment via ETFs, bars and coins. To close that gap on a volatility-adjusted basis, they calculate Bitcoin’s market cap would need to rise by about 67%, “implying a theoretical bitcoin price of close to $170,000.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The Block also highlights how this view fits into JPMorgan’s recent track record of calls. In an earlier note last month, the same team argued that Bitcoin looked significantly undervalued relative to gold, implying upside toward about $165,000 by year-end. Panigirtzoglou has since dialed back the timing, telling The Block that, “it would not be realistic to expect this price target by year’s end,” given recent liquidations and very weak sentiment, and reframing $170,000 as a 6–12 month scenario rather than a near-term objective. The note further recalls an August projection around $126,000 by year-end; Bitcoin later printed an all-time high above $126,200 on Oct. 6 before a record liquidation event on Oct. 10 abruptly reset positioning. Those earlier pieces of research are consistent with a broader framework JPMorgan has been articulating publicly. In a separate analysis earlier this month, also led by Panigirtzoglou and reported by MarketWatch, the bank argued that post-October deleveraging left Bitcoin “very cheap to gold” on a volatility-adjusted basis and concluded that “this mechanical exercise thus implies significant upside for bitcoin over the next 6–12 months,” with fair value again clustering near $170,000. What the new note, as relayed by The Block, adds is a more explicit downside anchor: as long as network difficulty and energy-input assumptions keep the estimated production cost around $94,000, JPMorgan sees that level as the effective floor that answers how low Bitcoin can go before mining economics force the market to confront its constraints. At press time, BTC traded at $97,505.

Trading volumes have picked up to more than $7 billion on crypto exchanges, but the interest in the token seems to be growing due to the launch of the first US-based spot XRP ETF that has a 100% exposure to the asset. CryptoPotato reported yesterday that the last hurdle for Canary Capital’s XRPC fund had been resolved after the US SEC failed to object to its launch and the Nasdaq published the official listing notice. Hours later, the financial vehicle went live and broke SOL’s record for trading volumes on the launch day. Although this sounds like a bullish development, there was a warning hidden in the first report. In the few days leading up to the ETF release, on-chain data showed that the 7-day moving average of XRP’s Exchange Network into Binance had turned positive, which typically suggests that large holders (known as whales) are moving significant quantities of the asset onto trading platforms, with the likely intention to sell. This aligned with previous warning signs coming from such market participants. In fact, whales had sold off roughly 1.4 billion tokens in the span of just a month or so, which not only increases the immediate selling pressure but could serve as an example for retail investors to abandon ship. Consequently, even though the most probable reason for XRP’s plunge today is the overall market correction that drove the entire capitalization south by $200 billion in 24 hours, there could be a bigger story. The investor exodus from above and previous AI claims that the ETF launch will inevitably become a classic ‘sell-the-news’ event are also among the main culprits behind XRP’s nosedive from $2.52 to $2.28. The good news for the short term is that the token dumped to a buy wall located at around $2.20, which previously held during a correction. It currently serves as the first substantial support area before a drop to $2.00. $XRP has reach a buy all again. pic.twitter.com/KT54RT8BgE — CW (@CW8900) November 14, 2025 The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Down Today (November 14)? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-14 10:01:09

According to LD Capital founder Jack Yi, that moment arrives when market fear reaches its peak. His recent analysis suggests that current conditions present exceptional opportunities for strategic spot buying. Why Does Spot Buying Matter During Market Fear? Market corrections often trigger emotional responses that cloud investor judgment. However, experienced traders understand that extreme fear typically signals excellent entry points. Spot buying during these periods allows investors to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Jack Yi emphasizes that while the current correction feels prolonged, the actual decline from market highs has lasted just over one month. This perspective helps investors recognize that downturns are often shorter than they appear. What Makes Current Conditions Ideal for Spot Buying? Several factors align to create favorable conditions for spot buying. First, negative market factors have largely resolved. Second, fear levels have reached extremes that historically precede recoveries. Third, the fundamental value of many assets remains strong despite price drops. Consider these advantages of strategic spot buying: Lower entry prices increase potential returns Reduced competition from fearful investors Opportunity to build positions in quality projects Historical patterns favor buyers during fear peaks How Can You Identify Optimal Spot Buying Opportunities? Successful spot buying requires more than just timing the market bottom. It involves careful analysis of market sentiment, project fundamentals, and technical indicators. Yi suggests that investors focus on projects with strong development teams and real-world utility. Moreover, diversification remains crucial when executing spot buying strategies. Spreading investments across multiple promising projects reduces risk while maintaining exposure to potential gains. What Risks Should Spot Buying Investors Consider? While spot buying during fear periods offers advantages, investors must remain cautious. Market conditions can change rapidly, and not all assets recover equally. Proper risk management includes setting clear entry and exit points. Remember these risk management tips: Never invest more than you can afford to lose Dollar-cost average to reduce timing risk Maintain a long-term perspective Keep some dry powder for additional opportunities FAQs: Spot Buying During Market Corrections What is spot buying in cryptocurrency? Spot buying refers to purchasing actual cryptocurrency assets for immediate delivery, rather than trading derivatives or futures contracts. How do I know when market fear has peaked? Market fear peaks often coincide with extreme negative sentiment, high volatility, and widespread pessimism in media coverage. Is spot buying better than trading during corrections? Spot buying typically suits long-term investors, while trading may better serve short-term strategies. Your approach should match your investment goals. What cryptocurrencies are best for spot buying now? Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility rather than chasing short-term trends. How much of my portfolio should I allocate to spot buying? Allocation depends on your risk tolerance, but many experts suggest keeping cryptocurrency investments below 10% of total portfolio value. Should I wait for the absolute bottom before spot buying? Timing the absolute bottom is nearly impossible. Instead, focus on buying at reasonable prices during fear-driven selloffs.

This developing story highlights the ongoing tension between traditional financial institutions and emerging digital currency innovations. Why is Sony Bank stablecoin causing controversy? The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), representing thousands of small U.S. banks, has launched a formal opposition to Sony Bank’s stablecoin initiative. According to recent reports, the Japanese financial institution planned to establish a new entity called Connectia specifically for issuing stablecoins and providing cryptocurrency custody services. The core issue revolves around regulatory concerns. The ICBA argues that the proposed Sony Bank stablecoin shares critical similarities with traditional bank deposits but would operate outside conventional banking oversight. This regulatory gap, they claim, could create unfair advantages and potential risks for consumers. What are the main arguments against the stablecoin plan? In their letter to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the ICBA presented several key concerns: Regulatory circumvention – The stablecoin could bypass strict banking requirements Consumer protection gaps – Lack of traditional deposit insurance safeguards Unfair competition – Operating without same compliance costs as banks Supervision concerns – Potential regulatory loopholes in cryptocurrency oversight The group specifically accused Sony Bank of attempting to exploit regulatory gaps in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. This Sony Bank stablecoin proposal represents a significant test case for how traditional financial regulators will approach similar initiatives from non-bank entities. How does this affect the future of cryptocurrency regulation? This confrontation signals a crucial moment for stablecoin regulation worldwide. The outcome could set important precedents for how financial authorities balance innovation with consumer protection. Moreover, it demonstrates the growing scrutiny that major corporations face when entering the cryptocurrency space. The Sony Bank stablecoin situation highlights several important trends in financial regulation: Traditional banks are actively monitoring cryptocurrency developments Regulatory boundaries between traditional and digital finance remain unclear International financial institutions face complex cross-border regulatory challenges Stablecoin issuers must navigate evolving compliance requirements What’s next for Sony Bank and stablecoin regulation? As regulatory bodies consider the ICBA’s objections, the cryptocurrency industry watches closely. The decision could influence how other companies approach stablecoin issuance and whether similar regulatory challenges will emerge globally. This Sony Bank stablecoin case may ultimately shape how financial authorities worldwide approach cryptocurrency banking services. The resolution of this regulatory standoff will likely impact: Future stablecoin projects from traditional corporations International banking regulations for digital assets Consumer protection standards in cryptocurrency Cross-border financial innovation policies Frequently Asked Questions What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar or other assets. Why is ICBA opposing Sony Bank’s stablecoin? ICBA claims the Sony Bank stablecoin would function similarly to bank deposits but avoid traditional banking regulations and consumer protections. What is Connectia? Connectia is the proposed new entity that Sony Bank wants to establish specifically for issuing stablecoins and providing cryptocurrency custody services. How could this affect other cryptocurrency projects? The outcome could set important regulatory precedents for how financial authorities approach stablecoins and cryptocurrency banking services from non-traditional institutions. What regulatory body is reviewing this case? The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is currently considering ICBA’s objections to the Sony Bank stablecoin plan. When will a decision be made? There is no official timeline for a decision, but regulatory reviews of this nature typically take several months to complete.

Traditionally, initially taking over positions in high utility projects has resulted in outsize returns when the market becomes bullish. A new token in the DeFi crypto sector that is gaining increased interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a project that has seen consistent developments during the presale, open development, and one that has a novel revenue structure. Momentum and Presale Progress Mutuum Finance presale numbers indicate a steady rise in numbers and have seen a solid investment by both the retail and institutional investors. It is currently in Phase 6 at $0.035 at a 250% increase of the original price when the presale commenced in early 2025. Up to now, the amount raised is $18.7 million, and the number of holders is exceeding 18,000 and the number of tokens sold is 796 million. Out of this 4 billion amount of supply, 45.5% (or about 1.82 billion tokens) have been set aside to the presale. Phase 6 is already more than 86% sold out and it is evidenced that there is a growing momentum in buyers predicting that the price would start to rise towards the actual launch price of 0.06. Mutuum Finance has also implemented the 24-hours leaderboard where the top performer in a day receives $500 in tokens of MUTM, which maintain the presence of the investor on an active loop around the clock. Recently this project has announced that investors will now be able to purchase MUTM directly with the card and do not have any purchase restrictions which has made it much easier to access by the new entrants in this critical stage. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized and borrowing/lending protocol aimed at streamlining crypto markets and improving their transparency. The platform automated transactions involving lenders and borrowers with the help of smart contracts and eliminated the need to have centralized intermediaries. The main components of this system are the mtTokens which are issued 1-1 with assets being deposited in the protocol. These tokens grow in yield automatically in line with the position of the user in the lending pool. In addition, the part of Mutuum buy-and-distribute model is designed to sell a portion of the revenue of the platform as purchasing MUTM in the open market which is further redistributed to those who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This generates platform-based natural token demand. One key emphasis of focus has been since the inception of the project has been on security. Mutuum Finance is among the companies that effectively underwent a CertiK audit with a high of 90/100 Token Scan rating. Stablecoin and Oracle Plans The roadmap of Mutuum Finance implies the implementation of the USD-pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burned as it becomes necessary. This system makes the project more sustainable because the lending activity is linked to the constantly existing demand of the token that may have its native counterpart in the market. To ensure the correct price data in the management of collateral and loans, Mutuum Finance will use degenerated oracles: Chainlink (at least), fallback and aggregated data streams to ensure further precision. These will make sure that they have accurate valuations in volatile markets and this is essential to safeguard a liquidity position and avoid unwarranted liquidations. It is the opinion of analysts that these kinds of innovations may see MUTM grow by 5x to 7x when the industry cycle recovers and when DeFi lending activity increases. Others note that Mutuum is designed to be similar to the initial designs of the leading DeFi actors such as Aave at significantly lower entry value. V1 Take Off and Emerging Expectation In an official statement on X , it is intended that Mutuum Finance will roll out its V1 testnet in Q4 2025 on Sepolia network. The said version will launch the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, which will be one of the biggest milestones to the operational roll-out of the protocol. The first backed assets will be ETH and USDT to lend, borrow, and use as a collateral, both of which are selected due to their high level of liquidity and reliability. Such a measured course of action enables Mutuum Finance to work on stability where it can expand to more assets and chains at later stages. V1 testnet will hopefully be a milestone to the project, as it will show a real functioning state before the mainnet. In the case of pioneer purchasers, the phase can be considered the departure of a concept-based valuation to a product-supported valuation. Phase 6 Acceleration and Whale Interest Large buyers are now beginning to accumulate with Phase 6 over 86% allocated, and before the price rises further. The community reports that there have been numerous allocations of whales of over $100,000 in a single day, just to mention a few, showing an increased institutional interest. This boom is also partially fueled by the tokenomics and on-screen growth that is transparent and open at Mutuum and contrasted with a typical presale token. The open communication of the protocol has been demonstrated by verified and X updates and audit disclosures that have assisted in building credibility at the outset of its development. With the V1 testnet and Phase 7 price increase anxieties approaching, Mutuum Finance is coming to be considered among the potential best cryptos to purchase pre-established bull run. Its low cost of entry, easy to follow, and rewarding token economy fits the historically traditional profile of major winners in early market turnarounds.

Solana is also the main carrier for actively traded RWA tokens. XStocks has shown ongoing expansion in trading activity since the launch of the new tokenized share standard. The XStocks market broke above $10B in total volumes for the first time, on a mix of activity inflows from Kraken and, more recently, Hyperliquid. Most of the trading volumes are concentrated on centralized markets, with around $341M cumulative volumes on DEXs. XStocks volumes expanded continuously, boosted by activity on the Kraken centralized exchange. | Source: Dune Analytics As of November, Solana has also become the main hub for tokenized equities, the smallest and still-growing asset class in RWA tokenization. Over 90% of tokenized equities are minted on Solana, with 77% of transfer volumes using the chain. XStocks was also added to BNB Chain , Ethereum, as well as Arbitrum, with multiple avenues for transfers. Despite this, Solana remains the preferred network. XStocks are making their way into DeFi, becoming a new collateral class to mint stablecoins. Recently, Falcon Finance added XStocks as collateral for USDf . Kamino Lend, Solana’s most widely used lending protocol, has also added XStocks as collateral. XStocks turns into the leading brand for tokenized equities The launch of XStocks in July created a high-profile brand for tokenized equities. Until recently, tokenized shares were informally created, and the markets were fragmented. Public equity is still the smallest addition to general tokenization. However, a unified stock standard may bring more crypto natives to trading, especially with the addition of convenient markets. XStocks caters to a mix of large-scale traders and retail. Most of the volumes are concentrated on a handful of assets, with Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. XStocks still lag behind the RWA secured by Ondo and Securitize, but are one of the few stock-based tokens to launch for the European market . Solana becomes a top 5 network for RWA tokenization XStocks are becoming the most intuitive type of RWA tokens, bringing Solana into the top 5 of networks for RWA tokenization. XStocks are still growing, with just under $100M in total value locked. Solana is among the top 5 networks for RWA tokenization, as XStocks became a widely traded asset class. | Source: RWA.xyz Solana is still lagging behind Ethereum, which got a boost from tokenized money markets. Ondo is the most direct competitor, as the chain also has its own prominent brand of tokenized shares. While Solana still has a more limited selection of tokenized RWA, the active trading of XStocks is a breakthrough, as other tokens have lower trading activity. Solana also reported 101K holders of its tokenized shares, showing greater potential for mainstream adoption.

54387815,627999,1763120049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54387815.jpeg,Nearly 25% of Asian Adults Online May Hold Crypto: $BEST Presale Passes $17M Milestone,https://bitcoinist.com/best-wallet-token-presale-17m-apac-crypto-ownership-near-25-percent/,"Quick Facts: Nearly a quarter of APAC adults with internet access may own crypto, pointing to strong regional onboarding tailwinds for simple, secure wallets. Reducing friction with multi-chain support, clean swaps, and clear fee flows drives retention as first-time users move beyond their debut transaction. $BEST ties wallet utility to incentives with staking, fee perks, and launch access, aiming to convert new users into long-term participants. Reasonable price scenarios hinge on listings and execution; upside requires roadmap delivery rather than market hype alone. Nearly a quarter of adults with internet access in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region may already own cryptocurrency. Fresh research jointly produced by Protocol Theory and CoinDesk points to broadening retail participation across the region , with stablecoin usage gaining particular traction. Friction remains in certain areas, such as onboarding, education, and trust. However, the data signals a maturing market where wallets and user-first apps can win big. The report matters for builders and beginners alike. If you’re an everyday user who’s already experimenting with digital assets, the race shifts from ‘why crypto’ to ‘who delivers the smoothest path in.’ UX now carries real market share implications. That’s exactly where wallet-led ecosystems step in: they abstract complexity, layer useful features, and make first steps feel safe, quick, and rewarding. The Best Wallet app and its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) fit this adoption arc. The presale has topped $17M with a current token price of $0.025945 and 77% staking rewards. The project’s pitch is simple: bundle a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with fee perks, staking access, and early exposure to best crypto presales , then keep polishing the experience. For a region onboarding millions, that’s a clean match between demand and product design. If APAC’s ownership base keeps expanding, on-ramps that feel like modern fintech – not developer tools – should capture flows. Best Wallet is aiming to capture the lion’s share of those flows, with an easy entry point and a token designed to plug users into the wider DeFi stack. The timing isn’t bad either: when a market moves from early adopters to mainstream-curious, infrastructure tends to lead the next wave. Wallet Utility Built For Real-World Onboarding Best Wallet’s value proposition leans on practical features that reduce friction. It’s non-custodial and multi-chain, with in-app buying and swapping, and portfolio tracking. Powering the wallet is its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . Holding this offers exclusive benefits, including low transaction fees, governance rights, and early access to presales (including the best meme coins ) in its Token Launchpad. To learn more about the project, be sure to check out our detailed Best Wallet Token review . Plans flagged across reviews and ecosystem updates point to a staking aggregator, MEV protection, advanced order types, and a crypto card to spend balances natively. The angle is clear: take what power users already do across five tabs and fold it into one clean interface. That’s what helps first-timers stick. Cost control also matters. Analyses of the wallet indicate no added markup on base network fees and flexibility on how fees are paid, which helps newcomers avoid the classic ‘I can’t swap because I don’t have the right gas token’ facepalm. For APAC users who meet crypto first on mobile and stick with what feels familiar, these small UX decisions become retention engines. The broader backdrop is supportive. If roughly one in four online adults across Asia-Pacific already holds crypto, the next winners will be products that treat security, speed, and clarity as table stakes, then layer incentives that actually compound. And crypto wallets that double as launchpads and DeFi dashboards will pull ahead because they compress the learning curve. That’s the play Best Wallet is making. Download the Best Wallet app for free today. Last Chance to Join the $BEST Presale The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale has crossed $17M, with the token offered at around $0.025945. Staking sits at 77% rewards, but these rates are dynamic and likely to decline as more tokens are staked by holders. The presale window is in its final 14 days, concentrating attention on entry price, staking math, and the first phase of utility unlocks at launch. Our guide to buying the Best Wallet Token offers step-by-step instructions on how you can get hold of $BEST tokens. How might that translate into forward price scenarios? Based on our Best Wallet Token price prediction , we see $BEST potentially hitting ~$0.60 by the end of 2026, with broader exchange coverage, deeper feature rollouts, and sticky user growth. This gives the token a potential to go ~23x as per its current price. Why do these numbers make sense in context? Wallet tokens benefit from network effects. More users mean more on-chain actions, more fee discounts sought, and, potentially, more staking to capture yield and perks. If Best Wallet aggregates staking and shields users from MEV where possible, $BEST’s ‘own to save and earn’ loop feels tangible; not theoretical. That narrative aligns with a market that’s migrating from speculative curiosity to utility-first usage. But with just two weeks before the token presale closes, this could be your last chance to grab $BEST at its currently discounted price. Join the Best Wallet Token presale while you still can.

Bitcoin’s price has dropped below the $97k level, while Ether is still holding above $3k. LINK, the native coin of the Chainlink network, has lost 10% of its value in the last 24 hours and now risks dropping below $14. LINK dips below $15 despite positive news from the ecosystem LINK’s poor performance over the last 24 hours comes despite positive news from the broader Chainlink ecosystem. On Tuesday, Chainlink launched the Rewards Season 1, marking a major milestone as it expanded the Build Program. The Rewards program allows eligible LINK stakers to earn token rewards from nine Build projects by allocating non-transferable reward points known as Cubes. These participants began allocating Cubes on November 11, and the program will last till December 9. Token claims will commence on December 16 under a 90-day linear unlock schedule. This initiative is a bullish event for LINK in the long term as it allows users to deepen participation in the Chainlink ecosystem and strengthen demand for LINK via staking incentives and increased on-chain activity. In addition to that, Chainlink’s on-chain and derivatives data show a bullish bias despite the current bearish price action. Santiment’s Social Dominance metric for Chainlink currently supports a bullish outlook. The index rose from 0.15% on Saturday to 1.89% on Wednesday, the highest level since July 2022. While the rise indicates growing investor interest and increased community engagement around Chainlink, it hasn’t translated to higher prices for LINK. According to CoinGlass, LINK’s OI-Weighted Funding Rate data shows that the number of bearish traders is lower than bullish ones. The metric flipped to a positive rate on Tuesday and stood at 0.0032% on Thursday. The positive metric could signal recovery for LINK in the near term. LINK could recover if the $13.5 support level holds The LINK/USD daily chart is bearish and efficient as Chainlink has lost 10% of its value in the last 24 hours. It has lost the $16 key support level and is now trading at $14.2 per coin. If the lower trendline continues to serve as the support in the near term, LINK could recover towards the $16 support-turned-resistance region. However, the support level at $13.5 has to hold in the near term for LINK to have opportunities to recover. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 38 on the daily chart, approaching the neutral 50 level and suggesting a strong bearish momentum. For the recovery rally to be sustained, the RSI must recover above the neutral level. Furthermore, the MACD hasn’t shown a bullish crossover since the start of the week, supporting the current bearish price action. However, if the bulls fail to hold the $13.5 support level, LINK could extend its decline towards the next daily support level at $11.1.

While further declines and bearish rhetoric for Bitcoin increased after the sharp correction in the market, CryptoQuant CEO Ki-young Ju made important statements about the future of BTC. The famous CEO spoke clearly about the bear market, stating that it is unlikely that a bear market will occur unless the BTC price falls below $94,000. At this point, Ki-young Ju stated that the $94,000 price level is a critical and important level to determine whether Bitcoin has entered a bear market. The famous CEO said in his post on X that it is difficult to evaluate the current correction in Bitcoin as a bear trend on its own. Noting that the average purchase price for investors who purchased BTC 6 to 12 months ago was $94,000, Ju said that whether this level will be broken will determine the bear trend. Finally, Ju said it is better to wait than to jump to conclusions. “The average purchase price for investors who purchased Bitcoin 6 to 12 months ago was approximately $94,000. Until this price level is clearly broken downwards, it is difficult to say that a downward cycle or bear market is finalised. In the current situation, it makes more sense to watch whether the key support level holds rather than jump to conclusions.” *This is not investment advice.

XRP 1-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The reversal comes less than a day after the launch of the first U.S. spot XRP ETF on Nasdaq, a development many expected to trigger a continuation of this week’s rally. Instead, traders are increasingly pointing to a classic sell-the-news setup. After weeks of anticipation and strong pre-launch positioning, the market appears to have reacted by locking in profits the moment the ETF went live. Whale selling accelerates the drop Large holders amplified the downside. Over the past month, XRP whales offloaded 1.4 billion XRP, adding significant weight to the selling pressure and contributing to the sharp cooldown from Thursday’s high of $2.52. The combination of profit-taking, elevated expectations, and whale distribution created a fast, cascading pullback into the $2.20–$2.30 zone. What’s more, the timing also coincides with a broader market drawdown. Roughly $200 billion vanished from the global crypto market cap in the same 24-hour period, magnifying XRP’s decline. Even in that context, however, the reaction to the ETF launch stands out, given how sharply sentiment flipped after the debut. ETF numbers tell a different story Interestingly, the underlying ETF data paints a much stronger picture than price action suggests. Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC) recorded $58.5 million in opening-day trading volume and $245 million in net inflows, placing it among the most successful crypto ETF debuts to date. Wowza. $XRPC surpassed $BSOL to become the biggest ETF launch of the year.

The recent sell-off coincides with substantial distribution from long-term holders. These seasoned investors have offloaded approximately 815,000 BTC over the past month. This marks the highest distribution level since January 2024, adding complexity to current market dynamics. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $96,627, suggesting a 6.11% decline in the last 24 hours. BTC price action over the past 24 Hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Long-Term Holders Follow Historical Patterns Analysis from Glassnode indicates that profit-taking by long-term holders has increased from 12,500 BTC per day in early July to 26,500 BTC currently. Contrary to alarming narratives suggesting coordinated dumping, the data indicate standard bull-market behavior. On-chain metrics indicate that long-term holders have consistently realized profits throughout this cycle. Their activity mirrors patterns observed in previous bull runs. By late August, profit-taking had reached levels comparable to prior cycle peaks. Whale wallets aged seven years or older show interesting spending patterns. These addresses, which process more than 1,000 BTC per hour, exhibit regular and evenly spaced transactions. The frequency suggests a persistent, staggered distribution rather than panic selling. Bitcoin holders realized net profits of $3.0 billion on November 7. This figure aligns with October's profit levels, indicating continued strength among holders. Net realized losses remain virtually nonexistent, suggesting holders have not capitulated. Critical Support Levels and Market Structure Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted that investors who bought Bitcoin six to twelve months ago have a cost basis near $94,000. Ju stated the bear cycle cannot be confirmed unless Bitcoin loses that level. He advocates for patience rather than premature conclusions. Alex Adler identified two key correction levels: $87,000 and $74,000. The $87,000 mark derives from a conservative valuation model that explains 87% of price variation through on-chain activity. The model carries a backtest score of 95 out of 100. Failure to reclaim the 365-day moving average could trigger a deeper correction. CryptoQuant's research suggests this scenario would accelerate downward momentum and test lower support zones. Hunter Horsley from Bitwise offered a different perspective on market cycles. He argued that the traditional four-year cycle model belongs to a bygone era.

In a stunning development, an anonymous whale has just made headlines by purchasing another $114.5 million worth of Ethereum. This mysterious investor continues to accumulate ETH at an astonishing pace, raising questions about market sentiment and future price movements. Who Is This Anonymous Whale and Why Should You Care? The anonymous whale address starting with 0xe5c has become one of the most significant players in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to Spot On Chain data, this entity purchased 36,445 ETH valued at $114.5 million at an average price of $3,154. This latest transaction represents just one piece of a much larger accumulation strategy that began on July 2. What makes this anonymous whale particularly interesting is the sheer scale of their operations. Since beginning their accumulation phase, the same address has acquired a total of 488,217 ETH worth approximately $1.7 billion from Binance. The average purchase price across all transactions stands at $3,478.5 per ETH, showing strategic buying across different price levels. How Much Ethereum Does This Whale Actually Hold? The current holdings of this anonymous whale now stand at an impressive 422,217 ETH, valued at approximately $1.34 billion. This represents one of the largest individual Ethereum positions in the cryptocurrency market. The whale’s activity demonstrates several key patterns: Consistent accumulation during market fluctuations Strategic purchasing from major exchanges Long-term holding strategy despite price volatility Significant influence on market liquidity What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future Price? When an anonymous whale accumulates this much Ethereum, it typically signals strong confidence in the asset’s future prospects. Large-scale accumulation by sophisticated investors often precedes significant price movements. However, it’s crucial to understand that whale activity can impact the market in multiple ways: Firstly, such substantial buying reduces available supply on exchanges, potentially creating upward price pressure. Secondly, the anonymous nature of these transactions adds an element of mystery to market dynamics. The whale’s continued accumulation suggests they believe Ethereum has substantial room for growth beyond current price levels. Why Are Anonymous Whales Important for Crypto Markets? Anonymous whales play a crucial role in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Their large transactions can indicate institutional interest or sophisticated investor strategies. When an anonymous whale consistently accumulates an asset like Ethereum, it often reflects: Strong fundamental belief in the technology Expectation of future adoption growth Strategic positioning before major developments Hedging against traditional market risks The current anonymous whale activity represents one of the most significant accumulation stories in recent cryptocurrency history. Their $1.7 billion total acquisition demonstrates extraordinary conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. What Can Retail Investors Learn From Whale Behavior? While retail investors cannot match the scale of anonymous whale transactions, there are valuable lessons to be learned. The consistent accumulation pattern suggests a long-term investment horizon rather than short-term speculation. This anonymous whale appears focused on building a substantial position regardless of daily price fluctuations. Moreover, the whale’s strategy of purchasing from major exchanges like Binance indicates confidence in the security and liquidity of these platforms. Their ability to execute large transactions without significantly moving the market demonstrates sophisticated trading techniques that retail investors can study and adapt. Conclusion: The Ripple Effect of Major Crypto Movements The ongoing accumulation by this anonymous whale represents more than just another large transaction—it signals deep market confidence in Ethereum’s future. As the whale continues to build their position, market participants watch closely for clues about future price direction and market sentiment. The $114.5 million purchase serves as a powerful reminder that sophisticated investors remain bullish on Ethereum’s long-term prospects despite short-term market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is an anonymous whale in cryptocurrency? An anonymous whale refers to a large investor whose identity remains unknown but who makes substantial cryptocurrency transactions that can influence market prices. How much Ethereum has this whale purchased total? This particular anonymous whale has accumulated 488,217 ETH worth $1.7 billion since beginning their buying activity on July 2. Why do whales purchase from exchanges like Binance? Whales use major exchanges like Binance because they offer sufficient liquidity to handle large transactions without significantly impacting prices. Can whale movements predict cryptocurrency prices? While whale activity can indicate market sentiment, it should not be used as the sole predictor of price movements since many other factors influence cryptocurrency markets. How does anonymous whale accumulation affect retail investors? Whale accumulation can reduce available supply and create upward price pressure, potentially benefiting retail investors who hold the same asset. What happens if the anonymous whale decides to sell? If the whale sells their substantial position, it could create significant downward price pressure due to the large volume hitting the market simultaneously.

Draft plans have shown a proposal to make ESMA a direct supervisor for all crypto service providers in the EU. EU officials have drafted plans to tighten crypto oversight , with more power in the hands of ESMA. Currently, crypto firms in the EU rely on registration within a single jurisdiction, choosing countries with lenient crypto rules. Under the active Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) rules, exchanges or other service providers can be registered in one country and provide services across the entire European Union. After that, national regulators have a say in the operations of crypto service providers and regulating the local market, reported Bloomberg. The concentration of regulatory power in the hands of ESMA may break down the already intricate national crypto regulations, leaving the market disoriented once again. European Commission may delegate power to national regulators The proposals for increased ESMA oversight are still preliminary. ESMA may also decide to delegate regulations back to national authorities in some cases. The draft is waiting approval from the European Parliament and the council of member states. “ Reopening MiCA at this stage would introduce legal uncertainty, risk delaying the authorization process, and divert attention and resources from the practical task of consistent implementation,” said Robert Kopitsch, secretary general of Blockchain for Europe, an industry lobby group. The introduction of MiCA caused limited effects on the Euro area crypto trading. Most notably, exchanges and brokerages increased their usage of USDC, while phasing out USDT trading pairs. Kopitsch added that national regulators had a closer engagement with firms, more detailed compared to ESMA’s cross-border oversight. Other analysts noted that after the implementation of MiCA, another shift in goal posts may hurt the crypto industry in the EU. Additionally, ESMA would have to rebuild its expertise for tracking crypto service providers. The proposal to give more instruments to ESMA mostly came from France and the EU institutions, putting a new layer of compliance for crypto companies. Other supporters included Austria and Italy, calling for ESMA oversight for major crypto companies, while leaving smaller businesses under national jurisdiction. Centralized regulation calls come amid hacking, money laundering risks Earlier reports linked the ESMA proposal to the 2025 hack of Bybit. The hacked funds went through OKX, an exchange that has secured a full MiCA license and is a major player on the EU market. The chief concern of French market regulators is the foothold of market operators from outside the Euro Area, who also have a substantial global business. Most major crypto centralized exchanges have re-entered the market with a full MiCA license, but continue to be exposed to global risks and coordinate with their global branches. ESMA may intervene when those arrangements pose risks to investors and may hurt European market participants. However, in most cases, the European branches of big exchanges are isolated, which includes user accounts and wallets without access to the global market.

The fund generated $26 million in trading volume within the first 30 minutes, and by the end of the session, it had recorded more than $58.5 million in total volume and $245 million in net inflows. Despite the compelling first day, XRPC’s initial volume still falls short compared to the launches of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) spot ETFs, which saw $4.1 billion and $1.1 billion in day-one trading volume, respectively. Even so, XRPC has outperformed all funds launched this year, roughly 900 in total, according to Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1989077502300680375 XRP plummets despite successful ETF launch The strong ETF launch failed to prop XRP up, as the token extended its decline on Friday due to broader crypto-market weakness. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.27, down almost 9% on the daily chart and erasing $13 billion from its market capitalization. XRP 24-hour price. Source: Finbold Overall, the total cryptocurrency market lost 6% of its market cap in just 24 hours, wiping out roughly $160 billion. Bitcoin saw massive losses, dropping to its six-month low below $96,000, while more than $1.1 billion in liquidations across derivatives markets accelerated losses across major altcoins. XRP, which maintains a 0.82 correlation with Bitcoin, was pulled sharply lower as institutional investors moved into risk-off mode. Namely, some 1.4 billion XRP was moved to exchanges in the days leading up to the Canary listing, signaling large holders were preparing to take profit. From a technical standpoint, XRP is below its 30-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.42 and the key pivot point at $2.38, while the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) slipped to 44.71, indicating building bearish momentum.

Dogecoin (DOGE) also posted substantial losses despite the accumulation efforts of the whales. In this article, we will focus on the performance of these cryptocurrencies and examine the latest developments surrounding Shiba Inu (SHIB). XRP’s Price Swings Ripple’s token surged to nearly $2.60 on November 11, likely driven by investor excitement surrounding the launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF in the US. The fund began trading on November 13, but the asset’s price headed south in what could have been explained as a classic “sell-the-news” event. Another factor potentially hurting the coin’s performance is the broader pullback of the crypto market, where Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled well below $100,000, while Ethereum (ETH) plunged to approximately $3,100. Meanwhile, whales have sold a substantial amount of XRP tokens over the past month, which could also have contributed. Currently, the asset is worth around $2.28 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 9% decline on a 24-hour scale and a significant retreat from the all-time high of $3.65 reached this summer. Some analysts, though, remain optimistic that a rebound might be on the way. Just a few days ago, X user Levi suggested that XRP has formed a “cup and handle” setup on its chart, which could be a precursor of a major rally to $5 by the end of 2025. DOGE Whales on the Move The biggest meme coin is also deep in red territory, with its valuation sinking by 8% for the day to $0.16. It is worth noting that the correction occurs despite the increased whale activity. Over the past 14 days, the large Dogecoin investors have scooped up 4.72 billion tokens, thus increasing their total holdings to 32.4 billion, or around 21% of the coin’s circulating supply. Such accumulations may influence smaller players to join the ecosystem and have a positive effect on the price. Additionally, they reduce the amount of DOGE available on the market, which, combined with steady or rising demand, can trigger a pump. What’s New Around SHIB? Shiba Inu, which is also far from its glory days, recently teamed up with the blockchain-based mobile edge network Unity Nodes to unlock “real-world utility.” As a result, users will have the opportunity to purchase Nodes with SHIB, earn rewards, and receive specific bonuses when paying with the token. The SHIB Army reacted to the news with solid excitement, but the meme coin failed to post any significant gains. As of this writing, it trades at roughly $0.000009119, representing a 2% decline on a weekly scale. Additionally, the low Shibarium activity and the recent shift from self-custody methods to centralized exchanges suggest that Shiba Inu may suffer further losses in the short term.

Zero Knowledge Proof’s Pods Generate Real Monthly Income of $1,500",https://timestabloid.com/gambling-on-aster-and-uni-breakouts-zero-knowledge-proofs-pods/,"Everyone is watching the Aster (ASTER) breakout level and the latest Uniswap (UNI) breakout prediction. People are searching for the next big win. But what if focusing on charts means you’re missing the real ground-floor opportunity? Remember when laptop Bitcoin mining made millionaires? That chance is gone but there are similar opportunities now. Zero Knowledge Proof introduces Proof Pods. For $249, you’re not buying speculative tokens; you are buying income-generating infrastructure. These pods validate real AI computations instead of wasting energy. Early miners won. Early Pod operators will dominate. A Level 50 Pod earns $50 daily. This isn’t just a token, it’s the best crypto to buy today. The project is fully built, launching when presale auctions start. The whitelist is open now for early access to the project. Zero Knowledge Proof: The New Ground Floor for Crypto Gains Many people look back and wish they’d mined Bitcoin on laptops when it was easy. That opportunity is gone forever. But Zero Knowledge Proof is offering the next “ground floor” moment, and it’s completely different. Forget wasting energy on pointless math. This project uses $249 Proof Pods to validate real AI computations. You are acquiring income-generating infrastructure for the world’s first privacy-first AI network. Early Bitcoin miners won big because they were first. Early Proof Pod operators will dominate for the same reason. The difference? No expensive, screaming GPU farms or technical degrees. You just plug the device in, activate it online, and watch the passive income accumulate. This is real hardware doing real work. The numbers are amazing. A Level 50 Pod (total cost $5,149) earns approximately $50 daily. That’s $1,500 a month, meaning an ROI in months, not years. This setup is why many are calling it the best crypto to buy today for pure utility. The Zero Knowledge Proof project is fully built and ready. The presale auctions will launch the entire system. The whitelist is open right now for early access. This isn’t just a token; it’s the best crypto to buy for those who missed Bitcoin’s start. The Critical Aster (ASTER) Breakout Level Aster (ASTER) is seeing massive action, fueled by major news. It was recently added to the Coinbase listing roadmap, and the SoFi Bank integration brought it to more retail users. On-chain data also showed a whale accumulating 8.4 million tokens. After a strong rally, the price is in a slight pullback, trading around ₹94. All eyes are now on the Aster (ASTER) breakout level of $1.21. A decisive close above this price is needed to confirm the next leg up. If it clears that resistance, analysts are eyeing targets at $1.23, $1.28, and potentially $1.50. However, support is just as important. ASTER must hold the $1.05-$1.06 floor to maintain its bullish structure. A drop below that could invalidate the current pattern. Traders are watching this Aster (ASTER) breakout level intensely to see if the momentum will continue. The Next Uniswap (UNI) Breakout Prediction Uniswap (UNI) saw a massive price surge of 40-50% after founder Hayden Adams introduced the “UNIfication” proposal. This plan, which includes activating protocol fees and a major token burn, has put all eyes on UNI. After this huge move, the price is now consolidating. The key resistance for the next breakout is the $9.50 – $10.00 zone. A strong close above this area is critical for any new Uniswap (UNI) breakout prediction to play out. Traders are now watching support levels. For the bullish setup to continue, UNI must hold the $7.80 – $8.00 range. The most critical “must-hold” line is the 200-day EMA, around $7.61. If it holds, analysts see targets at $11.00 and $12.00. If it fails, the current Uniswap (UNI) breakout prediction would be at risk. The current pause is seen as a healthy sign before a potential next move. Zero Knowledge Proof’s Passive Income Paycheck Watching the Aster (ASTER) breakout level and the latest Uniswap (UNI) breakout prediction is exciting. These tokens show big moves based on technicals and new features. They are great for traders, but they represent a different kind of opportunity. While those tokens are in motion, Zero Knowledge Proof offers a return to the ground floor. It’s like the early days of Bitcoin mining, but instead of wasting energy, Proof Pods validate useful AI computations. You’re not just buying a token; you’re buying the machine. For $249, you own income-generating hardware. A Level 50 Pod earns $50 daily. This is why it’s a candidate for the best crypto to buy today .

54388570,627688,1763121634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54388570.jpeg,Crypto Titan Grayscale Joins IPO Rush In The US: What Investors Need To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-titan-grayscale-joins-ipo-rush-in-the-us/,"Following the conclusion of the recent US government shutdown, Grayscale, the industry’s leading asset manager, has made a significant move by filing for its initial public offering (IPO) with US regulators. This step aligns with a trend where several crypto-focused companies have been increasingly entering the IPO race, reflecting the growing prominence of digital assets within the financial landscape. Grayscale’s IPO Revelation Grayscale initiated the IPO process confidentially back in July, which allowed the company to withhold public disclosure of its financial information until now, with the official IPO filing now unveiled for public scrutiny. With assets under management totaling $35 billion as of September 30, Grayscale disclosed a net income of $203.3 million in the initial nine months of 2025. However, despite its substantial assets under management, Grayscale has faced a decline in profitability and revenue over the past year. In the corresponding period of 2024, the company reported a higher net income of $223.7 million. The revenue for the first three quarters of the year stood at $318.7 million, marking a 20% decrease from the $397.9 million recorded in the same time frame back in 2024. The ongoing surge of crypto firms entering the public market has been notable in the backdrop of a crypto-friendly administration by President Donald Trump, which has facilitated a closer integration of digital assets into mainstream financial operations. Noteworthy names such as stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), crypto exchanges Gemini (GEMI) and Bullish (BLSH), and Figure Technology led by Mike Cagney have all made their debut in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this year. A New Chapter For The Crypto Asset Manager While Grayscale’s IPO marks a significant milestone, the company, like many others in the crypto sector, has encountered challenges due to the extreme market volatility experienced this year. Price upswings in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have impacted the performance of crypto-related firms. Post-IPO, Circle and Bullish have witnessed decreases in share value from their peak prices, while Gemini is trading below its offering price as concerns regarding mounting losses persist. Grayscale’s IPO filing acknowledges the company’s concentrated exposure to the digital asset industry, emphasizing its reliance on market conditions, which remain notably volatile. The performance of its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Ethereum ETF, has fluctuated significantly throughout the year due to continuous market uncertainties. With plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GRAY,” Grayscale’s IPO has garnered notable attention, with Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor serving as the lead underwriters for the deal.

The candle patterns on day one do look cautious, and XRP’s price did not explode on opening. But that narrative misses a critical, powerful point lurking underneath the surface. Vincent Kennedy highlighted a fact that flips the pessimistic reading: XRPC recorded $58 million in first-day trading volume , according to his post. That figure makes it the strongest ETF debut of 2025, narrowly surpassing Bitwise’s Solana ETF, which saw $57 million on its first day. How ETF Mechanics Drive Demand To understand why this volume matters, it helps to review how spot ETFs work. When investors bid for ETF shares, authorized participants (APs) step in. They create or redeem shares by delivering—or receiving—the underlying asset, in this case, XRP. People may look at this XRP ETF chart and think its bad. It's actually really good. $58 million on day 1 in dollar volume making it a top performer. Now they have to replenish the basket and buy $50+/- million of XRP on open market. pic.twitter.com/KjVF8bFFKB — Vincent Kennedy (@VincentCrypt46) November 13, 2025 That means net creation forces the sponsor to buy XRP on the open market, or deliver it in-kind from custody. On day one, that process likely translated the huge inflows into substantial spot demand. Price Action Doesn’t Tell the Whole Story Even though XRP’s price closed lower that day, such a drop isn’t surprising under these dynamics. Some capital flows may come from market makers hedging or from APs doing arbitrage. These players cushion the price, which can mute volatility even as the ETF builds up its XRP reserves. In short, strength in structural demand need not always manifest as a sharp upward move. Replenishment Pressure Is Real Kennedy’s key insight is this: the fund now needs to replenish its XRP basket, which could require tens of millions in fresh XRP purchases. That replenishment triggers more demand from the open market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Over time, this mechanical demand may outlast the debut-day buzz and become a consistent tailwind for XRP. What to Monitor Going Forward Investors should now watch for several critical signals. One is the creation-redemption data—how many ETF shares are being issued or redeemed. Another is on-chain transfers to custodian addresses, which could show where the ETF is accumulating. Finally, trackers of ETF holdings disclosures will shed light on how much XRP the fund actually holds. In conclusion, at first glance, the XRPC chart might look modest. But as Vincent Kennedy rightly argued, the $58 million launch volume is not just symbolic — it reflects real, deep demand backed by ETF mechanics. The real story is not the shape of day-one candles, but the ongoing structural demand that could follow. Investors and analysts who dig past the surface may well find that this ETF debut is a strong foundation, not a false start.

54388749,628041,1763122010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54388749.jpeg,Best Meme Coins To Buy As Dogecoin Lines Up A 5x Setup,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-dogecoin-price-prediction-5x/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin long-term holders have dumped roughly 815K $BTC while whales accumulated 45K $BTC, a classic sign of risk rotation toward deep-pocketed buyers. Dogecoin is consolidating in a fresh weekly accumulation zone, with technical structures that historically preceded multi-x rallies and renewed meme-sector interest. Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge, and FLOKI ride that same meme-sector tailwind while adding utility narratives ranging from Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling to gamified trading ecosystems. Presale entries in $HYPER and $MAXI sit well below the current 2026 high forecast, but outcomes depend on execution, listings, and broader market conditions. Bitcoin’s ($BTC) old guard is finally blinking. On-chain data shows long-term holders have offloaded roughly 815K $BTC in just 30 days, the heaviest distribution since early 2024. At the same time, whale wallets have quietly added around 45K $BTC near six-figure prices, flipping supply from patient retail holders to deep-pocketed buyers. This rotation is happening as Dogecoin prints one of its most interesting structures in years. On the higher timeframes, it is once again grinding through a fresh weekly accumulation zone, repeating the familiar ‘recover, consolidate, surge’ pattern that has preceded its biggest rallies in 2017, 2021, and more recent cycles. Current technical projections sketch a path first toward the $0.18 region , then into a broader upside range where a move of 5x from current levels would put $DOGE around $0.80 to $1. Put together, this is a classic late-cycle setup: Bitcoin whales buying weakness, long-term holders taking profit, and a flagship meme coin compressing under resistance. When $BTC volatility cools and $DOGE starts to trend, capital usually rotates down the risk curve into newer narratives and smaller caps. That is where the best meme coins tend to emerge for the next wave of speculation. In that context, three names stand out right now: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a Bitcoin-aligned Layer-2 with real utility, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as a high-octane Doge spin with live staking, and $FLOKI as the more established meme coin that has quietly built a full ecosystem around its brand. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bitcoin Layer-2 With Meme-Level Upside Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is not a meme in the traditional sense, yet it sits right in the slipstream of the memecoin trade. It is a Bitcoin Layer-2 that anchors to $BTC for security while using the Solana Virtual Machine to deliver near-instant, low-fee transactions and smart contracts. Payment ecosystems, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, NFT marketplaces, anything could become possible through $HYPER’s Layer-2. And Bitcoin’s absolute security would lock everything down. Want to learn more about the project? Be sure to check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ page. The token sale has already attracted serious attention. Recent coverage puts the presale at around $27.5M raised, with tokens offered in the low-cent range around $0.013275 in earlier phases. One on-chain transaction routed roughly $502K into the presale contract in a single call, which signals clear whale interest. Based on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the end-2026 forecast high for $HYPER sits at $0.20. Using the $0.013275 presale reference, the 2026 high implies roughly a 15x potential. On top of that, $HYPER is designed around staking, governance, and eventual DAO control, giving holders a direct role in how the Layer-2 evolves. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): High-Energy Doge Spin With 77% APY Maxi Doge ($MAXI) takes the Doge meme and cranks everything to eleven. The brand leans into 1000x leverage memes, energy-drink aesthetics, and hyperactive trading culture, but the token has structure: audited Ethereum contracts and a roadmap toward integration with high-leverage futures platforms. As Dogecoin’s wilder, crazier cousin, Maxi Doge is destined for greatness. He never relents as he’s watching the charts, ready to go all in on the most degen traders ever. Part of a new generation of meme coins, $MAXI is looking very promising, with presale momentum already strong. Recent figures put Maxi Doge over $4M raised, with tokens currently priced at $0.000268. Learn how to grab your share of $MAXI tokens in our Maxi Doge buying guide . Live staking during presale is paying around 77% APY, pushing buyers to hold rather than flip and building early locked liquidity. Our Maxi Doge price prediction points toward $0.0058 for the end of 2026 under bullish conditions. Buy your $MAXI tokens here. 3. FLOKI ($FLOKI): Established Meme With Expanding Utility Stack FLOKI ($FLOKI) is the most battle-tested of the three. It has evolved into an ecosystem with gaming, DeFi, and education products tied into the token. Its Valhalla metaverse, FlokiFi suite, and marketplace help support long-term demand. On the numbers side, $FLOKI is trading around $0.000055 with a market cap near $530M — large-cap meme territory, but still far below its ATH of $0.000346. It trades on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, including Gate.io, Bybit, Uniswap, and PancakeSwap. In a market where $BTC whales accumulate and $DOGE prepares for a potential 5x move, FLOKI remains a way to gain meme exposure without thin-liquidity risk. As one of the biggest meme coins in the world (ranked 8th in the world), $FLOKI is one of the biggest gainers whenever meme coins start rallying. You can buy $FLOKI on Binance. Dogecoin’s repeating accumulation pattern and heavy $BTC rotation point toward another meme-driven cycle. In that environment, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and FLOKI ($FLOKI) each offer different ways to play meme momentum.

The Chinese chipmaker SMIC has warned that a shortage of memory chips may disrupt the operations of manufacturers of cars, smartphones and other consumer electronics in 2026. The company’s co-CEO Zhao Haijun, said that some of SMIC’s customers are “reluctant” to place orders for the first quarter of 2026 because they are uncertain how many memory chips they will be able to secure. With the surge in demand for memory used in AI accelerators, memory chip suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. are prioritizing customers tied to AI accelerator production. As a result, memory chips used in cars, smartphones, and consumer electronics are facing supply constraints. Warning from SMIC about 2026 production The biggest global producers of memory chips are Micron in the United States and South Korea’s SK Hynix and Samsung. Zhao believes the current memory market is in short supply and prices have “surged significantly,” which creates more pressure for device makers. According to him, the ongoing “super cycle” in the memory sector is pushing customers to negotiate lower prices for other types of chips in order to balance the rising cost of memory components. Zhao said that prices for memory chips are expected to surge because the cost to run the business is increasing. Manufacturers also have to be cautious about committing too early or too heavily. Companies in China are holding back on placing large orders for other chips and hardware components, since the memory shortfall could limit how many finished devices they can build. SMIC’s own capacity and investment SMIC says demand currently exceeds its own supply capabilities, and its capital expenditure will remain flat or only increase slightly compared with the $7.33 billion from last year. SMIC’s revenue rose by 9.7% from a year earlier to $2.38 billion, supported by solid local demand, and its profit increased by 28.9% to $191.75 million. Both figures were above analysts’ expectations. The company’s monthly production capacity also grew by 3.2% from the previous quarter to 1.02 million eight-inch equivalent wafers, with utilization rising to 95.8% from 92.5%. The company shipped 2.5 million equivalent wafers in the quarter, up by 4.6% from the previous three months. China remained its largest market, making up 86% of revenue, up slightly from the previous quarter, while the U.S. contributed 11%, down from 13%. Consumer electronics excluding smartphones, computers, tablets, and industrial or automotive chips also grew quarter-to-quarter, driven by strong local demand. Zhao said this was because SMIC’s customers gained more market share in China. In China, domestic production of electronics is important, and companies like Huawei Technologies Co. rely on local suppliers such as SMIC, so resolving the memory shortage is crucial to avoid disruptions within the industry. This shows that the boom in AI is not only affecting advanced chips but also more basic memory chips. When chipmakers focus on high-end AI parts, there are fewer chips left for everyday products.

Aden, a leading decentralized exchange, has made a significant move by restoring Korean language support. This decision comes after a crucial regulatory clarification that’s creating waves across the cryptocurrency landscape. Why Did This Decentralized Exchange Resume Korean Support? The turning point arrived when South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit provided clear guidance. They confirmed that decentralized exchange platforms fall outside Virtual Asset Service Provider regulations. This regulatory clarity gives decentralized exchange operators like Aden the confidence to expand their services. South Korea’s FIU, operating under the Financial Services Commission, has taken a progressive stance. They’re currently not imposing sanctions on any decentralized exchange platforms, including well-known names like Aster and Hyperliquid. This creates a favorable environment for decentralized exchange growth in the region. What Does This Mean for Korean Crypto Traders? Korean users now regain access to Aden’s full suite of decentralized exchange services in their native language. This development brings several key benefits: Seamless trading experience in Korean language Enhanced accessibility for local traders Clear regulatory framework for decentralized exchange operations Increased confidence in platform security and compliance The decentralized exchange ecosystem continues evolving rapidly. Aden has committed to adapting its operating policies to match any future regulatory guidelines. This proactive approach demonstrates their dedication to compliant operations while serving the Korean market effectively. How Are Other Decentralized Exchange Platforms Responding? While specific regulations for decentralized exchange platforms remain under development, the current landscape shows promising growth. Other decentralized exchange operators are likely watching Aden’s move closely. The successful implementation of Korean language support could inspire similar expansions across the decentralized exchange sector. Aden’s decision reflects growing confidence in decentralized exchange regulatory frameworks worldwide. As more jurisdictions provide clarity, we can expect increased adoption and language support across various decentralized exchange platforms. What’s Next for Decentralized Exchange Regulation? The future looks bright for decentralized exchange platforms seeking global expansion. South Korea’s approach could serve as a model for other nations developing decentralized exchange regulations. The key takeaway? Regulatory clarity enables growth and innovation in the decentralized exchange space. As Aden leads the way with Korean language support, other decentralized exchange platforms may follow suit. This creates exciting opportunities for traders and strengthens the global decentralized exchange ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What prompted Aden to resume Korean language support? The decision followed South Korea’s FIU clarification that DEXs are excluded from VASP regulations, providing regulatory certainty. Are other DEXs facing sanctions in South Korea? No, the FIU has confirmed they’re not currently sanctioning any DEXs, including platforms like Aster and Hyperliquid. Will Aden comply with future DEX regulations? Yes, Aden has committed to adjusting its operating policies to comply with any future regulatory guidelines. How does this benefit Korean crypto traders? Korean traders regain native language access to decentralized trading with enhanced clarity about regulatory status. Could this lead to more DEXs adding language support? Absolutely, regulatory clarity often encourages platforms to expand their language and regional support offerings. What does this mean for DEX regulation globally? South Korea’s approach could influence how other countries regulate decentralized exchanges, potentially creating more standardized frameworks.

Approaching strong support, the Total2 chart provides hope that this bull market is not over yet. Bitcoin will decide, but altcoins above major support Source: TradingView While Bitcoin (BTC) is at the very brink of a descent into potential bear market territory on Friday morning, the altcoin market cap is approaching its own strong support. A major horizontal support level and an ascending trendline are what remain between altcoins and what could be a spectacular collapse. Obviously, Bitcoin will decide the ultimate destiny of the altcoins for this bull market cycle, and therefore it will all depend on whether the undisputed king of the cryptocurrencies goes into a full-scale bear market plunge, or whether its major ascending trendline will hold firm. If the bearish scenario does play out, the altcoin market cap could go all the way down to $940 billion at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, or even $717 billion at the 0.786 Fibonacci extension. The bullish scenario is that a bounce takes the price first to the $1.42 trillion resistance, and then to $1.55 trillion. The Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom and would therefore perhaps point towards the bounce. USDT Dominance trend breakout Source: TradingView The USDT Dominance chart appears to be in favour of the bears. If the USDT stablecoins are increasing in dominance it means that they are not being exchanged into $BTC or altcoins. The above weekly chart reveals a potential breakout of a descending trendline that began in late 2022, i.e., at the beginning of the bull market. If this breakout confirms, that could also confirm the end of the crypto bull market. One hope the bulls still have to cling to is that the current weekly candle has just back-filled the previous week’s candle wick to the upside. It could potentially come back from here. This time the Stochastic RSI indicators are topping out, so this would probably point towards a decrease in USDT Dominance from here. DXY rejection gives crypto market hope Source: TradingView Finally, we need to have a look at the Dollar Index (DXY). The DXY has a strong inverse correlation with the crypto market, given that as the dollar weakens against other major currencies, it enhances the appeal of non-fiat assets like cryptocurrencies. Also, as the dollar debases, more value is sucked into scarce and hard money like Bitcoin, which is then diffused through the crypto ecosystem. The above weekly chart shows that the DXY is between multi-year trendlines and has just been rejected from the strong $100 horizontal resistance level. A weak dollar is part of President Trump’s economic strategy, therefore, unless there are any major black swans, it might be expected that the dollar continues to weaken now. Once again, the Stochastic RSI is giving the signal of a potential major downturn. Conclusion To conclude, the current dire market sentiment for crypto may be deserved, but there are signs that a turnaround could be in the cards. The altcoin market, and Bitcoin specifically, need to survive this week. At time of going to press, the $BTC price has dipped under the major trendline and has fallen to $95,700. Unless the price gets back above the major trendline, and soon, there could be a whole world of hurt still to come for crypto. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $254 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is down by 5.6% on Friday morning (UTC); 96 of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins are down today; BTC decreased by 6.2% to $97,033, and ETH fell by 9.2% to $3,208; ’Bitcoin appears to be fighting one battle after another’; The real test could be the interest rate decision in the US on 10 December; Crypto and tech stocks are diverging; ’Despite recent price movement, 2025 has been the year of institutional investment into digital assets’; ’Bitcoin DeFi is poised to be at the forefront of the global financial system – from Wall Street to Main Street’; US BTC spot ETFs saw a whopping $869.86 million in outflows on Thursday, and ETH ETFs let go of $259.72 million; Canary Capital’s XRPC, the first US spot XRP ETF, made its debut on Thursday; Crypto market sentiment drops again within the fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 6.2% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $97,033. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 9.2%, now changing hands at $3,208. This, along with Lido Staked Ether (STETH) , is the highest fall in the category. Solana (SOL) is in in the second place, having dropped 8.6% to the price of $142. The smallest fall is 2.3% by Tron (TRX) , which now stands at $0.2927. When it comes to the top 100 coins, only four are green. Among these, Zcash (ZEC) appreciated the most, rising to the price of $507. Leo Token (LEO) follows with a 2% rise to $9.17. On the other hand, three coins saw double-digit drops. Story (IP) fell 15%, now trading at $3.34. It’s followed by Aave (AAVE)’s 13.6% and Hedera (HBAR)’s 10.4% to $185 and $0.1606, respectively. ‘Bitcoin Appears To Be Fighting One Battle After Another’ Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau , argues that the “crypto market has been struggling to regain momentum since October’s pandemonium.” “Bitcoin appears to be fighting one battle after another, dragged down by US dollar strength and higher Treasury yields, long-term holders selling, and macro uncertainty,” he says. Puckrin finds it “unsettling” to see crypto and tech stocks diverging when they typically move in lockstep. This dynamic shows that BTC “isn’t just a proxy for the Nasdaq.” Rather, it’s more sensitive to macro headwinds and liquidity concerns and is “perfectly positioned to break out once those concerns dissipate.” Notably, as the US re-opens and data starts flooding back in, “we may see the BTC price wobble over the coming weeks.” The real test could be the interest rate decision in the US on 10 December. Still, “it remains likely that the news will be positive, which could set the stage for a Santa rally in crypto and other risk assets,” Puckrin concludes. Moreover, Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB , commented on institutional involvement in BTC as the coin’s price drops below $100,000. “Despite recent price movement, 2025 has been the year of institutional investment into digital assets, with institutions now holding over 4 million BTC,” Harz writes in an email commentary. These institutions are “increasingly looking to store excess cash in DeFi vaults for higher-yield opportunities. These two movements are converging with Bitcoin DeFi; moving the world’s biggest digital asset beyond a store of value and into a yield-generating asset. “ He continues: “As this mainstream appetite for DeFi grows, serious technological advancements are unlocking Bitcoin’s utility. Key players in institutional crypto and Bitcoin DeFi adoption are opening up access to BTCFi, where institutions can leverage yield-bearing opportunities for their BTC holdings. Bitcoin DeFi is poised to be at the forefront of the global financial system – from Wall Street to Main Street.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC fell below the $100,000 mark and to the $96,000 level, now standing at $97,033. The coin has dropped from the intraday high of $103,737 to the low of $96,170. It’s now down 4.7% in a week, 13.7% in a month, and 22.9% from its all-time high. We may see BTC pull back towards $94,500 and further towards the $90,000 level. A higher plunge could drag it lower. Conversely, if there is a change in course, the coin could climb back above $100,000 and move towards $103,000. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,208. It plunged from today’s high of $3,545 to the currently lowest point of $3,126. Over this past week, it has been trading between $3,172 and $3,633. ETH is down 4.3% in a day, 22.2% in a month, and 35.1% from its ATH. ETH may continue dropping today and over the next few days. Should that happen, it could retreat below the $3,000 level – far from the near-$5,000 zone where it stood just weeks ago. If there is a market rebound, the coin could return to the $3,500 territory and potentially $3,650. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has decreased again, holding firmly to the fear zone and moving to extreme fear. The crypto fear and greed index fell from 25 yesterday to 22 today . Some investors are selling assets, driven by fear and worry over the continuously falling prices. If the market continues to ride this instability, it may decline further. However, if assets are oversold, as high fear can sometimes indicate, the market could potentially see a rebound. Undervalued prices could also present a potential buying opportunity. ETFs See Significant Outflows On Thursday, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $869.86 million in outflows, the highest since February 2025 and the second-highest on record. The total net inflow is back down to $60.21 billion, but it still stands above $60 billion. Ten of the 12 BTC ETFs recorded negative flows, and there were no positive flows. Grayscale let go of $256.64 million. It’s followed by BlackRock’s $256.64 million. One more triple-digit is $119.93 million by Fidelity . At the same time, the US ETH ETFs continued their outflow streak, recording another $259.72 million leaving on 13 November. The total net inflow pulled back to $13.31 billion. Five of the nine funds recorded outflows. There were no positive flows. BlackRock is the reddest among these, letting go of $137.31 million. Grayscale follows with $67.91 in outflows. Meanwhile, Canary Capital’s XRPC , the first US spot exchange-traded fund offering direct exposure to XRP , made its debut on Thursday with $58 million in trading volume. Such notable opening performance indicates that there is a rising institutional appetite for exposure to other major assets, besides BTC and ETH. Congrats to $XRPC for $58m in Day One volume, the most of any ETF launched this year (out of 900), BARELY edging out $BSOL 's $57m. The two of them are in league of own tho as 3rd place is over $20m away. pic.twitter.com/MjsOeceeNb — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today?

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) combines fee discounts, staking, and roadmap utility, with a modeled potential high of $0.62 in 2026. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) fuses meme energy with a burn-to-earn game loop; external models outline 2025–2026 upside if listings and gameplay land. XRP ($XRP) gives you deep liquidity and low-cost, near instant settlement. Bitcoin’s falling! Bitcoin’s falling! Well, Bitcoin slipped right under the $100K mark and briefly touched a six-month low near $96,094. This wasn’t just a gentle pullback; it was a classic leveraged long flush, a sudden price drop forcing the liquidation of numerous leveraged long positions. Think of it as the market aggressively wiping out speculators who were over-betting on a price rise. We’re talking about roughly $509M in $BTC long positions getting liquidated in 24 hours. Even after all that, sentiment hasn’t totally crashed. Most folks are still leaning bullish, viewing this less as a disaster and more as a “buy-the-dip” opportunity. The noise might stick around for a bit, but the overall setup still favours smart accumulation and low-risk staking over high-risk leverage plays. That’s why smart money is rotating toward projects with real utility. And that’s why Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , and XRP ($XRP) could be the best crypto to buy at the moment. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Wallet Utility, Staking, and Fee Discounts Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is essentially your membership key to a top-tier Web3 wallet ecosystem, positioning itself as the access key to a full Web3 wallet stack. Its Best Wallet app is also among the leading self-custodial wallets today. $BEST lowers trading fees inside the wallet, offers priority launchpad access, and provides staking yields up to 77% for early community members. This focus on utility matters greatly when volatility bites, as a wallet token that reduces on-chain costs and offers curated deal flow gives holders something tangible to use every market day, not just during rallies. The presale has already impressively crossed over $17M, setting it apart from typical micro-raises. Its roadmap promises more juice, like market analytics, MEV protection , a staking aggregator, and a debit card, all designed to funnel recurring demand back to $BEST. If execution stays on track, the $BEST token forecast includes potential highs near $0.62 by the end of 2026, giving you an ROI of over 2280% if you bought at today’s price. You don’t have long to buy in, though, as the presale ends on November 28. Get $BEST tokens for $0.025945. 2. PepeNode ($PEPENODE): Mine-To-Earn Without the Bills PepeNode ($PEPENODE) cleverly blends meme culture with a mining-sim GameFi layer where you can buy nodes, upgrade facilities, and earn in-ecosystem rewards. It’s essentially gamified crypto mining without the need for the complicated tech setup and massively expensive electricity bills. This dual appeal of narrative and mechanics has seen its presale raise over $2.1M. The project also offers eye-catching triple-digit staking APYs for early participants, currently standing at 604%. You also get rewards for being the best miner, not only in $PEPENODE but in other popular altcoins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN, further enhancing the project’s reach. GameFi tokens typically perform well when liquidity shifts from Bitcoin to faster-moving sectors, and $PEPENODE fits this rotation. Our experts predict $PEPENODE’s token price reaching a potential $0.0072 by the end of 2026, giving you an ROI of 528% from today’s price. Buy your $PEPENODE for $0.0011454. 3. XRP ($XRP): Top Liquidity and Near-Instant Settlement For anyone prioritizing established exchange liquidity and a robust payments narrative, $XRP remains a core listed option, currently trading around $2.26 with deep markets and broad exchange coverage, including tier-one venues. The XRP Ledger’s low-cost, near-instant settlement capabilities continue to make it a go-to for cross-border transfers and remittance-style flows. And its substantial market cap and volume provide a cushion against volatility during broader market drawdowns. In a week when Bitcoin dipped to a six-month low, $XRP’s appeal lies in the ability to re-enter on liquid order books, while maintaining exposure to a strong, payments-led adoption curve. If the market stabilizes into year-end, rotations into large-cap alts with genuine throughput can outpace headline beta. This would make $XRP a reliable choice for HODLers focused on safer rails. Find $XRP on Binance for top liquidity. Recap: Bitcoin’s recent slip cleared out the over-leveraged traders, but it didn’t break the community’s overall belief in the market. For those buying the dip, $BEST offers practical wallet utility, $PEPENODE has that exciting “meme meets GameFi” mine-to-earn dynamic, and $XRP provides deep liquidity with a proven payments use case.

That’s exactly what Winston Weinberg achieved with Harvey AI, a legal technology platform that’s revolutionizing how lawyers work while attracting every top-tier investor from Sequoia Capital to Andreessen Horowitz. The company’s staggering rise from $3 billion to $8 billion valuation in under a year signals a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is reshaping the legal profession. How Harvey AI is Disrupting Legal Technology Harvey AI represents the cutting edge of legal technology innovation. What started as a simple experiment with GPT-3 to run Dungeons and Dragons games evolved into a platform that now serves 235 clients across 63 countries, including most of the top 10 U.S. law firms. The company reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue by August 2025, demonstrating the massive demand for AI-powered legal solutions. Winston Weinberg’s Unconventional Journey to Startup Success Winston Weinberg’s path to building an $8 billion company began while he was still a first-year associate at O’Melveny & Myers. His breakthrough moment came when he and his co-founder Gabe Pereyra tested GPT-3 on California landlord-tenant statutes. They created a chain-of-thought prompt and tested it on 100 legal questions from Reddit’s legal advice community. The results were astonishing – on 86 of the samples, two out of three attorneys said they would send the AI-generated answers with zero edits. The turning point came with a bold move: Cold emailing Sam Altman and OpenAI’s general counsel Jason Kwon Securing a meeting on July 4th with OpenAI’s C-suite Becoming the OpenAI Startup Fund’s first institutional investment Building relationships with top investors despite no prior VC experience AI Startup Growth Strategy That Captured Silicon Valley Weinberg’s fundraising philosophy defies conventional Silicon Valley wisdom. Rather than focusing on networking, he emphasizes building a fundamentally strong business. His approach demonstrates that the best way to raise capital is to create undeniable value and traction. The company’s investor roster now reads like a who’s who of venture capital, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Elad Gil, Google Ventures, Coatue, and Andreessen Horowitz. Legal Innovation Through Multiplayer Platform Technology Harvey’s most significant technical challenge involves building what Weinberg calls a “multiplayer” platform – a system where in-house lawyers can safely collaborate with outside stakeholders while navigating complex ethical walls and data permissioning across dozens of countries. This addresses critical legal industry concerns about data security and confidentiality across jurisdictions with strict data processing laws like Germany and Australia. Use Case Percentage of Usage Growth Trend Drafting Primary Use Stable Research Emerging Rapid Growth Analysis Third Most Popular Accelerating Transforming Legal Practice with Advanced AI Technology Harvey addresses common criticisms about being just a “ChatGPT wrapper” by focusing on two key competitive advantages: collecting extensive workflow data and building a truly multiplayer platform that serves both legal service providers and consumers. The company is moving beyond simple AI assistance to create systems that can handle complex legal workflows with high accuracy. Current business model evolution: Primarily seat-based pricing Moving toward outcome-based pricing for specific workflows Focus on productivity enhancement rather than full automation Maintaining lawyer-in-the-loop approach for complex matters Frequently Asked Questions About Harvey AI What is Harvey AI’s current market penetration? With 8-9 million lawyers worldwide, Harvey’s penetration remains incredibly low, but the company is focused on the high value per token in complex legal work like mergers and acquisitions. How does Harvey address concerns about junior lawyer training? Weinberg views AI as a training tool rather than a replacement, creating systems that serve as one-on-one tutors for junior associates and potentially transforming legal education. What are Harvey’s future fundraising plans? While the company has raised significant capital for compute-intensive research, they don’t anticipate needing large fundraising rounds soon and are considering public markets long-term. The Future of Legal Technology is Here Harvey AI represents more than just another Silicon Valley success story – it demonstrates how artificial intelligence can transform traditional industries while creating enormous value. Winston Weinberg’s journey from first-year associate to CEO of an $8 billion company shows that breakthrough innovation often comes from unexpected places. As legal technology continues evolving, Harvey’s multiplayer platform approach and focus on real workflow solutions position it to fundamentally reshape how legal services are delivered worldwide.

While the recent increase in sudden and sharp corrections in Bitcoin has also increased bearish rhetoric, Bitwise CEO spoke clearly about the bearish rhetoric. Bringing a different perspective to bearish rhetoric, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that Bitcoin has been in a bear market for about six months and is now coming to an end. Stating that market dynamics have changed radically with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the inauguration of the new administration, Horsley argued that Bitcoin's traditional four-year cycle is no longer a valid model. Sharing from his X account, the famous CEO stated that the market is now driven by completely different participants, transaction motivations and liquidity mechanisms. Horsley also said that the current market structure is more robust than ever and Bitcoin maintains a bullish outlook in the medium to long term. “We talk about 4-year cycles. But the reality is that this model is based on the past cycles of cryptocurrencies. Since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and new management, we have entered a new market structure: new players, new dynamics, new reasons why people buy and sell. I think there is a pretty good chance that we have been in a bear market for about 6 months and have almost gotten over it. The current state of cryptocurrencies has never been stronger.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Famous US CEO Comments ""Bitcoin Bullishness Is Just Beginning!""

Tether Holdings SA, the issuer of the world’s most circulated stablecoin USDT, is entering the world of physical goods by reshaping how traders finance global shipments of commodities like oil, wheat, and cotton. A Bloomberg report states that with $1.5 billion already issued in loans, the company is transforming a centuries-old system that has traditionally relied on bank credit. This shift comes at a time when traditional lenders are pulling back from certain commodity markets, especially in riskier countries. Tether’s lending programme is filling the void with fast-moving, high-yield credit backed by digital assets. The result is a new form of trade finance that fuses stablecoin liquidity with private credit demand. Trade finance finds a new backer Commodities trading has always depended on credit. Traders typically use loans to pay for cargoes of goods that are in transit, such as crude oil or wheat. These loans are often short-term and denominated in US dollars, repaid once the goods are delivered and sold. However, a series of fraud scandals in recent years has pushed some global banks to reduce exposure in certain markets. That has left a financing gap, especially for smaller firms operating in emerging markets. Tether has stepped in through its Trade Finance unit, which launched in 2022 and is separate from the reserves backing its stablecoins. Since last year, Tether has expanded its lending across key sectors, including agriculture, oil, and soft commodities. It offers credit in both traditional US dollars and USDT, the stablecoin that tracks the value of the dollar. The company says this programme will grow significantly over time. Short cycles and high returns Lending in the commodities space has unique characteristics that attract private credit providers. One key feature is the speed of repayment. A single trade, such as a shipment of wheat across the Atlantic, is usually completed in under 30 days. This short cycle means lenders receive interest quickly and can reissue funds for the next deal. Tether is focusing on regions and clients where banking support is limited. These are often locations where geopolitical risks or a lack of collateral discourage banks from issuing credit. Private lenders can charge higher interest rates to reflect the greater risk. In some cases, these rates reach double digits, making the model highly profitable if loans are repaid on time. With nearly $200 billion in reserves, mostly invested in liquid assets such as US Treasury Bills, Tether has significant capacity to expand its lending portfolio. Bloomberg reports that it expects to generate around $15 billion in profit in 2025, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. From gold holdings to farm investments Tether is also expanding its role beyond lending. It has built one of the largest private gold reserves globally, excluding national governments and banks. Its gold-backed stablecoin, XAUT, has a market value of nearly $2.2 billion, according to CoinGecko . To strengthen its position in the precious metals market, Tether is hiring two senior traders from HSBC Holdings Plc, according to Bloomberg. This signals a more active strategy in physical commodity management. The company is also investing in production assets. In March, it announced plans to raise its stake in South American agribusiness Adecoagro SA to 70%, a deal worth up to $616 million. By April, commodity trading executive Kyril Louis-Dreyfus joined Adecoagro’s board, giving the company further strategic reach in the agriculture supply chain. Stablecoin adoption drives real-world use Stablecoins like USDT are increasingly being used beyond cryptocurrency exchanges. In Latin America, they are gaining traction for remittances and cross-border payments. The US passing stablecoin legislation in July added further clarity, accelerating adoption in traditional sectors. Tether is leveraging this shift to integrate USDT into real-world finance. By embedding its stablecoin into commodities trade, it combines blockchain efficiency with the scale of physical market operations. This offers faster payments, traceable transactions, and greater access to liquidity for traders who are often locked out of banking systems. The company’s growing role in commodities finance signals a broader change. As digital tokens become more trusted for value transfer, they are starting to fund the flow of goods that feed and power the world.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $94,900 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable downturn that has caught the attention of investors worldwide. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $95,000? Market analysts point to several factors contributing to this Bitcoin price movement. The cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility, and this recent dip reflects broader market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to understand that price corrections are normal in the crypto space. The current Bitcoin price adjustment might present opportunities for strategic investors looking to enter the market at lower levels. Key factors influencing this Bitcoin price movement include: Market sentiment shifts Institutional trading patterns Global economic indicators Technical resistance levels What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Your Portfolio?

The Bitcoin price landscape continues to evolve, and staying informed helps investors make better decisions. Market conditions change rapidly, and today’s Bitcoin price represents just one moment in the ongoing cryptocurrency journey. Frequently Asked Questions How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact Bitcoin price bottoms is challenging, as markets are influenced by numerous factors including sentiment, adoption rates, and global economic conditions. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? This depends on your investment strategy and financial goals. Many long-term investors view price drops as accumulation opportunities rather than selling signals. How long do Bitcoin price corrections typically last? Bitcoin price corrections can vary in duration from days to months, depending on market conditions and catalyst events driving the movement. What indicators should I watch for Bitcoin price recovery? Key indicators include trading volume, institutional activity, market sentiment, and technical support levels that suggest potential reversal points. Is this Bitcoin price drop different from previous corrections? While each market movement has unique characteristics, Bitcoin has experienced similar percentage drops throughout its history and recovered to new highs. How can I protect my portfolio from Bitcoin price volatility? Diversification, proper position sizing, and having a long-term perspective can help manage the impact of Bitcoin price fluctuations on your overall portfolio. Found this analysis helpful?

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-everything-is-lining-up-for-xrp-heres-why/,"The arrival of XRP exchange-traded funds (XRP ETF) has shifted market expectations. For the first time, XRP now sits inside regulated investment vehicles that can attract large pools of capital. This moment has pushed traders, analysts, and institutional watchers to re-evaluate XRP’s position in the broader market cycle. The optimism is strong, yet the dynamics shaping the next major move remain complex. ETF Launches and Growing Institutional Access According to top trader Arthur, several forces now align in XRP’s favor. These include the launch of spot ETFs, fresh listings, early inflows, and rising institutional queries. His view reflects the growing interest seen across major trading venues. The debut of the XRP ETFs drew heavy day-one volume and signaled strong market readiness. These early flows suggest investors want regulated exposure to XRP at scale. Everything is lining up for XRP! The ETFs have just launched and listings, inflows, institutional demand… it’s all coming ! But for that to fully play out… We NEED the Bitcoin Dominance to drop ! This useless BTC is dragging the entire market down. XRP needs room to… — Arthur (@XrpArthur) November 13, 2025 How ETF Mechanics Amplify Demand ETF demand does not only appear in trading volume. When new shares are created, authorized participants must acquire the underlying asset. This process produces real buy pressure in the spot market. If creations continue daily, XRP demand may rise in a steady and measurable way. The ETF structure also offers clarity and reduces friction for large investors who have avoided direct crypto custody. Market Pressure From Bitcoin Dominance Arthur highlighted one key barrier: Bitcoin dominance . Bitcoin currently controls a large share of the crypto market. When dominance stays high, altcoins often struggle to gain momentum. XRP faces this same challenge. For the token to break out strongly, capital must rotate from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins. A decline in Bitcoin dominance would allow this rotation to happen more easily. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Market Needs Bitcoin Dominance to Fall A fall in Bitcoin dominance often marks the start of broad altcoin expansion. This shift would give XRP room to accelerate without Bitcoin’s weight holding the market down. Traders watch Bitcoin dominance closely because it signals where liquidity is flowing. A sustained drop would open the door for stronger XRP performance, especially with ETF demand building. Current Market Conditions and Short-Term Risks Despite the strong ETF debut, XRP’s price action remained mixed in the immediate aftermath. Broader market selling and unstable sentiment pulled many altcoins. This shows that ETF demand alone cannot override wider market pressure. Liquidity shocks, macro events, and Bitcoin volatility can still slow XRP’s progress in the short term. Conditions Are Building, But One Trigger Remains XRP’s long-term outlook has strengthened. The infrastructure for institutional adoption now exists, and early inflows confirm genuine interest. The remaining catalyst is a shift in capital distribution across the market. A meaningful drop in Bitcoin dominance could unlock the full impact of the ETFs. If that shift occurs, XRP may finally gain the space it needs to pursue a sustained breakout. XRP has structure, attention, and regulated access on its side. What it needs next is market rotation. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This powerful visual metaphor speaks volumes about his HODL Bitcoin philosophy during turbulent market conditions. Why Is Michael Saylor Doubling Down on HODL Bitcoin? The term HODL originated from a 2013 Bitcoin forum post typo and has since become a battle cry for long-term cryptocurrency holders. Michael Saylor’s recent social media post reinforces his unwavering commitment to this strategy. His lifeboat imagery suggests that while others panic during market downturns, true believers should stay the course with their HODL Bitcoin approach. MicroStrategy currently holds over 214,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Saylor’s consistent message remains clear: accumulate and hold through volatility. His latest post serves as both reassurance and warning to investors tempted to abandon ship during choppy waters. What Does the Lifeboat Imagery Really Mean? Saylor’s burning ship represents the traditional financial system and failing investment strategies. The lone lifeboat symbolizes Bitcoin as the safe haven. This visual storytelling emphasizes several key points: Bitcoin as preservation – Protecting wealth when other assets fail Individual responsibility – Taking control of your financial future Long-term perspective – Staying focused amid short-term chaos Strategic isolation – Sometimes the right move means going against the crowd How Can Investors Implement the HODL Bitcoin Strategy? Successfully executing a HODL Bitcoin strategy requires more than just buying and forgetting. Here are actionable steps based on Saylor’s philosophy: Dollar-cost average into positions rather than timing the market Secure your assets in cold storage wallets for long-term safety Ignore short-term noise and focus on multi-year time horizons Educate yourself continuously about Bitcoin’s fundamentals Remember that the HODL Bitcoin approach works best when combined with proper risk management and portfolio diversification. Saylor’s message isn’t about reckless speculation but disciplined accumulation. What Challenges Do HODL Bitcoin Investors Face? Maintaining a HODL Bitcoin mindset presents several psychological challenges. Market volatility tests even the most committed holders. Regulatory uncertainty creates additional pressure. Moreover, the temptation to take profits during rallies can undermine long-term strategy. However, historical data shows that those who consistently held Bitcoin through multiple cycles have been rewarded. Saylor’s lifeboat imagery serves as a reminder that survival often requires staying calm when others are panicking. The Ultimate HODL Bitcoin Survival Guide Michael Saylor’s dramatic post encapsulates the core principles of successful cryptocurrency investing. The HODL Bitcoin strategy represents more than just holding – it’s about conviction, patience, and recognizing Bitcoin’s unique value proposition in the digital age. As traditional financial systems show increasing strain, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience. Saylor’s message encourages investors to view market downturns as opportunities rather than threats. The lifeboat isn’t escaping the storm – it’s navigating through it toward safer waters. Frequently Asked Questions What does HODL mean in cryptocurrency? HODL stands for ‘Hold On for Dear Life’ and refers to the strategy of buying and holding cryptocurrencies long-term regardless of price fluctuations. How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own? MicroStrategy currently holds over 214,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Why does Michael Saylor promote HODL Bitcoin? Saylor believes Bitcoin is the best store of value available and that long-term holding outperforms active trading strategies. Is HODL Bitcoin strategy suitable for all investors? While the strategy has proven successful for many, it requires high risk tolerance and should only represent a portion of a diversified portfolio. What’s the difference between HODL and day trading? HODL focuses on long-term accumulation while day trading seeks short-term profits from price movements. How long should I HODL Bitcoin? Most successful HODLers maintain positions for multiple market cycles, typically 4+ years, to realize maximum returns. Found this analysis of Michael Saylor’s HODL Bitcoin strategy helpful?

The company announced Thursday that it will wind down its Bitcoin operations over 2026 and 2027 after posting a steep $46 million loss in the third quarter, nearly double its $24 million loss during the same period last year. Source: Bitfarms Bitcoin mining firms across the U.S. and Canada have been rushing to capture the booming demand for AI compute , but Bitfarms has become the first major player to openly say it plans to abandon Bitcoin mining entirely. The company will now focus on high-performance computing and AI infrastructure. Bitfarms Abandons Bitcoin Mining Following Deep Losses, Shifts to AI Infrastructure The company detailed its transition plans alongside earnings, revealing that its 18-megawatt facility in Washington State will become the first Bitfarms site fully converted to support HPC and AI workloads. The facility is expected to run up to 190 kilowatts per rack, use advanced liquid cooling, and support validated designs optimized for Nvidia’s next-generation GB300 GPUs. Bitfarms said it has already signed a fully funded $128 million binding agreement with an American infrastructure provider for IT equipment and materials for the conversion. The company expects the site to be completed by December 2026, operating at an industry-leading power usage effectiveness (PuE) between 1.2 and 1.3. CEO Ben Gagnon said the Washington facility represents less than 1% of Bitfarms’ total developable portfolio but could still generate more income than the company has ever earned from Bitcoin mining. With nearly $1 billion in liquidity, the company plans to pursue a GPU-as-a-Service model, which could serve as the financial foundation as Bitcoin revenues decline. Bitfarms currently operates 12 data centers across North America with 341 megawatts of installed capacity and a 1.3-gigawatt development pipeline. Despite confidence in its shift to AI, the company’s Q3 results highlight the financial strain of mining in 2025. Source: Bitfarms Revenue rose 156% year-over-year to $69 million, though still below analyst expectations, while the company mined 520 BTC during the quarter at an average direct cost of $48,200. According to Bitcoin treasury data, Bitfarms held 1,827 BTC as of Wednesday. Shares of Bitfarms (BITF) fell sharply following the announcement, dropping nearly 18% to $2.60 on Thursday and slipping further in after-hours trading. Source: Google Finance The stock is now down more than 51% over the last month. Under Financial Scrutiny, Bitfarms Upsizes Debt Deal and Joins Mining Industry’s AI Pivot The transition is unfolding during a period of turbulence for the company. Earlier in the year, Bitfarms disclosed accounting errors in its 2022 and 2023 reports, prompting a proposed investor class action alleging weaknesses in its financial reporting controls. The company also expanded a major debt financing deal in October, upsizing a planned convertible note sale from $300 million to $500 million due to strong investor demand. @Bitfarms_io has expanded its planned convertible note sale to $500 million, up from the $300 million announced just a day earlier. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/EGAAW05VqU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 17, 2025 The notes, maturing in 2031, carry a 30% premium conversion price at $6.86 per share. The broader mining sector is also shifting. Marathon Digital recently announced it would expand into AI compute alongside record revenue. IREN signed a multiyear $9.7 billion AI compute deal with Microsoft, giving the tech giant access to its infrastructure. These moves reflect the rising view that AI offers higher margins, steadier demand, and fewer regulatory uncertainties than Bitcoin mining. Bitfarms’ pivot also comes during a volatile period for the cryptocurrency itself. Source: Cryptonews Bitcoin fell nearly 3% over the last 24 hours to $99,441, its lowest level in six months. Corporate accumulation also slowed significantly in October, with public and private companies adding only 14,447 BTC, the smallest monthly increase of 2025.

Notably, the independent nonprofit organization arrived at this decision after noticing that regulations for recognizing and reporting cryptocurrencies were unclear. This resulted in the inaccuracy of financial reports, according to the FASB . Therefore, with this review in place, sources pointed out that the non-profit organization is committed to improving the current financial reporting practices and addressing existing challenges. Washington calls for more rules and transparency for digital assets The FASB’s recent move has sparked debates among individuals in the crypto space, with many wondering when these amendments will take place. To address this controversy, a source close to the matter highlighted that the FASB’s discussions focus on the possibility of broadening the framework established in 2023. This framework offered initial guidance for crypto assets. Under the framework established in 2023, the FASB released ASU 2023-08, which outlined the accounting and disclosure requirements for specific crypto assets. Reports indicate that these new guidelines require organizations to evaluate certain crypto assets at fair value over time, with any adjustments in this value reflected in net income at each reporting period. Moreover, organizations were required to provide more information regarding their holdings of specific crypto assets. These changes were initially scheduled to take effect for fiscal years that begin after December 15, 2024, including the interim periods within those years, and would affect all organizations. However, reports with this information pointed out that organizations that preferred to adopt these amendments early were given the chance to do so. According to established guidelines, if an entity decides to implement changes during the interim period, it must initiate these changes at the beginning of the fiscal year that encompasses that period. These guidelines were successfully implemented in response to the White House’s call for greater clarity on cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, regarding FASB’s recent considerations, reliable sources reported that Richard Jones, the chair of FASB, stated that the board has added a new initiative to its research plans. He also revealed that this new project will concentrate on how businesses need to account for their digital assets. This decision, according to Jones, not only suggested an internal affair but “a recent recommendation from the President’s Working Group on digital asset markets.” Several analysts also weighed in on the matter, stating that this situation reflected the mounting pressure from Washington for more regulations and clarity in the rapidly expanding digital economy. FASB faces criticism for omitting key elements in the crypto industry By possibly revealing its rules to the public, analysts anticipate that the FASB would bolster its guidelines linked to crypto assets. This highlights the importance of robust accounting standards in a rapidly evolving financial world. While several individuals praised FASB’s recent moves, some have criticized the non-profit organization’s new rules, arguing that it omitted important elements such as specific “governance” tokens, wrapped tokens , and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the crypto industry. On the other hand, investors are paying keen attention to clearer rules that guide them on how to report their crypto asset transfers in their financial statements. Furthermore, sources noted that they are seeking better investment options, acknowledging the need for greater uniformity and clarity in financial reporting.

54391462,https://invezz.com/?p=2968149,1763126433,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Alibaba and JPMorgan bring stablecoin like payment to global e-commerce,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/14/alibaba-and-jpmorgan-bring-stablecoin-like-payment-to-global-e-commerce/,"Alibaba is preparing to transform international business payments with a tokenised money system that could speed up B2B trade around the world. Partnering with JPMorgan, as reported by CNBC , the company will roll out a blockchain-based settlement network by December, aiming to eliminate payment delays and high transaction costs. The system will use stablecoin-like tokens backed by real bank deposits in US dollars and euros, making digital payments faster and more reliable for buyers and suppliers globally. Stablecoin settlement built for real trade The new payment network is designed to address some of the most pressing problems in global e-commerce. At the moment, cross-border payments can take between 48 and 72 hours to settle. This slows down supply chains and increases risk for small businesses and large exporters alike. Alibaba plans to use tokenised versions of the US dollar and euro that are backed by actual bank deposits. These tokens will behave like stablecoins but without the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The aim is to create a seamless transaction layer that works across different currencies and jurisdictions without friction. JPMorgan’s Kinexys blockchain platform will power the network. The bank’s infrastructure already supports $2 billion in tokenised daily transactions, offering a tested foundation for Alibaba’s next phase in digital trade. Agentic Pay automates contract workflows Alongside the payment system, Alibaba is launching Agentic Pay, a smart payment rail that uses artificial intelligence to speed up B2B negotiations. This tool can automatically convert chat conversations between buyers and suppliers into enforceable contracts. The use of AI in this context helps simplify processes that normally require legal review and paperwork. It reduces the time and manual effort involved in closing a deal, letting businesses focus on operations rather than administration. Agentic Pay is expected to make Alibaba’s platform more efficient by connecting communication directly with transaction execution. This links naturally with the new tokenised settlement system, creating a complete end-to-end experience for users. December launch targets billions in volume The system is set for a global rollout in December. Alibaba expects that once active, the network will handle billions in annual settlement volume. The company sees this as a necessary step for scaling digital trade and removing long-standing barriers in global finance. Alibaba.com president Kuo Zhang shared details of the initiative with CNBC, explaining that the current state of B2B trade needs to be reimagined using modern tools. The urgency, according to the company, is driven by inefficiencies that have existed in the traditional financial rails supporting international trade. JPMorgan’s timing aligns closely with this project. Just two days before the announcement, the bank had launched its deposit token on Base, another sign of growing confidence in tokenisation from traditional finance. A new model for cross-border payments This collaboration between a leading global marketplace and a major financial institution signals a shift in how digital payments are handled at scale. It is not an experimental project but a commercial solution built on proven banking infrastructure and digital asset technology. By replacing delays and currency complexities with near-instant, tokenised transactions, Alibaba is taking a bold step into the future of trade. The model avoids speculative tokens, opting instead for real-world money represented digitally, making it easier for businesses to trust and adopt. With billions in expected volume and technology from two industry leaders, the project could mark a turning point in global B2B commerce.

Is It the Next 1000x Crypto?,https://bitcoinist.com/500k-whale-buy-bitcoin-hyper-next-1000x-crypto/,"Quick Facts: A whale bought $500K worth of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), marking perhaps the biggest sign of confidence yet on the project. Whale buys, particularly in early stages, typically precede broader retail interest and exchange listings. The whale buy has helped push the Bitcoin Hyper presale to over $27.5M raised. Hyper’s Bitcoin Layer-2, powered by Solana contracts, has attracted a lot of attention since the presale began. Smart money is making noise. Just a few hours ago, a whale wallet bought over $500K worth of $HYPER tokens, helping push the presale to over $27.5M raised. That level of accumulation doesn’t happen by accident. When a whale wallet buys more than $500K in a presale token, it’s nothing but a clear conviction ahead of public listings. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) positions itself as the first meme token with a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, which is powered by a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration. It’s targeting Bitcoin’s core pain points: glacial transaction speeds, sky-high fees, and the absence of programmable smart contracts. Why Whales Are Betting on Bitcoin Hyper On-chain analysis reveals coordinated positioning by high-net-worth wallets. These aren’t speculative retail buys. The $500K transaction represents calculated exposure to infrastructure that could reshape how Bitcoin handles DeFi, NFTs, and high-frequency payments. Whale wallet buys of more than $500K in early-stage projects undoubtedly correlate with insider confidence. This pattern of accumulation often precedes broader institutional interest and exchange listings. And this recent big buy is far from the only one. Hyper has locked in similar whale buys of nearly $380K and $274K earlier during the presale. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) clearly has momentum. The presale has already raised a whopping $27.5M+, with tokens at $0.013275 ahead of the next price increase. That’s significant traction for a project targeting Q4 2025 to Q1 2026 mainnet launch. What Bitcoin Hyper Actually Does Bitcoin processes roughly seven transactions per second (TPS), while Solana can handle up to 65K TPS . Bitcoin Hyper bridges that gap by layering the Solana Virtual Machine atop Bitcoin’s settlement layer, creating a modular architecture that preserves security while unlocking speed. The technical setup matters. Bitcoin serves as the Layer 1 for final settlement. Bitcoin Hyper’s SVM-powered Layer 2 handles real-time execution with sub-second finality and minimal fees. A trusted sequencer batches transactions before periodically anchoring state proofs to the Bitcoin mainnet. Developers get access to Rust-based SDKs and APIs, enabling deployment of DeFi protocols, gaming dApps, and NFT platforms without rewriting infrastructure from scratch. SPL-compatible tokens modified for Layer 2 operation allow seamless asset bridging through the project’s decentralized Canonical Bridge . See Hyper’s latest blockchain updates. The Layer 2 Infrastructure Race Heats Up Bitcoin Layer 2 development accelerated throughout 2025. Yona Network integrated SVM and EVM to bring high throughput to Bitcoin, while Solayer recently launched sBridge for sub-1-second cross-chain transfers optimized for SVM semantics. Caldera became the first multi-VM rollup platform supporting both SVM and EVM implementations. Bitcoin Hyper enters this landscape with a pure-play focus on Bitcoin ecosystem expansion. Unlike hybrid solutions, it commits exclusively to scaling Bitcoin rather than fragmenting across multiple chains. To learn more, check out ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ guide. The ongoing presale for $HYPER funds the project’s growth and keeps early buyers invested as the ecosystem expands. The total supply caps at 21B $HYPER tokens. Distribution allocates 25% to treasury, 20% to marketing, 10% to exchange listings, and 30% to ongoing development. Presale participants gain immediate access to staking upon joining, with dynamic APY rates now at 42%. How to Join the Bitcoin Hyper Presale The $HYPER token is what will power the Layer 2 once it launches. More than simply a means to pay for transaction fees, it’ll also provide you with additional benefits, including governance rights and access to exclusive features. Right now, you can purchase tokens via the official presale page. Each one costs $0.013275, which you can also stake right after buying and get 42% APY in staking rewards. But this price is dynamic and bound to go up. The token presale has regular price increases, with the next one happening a day from now. Read our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide for step-by-step instructions to join the presale. If you’re still on the fence about the project, the latest $500K whale buy is perhaps the biggest sign that it could be the next 1000x crypto . After all, Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to give the Bitcoin ecosystem a much-needed upgrade when it launches its Layer 2 network. If project milestones check out, $HYPER’s price forecast looks bullish in late 2025 and beyond, but it’s still early days. Join Hyper early for under $0.014. Disclaimer: Do your own research.

The fear and greed index hovers around 20 levels, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market. Dogecoin experienced a sharp drop from around $0.1757 before finding a bottom near $0.159, signaling strong intraday selling pressure. After the decline, the price attempted a mild recovery but continued to fluctuate in a tight range, showing hesitation from buyers. DOGE is currently trading near $0.164 down by 6.98%, indicating consolidation as the market waits for a clearer direction. Whales Accumulate 4.72 Billion DOGE, Signaling Strong Bullish Confidence According to analyst Ali Martinez, highlights a significant accumulation trend among Dogecoin whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE. Over the past two weeks, these large holders have collectively added 4.72 billion DOGE to their wallets. This surge in accumulation has taken place even as price volatility persisted, suggesting that whales see current levels as a strategic accumulation zone rather than a distribution phase. Their steady buying activity often reflects confidence in DOGE’s medium- to long-term potential. Martinez notes that such a sharp increase in whale holdings is usually a bullish on-chain signal, as it reduces the available supply on exchanges and hints at expectations of future price appreciation. Historically, when whales accumulate aggressively, Dogecoin often sees stronger price momentum afterward. If this trend continues, the supply squeeze created by these major investors could act as fuel for a potential upward move once broader market sentiment aligns. Dogecoin’s Giant Triangle Points to a Major Breakout Ahead Analyst Trader Tardigrade highlights a massive multi-year giant triangle pattern forming on Dogecoin’s long-term chart. This structure has been developing over roughly five years (1,826 days), with price action consistently tightening between the upper descending trendline and the rising support line. Such long-term symmetrical triangles often precede major breakout moves, as they represent years of consolidation where volatility compresses and market participants accumulate positions in anticipation of a decisive trend. Source: X According to the chart, a breakout from this giant triangle could propel Dogecoin toward a projected target of around $1.20, marking a significant bullish expansion if the pattern plays out. Trader Tardigrade’s outlook suggests that once Dogecoin escapes this prolonged consolidation zone, the move could mirror previous explosive rallies flagged by similar volatility squeezes. This setup emphasizes the potential for a dramatic price surge once DOGE breaks above the triangle’s upper boundary on strong volume.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 13:21:56

With this in mind, the Digitap ($TAP) presale has emerged as the top option, as Digitap brings utility unlike the market has seen before. Because of this, experts believe that Digitap can outperform SUI and another promising crypto presale, BlockchainFX, stating that it has virtually unlimited room for growth. SUI and BlockchainFX: 2 Very Promising Altcoins to Buy In this head-to-head, there’s SUI, an established player that was one of the best altcoins to buy in 2024, and BlockchainFX, a crypto presale that’s also considered a great crypto to buy now. On the one hand, SUI has experienced considerable turbulence over the past few weeks, largely due to the broader market downturn. This has led to a significant fall in SUI’s price, which is currently at $1.97. This marks a 2.85% decrease from SUI’s price from a week ago , but experts believe that SUI is now back on the best altcoins to buy list. That’s because they believe that SUI’s price is marking a local bottom, with potential to rise in the coming weeks. On the other hand, there’s BlockchainFX, a promising crypto to buy that’s currently in presale. As a new project, BlockchainFX is here to bring a more streamlined trading experience for people. To do that, it allows users to trade crypto, stocks, bonds, ETFs, and more via one unified platform. This has helped BlockchainFX to raise over $11 million during its crypto presale so far, which is quite impressive. The demand is there, and experts believe that BlockchainFX could have sound success if everything goes as planned. As for its price, BlockchainFX is currently selling for $0.03 per token, with its launch price set at $0.05. What Could the Future Hold for SUI and BlockchainFX, As Per Analysts As mentioned, analysts see SUI and BlockchainFX as two very promising altcoins to buy. According to Ali Martinez , SUI could be in a good spot for buying right now, as its price has suffered significant downturns recently. Also, his TD Sequential has flashed a buy signal, and he believes that SUI’s price could rally to $3 or even $4 from here. This would mark a potential 103% rise. As for BlockchainFX, analysts are still not 100% sure of its outcome, but they still believe that it could be a good crypto to buy if it executes its plan and roadmap well. They say that if everything goes as planned, BlockchainFX can onboard a good user base, which would include traders who want to diversify as much as possible without having to go from platform to platform. With this in mind, they say that BlockchainFX’s price can rise by 2x-3x in the coming months, maybe slightly more if an overly bullish sentiment sweeps the market. What Makes Digitap the Best Crypto To Buy Now, With a Potential Better ROI Than SUI and BlockchainFX? Even though both SUI and BlockchainFX seem to have bright futures ahead, experts are more bullish on Digitap, calling it the best crypto to buy now. The reason behind this is Digitap’s utility and how early it is in its crypto presale. With Digitap, people will now get something they’ve been waiting for years - a platform that merges crypto and fiat into one place. Via the Digitap app, people can now store, hold, and spend both crypto and fiat from one place, receiving instant conversions and settlements. Also, they’ll get a Visa-backed crypto card, which they can use anywhere Visa is accepted. So, no matter which asset they hold, they can use the Digitap crypto card to pay for everyday things, as well as make global transfers. Another thing that sets the $TAP presale apart is the fact that the Digitap app is already live via the Google Play Store and Apple App Store even now. This means that people can see exactly what they’re investing in before they actually do, which has driven demand for $TAP even higher. So far, the presale has raised over $1.8 million, selling more than 112 million tokens. Its price is at $0.0297, which will rise pretty soon to $0.0313 as demand continues to grow. Digitap’s Path: An Overly Positive Journey As with all investments, Digitap also has its own risks and scenarios that every investor should consider. However, according to experts, the overall outlook is positive, as Digitap brings utility that can go far beyond crypto, reaching global financial markets. This is all because Digitap offers attractive services/products to both crypto and non-crypto users. With this in mind, their most bullish scenario involves Digitap reaching unprecedented adoption in 2026, possibly even rising to the top 5 ranks by them. In this case, they say that $TAP’s price could potentially rise by more than 100x, making $TAP one of the most promising altcoins to buy right now. Their base case involves Digitap seeing its roadmap through, with significant adoption from both crypto and non-crypto users. This scenario points to a possible 50x-75x rise for the $TAP price in 2026, as currently, the price is extremely low and has massive room for growth. As for their bear case, they still see Digitap gaining adoption and traction, just not as much as would be expected by a project with such utility. Still, even in the bear case, they say that $TAP’s price could potentially still rise by 10x-15x from here, outperforming SUI and BlockchainFX as it does. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Why Digitap Demands Attention Experts don’t simply see Digitap as a newcomer that can do amazing numbers after its launch and the hype around it. Instead, they view it as a project that can transform how people manage their finances forever, which is why they believe that $TAP could become a household name in global finance in the coming years. And now, since $TAP is still in its crypto presale phase, their attention is focused there.

The update was announced on Friday by Kuo Zhang, who runs Alibaba.com, and who told CNBC the team plans to use AI systems and tokenized money to speed up global trade across the company’s marketplace. He said the plan may include work with JPMorgan, one of Alibaba’s existing banking partners. Alibaba’s B2B arm , which made more than $3 billion in the last fiscal year, lets companies source goods from suppliers around the world. Zhang said the group is rolling out a new subscription tool called AI Mode, a system that helps buyers compare suppliers based on price, logistics, and production ability. He said the move comes at a time when more searches on the platform are being done with AI tools, and the division now wants to push deeper into that shift to increase efficiency on the platform. AI Mode adds new subscription income and expands supplier reach Zhang told CNBC the B2B team feels pressure to rebuild global trade workflows with AI and said the company sees the space entering what he called a “paradigm shift” for B2B commerce. The B2B arm isn’t as big as the domestic e‑commerce or cloud divisions, but it is one of the fastest-growing parts of Alibaba. The team earns money from marketing and cross‑border trade services, and it now wants AI Mode to create a new subscription revenue stream. He said the team may charge $20 per month or $99 per year, though the pricing is not final. The original goal of Alibaba when Jack Ma and his co‑founders launched the company in 1999 was to connect Chinese sellers to global buyers. Zhang said the supplier base today is much larger, with active suppliers worldwide up 50% between March and October compared with the same stretch last year. He said the team is investing more in expanding that supplier pool because “there are a lot of good products worldwide that can contribute to the global supply chain.” Alibaba runs tokenized USD/EUR payments and prepares ‘agentic pay’ Zhang told CNBC the team will launch a new tool called agentic pay in December. It will let the company’s AI auto‑generate contracts between buyers and suppliers by using the conversations they’ve already had over messaging. Today, many of those documents are written offline and uploaded later, but the new tool will let both parties confirm the AI‑generated version directly on Alibaba.com before moving forward. The B2B division serves buyers and suppliers in different countries, which means payments move across several banks and currencies. Zhang said this causes delays and adds cost because settlement times can stretch for days. To address that, he said the company will use tokenization, which he described as a digital form of money backed by fiat on a bank’s balance sheet. He said tokenized deposits are different from stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat but usually issued by non‑banks and backed by assets like bonds or fiat reserves. Zhang said Alibaba.com plans to use tokenized euros and U.S. dollars so payments do not pass through multiple intermediaries. He explained that when buyers in the U.S. or Europe pay in euros or dollars, the payment will move through tokenization and blockchain tech so money can reach places like Hong Kong, Singapore, or China at the same time without the slower routes common in cross‑border settlement. He said the team will work with JPMorgan, which launched JPMD this year, a token used for B2B payments in global trade. Zhang also told CNBC the company will “evaluate” the use of stablecoins later, after it starts using tokenized money transfers for global payments.

The Bitwise XRP ETF could be the next cryptocurrency fund to hit the markets, potentially revolutionizing how investors access XRP. This development comes at a crucial time when regulatory pathways are opening up for faster crypto ETF approvals. Why is the Bitwise XRP ETF Generating So Much Buzz? Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas recently revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF appears positioned to become the next cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund listing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has introduced guidelines encouraging the use of the 8(a) procedure. This method allows products to become effective automatically after a specific period without formal SEC approval. Consequently, crypto ETF issuers who haven’t used this approach before now have a golden opportunity to secure faster approvals. How Does the 8(a) Procedure Benefit Crypto ETFs? The 8(a) procedure represents a significant shift in how cryptocurrency ETFs might gain approval. This non-standard listing method could dramatically speed up the process for the Bitwise XRP ETF and similar products. Here are the key benefits: Automatic effectiveness after designated waiting period Reduced regulatory hurdles Faster market access for investors Clearer pathway for future crypto ETFs What Makes the Bitwise XRP ETF Different? Unlike traditional ETF approval processes that involve extensive SEC review, the Bitwise XRP ETF could benefit from this streamlined approach. The SEC’s new guidance specifically addresses backlog issues from government shutdowns. Therefore, Bitwise and other crypto ETF issuers can now leverage this method to accelerate their listing timelines. This development signals growing regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency investment products. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The potential approval of the Bitwise XRP ETF through the 8(a) procedure could transform cryptocurrency investing. Investors would gain: Regulated exposure to XRP Traditional brokerage account access Enhanced security and transparency Simplified tax reporting Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto ETFs The prediction about the Bitwise XRP ETF represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption. As regulatory pathways evolve, investors stand to benefit from increased access and legitimacy. The combination of expert predictions and favorable SEC procedures creates an optimistic outlook for crypto ETF enthusiasts. This development could pave the way for broader institutional acceptance and mainstream cryptocurrency investment opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 8(a) procedure for ETF approval? The 8(a) procedure is a non-standard listing method that allows investment products to become effective automatically after a set period without undergoing formal SEC approval processes. When might the Bitwise XRP ETF launch? While no official timeline exists, analysts suggest it could be among the next crypto ETFs to launch if it utilizes the 8(a) procedure for faster approval. How does this affect XRP investors? An approved Bitwise XRP ETF would provide regulated, accessible exposure to XRP through traditional investment accounts, potentially increasing institutional participation. Are there risks with the 8(a) procedure? While faster, this procedure still requires issuers to meet all regulatory requirements, ensuring investor protection remains intact. Could other crypto ETFs use this method? Yes, the SEC’s guidance applies to all eligible ETF issuers facing backlog issues, potentially benefiting multiple cryptocurrency ETF applications. How reliable are these predictions? Bloomberg ETF analysts have strong track records, but final approval depends on regulatory decisions and market conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

54391184,628251,1763126938,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Perché Bitcoin Hyper è uno dei presale crypto più discussi del 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/perche-bitcoin-hyper-e-uno-dei-presale-crypto-piu-discussi-del-2025/,"Bitcoinist descrive Bitcoin Hyper (token HYPER) come una delle presale più rilevanti nel panorama crypto del 2025, grazie al suo progetto di Layer 2 su Bitcoin. L’idea alla base è offrire una rete più veloce e programmabile (dApps, staking, trasferimenti) pur continuando a usare Bitcoin come livello di “settlement”, combinando sicurezza e scalabilità. L’architettura tecnica di Bitcoin Hyper Secondo le specifiche, Bitcoin Hyper permette di depositare BTC in un indirizzo osservato, dopodiché un contratto su Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) verifica i relativi header o proof. Questo processo porta alla creazione dell’equivalente tokenizzato su Hyper, che può essere usato nella rete L2 per transazioni rapide, staking, scambi e applicazioni decentrate. Periodicamente, le transazioni vengono “ancorate” indietro su Bitcoin usando prove ZK (zero-knowledge), per garantire che il token L2 resti collegato al valore reale di BTC su L1. Grazie a questo modello, il progetto punta a combinare l’ affidabilità di Bitcoin con la velocità di altre blockchain più moderne, rendendo la rete adatta anche a pagamenti quotidiani e casi d’uso DeFi. Raccolta fondi e struttura della prevendita Durante la presale, Bitcoin Hyper ha raccolto cifre significative , con investitori che sembrano credere nella visione del progetto. I token HYPER sono offerti a un prezzo base, e chi partecipa può anche scegliere di mettere in staking parte dei suoi token durante la fase di presale. Questo staking offre rendimenti relativamente elevati, il che può risultare attraente per chi è disposto a bloccare risorse in vista del lancio. Secondo l’analisi originale, l’operazione di presale non è guidata solo da hype: la domanda deriva anche da un interesse concreto per infrastrutture che migliorino l’esperienza d’uso di BTC e ne espandano le funzionalità. Questo mix di visione tecnica e appello retail spiega, secondo l’articolo, perché molti osservatori considerino Hyper una scommessa “infrastrutturale” piuttosto che una semplice altcoin speculativa. Opportunità e punti di forza Uno dei principali vantaggi di Bitcoin Hyper è la possibilità di utilizzare Bitcoin in modo più versatile: non solo come riserva di valore, ma per costruire applicazioni, movimentare fondi rapidamente e partecipare alla finanza decentralizzata. Se il progetto dovesse effettivamente realizzare bridge sicuri, esecuzione rapida su L2 e un ecosistema funzionante, potrebbe attirare sviluppatori interessati a creare dApp “Bitcoin-native” e utenti che vogliono trasferire o usare BTC più agilmente. Inoltre, il fatto che parte del capitale arrivi da investitori retail e istituzionali suggerisce che il progetto non è visto solo come un gioco speculativo, ma come qualcosa con potenziale a lungo termine. Rischi da considerare Tuttavia, non mancano le incognite. Il successo di Bitcoin Hyper dipende fortemente dall’esecuzione tecnica: è necessario che il bridge funzioni in modo sicuro, che le validazioni ZK siano affidabili e che la rete L2 sia stabile e performante. Se qualcosa dovesse andare storto (bug, costi elevati, problemi di sicurezza), la proposta perderebbe molto del suo valore “pratico”. Inoltre, il modello di staking e yield alto può nascondere rischi: rendimenti elevati nei progetti in presale non sono mai garantiti dopo il lancio, e possono diminuire man mano che la piattaforma matura o se non viene sostenuta da reale utilizzo o liquidità. Infine, il fatto che si tratti ancora di un progetto L2 su Bitcoin implica una forte dipendenza dallo sviluppo futuro di entrambi gli strati: il fallimento su uno dei due fronti potrebbe compromettere l’intera proposta. Vai a Bitcoin Hyper Conclusione Bitcoin Hyper è presentato come un progetto ambizioso che cerca di risolvere alcune delle limitazioni storiche di Bitcoin: lentezza, costi alti e mancanza di programmabilità. La sua prevendita ha attirato interesse grazie a un modello che combina tecnologia avanzata con un’idea di lungo periodo, non solo speculazione. Detto questo, è importante guardare al progetto con realismo: se la rete funziona come descritto, potrebbe avere un impatto significativo; ma gli ostacoli tecnici e i rischi restano. Chi è interessato dovrebbe fare la propria due diligence , valutare sia il potenziale che i rischi, e non considerarlo un “colpo sicuro”.",Uncategorized|Altcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ZK|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 13:28:58

The ruling came after the companies claimed they lost business because of how the search giant ran its operations. The Berlin Regional Court made the decision on Thursday evening, but only made it public Friday morning. Idealo, owned by Axel Springer SE, will get €374 million, along with €91 million in extra payments for interest. The company had asked for €3.3 billion. In the second case, Producto GmbH will receive €89.7 million plus €17.7 million in interest, though it wanted €290 million. These court cases go back to a 2017 ruling from the European Commission . That year, regulators hit Google with a €2.4 billion fine for breaking competition rules. Officials said the company used its powerful position in search to push its own shopping service ahead of rivals. The commission’s decision opened the door for companies to file their own lawsuits seeking money for damages. These cases sat in limbo for years while Google fought the EU fine, according to Bloomberg. Last year, a court backed up the original finding that Google broke antitrust laws. This means companies in Europe no longer need to prove wrongdoing themselves when they go to court. Google offers ad tech changes to settle separate EU case Today, Google said it would make changes to its advertising technology to resolve another EU complaint. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the company faces a nearly €3 billion fine in that case, but hopes its proposed fixes will settle the matter without having to split up parts of its business. Google said through a blog post that it would let publishers set their own minimum prices when people bid for ad space on its Ad Manager platform. The company also promised to make its ad technology work better with other systems, giving publishers and advertisers more options. Even with these proposed changes, Google said it still thinks the European Commission got it wrong in its September ruling and plans to fight the decision. EU officials claimed the Alphabet unit gave unfair advantages to its own ad services and demanded the company stop these practices. Record fines continue to mount against tech giant Teresa Ribera, who leads competition enforcement for the EU, suggested Google might need to sell off some parts of its advertising business to truly fix the problems. This idea does not go as far as what her predecessor Margrethe Vestager wanted, but Google still sees it as too extreme. The €2.95 billion fine for the ad tech case ranks as one of Brussels’ biggest punishments. It stands as the second-largest penalty ever given to Google by the EU for abusing its market power. The company previously paid €4.13 billion over its Android mobile system and €2.42 billion for hurting shopping search competitors. Another €1.49 billion fine related to AdSense was thrown out last year.

With its current price around $0.18, the idea of a 10×–15× return is back on the table, fueled by renewed meme-coin enthusiasm, social chatter, and upwards momentum in broader markets. Yet, even as DOGE pushes for another run, there’s a more advanced story unfolding behind the scenes: Ozak AI , an AI-blockchain hybrid with a forecasted 100× move, is quietly becoming the project to beat. The contrast between Dogecoin’s nostalgic meme power and Ozak AI’s forward-looking intelligence narrative highlights the evolving nature of this market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin currently trades at approximately $0.18. Technical indicators suggest key levels: resistance at $0.20, $0.24, and $0.30, while support zones hang around $0.16, $0.14, and $0.12. If DOGE reignites its social momentum, some analysts believe a move toward $2.50–$3.00 is possible in the next phase of a bullish run—a 10×–15× move from here. Indeed, recent reports reflect meme coin sentiment flying high, with Dogecoin again capturing headlines around celebrity endorsements and platform integrations. However, despite its cultural strength and liquidity, Dogecoin faces key structural limitations. Its utility remains largely transactional and sentiment-driven rather than technology-driven. Analysts caution that while DOGE may rally, the upside may be capped by its large market cap and lack of innovation compared to next-gen projects. Ozak AI: The 100× Asymmetrical Opportunity Enter Ozak AI—a project that blends artificial intelligence, predictive analytics and blockchain automation into a single ecosystem. Already in OZ presale phase, Ozak AI has raised over $4.5 million and sold more than 1 billion OZ tokens. Its narrative centers not on meme hype, but on intelligent decentralization: AI-driven smart agents that can network, learn and act across chains. Because Ozak AI is still early, investors perceive the potential for exponential returns. While DOGE chases 10×–15×, Ozak AI is being positioned by analysts for 100× or more—the kind of upside that turns early bets into life-changing gains. Indeed, a recent report framed DOGE’s possible 10×–15× run in contrast to Ozak AI’s utility-backed 100× thesis. The appeal is clear: combining a low entry point with a strong technological foundation and a growth path in a sector (AI + blockchain) that’s expected to dominate the next wave of crypto innovation. Why Dogecoin May Rally—and Why Ozak AI Could Outpace It Dogecoin’s case is compelling: brand recognition, massive community engagement, and the possibility of platform integrations or renewed meme-cycle fuel. If sentiment reignites, DOGE could certainly see a strong multiple. But here's the catch: as Dogecoin matures, its market cap grows, and the path to 100× becomes increasingly unrealistic. That’s where Ozak AI’s narrative stands out: early-stage, technology-driven, adjacency to the AI boom, and still subject to expansion rather than saturation. In short: Dogecoin may rally 10×–15×, and that is no small feat. Yet Ozak AI could deliver 100×+, redefining what success looks like in 2025 and beyond. The Smart-Money Shift As the market rotates from pure hype into utility and innovation, smart investors are likely reallocating: taking profits from established meme names like DOGE and deploying into the early presales of projects like Ozak AI. This rotation reflects a broader maturation of crypto—from fun speculative plays to technology-led growth stories. In this cycle, Dogecoin might steal the short-term spotlight. Ozak AI, however, may define the next decade of crypto opportunity.

Speaking to CoinDesk, Mike Novogratz said that XRP has achieved something truly complex in the cryptocurrency world. Stating that XRP has become a real money after a long struggle, Novogratz said that XRP has defied expectations, transformed its narrative and built a community strong enough to turn a token into a functional monetary asset. Stating that XRP has achieved something very rare, the famous CEO said that only a few tokens have crossed the threshold of becoming money so far. “How do you turn something from a token into money? It's a really complex and difficult thing. “There have only been a few people who have done this before. XRP has done it too, and it's surprised everyone.” Noting that Galaxy Digital remains a significant shareholder in Ripple, Novogratz admitted that he once questioned XRP's decentralization, structure, and purpose. Novogratz admitted that he misjudged XRP's survival, praising the strength and community support of Ripple and XRP. He added that XRP has proven its strength and resilience.

The firm said the authorization makes it one of the first DeFi innovators in Europe to operate under the new regulatory framework.

Cash to DeFi will soon be a frictionless experience across the Aave ecosystem. pic.twitter.com/5rgQ4Orny4 — Aave (@aave) November 13, 2025 The crypto platform stated that MiCAR regulation allows Push to provide regulated and secure on- and off-ramping of stablecoins at no cost. The initiative goes against fintech companies and centralized exchanges that typically charge notable spreads or processing fees. Aave added that the authorization will enable users to move easily between euros and digital assets under a new standard for consumer protection and transparency. The firm stated that it selected Ireland as the anchor for its European Economic Area (EEA) operations. Aave also emphasized that the Aave Protocol remains permissionless and decentralized, operating globally on public blockchains. The firm also confirmed that the MiCA authorization applies only to its regulated service offering, provided by Push for fee-free stablecoin on-and-off ramping. On-chain data revealed that Aave’s ecosystem continues to generate significant activity, processing over $542 million in volume within the past 24 hours. Users on the network also currently hold more than $22.8 billion in borrowed assets across its lending protocol. Aave’s initiative comes as stablecoins and tokenized digital assets gain more mainstream traction. On-chain data indicate that the global stablecoin supply already exceeded $300 billion by 2025. At the time of publication, the total stablecoin supply had reached $305 billion. Tether’s USDT accounted for the largest share of stablecoin supply, with around $184 billion, while Circle’s USDC followed with $75 billion. BOE’s Breeden warns stablecoin dilution risks damaging UK’s financial system Although Aave is championing a cost-free offramping of stablecoins, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) on Wednesday said the bloc’s existing rules already contain safeguards against risks posed by stablecoins. The remarks followed the European Central Bank’s warning that stablecoins pose a threat to financial stability. The ESRB, chaired by ECB President Christine Lagarde, and the European Central Bank urged the European Union to ban the multi-issuance model. The initiative could alter the way global stablecoin issuers treat tokens in the EU, treating them as interchangeable with those outside the bloc. The ESRB argued that a rush by non-EU holders to redeem EU-issued tokens could amplify runs within the bloc. A spokesperson for the Paris-based European Banking Authority said the ESRB’s concerns reflect the inherent risks posed by potential large withdrawal requests. The spokesperson said the severity of the risks depends on a token’s business model and scale. The EBA revealed that it’s awaiting clarification from Brussels on whether multi-issuance is allowed under the EU’s MiCA. Stablecoin issuers acknowledged that they hold dollar-based reserves to enable redemptions. “From a liquidity point of view, issuers need to hold an amount of liquid assets to meet potential redemption requests. And this should work at a global level.” -Luis del Olmo, Senior Expert at the European Banking Authority. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden also warned that further diluting rules for stablecoins risked endangering financial stability. She also believes it will cause a credit crunch, adding that the UK needs a different approach to the U.S. Sarah’s remarks followed the BOE’s Monday report on new rules for systemic stablecoins used for payments. The central bank has set a limit of £20,000 ($26,840) per person for stablecoin holdings, while stablecoin issuers are required to hold 40% of the assets backing the tokens with the central bank as collateral for remuneration.

In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $16.64 to a minimum of $14.31. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $50.87 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong Polkadot protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $2.82 Market Cap $4.27B Trading Volume $233.48M Circulating Supply 1.62B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.07 24-hour Low $2.77 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 13.02% 50-Day SMA $ 3.55 14-Day RSI 37.49 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 3.94 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces renewed selling pressure after failing to hold above $3 Sellers remain in control as DOT continues to fail at the $2.95–$3.00 resistance zone. Repeated tests of $2.80 show weakening support and rising downside risk. Tight ranges and shallow rebounds signal bearish compression and limited buyer strength. On November 14, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) trades around $2.82, marking a 5.65% decline over the past 24 hours. The asset moved between a low of $2.77 and a high of $3.03 during the session, showing a clear struggle to maintain momentum after early attempts to push above the $3.00 mark failed. The 24-hour chart reflected consistent selling pressure, with a notable slide from the previous peak near $2.999 that set the tone for the day’s downward movement. Polkadot daily price chart: DOT faces resistance near $2.95, indicating continued downtrend DOT’s daily chart showed steady downward momentum, with sellers dominating after the token failed to sustain levels above $2.95. The market structure leaned bearish as price action dipped repeatedly toward the $2.80 region, creating pressure on support levels that were previously stable. The decline from the $3.00 zone highlighted the market’s inability to break through resistance, reflecting hesitation among buyers. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView The price consistently faced rejection around $2.90–$2.95, forming a tightening compression that increased the likelihood of further downward tests. The token’s inability to reclaim upward momentum kept sentiment neutral to bearish for the short term. Continued pressure around the $2.80 mark indicated that buyers needed stronger volume to stabilize the trend. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT gradually declines as selling pressure intensifies On the 4-hour chart, DOT showed repeated dips toward $2.80 followed by shallow rebounds that failed to build momentum. The chart displayed a weak recovery structure, with each bounce capped by stiff resistance near $2.85. Overall, the range remained narrow, reflecting indecision but leaning toward bearish continuation. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Price movement over the last few sessions showed frequent wicks below $2.80, indicating active attempts to defend support but without sustained strength. The inability to break past the $2.87–$2.90 area kept DOT in a constrained trading zone, signaling that buyers lacked the conviction to push higher.

Price struggled between $2.77 and $3.03, with repeated rejections near $2.95–$3.00 signaling weak buyer momentum. The daily chart shows dips toward $2.80, creating pressure on support, while tight ranges and shallow rebounds reflect bearish compression. On the 4-hour chart, repeated tests of $2.80 with weak rebounds capped near $2.85 indicate fragile support. Overall, DOT remains under pressure, with a break below $2.80 likely to trigger further declines, while recovery above $2.95–$3.00 is needed to regain bullish momentum. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot (DOT) is under renewed selling pressure after failing to hold above $3.00, trading around $2.82 on November 14, 2025, down 5.65% in 24 hours. Price repeatedly rejected the $2.95–$3.00 resistance zone and dipped toward $2.80, highlighting weakening support and limited buyer strength. The daily chart shows bearish momentum with tight ranges and shallow rebounds, while the 4-hour chart confirms fragile support and weak recovery attempts capped near $2.85. Overall, DOT remains under short-term pressure, and a break below $2.80 could trigger further declines, whereas a recovery above $2.95–$3.00 would be needed to restore bullish sentiment. As an investment, DOT may carry higher short-term risk due to persistent downward pressure, making it more suitable for traders who can tolerate volatility rather than conservative long-term holders. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is down today due to renewed selling pressure after failing to hold above the $3.00 resistance level. Repeated rejections near $2.95–$3.00 and frequent dips toward $2.80 indicate weakening support and limited buying strength. Tight trading ranges, shallow rebounds, and persistent bearish momentum on both the daily and 4-hour charts show that sellers remain in control. Short-term market sentiment leans bearish, with DOT struggling to regain upward momentum, keeping the token under pressure and contributing to today’s decline. Recent news Banxa, a global crypto infrastructure provider, has integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem to offer regulated fiat-to-crypto on and off-ramps, compliance solutions, and stablecoin access. This allows developers on Polkadot to onboard users with over 30 fiat currencies, including USD and EUR, and access stablecoins like USDC and USDT, as well as DOT. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2027, with expectations for next week also showing positive trends. Will Polkadot reach $40? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $40 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years.

Squire noted that trading would begin at 9:30 AM ET on November 13 and described the moment as one where “the ignition switch has been flipped.” His post signaled how quickly the ETF is gaining visibility across major trading platforms, and Robinhood’s inclusion reflects a widening path for investors who prefer regulated channels for digital asset exposure. The listing adds to the early momentum behind XRPC and gives retail participants an additional venue to access the fund from the first session of formal trading. BREAKING NEWS Robinhood has officially listed the Canary Capital Spot XRP ETF. Trading kicks off at 9:30 AM ET / 6:30 AM PT. The ignition switch has been flipped. Let it rip! pic.twitter.com/83bH3c4z9i — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) November 13, 2025 The Steps That Enabled the Launch The ETF reached this point through a sequence of regulatory actions that shaped its launch timeline. Canary Capital first filed its S1 registration statement with language that allowed the firm to delay its effective date, but subsequently removed this amendment . By eliminating that clause, Canary placed the registration on a definitive path toward automatic effectiveness, which initiates 20 days unless the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intervenes. Market data from the first day showed strong volume, and interest from major brokerages developed quickly. Robinhood’s decision to list the ETF shortly after its debut represents another step in building liquidity and recognition for XRPC in its early stages. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Spot Crypto ETFs Attract Investors Spot cryptocurrency ETFs appeal to investors who want exposure to digital assets without managing wallet security, private keys, or exchange accounts. A regulated fund structure offers defined reporting standards, audited custodial practices, and easier integration with existing brokerage accounts. These features have already made spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs popular among both retail and institutional users who prefer compliance-oriented investment tools. A spot XRP ETF builds on that same logic. With more XRP ETFs on the horizon , traditional investors, retirement accounts, and institutions can now engage with XRP while remaining inside their established operational frameworks. Potential Benefits for XRP ETF demand can influence liquidity conditions for the underlying asset. As new channels list XRPC, many other investors can buy XRP through the ETF structure. Increased accessibility can improve market depth and visibility. For XRP, which already occupies a defined role in payment utility discussions, the ETF creates a regulated on-ramp that may attract participants who previously avoided direct token transactions.

However, the reality is quite different and painful as BTC just plummeted to a six-month low and there’s no bottom in sight, at least for now. But let’s rewind to the end of the previous week, when BTC had just dipped below the crucial $100,000 line but had managed to defend it. In fact, it recovered to around $102,000 during the weekend and jumped to $104,000 on Sunday afternoon and $107,000 on Monday after US President Trump promised $2,000 tariff checks to non-high-income Americans and hinted that the longest government shutdown would come to an end soon. That relief rally was short-lived, and BTC quickly dropped by several grand. Its next bounce came on Thursday morning when the government reopening became official after the POTUS signed the necessary papers. BTC peaked at $104,000, but that resistance turned out to be too strong once again. The subsequent rejection was a lot more violent than the previous ones. Not only did bitcoin dump below $100,000, but it kept plunging on Friday to its lowest levels since May at $94,500 (as of now). This meant that the asset has lost more than $12,000 since the Monday peak of $107,000. The overall mood is bearish, with analysts declaring the end of the bull market and the subsequent beginning of a more profound bear cycle. The weekly losses for BTC stand at almost 5%, for ETH are more than 4%, while SOL is down by over 10%. Interestingly, LTC, XMR, WLFI, and UNI are well in the green, and so is XRP from the larger caps. Market Data Market Cap: $3.3T | 24H Vol: $280B | BTC Dominance: 57.4% BTC: $94,700 (-4.8%) | ETH: $3,074 (-4.2%) | XRP: $2.26 (+4.4%) This Week’s Crypto Headlines You Can’t Miss Bitcoin’s (BTC) Famous 4-Year Cycle May Finally Be Crumbling . Amid the ongoing calamity and the different state of the bull market that started last year, crypto analysts are adamant that the typical 4-year cycle is over and there’s a new, more sophisticated and mature phase for BTC. Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) Launch Successful: Here’s What Happened on Day 1 . After numerous delays and uncertainty, the first spot XRP ETF with 100% exposure to Ripple’s asset finally went live for trading on Thursday after the last hurdle was bypassed by the Nasdaq’s official listing notice on Wednesday. Canary’s XRPC broke the previous SOL record for the launch day. Bitcoin Whales and Miners Are Moving Massive Sums: What Does This Mean for BTC’s Price? One of the first warning signs this week came after reports emerged that BTC whales and miners had moved large portions of the asset to exchanges, with the likely intention to sell. Such transfers are typically followed by market crashes. BTC ‘Miner Heartbeat’ Metric Shows Bitcoin Network Still Strong . With prices falling, investors capitulating, and sentiment souring, on-chain data indicate that Bitcoin’s network fundamentals remain as strong as they were during the summer rally, as evidenced by the “Hash Rate Momentum Score.” IRS Introduces Safe Harbor Allowing Tax-Free Staking for Crypto ETPs . The US Treasury and IRS outlined a new safe harbor that will allow crypto ETFs to stake digital assets without paying extra tax. UNI Token Soars 35% Following Fee Switch Proposal . UNI’s market-wide correction defiance and double-digit weekly surge were primarily prompted by the announcement from Uniswap’s founder, Hayden Adams, stating that the exchange will introduce a sweeping governance proposal, which introduced a long-anticipated fee switch that would redirect a portion of trading fees toward burning UNI tokens.

Its main “business” is bitcoin treasury—i.e., it buys and holds bitcoin. But that’s just the start. Its “intelligent leverage” program, opportunistic capital raises, and coin purchases help the company outperform bitcoin prices. MSTR now trades at a premium to the value of its bitcoin, but a narrower premium than in the recent past. That’s OK. Intelligent leverage deserves some sort of premium. Beyond that, MSTR is raising capital through various preferred issues, each of which is an interesting income vehicle. I’m neutral on MSTR but bullish on three of the preferred issues. While I don’t see bitcoin crashing, as skeptics fear, MSTR and its suite of preferred issues does come with some odd risks around the theoretical sustainability of its operations. Once upon a time, there was a little business information software company called MicroStrategy. It launched in 1989. It went public in 1998, in time for the dot-com bubble and burst. Then, an accounting controversy in 2000 really sent it into a tailspin. The SEC got into the act. Some restructuring followed. And the company limped along uneventfully—until 2011. That’s when it adapted its software to the cloud. Then, in February 2020, it introduced a major new version of its offering. Maybe the company would finally start to become a serious player in its market. But alas, that was not to be. It’s current market share remains mired at a measly 1.29%. (The leader, Tableau Software, has a 17.76% share.) But that’s OK. Co-founder Michael Saylor had other, much bigger, ideas. It was to be about bitcoin. The software business still exists. But the investment case for the company, having been renamed Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), is now tied to its… Bold New Trails in Corporate Treasury My initial 12/20/24 MSTR report quoted portions of the company’s 2021 10K (page 10) explaining its pivot to a new bitcoin-focused set of policies. The corporate treasury would consist of the usual holdings of cash and cash equivalents. But it would also include bitcoin. And this would be its “primary treasury reserve asset on an ongoing basis.” In addition, the company adopted… in conjunction with our Treasury Reserve Policy, a business strategy of purchasing bitcoin, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. **** We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoins in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes. To give you a sense of how serious this new vision is, take a look at how MSTR’s bitcoin treasury compares to treasuries of other major companies. MSTR IR So here we are—goodbye software (not in fact, but as an investment theme). And hello, Bitcoin. The Appeal of Bitcoin At one time, I’d have classified anything related to bitcoin (or crypto) as scary. And I understand many still do. My first reaction to bitcoin was to think of it as a collectible. How different is that from non-industrial demand for gold or silver? (And as I explained in my 12/20/24 writeup , there is a fixed maximum to the number of possible coins. After 21 million are issued, there will be no more. So, there’ll eventually be a built-in scarcity. That’s not so with precious metals.) As a form of money, I understand how this can be a hard pill to swallow. Government-issued (fiat) currency is so deeply ingrained in our sensibilities, it’s hard to take anything else seriously. But the definition of currency, or money, is and always has been much broader than that. In my 5/9/25 MSTR writeup , I quoted “ Everyday Economics ,” a booklet published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, as having said: Money is anything that is widely accepted as a form of payment for goods and services or repayment of debts. In the limited economies of POW camps, cigarettes became money as soon as they became the accepted form of payment for rations that prisoners were exchanging. (Emphasis supplied.) Bitcoin clearly is part of “anything.” The only open question is “widely accepted.” Today, its acceptance as a regular medium of exchange remains very limited. But the evolution of the blockchain (where coin ownership and transactions are verified and stored) is helping it gain ground. See generally, my 6/28/24 article on Coinbase ( COIN ). And it’s gaining acceptance in the political, financial, and corporate communities. Starting with politics, the Trump Administration brought a crypto-friendly climate to Washington. MSTR IR This is a big deal. Regulatory hostility has diminished and is turning more supportive. The July 2025 GENIUS Act boosts the legitimacy of stablecoins , an important link between crypto/blockchain and fiat currency. Again, see my 6/28/24 article on Coinbase for more on this. Meanwhile, Wall Street is taking bitcoin more seriously. MSTR IR MSTR IR So, too, are major banks. MSTR IR And business community is beginning to embrace bitcoin. MSTR IR Even Standard & Poor’s is adding an aura of legitimacy. It already added some crypto-friendly businesses to its flagship S&P 500 index. MSTR IR MSTR isn’t included—yet. But it may happen in the future. Bitcoin has had and will continue to have pricing ups and downs. But at this point, it’s hard to suggest it’ll become worthless, as early skeptics (once including me) feared. Most likely, bitcoin will trade like a regular asset. Consider… Demand is rising due to its increasing legitimacy. Meanwhile, supply will be limited . There’s a programmatic limit to the number of coins that can be created. After 21 million coins have been created, no new ones will ever be issued. So despite periodic price slumps and corrections, I believe there will be a general upward bias. An Extra Powerful Asset Play - Intelligent Leverage Assuming, as I do, that bitcoin is a bona fide asset class, one might expect MSTR stock to be valued based on the worth of the company’s bitcoin holdings. But there was always more to it than just that. If one wants to simply play the ups and downs of bitcoin pricing, there are vehicles other than MSTR for that. There’s bitcoin itself. And for those who don’t want to deal with the mechanics of actually owning coins, there are ETFs that invest in it. See, for example, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). MSTR’s goal is to have its stock (market cap) outperform bitcoin prices. It would do that through the manner in which it raises capital to finance its purchase of new coins. Choosing market conditions under which it issues new debt and/or equity would be one factor. The other would be the timing of bitcoin purchases. This strategy has, so far, worked out magnificently. Even though bitcoin’s price has struggled recently, we see that percent changes in the value of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings dramatically outstripped percent changes in the company’s diluted shares and its market capitalization. Analyst Compilation based on MSTR data and market data from Yahoo.com As tempting as it is to value MSTR stock based on the per-share value of the bitcoin it owns, the above chart confirms we should not thusly limit our computations. Clearly, the company’s “intelligent leverage” is worth something. Thinking this way would actually make for a fairly typical approach to equity valuation. After all, how many stocks today trade at book value! Typically, companies trade at premiums to book based on expectations that management will do things to make it grow. Similarly, it’s reasonable to assume that management’s use of intelligent leverage will enhance the worth of the company’s bitcoin position. So MSTR can legitimately trade at a premium to the current value of its bitcoin holdings. The harder question is how much of a premium MSTR deserves. Below is a historical summary of the stock’s premium. Analyst compilation based on MSTR data and market data from Yahoo.com With stocks, bonds, and real estate, there are theories and models we can use to assess, and argue about, valuation. Bitcoin is like precious metals in the sense that we don’t have objective valuation approaches. With a bitcoin-based asset play like MSTR, the best we can do is note that the stock’s premium to asset value is now low relative to past highs. (It would be nice if it could get back to the discount we saw in 2022. But based on the market’s increased appreciation of intelligent leverage, a discount may no longer be in the cards.) An Increasingly Active MSTR Treasury Buying and holding bitcoin is half the story. The other half is getting capital to finance the purchases. Capital raising at MSTR is much more compelling than at other companies. The typical company can generate capital internally—through profit-making business operations and/or through income produced by non-operating assets. MSTR has neither internal source. It must raise all of its capital externally. Issuance of new common equity is an obvious part of the package. That’s the core of the intelligent leverage strategy discussed above. Debt has been another part of the capital-raising strategy. Theoretically, this introduces a scary element. Debt comes with an interest-expense obligation. But attaching an equity-conversion feature to the debt—as MSTR did when it borrowed—lets it dramatically slash its interest obligation. Most of MSTR’s convertible debt calls for interest at less than 1%. Some are zero-coupon issues. In these cases, borrowers expect to get all of their return through equity conversion. But starting in January 2025, MSTR has been shifting gears. On the 10/31/25 analyst call , CEO Fong Lee discussed the company’s intent to allow its debt to vanish by 2029 through equity conversion. Instead, going forward, MSTR will rely on preferred equity financing. (Unlike with debt, skipping a preferred dividend does not constitute a default.) So far this year, the company has completed a variety of preferred issues: Strategy 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock ( STRK ) Strategy 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock ( STRF ) Strategy 9% Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock ( STRC ) Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ) Here’s a comparison of market characteristics. Analyst compilation based on data from MSTE and information from issue SEC Registration documents If you haven’t guessed from looking at the table—and I wouldn’t blame you if you haven't—MSTR appears to offer one-stop shopping for a range of income-investor styles. Think of this as a menu with dishes that appeal to different tastes. Now, there are some things on the table that might seem odd. For starters, you don’t typically think of preferred stock as having a duration. That’s an important metric for fixed-income strategists, given how it measures bond volatility. But bonds have an important feature preferred shares lack—maturity dates. Those are critical to calculating duration. But for preferred, there is a theoretical mathematical formulation that produces a duration for non-maturing preferred stock. It’s the Macaulay formula . This is (1+r)/r, where r is the yield or discount rate. That formula is easy to implement. But frankly, looking at its derivation gives me a migraine. Asset coverage is another challenging area. Strictly speaking, all of MSTR’s bitcoin is unencumbered. But the table shows something MSTR calls BTC Rating. Slide 90 of MSTR’s latest earnings presentation defines this as… the ratio of our Bitcoin NAV and the sum of the notional values of the instruments being rated and all instruments that are senior to and, if any liabilities share an equal claim to our assets, such instruments with a stated maturity date sooner than or that may become due upon an exercise of a repurchase right at the option of the holder sooner than, the liability being rated. That’s a mouthful. Essentially, the BTC Rating compares the value of the bitcoin MSTR owns to the value of the preferred issue. And in each case, the figure is adjusted for the fact that each preferred ranks differently in seniority. So higher ratings mean more bitcoin coverage of the preferred obligations. As if this weren’t enough to contemplate, MSTR announced on 11/3/25 that it is issuing another 10% preferred issue, this one to be denominated in euros. Its ticker will be STRE. And the company plans more overseas offerings. MSTR IR This already makes for an intriguing set of investment choices. And the menu is slated to broaden. But all this also presents… Challenging Oddities and Important Risks (1) Long-Term Financing to Cover Ordinary Expenses? Back around 1975, while I was in law school, New York City was going through a major financial crisis. The professor in my Municipal Law class explained it as having been caused by the City’s having issued long-term bonds to cover ordinary operating expenses. Such bonds are supposed to be issued for major one-time projects, like bridges, highways, school construction, etc. Taking those lessons to the corporate sector, we presume long-term debt or issuance of new equity should relate to some sort of one-time capital-type project, or acquisition, or something like that. Even with emerging companies or startups (e.g., quantum computing), we accept the issuance of permanent capital in order to fund expenses relating to building a new business. But how comfortable would you be if an established company like Meta Platforms ( META ), Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), or Microsoft ( MSFT ) were to issue long-term debt or new equity in order to raise money to meet its next regular monthly payroll expenses? Speaking for myself, I’d panic. Stretching the example, how would you feel if, say, Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) or Altria ( MO ) issued preferred stock to raise money so it could pay its next quarterly common dividend or the next set of interest payments due on its long-term debt? Again, speaking for myself, I’d panic. I’m not saying this is exactly what MSTR is doing… Come to think of it, as I was deciding how to finish that previous sentence, I realized something. This is, indeed, exactly what MSTR is doing. Cash preferred dividend payments are being funded by the issuance of preferred stock! To be fair, MSTR is running a very different kind of business. And default risk here is minimal, more theoretical than real. Here’s a tally of MSTR’s annual interest and preferred dividend obligations as of its latest earnings presentation . MSTR IR Here is a summary of the company’s capital-raising activities MSTR IR Clearly, the company has been able to raise a heck of a lot more money than it needs to meet its interest and dividend obligations. (New York City in 1975 couldn’t have even fantasized about a money-in/money-out relationship like this!) And there is the unofficial asset backing. We saw in the valuation chart above that the market value of bitcoin held leaves interest and dividend obligations in the dust. And it looks as if it should get easier to raise capital going forward. S&P recently assigned a B- rating to MSTR. MSTR IR That’s high, but not the very top, in the “junk” range. (S&P prefers the word “ speculative .”) But as MSTR points out above, it is at least the first rating for a bitcoin treasury company. Also, even B- gives MSTR access to a bigger capital pool than was the case when it was unrated. MSTR IR (2) Bigger Plans Recall above reference to the planned euro-denominated preferred issues. That’s just the first non-U.S. planned issuance. Also, MSTR is working hard to expand awareness and distribution of its preferred issues. MSTR IR This is good in the sense that it enhances the company’s ability to keep raising capital. But it’s also concerning… (3) Understandability The harder MSTR works to issue and market preferred issues, the greater the probability that more of its preferred securities will wind up in accounts of people who don’t actually understand what all this is about. As more people own securities they don’t understand, the more I worry. I’ve seen the registration statements for the preferred issues. They’re fine. Everything that needs to be disclosed is disclosed. For investors who aren’t inclined to read everything, the summaries in the early pages, while hardly literary, communicate well. But I’ve been around in the investment field long enough to know what should happen often doesn’t. If things go wrong, I honestly cannot see any legal basis upon which disgruntled investors would be able to come after MSTR. But the court of public opinion runs on different rules. If things turn out such that enough people in the future wind up disappointed, MSTR and preferred securities are likely to suffer in price. And that would make it harder, or maybe even impossible, to execute the capital-raising portion of its business model. (4) Expiration Date? In pure logic, MSTR cannot persist perpetually. There’s a finite number of potential bitcoins. The possible supply is programmatically capped at 21 million. The world now has about 19.5 million coins. It sounds like we’re close to the end. But reductions in the amount awarded over time are stretching the time when we’ll hit 21 million out into the future. (See generally, here .) As of 10/26/25, MSTR owned 640,808 coins. That was 3.05% of the potential supply and 3.29% of the current supply. So we can’t really say MSTR is cornering a fixed-supply market right now. But if we project far enough into the future, that might wind up happening. That’s not a worry for today. But as MSTR and others continue to accumulate bitcoin to hold in treasury, we have to wonder how far this can go before liquidity concerns arise and compromise the market. Many see NYSE/NASDAQ stocks as far more worth owning than less liquid OTC Pink Sheet stocks. Might bitcoin evolve toward the latter scenario? But again, this is a theoretical, distant-future concern. It’s not a here-and-now worry. What To Do About MSTR Stock - The Core Investment Vehicle MSTR shares have been weak since my initial 12/20/24 writeup , when I said, “Hold.” Since then, the stock is down 37%, versus a 16% gain for the S&P 500. I upgraded to “Buy” on 5/8/25 given my increased understanding of bitcoin. But since then, the stock is down 44%, versus a 21% gain for the S&P 500. Obviously, those ratings aged poorly. During this time, Bitcoin has cooled off. Another factor in MSTR’s poor performance here has been the narrowing of the stock’s premium to the value of its bitcoin holdings. Also, I suspect a good deal of buying interest in the preferred shares might have absorbed funds that otherwise might have been invested in MSTR had the latter been less aggressive in creating a variety of income offerings. Finally, this situation has become a lot more complex than it was when I reviewed it in the past. Complexity does not help share prices. Here’s the MSTR share price. StockCharts.com This is a bad chart. I hate how the 10-day exponential moving average ((EMA)) is below and falling faster than the also weak 50-day EMA. Chaikin Money Flow ((CMF)) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO) give no solace. Both measure which party to trade is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators look terrible right now. When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong…” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. For now, I see MSTR as likely performing no better than the broader market. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating MSTR as a “Hold.” What To Do About the Preferred Issues - The Satellite Investment Vehicles Right now, I’m much more interested in the preferred issues. Maybe it’s my age. The idea of a good-yielding bitcoin play appeals to me. I get that there’s an eventual theoretical date as of which MSTR’s business model has to expire. And I don’t love the idea of permanent capital being issued to cover ongoing interest and dividend expenses. S&P has it right—This is a “junk bond” type credit. But I’m a former junk bond fund manager. (That was back in the mid-1980s heyday, when Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham ruled the field.) I know how to live with credits rated this way, and worse. I’ve seen a lot of bad things in the junk arena. And I’ve invested in things with coverages (interest back in the day or preferred dividends today) that were much more challenging than what we see here. And I’ve accepted those despite much lesser yields. For your convenience, here again, is the table I showed above summarizing the preferred issues. Analyst compilation based on data from MSTE and information from issue SEC Registration documents As to STRK Here’s a 1-year STRK-MSTR share price performance comparison. StockCharts.com STRK appears to be doing exactly what it’s supposed to do. It’s a good income vehicle with exposure to the core MSTR bitcoin treasury business. But its yield mutes some of the volatility. We really see that in the most recent price action. Other preferred issues are more stable. But the combination of yield and convertibility works for me. Given my belief in an upward bias for bitcoin prices, convertibility, the good yield, and the reduced volatility relative to MSTR, I rate STRK as a “Buy.” As to STRC, STRF, and STRD Here’s a 3-month share price comparison between MSTR and STRK, and the newer STRC, STRF, and STRD issues. StockCharts.com I’m giving a thumbs down, on STRD. In terms of price performance, it’s similar to STRF. Meanwhile, STRD has a higher yield. But STRD is a non-cumulative preferred. That means that if the company chooses to skip a dividend payment, it’s gone forever. STRF, on the other hand, is a cumulative preferred (as are the other preferred issues). That means if the company skips a dividend payment, it has to pay all skipped-and-in-arrears preferred dividends before it can resume paying in the future. To my thinking, that extra protection is worth a lesser yield. So I rate STRD “Sell” (meaning I expect it to underperform). Right now, STRC looks like a great income vehicle—obviously , for those who can live with the above-described risks. It has the lowest volatility. And it has a terrific yield. But that adjustability feature (see footnote in the above table) bears watching. It sounds great now. If the stock falls, MSTR will quickly adjust and raise the payout to drive the price back up toward $100. That said, we have to always keep an eye on this issue. If, in the future, bitcoin rallies and causes STRC to rise, we have to expect a dividend reduction. Remember—management will continue to target a $100 share price. Still, for now, STRC looks poised to outperform. I express that as a “Buy” rating for the stock. Meanwhile, STRF is what I’d consider to be the most basic issue. Its combination of yield, volatility, and BTC Rating looks well balanced. And in contrast to STRC, the dividend for STRF will be stable—and in contrast to STRD, cumulative. So I see STRF as an outperformer. Accordingly, I rate it as a “Buy.”",STRK|STRF|STRC|STRD|MSTR:CA|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-14 13:53:17

This is one of the sharpest single-day drops in XRP exchange reserves in recent months. Despite the large transfer, the asset tumbled below $2.30 earlier today, marking a significant 9% overnight decline. Meanwhile, this development raises new questions among traders and analysts. Some see this as a shift in strategy by larger holders, while others remain cautious, noting a lack of strong buying pressure. XRP Exchange Balances Drop Sharply According to data from CryptoQuant, XRP’s exchange supply dropped steeply within a 24-hour period. The chart shows a clear cut in reserves, equal to over 149 million tokens. This suggests fewer coins are available for trading on such platforms. Source: CryptoQuant In many cases, tokens moved off exchanges are meant for storage rather than sale. Such activity is often linked to long-term holding or preparation for offline custody. However, XRP’s price has not moved much following the drop. It remains just near $2.30, showing that the lower supply has not yet been matched by fresh demand. ETF Launch Followed by Price Decline On November 13, the first US spot XRP ETF, known as XRPC, began trading. As CryptoPotato reported , it recorded over $58 million in volume and took in $245 million in inflows. Robinhood also confirmed the listing of XRPC, drawing attention across the crypto space. However, XRP’s price quickly dropped following the launch. Analysts described this as a typical case of the market pricing in the news ahead of time. Crypto Patel noted , “Markets move before headlines. Retail moves after.” His chart shows that XRP found support at a key level within its price channel, after a near 10% fall. The pattern is still intact for now. Large Holder Activity Slows Down Data from Binance shows that large wallet transfers to exchanges have been declining since October. A small spike on October 25 was short-lived, and the trend returned to low levels. The 30-day average also points to fewer large-scale moves. Source: CryptoQuant During the same period, XRP’s price has dropped from above $2.60 to around $2.30. While fewer whale transfers can lower selling pressure, the lack of new buying interest has kept prices under control. Market Signals Show Neutral Trend On a longer timeframe, XRP is showing early signs of recovery. The RSI on the 3-day chart has broken out of a past downward path. In previous cases, such moves came before stronger price shifts. The current RSI is near 46, showing mild upward momentum. Analyst Steph Is Crypto’s chart pointed to similar patterns in past years that led to large gains. Another analyst, Cryptollica, compared XRP to its 2-year moving average bands. XRP is trading above the 2-year base level but still far below the upper bands. This puts the token in a mid-range price zone with no clear signs of extreme moves, up or down.

He immediately points to the Treasury General Account (TGA): “Expect a few days for TGA spending to begin to significantly add to liquidity and should persist for several months.Obviously, QT ends in Dec and the balance sheet will crawl higher. We should see the dollar begin to weaken again.” Mechanically, TGA drawdowns push cash back into bank reserves and money markets, reversing the reserve drain that built up while the government was partially shut. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has already confirmed that quantitative tightening (QT) will end on December 1, 2025, shifting from active balance-sheet reduction to full reinvestment of maturing Treasuries and a more “maintenance” stance. When Will Crypto Prices Rise Again? Pal’s point is that both channels tilt the system toward more dollars sloshing through funding markets, a backdrop he has long argued is constructive for risk assets, including crypto. The near-term risk, in his view, is a classic year-end funding squeeze. “The next key step is to avoid a Year End funding squeeze. Expect several ‘temporary’ measures to add liquidity. Term Funding and SRF operations are most likely.” Related Reading: SEC Chair Sets Out Plans For Crypto Taxonomy To Define Digital Asset Classification Here he is referring to term repo or funding facilities and the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), which the Fed can scale up to backstop banks’ access to cash if overnight rates spike. That reading aligns with recent Fed communication that elevated SRF usage and tighter money-market conditions were central reasons for ending QT early. Pal then escalates from tactical tools to structural regulation: “That will eventually morph into the desperately needed changes to the SLR to allow banks to absorb more issuance and re-lever their balance sheets. This is a big liquidity bazooka. Expect in Q1. SLR should lower rates as banks buy more bonds.” The Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) caps large banks’ overall balance-sheet size, regardless of asset risk. Loosening it for Treasuries and reserves has been debated for years as a way to let dealers warehouse more government debt without breaching constraints. If regulators move in that direction, it would, as Pal notes, free capacity for banks to buy more bonds and could exert downward pressure on yields—again easing financial conditions. Related Reading: The 2025 Year-End Crypto Outlook: The Catalysts That Will Decide Everything For crypto, that matters indirectly: Pal’s core macro thesis is that improving liquidity and lower real yields are the primary tailwinds for digital assets. Regulation is explicitly on his radar too: “Also expect CLARITY Act for crypto to begin to get finalized.” The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (“CLARITY Act”) has already passed the US House and is now before the Senate. It would define digital asset categories and divide oversight between the CFTC and SEC, replacing much of the current “regulation by enforcement” model. Pal’s remark signals his expectation that the shutdown’s end clears the way for renewed legislative momentum – a key piece of the institutional puzzle for non-bitcoin crypto. He closes by broadening the lens to global and fiscal policy: “There will also be stimulus payments and the Big Beautiful Bill fiscal goosing. China will continue balance sheet expansion. Europe will add fiscal stimulus or extra spending. The debts must be rolled and the Gov wants to super heat the economy into the Mid-Terms. This is the Liquidity Flood…. the spice must flow.” Taken together, Pal is describing a synchronised regime: post-shutdown TGA spending, the end of QT, potential SLR relief, progressing US crypto legislation, and ongoing fiscal and monetary support in China and Europe. For crypto investors who share his liquidity-centric lens, the message is not subtle: the macro “spice,” in his view, is about to flow again. At press time, the total crypto market cap dropped to $3.24 trillion.

Zero Knowledge Proof’s Pods Generate Real Monthly Income of $1,500",https://timestabloid.com/gambling-on-aster-and-uni-breakouts-zero-knowledge-proofs-pods-2/,"Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has officially opened its whitelist, giving early participants the chance to register ahead of its Initial Coin Auction (ICA). This model introduces a daily auction system that allows the market, not the project, to determine token pricing. Each day, 200 million Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) tokens will be made available for contribution using ETH, USDC, or ZUSD. The final price per token is calculated by dividing total contributions by the tokens offered that day, ensuring full visibility into the process. The opening of the whitelist has already drawn attention across crypto communities and among analysts tracking top presale token opportunities. Built on the zero knowledge proof blockchain structure, the system prioritizes transparency, fairness, and user control. With the whitelist now open, participants can prepare for what could become one of the most closely observed auction-based events in the upcoming token presale market. How ZKP’s Auction Model Promotes Fair Pricing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)’s Initial Coin Auction presents a new method for token distribution by removing fixed pricing stages. Each day’s auction operates independently, offering an equal opportunity for participants based on visible market data. This approach ensures that no participant can manipulate pricing and that all contributors receive the same token rate once the auction ends. Unlike traditional presales that rely on rigid stages or private rounds, the ICA allows participants to choose when to take part. If one auction day experiences higher demand, users can wait for another with potentially different conditions. This method supports the project’s goal of giving users control through transparent, verifiable on-chain data. Analysts covering crypto presales have identified the ICA as a notable structure within the zero knowledge proof blockchain category. Its market-based process emphasizes openness and accountability, characteristics often associated with the leading top presale token initiatives. Fairness First: ZKP’s Anti-Whale Measures To maintain fairness, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) applies a $50,000 per-wallet daily contribution limit. This restriction prevents large participants from influencing pricing or dominating daily auctions. It ensures that all contributors, regardless of scale, have the same opportunity to acquire tokens under equal conditions. Every contribution, price calculation, and token allocation is handled entirely on-chain. No off-chain arrangements or hidden offers are permitted, reinforcing transparency and trust. The zero knowledge proof blockchain guarantees that records remain verifiable and secure while protecting individual privacy. This structured balance of openness and privacy has gained positive recognition across crypto presale discussions. Commentators analyzing top presale token options for 2025 have noted that Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)’s consistent focus on verifiable fairness strengthens its position among projects promoting integrity in token distribution. Where to Register: Whitelist Now Live! The whitelist for Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is now live at auction.zkp.com, where participants can connect their wallets and complete registration to confirm eligibility for the Initial Coin Auction once it goes live. This registration process ensures an organized and transparent system for future participation, helping prevent congestion or confusion once bidding begins. Beyond its auction system, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) will expand its utility through Proof Pods, physical computing devices that will support decentralized AI processing. Proof Pods will connect through Wi-Fi and contribute verified computational power to the network, rewarding users with Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) tokens based on measurable performance. This will create a link between blockchain operations and tangible computational work. The project’s collaboration with the Dolphins, a professional rugby league team in Australia, is already live and has further increased its visibility beyond crypto communities. This partnership highlights how blockchain-focused projects can connect with wider audiences and foster awareness of fair participation models. Analysts reviewing top presale token reports are expected to reference Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for its transparent pricing, fairness policies, and practical ecosystem design. These features are likely to position it as a key discussion point across multiple crypto presales heading into 2025. Closing Analysis The whitelist opening for Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) underscores a structured approach to transparency and fairness in token sales. By enabling market-based pricing through the Initial Coin Auction, the project removes speculation and creates equal access for all contributors. Its anti-whale policy and verifiable design establish a system built on accountability and clarity. As interest in the zero knowledge proof blockchain continues to expand, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is being recognized within top presale token reviews and crypto presales. With its whitelist now open and a focus on verifiable fairness, the project represents a clear example of how on-chain transparency can promote trust in future presale frameworks.

Crypto Market Structure Bill Draft Under Scrutiny According to Crypto In America, the long-awaited market structure discussion draft presented by the Senate Agriculture Committee this week has left many in the industry expressing the need for substantial improvements before extending their complete backing. Led by Chairman John Boozman and Senator Cory Booker, the draft draws inspiration from the CLARITY Act, aiming to delineate the definition of a digital commodity while accentuating aspects related to customer protections, oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and self-custody protocols. However, the presence of blockchain-related language enclosed in brackets signifies ongoing deliberations among lawmakers, with significant sections pertaining to decentralized finance (DeFi) and anti-money laundering (AML) left vacant. A figure from a leading crypto trade association articulated that while the bill marks a positive initiation, further amendments are requisite for industry-wide support. Notably, discussions suggest that the Senate Agriculture Committee may be awaiting deliberations from their Senate Banking counterparts, particularly concerning DeFi components falling under the purview of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). Expressing hope for clarity in the DeFi domain, DeFi Education Fund Executive Director Amanda Tuminelli emphasized the necessity for robust developer protections that distinctly differentiate centralized intermediaries from software developers devoid of custody and financial control over external assets. Acknowledging the iterative nature of a discussion draft, industry participants have demonstrated willingness to engage with legislators in refining the regulatory process. December Markup For Merging Market Structure Drafts Anticipating positive collaborations, Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone conveyed eagerness to collaborate in advancing the legislative agenda . Concurrently, the Senate Banking Committee has disclosed two market structure drafts, primarily led by the GOP, with ongoing bipartisan negotiations hinting at a potential merger of the drafts upon mutual satisfaction. Chairman Boozman has articulated a commitment to an early December markup session, underscoring the legislative trajectory aimed at integrating both draft versions into a cohesive framework. An unresolved clause in the Senate Ag draft proposes that the CFTC should nominate at least two commissioners post-consultation with the committee’s minority faction, potentially solidifying the necessity for minority seats within the commission. Key deliberations are scheduled, including the nomination hearing for Mike Selig, Trump’s nominee for the CFTC chair position. While the agency anticipates further nominations, the process remains underway without definitive names put forth for additional commissioner roles.

While XRP has outperformed Bitcoin this year, the token’s price has not matched expectations, considering the launch of XRPC. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.26, down 9.21% over the past 24 hours. Trading volume remains high at $7.6 billion, while market capitalization hovers around $136 billion. Over 59 billion XRP are in circulation. Grok’s Forecast and Market Alignment Building on this context, we consulted Elon Musk’s AI assistant, Grok, regarding XRP’s price for November 30, 2025. Grok projects a target of $3.25, citing ETF approvals, institutional adoption, and rising on-chain activity. While not deterministic, this forecast aligns with broader market sentiment and investor expectations. Grok’s estimate provides a benchmark for evaluating near-term performance and the potential impact of upcoming catalysts. ETF Momentum Fuels Bullish Sentiment The Canary Capital spot XRP ETF (XRPC) launched on November 12 , generating $58 million in day-one volume. This surpassed the Bitwise Solana ETF debut earlier this year. Several additional ETFs are under SEC review, with approvals expected under Section 8(a) rules by late November. Analysts suggest these listings could bring $5 billion in initial inflows, mirroring Bitcoin’s 2024 post-ETF rally. ETF momentum now drives near-term bullish sentiment and reinforces Grok’s projected target. Institutional Adoption and Network Activity ETF momentum is complemented by Ripple’s growing institutional adoption. Swell 2025 emphasized ISO 20022 compliance for faster settlements and wider financial integrations. On-chain metrics indicate rising demand, including over 21,000 new wallets and increasing whale accumulation. Exchange balances continue to decline, while DEX transactions remain elevated. These trends link institutional engagement with network growth, supporting both analyst forecasts and Grok’s price projection. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technical Analysis and Key Levels XRP consolidates between $2.40 and $2.55, with resistance at the 50-day EMA near $2.75 and support at $2.22. A death cross (50 EMA below 200 EMA) signals short-term bearish risk. However, divergence in on-chain metrics points to accumulation. A breakout above $2.75 could target $3.05–$3.25, while a drop below $2.22 may push the price toward $2.00. Technical levels reflect ETF flows, institutional activity, and network fundamentals. Analyst Forecasts and Sentiment Analyst projections for November 30 range widely. CoinDCX sees $2.90–$3.05, while CoinCodex $2.32–$2.34, and InvestingHaven $1.81–$4.10, averaging $2.91. Also, Changelly forecasts $2.38–$2.60, Economic Times $3.20–$5.00, while Coinpedia and X sentiment suggest $3.00–$5.00. The consensus range is $2.30–$3.50, averaging around $2.80. Grok’s $3.25 target aligns with these bullish scenarios if catalysts continue to materialize. End-of-Month Outlook Combining technicals, ETF momentum, and adoption, XRP could reach $3.25 by November 30 if catalysts align. Conservative models predict $2.32–$2.34, while bullish scenarios see $3.00–$5.00. Investors should monitor ETF approvals, liquidity flows, and support levels closely. Social sentiment reinforces this view, with many traders targeting $3.10–$5.00 over the next two weeks. In conclusion, XRP’s outlook reflects the convergence of ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and strong on-chain activity. Grok’s $3.25 projection represents a cautiously bullish near-term scenario. Traders should watch key support at $2.22 and resistance at $2.75. If momentum persists, XRP could achieve its projected target by November 30, 2025, offering significant upside while remaining sensitive to broader market volatility.

Bitcoin Hyper aims to deliver SVM-level throughput while settling to Bitcoin, targeting fast, low-fee $BTC transactions and usable DeFi rails. The $HYPER presale raised over $27.5M so far with a token price of $0.013275 and a staking reward of 42%. Based on $HYPER’s current price, investing now could reward you with an ROI of 572% or 1,805% by 2026 and 2030 respectively. Big money keeps circling fresh Bitcoin infrastructure plays. This week, a single on-chain purchase worth roughly half a million dollars in $HYPER lit up whale trackers, throwing a spotlight on Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) layer-2 pitch just as its presale enters the final stretch. The buy-in arrived at a moment when Bitcoin scaling narratives are driving capital flows across Layer-2s and sidechains. Faster settlement, cheaper fees, more programmable rails for $BTC – that’s where the puck is going, and that’s the lane Bitcoin Hyper wants to own. Bitcoin Hyper positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer-2 built around a Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer, bridging $BTC into a high-throughput environment while committing its state back to Bitcoin for security. The promise is simple: near-instant $BTC transactions and a workable home for Bitcoin-centric DeFi and apps without abandoning Bitcoin’s base-layer assurances. That combination – speed from an SVM stack, settlement discipline from Bitcoin – is the core of the project’s pitch. The momentum is already there, even without whales adding more fuel to the fire. Fresh capital validates the story, adds perceived scarcity pressure, and sets a reference point for what deep-pocketed traders are willing to risk ahead of a first listing. ➡️ Read more about this innovative project with 1000x potential in our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review. SVM-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Targeting Real Throughput Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) design will funnel $BTC through a canonical bridge, mint an equivalent value on its Layer-2, process transactions in an SVM environment for high throughput, and then commit proofs back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1. The intent is to preserve Bitcoin-grade security while overcoming Layer-1 bottlenecks. The Hyper roadmap references sequencing research, zero-knowledge proofs, and periodic state commitments – the right ingredients for a Layer-2 that wants to run payments, order books, and staking without grinding to a halt. For developers, the SVM angle taps an ecosystem that already understands performant, parallelized runtime patterns. For users, the value prop is faster finality and lower fees while still settling to Bitcoin. Utility is the point here. If the bridge and execution stack work as described, Bitcoin Hyper can become the place where $BTC actually moves at app speed. That creates room for payments, market venues, and on-chain tools tied directly to the asset people already hold. The upshot for presale buyers is straightforward: useful block space tends to find demand, and demand is what sustains fees and token utility. Presale Success as it Draws to a Close Presales are about price, runway, and conviction. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already cleared $27.5M+, with a current token price of $0.013275 and staking rewards set at 42% for early participants. Our $0.08925 price prediction for $HYPER suggests a potential ROI of 572% if the hype momentum holds. By 2030, following a successful implementation, $HYPER could get to $0.253, for a return rate of 1,805% based on today’s price. ➡️ Read our guide to buying $HYPER if you’re thinking of buying in. On signals, whale activity is setting the tone. Yesterday’s whale transaction saw 155.62 $ETH routed through the presale contract, with distributions to multiple recipient addresses and an associated $HYPER transfer of 36.86M tokens. 💰 Historical cost accounting at the execution time puts the gross outlay at $502.6K – massive enough to register, spot on the ‘half a million’ mark to move sentiment. In presales, that matters. It tells mid-sized buyers the order book isn’t only retail. On runway, the presale’s $27.5M+ haul and 42% staking rewards set a clear incentive for early participants while the network spins up. If the staking mechanism draws sufficient lock-in ahead of TGE, it softens the initial float and can stabilize early price action if listings open with typical volatility. Couple that with the SVM narrative and the broader hunt for Bitcoin-centric block space, and you get a presale with enough story, enough numbers, and now, enough whale interest to justify a closer look before the window shuts. It’s no wonder that, in terms of numbers and community support, Hyper already qualifies as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Bitcoin Hyper is eyeing a Q4 2025/Q1 2026 release window, so there’s not much time left to join the presale. Plus the presale price goes up in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders join the pool. 🚀 Don’t delay – buy your $HYPER today. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice.

Binance and BlackRock extend heavy ETH outflows as $1B leaves wallets Fresh data from Arkham shows a sharp wave of Ethereum outflows from major Binance wallets in the past few hours, adding pressure to a trend that has unfolded for three straight days. Several Binance hot wallets moved large batches of ETH to market-maker addresses and exchanges, signaling continued selling activity as traders track the scale of withdrawals. In the last hour, multiple transactions above $1 million each moved from Binance’s hot wallets toward Wintermute, Bybit and other settlement addresses. One transfer sent 1,205 ETH, while another pushed 1,133 ETH to Wintermute. Additional outflows included 550 ETH, 688 ETH and several smaller batches that followed the same pattern. These movements came as part of a broader series of ETH transfers leaving Binance throughout the morning. At the two-hour mark, more sizable flows appeared. One wallet sent 1,114 ETH to Wintermute, while another moved 717 ETH to an external address before additional flows routed toward OKX and MEXC deposit wallets. The continuous transfers point to sustained pressure across centralized exchanges as liquidity shifts into trading venues or market-maker accounts. Arkham ETH Outflows Dashboard. Source: Arkham/x Rekt Fencer highlighted the acceleration in a separate update, noting that Binance and BlackRock offloaded roughly $1 billion worth of ETH over the last 10 hours. He added that both players have been selling consistently for three days, raising questions about why large holders are reducing exposure while ETH trades near key technical support. Whales return to ETH spot markets as large order clusters re-emerge Meanwhile, Ethereum’s spot market is seeing a new wave of large-sized orders, according to fresh CryptoQuant data shared by analyst CryptoGoos. The chart shows a clear pickup in big-whale activity, with green and dark-green clusters appearing again after a quiet stretch earlier in the quarter. Ethereum Spot Average Order Size. Source: CryptoQuant/X The renewed concentration of large orders comes as ETH trades near a key support area that has shaped recent volatility. The data highlights strong participation from big wallets rather than retail traders, marking a notable shift in the order-flow profile. At the same time, the average spot order size has climbed back toward levels last seen during the early-2024 accumulation period. These clusters indicate whales are actively positioning while the broader market digests recent selling pressure across exchanges. The appearance of steady large orders suggests that high-volume players are building exposure during a period of compressed price action, adding another layer to Ethereum’s current market structure. Ethereum steadies at $3,200 as traders watch key support zone Ethereum is consolidating around the $3,200 level, a price area that chart analysts describe as a pivotal line for short-term direction. Fresh analysis from TedPillows shows ETH holding inside a narrow band after a series of sharp moves earlier in the week. Ethereum Price Support and Resistance Map. Source: TedPillows The chart highlights $3,200 as the immediate support that continues to absorb sell pressure. ETH has tested this zone multiple times, creating a tight consolidation structure that now shapes the next move. If the level holds, the chart outlines potential relief bounces toward resistance zones between $3,380 and $3,700, where previous breakdown points sit. Below the current range, Ethereum faces a cluster of deeper support levels near $3,050 and $2,915. A clean break through $3,200 would put those lower zones back in play, signaling a broader shift in momentum as the market digests heavy exchange outflows and renewed volatility. The setup places added focus on ETH’s ability to maintain stability around this midpoint area, with traders tracking whether buyers can prevent a move below the $3,000 threshold.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 15:26:45

Despite experiencing a period of recovery earlier this week, all three digital assets are now facing renewed downward pressure. The latest price declines are driven by both macroeconomic uncertainty and internal market factors, underscoring how sensitive the crypto market remains to changes in investor sentiment. FED Skepticism Fuel Decline In Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin The recent decline in cryptocurrency prices comes amid growing doubts over the Federal Reserve’s (FED) approach to interest rates. Recent remarks from FED officials, including the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, have cast uncertainty on whether the central bank will deliver a third consecutive easing of policy during the December FOMC meeting. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Crash Is Important If Wave 5 Corrects To $94,000 According to Bloomberg reports, Kashkari noted that recent economic data suggested more resilience than was initially anticipated, sparking a debate over the necessity of further rate cuts. This cautious stance has unsettled financial markets, causing investors to reconsider earlier positions as former expectations of a rate now appear uncertain. Notably, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin have reacted sharply to the prevailing sentiment caused by the doubts in monetary easing. Their prices have plummeted, accelerating the broader correction that has been dragging on for months. This decline is also being augmented by large-scale whale sell offs and lingering ambiguity surrounding new developments in the previous US government shutdown. How Much BTC, ETH, And DOGE Declined This Week In addition to macroeconomic factors, market dynamics are also contributing to crypto losses. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Bitcoin price crashed below $97,000 for the first time since May 2025. It has fallen more than 5% over the week and dropped another 6.4% in a single day. Related Reading: Analysts Share Forecasts As Ethereum Price Struggles Below $4,000, And It’s Very Bearish Amidst this decline, long-term BTC holders are reportedly selling at record levels, fueling the downtrend. Additionally, institutional demand is weakening while investor sentiment has turned negative. Even Spot Bitcoin ETF activity is plummeting, recording over $866.7 million in net outflows yesterday—the second largest in its history. Ethereum has also been hit hard, losing more than 10% in the past 24 hours and over 5% this week. The price has steadily trended downward for weeks and shows no clear signs of recovery. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,200, down more than 35% from the ATH levels above $4,950 set in August this year. Dogecoin, while only slightly affected by the broader bearish trend, is now trading at $0.165. It has fallen by approximately 2.3% during the week and by an additional 8% in one day. Collectively, these widespread declines suggest that the market may be experiencing a period of extreme stress, as all three cryptocurrencies have recorded double-digit monthly losses.

Everyone knew there’d be issues after launch because they basically handed out free coins to millions of users, but these “issues” are starting to look more like fundamental problems that might not have a fix. Nothing they’re trying seems to be working. The Pi Core team just dropped a new guide on how to create tokens on their network, getting ready for the Mainnet v23 update. Sure, they’re actively doing stuff, but here’s the thing: what makes them special? There are countless layer 1 blockchains out there already, and Pi’s whole strategy seems to be banking on their large user base to build an ecosystem that mainly benefits existing holders. Among the TOP50 coins, $Pi is one of the worst performers in the last 90 days. It is a big -48% in the last 3 months. $Pi needs way more utility, demand, liquidity and decentralization to become a serious project. #pi #pinetwork #minepi #picoin pic.twitter.com/hbsLciBHdF — pinetworkmembers (@pinetworkmember) November 7, 2025 The bigger questions remain unanswered: How does the team actually make money from this? Will there be any token-burning mechanism to control supply? Right now, it just looks like they’re trying to keep the ship afloat by launching features without a clear vision of what makes Pi worth holding long-term. Momentum Is Dying, And Holders are Giving Up Pi Coin is struggling to attract real investor interest, and the on-chain data tells the story. Over the past 24 hours, the top 100 transactions only moved about 9 million PI tokens, worth less than $2.45 million total. Even the biggest transaction was under $100,000, showing that major holders aren’t stepping up to create liquidity or momentum. It’s like a party where nobody’s showing up. To make things worse, technical indicators are flashing warning signs. Source: PI Transactions / Piscan Pi Coin Price Prediction: Brutal Crash to $0 Possible? Source: PIUSD / TradingView When looking at the chart, the picture is pretty clear: we’re in a sustained downtrend that’s been going on for weeks. That diagonal trendline from the top left shows how PI has been consistently making lower highs, dropping from around $0.29 down to the current $0.2168. The interesting part is that gray “accumulation zone” between roughly $0.204 and $0.22, where the price has been bouncing around lately. Either PI breaks out above that blue resistance line around $0.2368 and heads toward $0.26, or it fails to hold this level and drops down. The RSI is at 45.66, which confirms there’s not much momentum either way right now. Survived the PI Collapse? PepeNode Is Doing the Opposite While PI keeps bleeding out and struggling to prove it even has a future, PepeNode is moving in the completely opposite direction. Instead of fading demand and zero momentum, PepeNode is stacking users, growing fast, and actually giving people a reason to get involved. PepeNode takes the old school idea of mining and flips it into a play-to-earn game anyone can join. No hardware, no energy bills, no technical setup. You build virtual mining rigs, upgrade nodes, and earn PEPENODE tokens plus rewards in top meme coins as your operation grows. The token economy is what really separates it from the usual hype projects. Around 70 percent of all upgrade spending gets burned permanently, which keeps supply tight and builds long-term value for holders. And even before the full launch, staking APY is sitting at a wild 605% . It feels like the early days of Bitcoin mining, but without the barriers. Accessible, simple, and actually rewarding. That is why PepeNode has already pulled in over 2.13 million dollars from early backers, with support for ETH, BNB, USDT, or even credit card payments.

Cardano’s feeling the pain too. ADA just hit its lowest level in a year at $0.50, which is a straight-up bear market level. If it loses this support level, we could be looking at a serious drop ahead. But here’s where it gets interesting: the whales are buying. Big holders just scooped up over 348 million ADA, worth around $200 million. That’s nearly 1% of the entire supply. On top of that, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) just hit a 3-year high, and they recently launched Cardano Card. Source: Santiment Plus, ADA was added to the 21Shares Top 10 Crypto ETF, which is a pretty big deal for institutional recognition and could bring in some serious buying pressure. So here’s the head-scratcher: all the signs point to the ecosystem actually growing and maturing. So why isn’t the price reflecting that? It’s the classic crypto puzzle: fundamentals improving, price tanking. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Is Not Dead.. Or Is It? Source: ADAUSD / TradingView ADA is currently standing on the edge at $0.5157, teetering around the crucial support zone between $0.49 and $0.52 that has been holding it up for weeks. If you zoom out, the bigger picture isn’t pretty. Cardano’s been sliding downhill for months, dropping from around $0.70 to where we are now. So, what happens next ? There are two paths here: either ADA bounces off this support and climbs back up to $0.5685 or maybe even $0.60 (that’s the hopeful scenario), or it breaks down and drops further toward $0.48-$0.49, or worse, a scary one, isn’t it? The RSI sitting at 39.23 tells us ADA is getting close to oversold levels but isn’t quite there yet, and the flat MACD shows there’s basically zero momentum happening. Think of it like watching someone balance on a tightrope. ADA either finds its footing here and recovers, or it tips over and keeps falling into deeper bear market levels. SUBBD: A Creator Economy Shakeup While the Market Bleeds Out While the rest of the market is drowning in red, SUBBD is one of the few projects actually gaining momentum instead of losing it. Traders are starting to rotate into platforms with real fundamentals and real use cases, and SUBBD is landing right in that sweet spot. SUBBD is building a hybrid crypto and AI-driven media platform aimed straight at the broken subscriber economy. Instead of platforms taking the lion’s share and creators getting crumbs, SUBBD flips the model completely. Creators actually own their work, their audience, and their revenue stream. Fans get early drops, exclusive content, and perks that make supporting their favorite creators feel personal, not transactional. The big draw is the removal of middlemen. No algorithmic chokeholds. No platform taxes draining creators dry. Just direct connections, direct earnings, and an AI layer that boosts content discovery in a way traditional platforms simply can’t match. Investors are already waking up to it. The presale is closing in on $1.34 million, and that number keeps climbing as more people look for projects with staying power instead of hype cycles that die in a week.

Michael Saylor, Strategy’s executive chairman, denied the rumors and said they are actually buying BTC. Strategy’s wallets originated several large-scale transactions, moving a total of 38,657 BTC from known public addresses. Some of the coins were moved to new wallets , with no further transactions. Strategy performed several transactions, with funds sent to Coinbase Custody wallets. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The rumors of selling started just as BTC dipped under $95,000, causing further market panic. On social media, fake screenshots were distributed, suggesting Strategy may be dumping its BTC. In the past 24 hours, Strategy’s wallets sent out seven large transactions, ending up in Coinbase Custody wallets. Some of the patterns are unusual, but traders urged to avoid panic and spreading fear. Recently, the company also saw its playbook structure under pressure, as the common stock MSTR dipped under the total estimated value of the BTC holdings. In total, Strategy moved $1.2B in BTC for the past day. Previously, internal moves were sent to self-custodied wallets, though Strategy has been known to also use Coinbase Custody. Michael Saylor said Strategy is still buying Michael Saylor denied the rumors of selling, stating that Strategy was ready to buy more BTC. He also urged BTC supporters to hold through the turbulence. We are ₿uying. pic.twitter.com/6g11E9G6pO — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 14, 2025 The rumors were dismissed as FUD, as Strategy is seen as a long-term holder, more likely to buy the dip than sell BTC holdings. For now, Strategy is holding for net gains, with an average acquisition price of $74,000. Strategy’s MSTR threatens to slide below $200 The MSTR share price showed its correlation with BTC, extending its price drop from the past few days. MSTR slid to $201, a price range at which the common stock is not so useful for new BTC purchases. MSTR shares may see another BTC bear market, though Strategy has tried to offset the dilution and price weakness by offering new preferred shares. Strategy’s MSTR also fell after large-scale holders divested in Q3. Capital International Investors, Vanguard, and BlackRock each sold over $1B in MSTR holdings. In total, Wall Street firms divested over $5.38B in MSTR shares. The biggest worry for Strategy is that it would need to raise new funds to pay previous obligations, including servicing debt and paying out dividends. The company raised over $700M from its STRE product, and some of the funds would go toward paying for other convertible stocks. In the absence of a BTC bear market, this approach has led to skepticism about Strategy’s playbook viability. Overall, Strategy does not have direct obligations where it has to liquidate BTC to cover debt. However, the company may be pressured for cash, as it has launched products with significant demands for mandatory dividends.

Analysts are now warning that the drop is not a mere price fluctuation but a structural correction shaped by long-term holder profit-taking, fiscal constraints, and short-term investor stress. A Perfect Storm of U.S. Selling Pressure According to an analysis from XWIN Research Japan, the Coinbase Premium Index has been negative for weeks, meaning BTC is trading at a lower price on the U.S.-based exchange compared to international platforms, a clear signal that American investors are selling more aggressively than their global counterparts. This is creating a repeated pattern where Bitcoin recovers during Asian and European hours, only to reverse sharply when U.S. markets open. The selling is not limited to short-term speculators. On-chain data shows that long-term holders across various cohorts, from those holding for six months to as long as seven years, are all taking profits at the same time. As noted by analysts like Will Clemente and confirmed by Fidelity, this widespread selling is a strong indicator of year-end tax optimization, with U.S. investors locking in gains to finalize their 2025 tax positions. Furthermore, the recent U.S. government shutdown created a significant liquidity crunch, with the temporary halt in federal spending causing the government to run a surplus that pulled billions of dollars out of the financial system. XWIN suggested that this, combined with fading hopes for a December interest rate cut, weakened risk appetite across U.S. markets, dragging down equities, crypto-related stocks, and Bitcoin in unison. Market Psychology and the Search for a Bottom The current downturn is pushing the market into a painful but necessary cleansing phase. As analyst MorenoDV_ explained , the market is testing the resolve of short-term investors. They noted that the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is hovering near 0.9, a level that historically signals capitulation. When this ratio falls below 1, it means the average recent buyer is holding at a loss, and a break below 0.9 could trigger a final wave of selling that often forms a durable market bottom. Traders are now watching key price levels for signs of stability. As of November 14, analysts identified major on-chain support around $95,900, where a significant number of BTC were last moved. A decisive break below this threshold could see the price quickly descend toward the next support zones near $82,000. The rejection of the flagship cryptocurrency at the $107,000 resistance level earlier this week confirmed the bearish trend, with the asset now trading below its 200-day moving average, a widely watched indicator of long-term momentum. While the mood is pessimistic , the intense selling pressure from U.S. investors is viewed by many as a temporary, seasonal phenomenon.

This enormous stablecoin creation represents one of the largest single minting events we’ve seen recently, and it’s sending ripples across digital asset markets. But what does this actually mean for investors and the broader crypto ecosystem? Why Does 250 Million USDC Minted Matter? When we see substantial amounts of USDC minted, it typically signals increased institutional interest or preparation for major market moves. This recent 250 million USDC minted event suggests that large players are positioning themselves in the market. Stablecoins like USDC serve as the backbone of cryptocurrency trading, providing liquidity and stability during volatile periods. The timing of this USDC minted announcement is particularly interesting given current market conditions. Large-scale minting often precedes significant trading activity, as institutions and whales convert fiat into stablecoins before making their next moves. This massive USDC minted could indicate: Institutional accumulation of digital assets Preparation for major trades or investments Increased DeFi activity requiring stablecoin liquidity Market confidence in stablecoin ecosystems How Does USDC Minting Actually Work? Understanding the process behind USDC minted events helps explain why this matters. When we talk about USDC being minted, we’re referring to the creation of new stablecoin tokens backed by real US dollars held in reserve. Each USDC token represents one US dollar held in segregated bank accounts, providing the stability that makes these coins so valuable to traders and investors. The recent 250 million USDC minted means that $250 million in real dollars has been deposited into reserve accounts, and an equivalent amount of digital USDC has been created on the blockchain. This process maintains the 1:1 peg that makes stablecoins like USDC so crucial for cryptocurrency trading pairs and DeFi protocols. What Are the Market Implications of This USDC Minted Event? Major USDC minted events often serve as leading indicators for market sentiment and future price action. The sheer scale of this 250 million USDC minted suggests that sophisticated players are preparing for significant market movements. Historically, large stablecoin minting has correlated with: Increased buying pressure across major cryptocurrencies Enhanced liquidity for trading pairs and DeFi protocols Reduced volatility during market transitions Institutional participation in digital asset markets This particular USDC minted event comes at a time when market participants are closely watching for signs of institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance. The fact that such a substantial amount of USDC was minted indicates strong confidence in the stablecoin’s reliability and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. How Should Investors Interpret Large USDC Minted Announcements? For cryptocurrency investors, understanding the significance of USDC minted events can provide valuable insights into market dynamics. When you see substantial amounts of USDC being minted, it’s often wise to consider several factors: Market timing – Are we at key support or resistance levels? Trading volume – Is there corresponding activity in spot markets? Macro conditions – How does this fit with broader financial trends? Regulatory environment – Are there policy developments affecting stablecoins? The recent 250 million USDC minted should be viewed in context with other market indicators to form a complete picture of where digital assets might be heading next. Conclusion: The Big Picture Behind This USDC Minted Event This massive 250 million USDC minted represents more than just numbers on a blockchain – it’s a powerful signal about the health and direction of cryptocurrency markets. As stablecoins continue to play an increasingly vital role in digital finance, events like this USDC minted announcement provide crucial insights into institutional behavior and market sentiment. While we can’t predict exact outcomes, the scale of this minting suggests that major players are positioning for significant activity in the coming days and weeks. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, it means new stablecoin tokens are created and added to circulation, backed by equivalent US dollars held in reserve accounts. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Large institutions or whales typically mint substantial amounts of USDC to prepare for major trades, provide liquidity, or position themselves in anticipation of market movements. Is USDC minting good for cryptocurrency markets? Yes, USDC minting generally indicates healthy market activity, increased liquidity, and institutional participation, which are positive signs for ecosystem growth. How does USDC maintain its 1:1 peg with the US dollar? USDC maintains its peg through full reserve backing, regular audits, and redemption mechanisms that allow users to exchange 1 USDC for 1 US dollar. Can large USDC minting events predict price movements? While not guaranteed predictors, large USDC minting often correlates with upcoming market activity and can serve as one of many indicators traders monitor. What’s the difference between minting and burning USDC? Minting creates new USDC tokens, while burning removes them from circulation, typically when users redeem USDC for US dollars.

Here Are the Details…",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/as-ethereum-eth-strengthens-against-bitcoin-btc-this-could-benefit-xrp-the-most-here-are-the-details/,"Leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and altcoins are experiencing a major correction. At this point, BTC has fallen below $95,000, while ETH finds support around $3,100. While there are analyses suggesting that the correction could deepen further, one analyst noted that Ethereum remains relatively robust against Bitcoin. Accordingly, market analyst Omkar Godbole said that Ethereum has been relatively strong against Bitcoin despite the ongoing strong correction in the market, which is unusual. Pointing out that the ETH/BTC ratio increased by more than 2% in a single day, the analyst stated that the increase in the ETH/BTC ratio is an indicator of the relative strength of Ethereum. The analyst noted that the ETH/BTC ratio is stuck within a reversal downward channel, reflecting a pause following the sharp rise observed between May and August. A breakout from this channel would reaffirm investors' preference for Ethereum over Bitcoin and suggest further upside potential for the ETH/BTC ratio. “…Interestingly, the MACD histogram of the ETH/BTC ratio appears poised to break above zero, signaling a possible uptick in momentum. If Ethereum's strength against Bitcoin continues, the positive effects could spill over to other major altcoins.” Ethereum Price Also Points to a Breakout! The analyst said that, like the ETH/BTC ratio, the Etheruem price is also moving in a downward channel in the opposite direction to the dollar. “This data suggests the price has the potential to bounce, but a clean breakout from the downward channel is needed to confirm a broader bullish outlook,” the analyst said, noting that there are signs of exhaustion from sellers around $3,000. A Break in Ethereum Could Also Boost XRP! The analyst also recently analyzed the XRP/BTC ratio. According to the analyst, a strong breakout in Ethereum could be a significant catalyst for the XRP/BTC ratio. Stating that the XRP/BTC ratio has also accumulated potential volatility, the analyst said that this ratio has been stuck in a wide horizontal band for four years. Stating that this squeeze in the XRP/BTC pair indicates energy accumulation before a strong move, the analyst said, “If the Ethereum rally strengthens, this could also revitalize the XRP and altcoin markets. The upward breakout that has been awaited for years in the XRP/BTC pair could occur. This could lead to strong gains in the XRP price.” *This is not investment advice.

Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid recently delivered a stark warning that additional rate cuts could seriously hurt inflation progress. This cautious stance comes at a critical moment for monetary policy decisions. Why Could Further Rate Cuts Hurt Inflation Control? Schmid emphasized that additional interest rate reductions would fail to address underlying labor market weaknesses. More importantly, these cuts could adversely affect inflation by reigniting price pressures. The Federal Reserve must carefully balance competing economic objectives. Current economic data suggests that premature easing might: Undermine recent inflation progress Create new price stability risks Complicate future policy decisions What Are the Real Dangers of Aggressive Rate Cuts? The primary concern is that further rate cuts could hurt inflation management precisely when price stability appears within reach. Schmid’s position reflects growing unease among some Fed officials about moving too quickly. Historical examples show that premature policy shifts often lead to renewed inflationary pressures. Moreover, labor market cracks require targeted solutions rather than broad monetary stimulus. The relationship between employment and inflation remains complex. Therefore, policymakers must proceed with extreme caution. How Does This Warning Affect Future Policy Decisions? Schmid’s comments signal potential divisions within the Federal Reserve about the appropriate pace of policy normalization. His stance suggests that some officials believe additional rate cuts could hurt inflation expectations. This perspective emphasizes the need for patience and data-dependent decision-making. Key considerations for upcoming meetings include: Recent inflation trend analysis Labor market condition assessments Financial stability implications Global economic developments What Practical Implications Should Investors Watch? Market participants should prepare for potential policy divergence among Fed officials. The warning that further rate cuts could hurt inflation suggests possible resistance to aggressive easing. Investors must monitor economic indicators closely and adjust expectations accordingly. Critical data points to track include: Core inflation measurements Employment cost indices Consumer spending patterns Business investment trends Frequently Asked Questions Why does Schmid believe rate cuts could hurt inflation? He worries that premature easing might reignite price pressures and undermine recent progress toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target. What specific labor market concerns did he mention? Schmid noted that rate cuts wouldn’t effectively address structural labor market issues that require more targeted solutions. How does this position differ from other Fed officials? Some officials advocate for faster rate cuts, creating potential policy tensions within the Federal Reserve system. What economic indicators should I monitor? Watch core PCE inflation, unemployment rates, wage growth data, and consumer spending patterns for policy direction clues. Could this warning affect market expectations? Yes, it may temper market expectations for aggressive rate cuts and lead to more cautious investor positioning. What’s the timeline for potential policy changes? The Fed will continue data-dependent decision-making, with each meeting providing new assessment opportunities. Found this analysis helpful?

The offer, according to the ICBA, exploits regulatory gaps that could put customers at significant risk. Last week, ICBA sent a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) claiming that Sony Bank intends to use Connectia Trust for cryptocurrency-related activities. On October 6, Sony Bank filed to create Connectia Trust, a company that would offer digital asset custody services, retain reserve assets, and issue dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the letter, Sony plans to utilize Connectia Trust to provide asset management services to select affiliates in a fiduciary capacity. The group argued that Connectia Trust will not accept deposits or apply for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance. Connectia will instead conduct banking operations and related activities that are acceptable for a national bank. Mickey Marshall, the ICBA’s Vice President and Regulatory Counsel, stated that Sony appears to have established Connectia Trust to conduct banking-like operations without accepting deposits, thereby benefiting from a U.S. bank charter while avoiding compliance with all U.S. bank laws. ICBA flags risks in Sony stablecoin proposal ICBA warned that the Japanese financial giant is exploiting traditional banking monitoring by taking advantage of regulatory gaps. Additionally, ICBA requested that the OCC reject Sony’s application, citing that the application relies on an illegal reinterpretation of the statutory authorities of national trust banks. Community bankers argued that Connectia might predictably generate consumer confusion and harm in the event of insolvency. Connectia Trust joins an expanding list that includes Coinbase, Crypto.com, Circle, Ripple, Bridge (Stripe’s stablecoin arm), and Paxos. All of them are vying for federal charters as the stablecoin market soars above $311 billion following the passage of the GENIUS Act in July. According to ICBA, Connectia’s stablecoin shares many features with bank deposits, including electronic transfers, point-of-sale spending, and one-to-one dollar redemption. However, it would not be subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and federal deposit insurance standards that apply to traditional banks. The letter questioned whether Connectia’s eligibility for the Bank Holding Company Act is limited to institutions that operate “solely in a trust or fiduciary capacity.” Mickey Marshall stated that Connectia intends to use its national trust bank charter to illegally imitate the deposit-taking operations of a traditional bank, without the conditions, limitations, and compliance obligations that typically accompany a national bank charter. Additionally, the ICBA questioned Sony Corporation’s approximately 20% ownership in Connectia’s parent business, Sony Financial Group. The group claimed that Sony warrants further investigation to determine whether a controlling influence exists that would necessitate bank holding company regulation. ICBA warned that a single failure in key reassembly or system migration could result in the permanent loss of access to billions of dollars in customer assets. Additionally, the group claimed that the OCC has not handled an uninsured national bank since 1933 and lacks the necessary expertise to handle a complex cryptocurrency collapse. Coinbase trust charter faces regulatory pushback ICBA submitted identical objections against Coinbase’s proposal for a trust charter. Coinbase applied for a national trust charter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on October 3. Coinbase claimed that if licensed, it would be able to provide goods and services more quickly and further innovate to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. Factually, the licence helps companies that aren’t banks manage their own reserves and take care of assets for institutions. The exchange added that if approved, the charter would continue to provide Coinbase with the opportunity to introduce new products outside of custody, such as payments and related services, encouraging wider institutional adoption. However, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) and ICBA requested that the OCC deny Coinbase’s application for a national trust bank charter. On November 3, the group submitted a separate letter to the OCC warning that Coinbase’s application raises systemic and legal concerns. The letter urged that the Coinbase application should be rejected unless the company provides more information about its business model. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Selling put options on CRCL, specifically the February $65 strike, offers a 22%+ annualized yield and a lower entry point if assigned. CRCL's revenue growth is driven by stablecoin adoption, but falling rates and rising costs present near-term headwinds and risks. We maintain a Hold rating on CRCL, and we favor selling puts over buying shares outright for yield-oriented investors seeking lower-risk exposure. A few months ago, we wrote an article titled "" How We're Earning A 14%+ Yield Selling Puts On Circle Internet Group. "" In it, we laid out a strategy for earning a significant yield from Circle Internet Group's ( CRCL ) recent IPO, by selling far out of the money put options that promised to pay out a 14% annualized cash yield. While we thought - and still think - that CRCL will perform well over the long term as a company, at the time, the stock was trading around $240 per share, which, in our eyes, was an extremely premium valuation. In recent months, shares are down roughly 60% from highs, as market hype around stablecoins has dissipated and the company’s first earnings report showed rapidly deteriorating gross margins. This has been a disaster for those who purchased shares during the post-IPO rally. However, the conservative trade idea that we recommended produced exactly the returns we thought it would, as Circle's stock held up above $80 per share through mid-October: TradingView Seeking Alpha Investors who took this trade pocketed $380 per contract - or a 4.5% return - in just 117 days, and didn't have to take assignment of the stock. At present, Circle is in a slightly different position. Shares are much cheaper, volatility has fallen, and the company has announced a number of new initiatives that we expect will grow future revenues meaningfully. That said, shares are still expensive, and the ongoing rate cut cycle we're seeing will likely present a significant revenue headwind in the short and medium term. Thus, we’re still not quite willing to pay up for Circle's shares. Instead, we're recommending a similar trade to the one we highlighted in June - that selling put options on CRCL will likely generate substantial yield with relatively minimal risk, especially versus holding the stock outright. Today, we'll cover recent updates with CRCL, give our perspective on the upcoming earnings report, and highlight a 'short put' trading opportunity we think looks attractive. Sound good? Let’s dive in. The Thesis To start, let’s cover our general thesis behind Circle, and why we think the company is poised to grow considerably over the next 5 to 10 years. In short, we, broadly, believe that an increasing share of transactions will move towards crypto markets over time. This is due to the fact that crypto markets provide near instant settlement, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Not only that, but transaction fees are typically very low in Crypto, allowing for a near-frictionless exchange of value. As decentralized payment networks propagate, we expect a larger share of payment volume, commercial volume, and even more complex financial transactions like trading and lending, to take place on public and corporate blockchains. As use of these new money networks becomes more widespread, demand for stable value exchange will also grow. This is where stablecoins fit into the current crypto ecosystem. Sure, bitcoin is the 'gold standard', and is often thought of as digital gold, but the asset has too much volatility on a day-to-day basis to be used for transactions, treasury management, payment accounts, etc. Stablecoins bridge the gap between Fiat currencies - which is what we’ve used in the past - to digital currencies, which is where we see the future of money heading. Circle is the largest public issuer of stablecoins, which it primarily does through its USDC product, which has almost 30% global market share. The business is simple: as customers mint and use USDC, they leave their Fiat currency deposited with CRCL, who, in turn, invests into treasuries that produce significant reserve income. This is CRCL's primary revenue source, and on a digital currency stock of tens of billions of dollars, CRCL produced over $2.1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, almost all of which came from US treasuries. Circle has three main levers that it uses to produce revenue. First off, rates are key. If rates go down, then the return that Circle earns on its reserve holdings also decreases. Right now, this is a negative, but it also positions CRCL as a huge beneficiary in a rising rate environment. Secondly, another one of CRCL's levers is the market cap of its overall outstanding stablecoins. This is an input that the company has much more control over, and thus, CRCL is invested in aggressively distributing and driving network effects for its three core financial products, USDC, EURC, and UYSC. CRCL expects a ~40% compounded annual growth rate for the overall stablecoin market, so if USDC can retain or grow market share, then there’s a significant growth opportunity here. Finally, CRCL offers value-add services on top of its digital money ecosystem. Many of the firm's recent innovations, like the Circle Payment Network and Circle Gateway, are primarily designed to boost adoption of USDC, but we expect that as the product ecosystem matures, CRCL will have significant leverage to charge additional fees for value add services, similar to what Visa ( V ) and MasterCard ( MA ) do right now. Earnings While we’re bullish on the company, CRCL's Q2 earnings numbers were a mixed bag. From an operational standpoint, the company announced its new public blockchain , Arc , and announced developments with the Circle Payment Network, Circle Gateway, Circle CCTP, and more. We expect these investments will pay off handsomely as the overall market share of stablecoins grows: IR On the flip side, the company’s actual earnings came in much weaker than expected. The company reported $658 million in revenue - an all-time quarterly high (at least for the public numbers we have available) - but massive increases in the cost of revenues drove gross profit margins negative to the tune of $252 million in the Q2 alone. Stacked on top of the operating expenses of around $73 million for the quarter, CRCL produced negative operating income of $325 million. This massive increase in the cost of revenue represents continued investment in the distribution of CRCL's stablecoin network, including rewards paid out to deposit holders on platforms like Coinbase ( COIN ). At the same time, the company has traditionally kept gross profit positive, at least for the four quarters preceding Q2. It’s clear that CRCL is allocating IPO proceeds towards growth, as opposed to improving profitability. Broadly, this makes sense to us, but for investors looking at headline numbers, it obscures the story considerably. Rates have also gone down over the last year, and so the linear increase we'd expect to see in CRCL's revenues, as a result of the increased Stablecoin market cap, has not been fully reflected. This is the interest rate headwind we mentioned earlier. Thankfully, Q3, which was just announced, showed a number of improvements. Analysts were estimating revenue of $700 million, with an EPS estimate of around $0.18, and CRCL managed to produce revenue of roughly $740 million and EPS of $0.82, which were both positive surprises. Gross margins went up, which was a bit of a relief, but more broadly, we remain interested in the underlying 'operating' metrics like Meaningful Wallets, overall distribution, and market share. In our view, if the 'inputs' to the economic machine are positive, then sooner or later, the financial results will take care of themselves. Meaningful Wallets grew up to 6.3 million, and we'd like to see this metric grow even more quickly in the future as network effects propagate. Similarly, we're happy with USDC's market share of roughly 30%, but this number will need to move north for CRCL to gain truly impressive economics: IR At present, shares are trading at a P/S ratio of roughly 7.3x, but analysts expect revenues to grow to $6.2 billion by 2028, which should shrink this ratio considerably, to below 4x. All told, we'd prefer to get shares a little bit lower than they’re currently trading, but we’re much happier with the value proposition in shares than we were six months ago, especially following the recent selloff. The Trade Our favorite way to play the stock is still by selling put options on shares. Particularly, we like the idea of selling the February 19th, $65 strike put options: sofi.com Contracts are currently trading between $3.55 and $4.45 per contract, and we expect that you could get a contract filled at around $3.80, implying a $380 profit per contract if shares of CRCL stay above $65 over the next 99 days. At this price, investors stand to make 6.2% - or a little bit more than ~23% annualized - on their money, assuming CRCL options to stay above the $65 strike price. In the event that shares trade below $65, option sellers still get the aforementioned yield, but they may also be assigned shares of Circle. In that event, then investors can get shares of CRCL with a cost basis in the low 60s, which, we think, is a significant long-term value. As a result, selling options on CRCL looks like a win-win trade - either you get a robust cash-on-cash return over the next few months, or you get a solid 'buy-the-dip' entry point into CRCL's long-term story. Risks Of course, there are risks associated with this trade, and we'll point out three of those now. First off, CRCL has a number of revenue levers that we talked about earlier. Rates are a key risk for CRCL's long-term health, and if rates stay lower for longer, than it will have a serious impact on the company's overall profitability. That would make shares considerably more expensive than they currently look, making an entry point at around $70 per share potentially less attractive. Secondly, over the course of this option trade, we’re expecting an earnings report. Everyone knows that earnings are typically a volatile time for investors - so these events could send the stock materially lower. This has implications for short-term profitability for option sellers. The IPO lock-up also expires this week, which is a consideration. Finally, if you sell options in CRCL, then even if the stock's price goes to zero overnight, you’ll still be forced to purchase shares at $65 per share, representing a material capital impairment. This profile is no different than holding shares outright, but it’s worth mentioning for those who haven’t traded options before. Summary Overall, we think selling put options on CRCL (again) is a great use of capital in today’s market. The 22%+ annualized yield represents a significant income to yield oriented investors, and a cheaper entry price point into CRCL's long-term story, in the event of assignment - looks like a strong value proposition. As a result, we still rate shares a 'Hold', but we think selling $65 strike options could be a great use of your time and money.

Whale Alert just reported a massive 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury, sending ripples through the cryptocurrency community. This significant event represents one of the largest stablecoin creations we’ve seen recently, and it’s crucial to understand what this means for investors and the broader market. Why Was 250 Million USDC Minted? The recent minting of 250 million USDC represents a substantial injection of liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. When Circle, the company behind USDC, mints new tokens, it typically indicates growing demand from institutional investors or exchanges needing additional stablecoin supply. This massive USDC minted event suggests several market developments: Increased trading activity across major cryptocurrency exchanges Growing institutional interest in stablecoin-based transactions Potential preparation for large-scale crypto purchases or investments Enhanced market liquidity for decentralized finance protocols How Does USDC Minting Actually Work? Understanding the process behind USDC creation helps explain why this 250 million USDC minted event matters. When someone wants to acquire USDC, they deposit US dollars with Circle’s banking partners. The company then creates an equivalent amount of USDC tokens on the blockchain. This process ensures each USDC remains fully backed by real US dollar reserves, maintaining its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The recent USDC minted transaction was detected by Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency movements. Such substantial minting activities often precede significant market movements or indicate growing confidence in stablecoin adoption. What Impact Does Massive USDC Creation Have on Crypto Markets? The injection of 250 million USDC into the market creates several immediate effects that traders should monitor closely. This substantial USDC minted event typically signals: Increased buying power for cryptocurrency acquisitions Potential price support for major digital assets Enhanced DeFi liquidity across lending and borrowing platforms Reduced volatility during large trading operations Moreover, when we see significant amounts of USDC minted, it often indicates that large players are positioning themselves for upcoming market activity. This could mean everything from institutional accumulation to preparation for major token launches or ecosystem developments. Should Investors Be Concerned About Stablecoin Minting? While massive stablecoin creation might seem alarming at first glance, the 250 million USDC minted event actually reflects healthy market dynamics. Stablecoins serve as the backbone of cryptocurrency trading and decentralized finance. When demand increases, the supply must expand accordingly to maintain market efficiency. However, investors should always monitor these developments and consider: Market timing of large stablecoin injections Correlation with price movements in major cryptocurrencies Overall market sentiment and trading volumes Regulatory developments affecting stablecoin operations What Does the Future Hold for USDC and Stablecoins? The consistent growth in USDC circulation, including this recent 250 million USDC minted transaction, demonstrates the increasing importance of stablecoins in the digital asset ecosystem. As cryptocurrency adoption expands, we can expect to see more frequent and larger stablecoin minting events to support growing transaction volumes and DeFi activity. Looking ahead, the evolution of stablecoins will likely focus on: Enhanced regulatory compliance and transparency Cross-chain interoperability across multiple blockchain networks Improved yield generation opportunities for holders Expanded use cases beyond trading and DeFi Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, it means new tokens are created and added to circulation. This happens when users deposit US dollars with Circle’s partners, and equivalent USDC tokens are issued on the blockchain. Is USDC minting good for cryptocurrency markets? Yes, USDC minting generally indicates growing demand and provides essential liquidity for trading and DeFi activities. It shows confidence in the stablecoin ecosystem and supports overall market health. How often does large-scale USDC minting occur? Large-scale USDC minting happens regularly based on market demand. While 250 million USDC represents a significant amount, such events occur multiple times monthly as the stablecoin ecosystem expands. Can anyone mint USDC tokens? No, only authorized institutions can directly mint USDC through Circle’s regulated partners. Regular users acquire USDC through exchanges or by depositing dollars with approved entities. Does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Yes, large USDC minting events can influence prices by increasing available buying power and market liquidity. However, the impact varies based on overall market conditions and how the newly minted USDC gets utilized. Is my USDC safe after large minting events? Yes, USDC remains fully backed by dollar-denominated reserves regardless of minting volume. Each token maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through transparent reserve management.

The stock, which trades under the ticker ZONE on the NYSE American, fell to a record low of $0.3818 this week and ended Thursday’s session down almost 12%. Source: Yahoo Finance The decline continued into Friday, deepening concerns over its crypto-heavy balance sheet. Dogecoin Strategy Drags CleanCore Lower as Operating Costs Skyrocket The plunge comes just days after CleanCore reported its fiscal first-quarter results for the period ending September 30, revealing a widening net loss of $13.4 million, compared to $0.9 million during the same period last year. Source: MarketScreener While revenue doubled year-over-year to $0.9 million, and gross profit improved to $0.5 million, the firm’s spending surged. General and administrative expenses soared to $8.6 million from $0.9 million, driven by professional fees, stock-based compensation, new salaries, and insurance costs tied to its Dogecoin treasury rollout. The company has placed Dogecoin at the center of its financial strategy. CleanCore closed a $175 million private placement to build its “official” Dogecoin Treasury, partnering with House of Doge, using Bitstamp by Robinhood as its trading venue. The firm has accumulated over 733 million DOGE, worth about $117.5 million as of November 12. It reiterated its long-term objective of acquiring 5% of Dogecoin’s circulating supply to expand the token’s real-world utility. CEO Clayton Adams said the firm seeks to position Dogecoin as a “trusted reserve asset” and remains committed despite recent market volatility. “Our financial results during the quarter reflect several one-time expenses related to our treasury strategy transaction, while our core business experienced growth and cash flow on a stand-alone basis,” Adams said. Source: Cryptonews But the timing has been ruthless. Dogecoin’s price has fallen over 21% in the past month, slipping below $0.17 as it tests a long-term support level that has held since late 2023. Analysts warn that DOGE is showing a severe technical breakdown, with momentum turning bearish and key indicators weakening. Source: TradingView DOGE is currently trading near $0.163, down almost 7% in the last 24 hours. A break below the multi-year support trend line could trigger a broader decline, potentially marking the end of the cycle that began in late 2023. CleanCore Shares Lag Even as Corporate Dogecoin Adoption Accelerates CleanCore’s largest DOGE purchases came at an average price above current levels. Its first major acquisition on September 5 totaled 285.4 million DOGE at around $0.238 per token, followed by additional purchases that pushed its treasury above 700 million DOGE by mid-October . The company briefly reported over $20 million in unrealized gains earlier in the quarter, but those have evaporated in the downturn. NYSE American-listed CleanCore Solutions purchased an additional 100 million Dogecoin tokens, expanding its holdings past 600 million DOGE, targeting 1 billion within 30 days. #Doge #Treasury https://t.co/3CvWd1MUJR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 The Dogecoin bet attracted more than 80 institutional investors, including Pantera, GSR, FalconX, and Borderless Capital. CleanCore’s treasury plan also aligns with a broader wave of corporate participation in Dogecoin-related initiatives. Among those developments, DogeHash Technologies is expanding its mining footprint after securing a $2.5 million loan from Thumzup Media to deploy more than 500 new ASIC miners, bringing its fleet to over 4,000 machines by year-end. While these broader ecosystem moves have shown strong momentum, CleanCore’s stock has failed to benefit.

Yet beneath the noise, a different trend is emerging among informed XRP holders: the shift toward predictable yield. Instead of relying solely on price appreciation, many are adopting staking models that generate returns regardless of market direction. XRP Tundra has positioned its Cryo Vault system at the center of this shift, offering staking mechanics designed for users who want their assets to work around the clock. The approach aligns with a broader move toward utility-driven growth, where long-term holders prioritize daily earnings over speculative timing. A Utility Model Built for Predictable Returns The foundation of XRP Tundra’s staking ecosystem is the dual-token model, where TUNDRA-S powers utility functions such as staking while TUNDRA-X manages governance and reserve-related operations. TUNDRA-S currently sits in Phase 11 of the presale at $0.183, offering a 9% token bonus with each purchase. Every participant also receives TUNDRA-X at a reference value of $0.0915 at no additional cost. The presale has already surpassed $2.5 million raised, highlighting steady accumulation from users preparing for staking activation. Staking will begin once the ecosystem launches, and presale buyers secure automatic access to the Cryo Vaults. The model is designed to function independently of market conditions by rewarding commitment rather than speculation. This structure has become increasingly relevant as investors look for ways to generate consistent yield without relying on short-term price events. The project’s whitepaper details how staking factors into the broader architecture, including how rewards scale with commitment and vault selection. The appeal lies in control: participants choose their preferred staking tier based on flexibility, holding period and desired APY, allowing them to earn steadily even when XRP’s market price fluctuates. Liquid, Balanced and Premium Cryo Vaults Offer Three Yield Profiles The Cryo Vault system is divided into three staking tiers, each designed for specific user behaviors. Liquid Staking caters to active traders who want flexibility above all else. It offers 4–6% APY, no lock-up period and instant withdrawal. With a minimum of 100 TUNDRA-S, it represents the lowest-risk way to earn yield without sacrificing mobility. For holders seeking enhanced returns without a long-term lock-in, Balanced Staking introduces a structured commitment period. Users stake a minimum of 500 TUNDRA-S for 30 days, earning 8–12% APY. Withdrawals become available immediately after the lock-up ends. This tier appeals to users aiming for a middle ground between flexibility and return without the higher exposure of extended commitments. The highest returns come through Premium Staking, designed for long-term believers. With a 90-day lock-up, minimum 1,000 TUNDRA-S, and rewards ranging from 15–20% APY, it offers the strongest compounding potential. The risk level is classified as medium-high due to the commitment length, but the reward profile appeals to participants building multi-month staking strategies. Each tier is detailed extensively in the project’s technical documentation, outlining how reward mechanisms scale and how vault structures balance yield with risk. By offering three distinct approaches, the system ensures that both conservative and high-yield participants can earn passively without relying on market speculation. Verified Infrastructure Strengthens Long-Term Yield Confidence Yield systems only function when underlying contracts are secure, and XRP Tundra has built its staking roadmap on a foundation of independent verification. The project has completed audits from SolidProof , Cyberscope and FreshCoins . Each firm evaluated different portions of the ecosystem, from smart contract logic to token authority configurations, and their findings consistently confirmed stable architecture with no critical vulnerabilities. Concerns regarding team anonymity have been addressed through full KYC verification by Vital Block . The verification document, accessible through their GitHub repository, confirms that all key team members have undergone identity checks, reinforcing accountability while preserving operational security. These measures directly answer the most common community query — is XRP Tundra legit — with documented evidence rather than marketing claims. This verification footprint benefits stakers directly. Vault rewards ultimately depend on the integrity of underlying contracts and liquidity mechanisms, and XRP Tundra’s audit suite reduces structural risk for participants preparing for multi-month commitments. Staking Makes Market Cycles Less Important The appeal of staking becomes clearest in periods of market uncertainty. While prices fluctuate daily, yield does not. Staked TUNDRA-S continues earning throughout volatility, effectively decoupling returns from short-term sentiment. This mindset is increasingly common among long-term participants who prefer predictable accumulation over attempting to time market bottoms. A recent analysis from Crypto Vlog highlighted this shift, noting that staking-oriented ecosystems tend to outperform during broader market turbulence due to their ability to generate consistent on-chain returns. The discussion pointed to XRP Tundra’s presale activity as early evidence of this trend, with participants accumulating tokens ahead of Cryo Vault activation rather than waiting for speculative catalysts. As the staking model goes live, the ecosystem will reward holders who prioritize disciplined accumulation. Whether users select Liquid, Balanced or Premium tiers, the principle remains the same: predictable yield becomes a counterweight to unpredictable market cycles.

The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 7%, trading around $95,893. CoinGlass data shows significant liquidations in the market, with total liquidations crossing $1 billion in the past 24 hours. Out of this, $887 million were long positions, while $135 million were short positions. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Nearly $900 Million One-Day Outflow US spot Bitcoin ETFs registered total net outflows of $869 million on Thursday, the second-largest single-day outflow on record. According to data from SosoValue, the Grayscale Mini Trust ( BTC ) recorded the largest outflow of $318 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $256 million. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded $119 million in outflows while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $47 million in net outflows. Investors have withdrawn $2.64 billion from Bitcoin ETFs in the past three weeks, indicating industry-wide caution thanks to macroeconomic uncertainty and delayed economic data. Thursday’s outflows coincide with Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 for the first time since June. BTC’s decline can be linked with a surge in liquidations. According to data from November 13, markets saw $658 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin responsible for around $165 million. Data from November 14 reported liquidations of over $850 million, primarily bullish bets. Bitfarms To Shut Mining Operations Bitfarms has confirmed plans to shutter its Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining operations over the next two years as it pivots to AI. The company plans to convert its operations to artificial intelligence and high-compute data centers. The announcement comes after the company’s third-quarter results reported deeper losses. Bitfarm plans to begin its transition by converting its 18-megawatt Bitcoin mining site in Washington to support AI. It expects the transition to be completed by December 2026. The firm then plans to wind down the rest of its mining operations through 2026 and 2027. Bitfarms CEO Ben Gagnon stated that the conversion of the mining site to support AI could “potentially produce more net operating income than we have ever generated with Bitcoin mining,” adding that Bitcoin mining is becoming increasingly competitive because miners can “go to cheaper locations, higher-risk locations, more remote locations” compared to AI data centers. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin ( BTC ) sank to $95,000 as bearish sentiment and a fresh wave of risk aversion dragged prices lower. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 7% as its downtrend intensified. The recent slump has wiped out over $450 billion in value since October as large investment funds, ETFs, and corporate treasuries, once key sources of support, have paused purchases, putting BTC under even more pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency fell below $105,000 on Wednesday and settled at $101,639. It faced substantial volatility and selling pressure on Thursday. As a result, the price slipped below $100,000 and settled at $99,614. Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 5%. BTC’s selloff has intensified over the past 24 hours, with the flagship cryptocurrency down 8%, as it struggles to stay above $95,000. Jake Ostrovskis, head of OTC at Wintermute, attributes the slump to heavy spot selling, stating, “Bitcoin was already under pressure from heavy spot selling and corporate-hedging activity, with traders avoiding alt coins almost entirely. When crypto-specific narratives thin out, correlations to traditional assets increase. This is driving today’s move.” 10x analysts believe the market has entered a confirmed bear cycle. The analysts highlighted weakening ETF inflows, continuous selling by Bitcoin whales, and a slump in retail interest. 10x warned of further declines, highlighting $93,000 as a key level that could arrest the slide. 10x analysts stated in a note, “There’s no longer the smell of a bear market — Bitcoin and most crypto-linked assets are in a bear market.” According to market data, long-term holders have sold over 815,000 BTC in the past 30 days. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.15% on Friday and settling at $109,555. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday as BTC rose 0.45% and 0.44% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,536. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. The bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,468. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869. BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price slipped below $100,000 again on Friday, falling to a low of $99,170 before recovering and settling at $103,284, ultimately rising nearly 2%. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rose 1.23% and settled at $105,979. Buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC fell nearly 3% and settled at $103,009.

Starknet, Zcash, and Dash were among the few to record strong daily gains, showing that capital continues to rotate into names with distinct usage patterns even when sentiment across the market remains cautious. Liquidity has stayed consistent across active venues, allowing certain coins to advance without relying on extreme leverage or short-term speculation. The current setup favors tokens with steady depth, visible projects, and narratives tied to functional updates rather than broad optimism. Starknet Advances on Layer-2 Activity Starknet is currently trading near $0.178 , up around 25% in 24 hours, with turnover expanding on multiple exchanges. The move coincides with rising engagement around Starknet-based applications and bridge inflows, pointing toward incremental user growth and sustained deployment activity within its ecosystem. While the hackathon that began on November 13 added visibility to the project, the increase in trading appears more grounded in consistent usage and layer-2 participation. 1/ Zypherpunk Hackathon is now officially live, and Starknet is backing it with $10K in prizes. With a based lineup, a real mission, and a clear vision, this one hits different. Join Ztarknet and build the future of privacy https://t.co/JarpjujVsr pic.twitter.com/OSjFrrhylM — Starknet (BTCFi arc) (@Starknet) November 13, 2025 When transaction costs on major chains rise, attention often shifts toward scaling networks that can absorb that flow efficiently. Starknet fits that profile, particularly after a steady series of tooling and developer updates that reinforce its position within Ethereum’s rollup framework. Maintaining this pace will depend on whether volume remains distributed across multiple venues and if open interest continues to build alongside cash trading—signs of balanced participation rather than event-driven enthusiasm. Zcash Extends Its Privacy Recovery Zcash is trading near $573, up roughly 18% in 24 hours, extending a gradual climb that has persisted through November. Activity has widened across several exchanges, while price support continues to form near previous consolidation areas, suggesting a durable two-way flow. Zcash Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The renewed focus on privacy infrastructure and an uptick in wallet engagement contributed to the continuance of ZEC momentum. Miner consistency and liquidity improvements across core pairs have also supported steadier trading conditions. Privacy tokens often see rotation when other sectors face uncertainty, and Zcash’s liquidity profile has allowed it to maintain a controlled uptrend even during periods of reduced risk appetite. Dash Tracks Higher on Payment-Related Flows Dash is now trading close to $73 , up 9% in 24 hours, building on last week’s base with a measured expansion in daily volume. The coin’s performance is often linked to payment corridor activity and interest in remittance-oriented systems. Current data show steady order book depth and a return of two-way participation, factors that help sustain its price structure. The movement appears orderly, with consistent throughput across trading venues and reduced slippage compared with earlier in the month. These elements often coincide with periods of renewed merchant or peer-to-peer activity rather than speculative bursts. Reading Altcoin Season Rotation The current pattern across these assets shows how selective interest continues to define the later stages of the cycle. Starknet’s traction comes from scaling use cases, Zcash from privacy functionality, and Dash from ongoing transactional relevance. Each shows liquidity conditions that are strong enough to support sustained trading rather than isolated spikes. Durability depends on whether this balance between participation and liquidity can persist. If volumes remain well distributed and open interest aligns with spot activity, altcoin rotation could continue through November. If not, prices may revert to established ranges until the next visible catalyst emerges.

This has been a constant trend in the cryptocurrency market. An early adopter of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the chance to benefit in a similar manner. Experts in the field expect massive returns for early Mutuum investors because of the fully audited launch of the V1 protocol and presale which showed gabbing interest. Meaning, with a $300 investment, one can rake in $30,000 by 2026, excluding the presale and Mutuum staking rewards. This has been the trend with Cardano and multiple other assets with similar characteristics during the previous bull cycles. Presale Momentum Of MUTM Unmatched in the cryptocurrency markets for raising funds, the presale for Mutuum Finance has been nothing short of remarkable. The project has been able to raise $18,700,000 while acquiring 17,950 holders. Currently, the project is in phase 6 of the 7 phase process and is able to provide tokens for $0.035. The tokens in this phase are nearly 90% claimed, indicating a strong demand. Phase 7 has a set price of $0.040, indicating a 20% price increase. This set price is a stepping stone for the token launch slated for $0.06. This immense price increase has been the trend for other crypto assets, peaking during parabolic phases. To increase accessibility and encourage participation in the presale, the payment system is automated. As a result, global users can purchase tokens without any purchase barriers. The V1 Protocol: Catalyzing a Price Surge The main reason for the anticipated price explosion is the planned release for Q4 2025 of the Mutuum Finance V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This will move the project from a development stage to an operational, testable product, including the innovative liquidity pools, mtTokens, and the liquidator bot. The launch is anticipated to provide a new layer of market affirmation and will create a stampede of liquidity willing for safe and secure DeFi real yield. The increase in demand for such services and utility is the reason for the bullish price estimates, as operational platforms that have definable market monetization targets are valued higher than projected and speculative platforms. A Historical Precedent: The Cardano Blueprint In the case of Cardano (ADA), the performance speaks for itself, which serves as a proxy for the potential ROI for MUTM. In 2020, the price of ADA was relatively pegged, trading at a low of around $0.02. The next 12 to 15 months ADA started developing the ecosystem with the introduction of a bear market. From $0.02, the price shot up to $3.10, with the introduction of magic contracts, which resulted in the price skyrocketing, leading to a never-seen-before ROI of over 15,000%. When projects of this caliber hit certain developmental areas during a bull market, the profit gained is often staggering, which this case is further proved by Cardano. The same is said for Mutuum Finance, which is on an analogous trajectory, with the V1 launch of the product acting as the ‘smart moments’ that marries the vision with the ever-changing market. From $300 to $30,000: The Path to 100x Gains MUTM’s current trajectory and historical context explains how an investment can grow from $300 to $30,000. Consider that 8,570 MUTM tokens can be purchased at the Phase 6 price of $0.035, and the token only needs to reach $3.50 to achieve a 100x return. As the project possesses a dual lending market, a native stablecoin, and Layer-2 expansion, there is a feasible scenario where the project achieves a market cap of a few billion dollars during the 2026 bull run. Once the token goes to major exchanges, and the wider audience is the investor base, the expected neutral supply and proven utility can easily hoist the price to these levels, thus turning the investment into a fortune. There has Never been a Better Time for Astounding Returns The closing windows of a presale phase, the launch of a much-awaited product, and an advantageous market phase has created a perfect environment for phenomenal growth. The path drawn by the earlier giants like Cardano is sufficient enough in itself to understand how this growth will happen. The investors in search of a genuine project with potential for a 100x return, the facts need no justification. The presale offering of $0.035 for $MUTM is the last chance. The countdown to an opportunity for potential generational wealth has begun, alongside the launch of V1 protocol, which is only a few months away.

Higher speed, more transactions per block and near-instant consensus are expected with the Firedancer and the Alpenglow updates. Why Solana’s Roadmap Matters Now The Solana roadmap matters as the network is more widely adopted for both retail on-chain activity and decentralized finance. The Solana roadmap for 2025 focused on both the chain’s technical side, and on expanding as a platform, especially for US-based traders and Web3 users. From High-Performance Promise to Real-World Applications Solana scaling is happening at an accelerated pace, aiming to create the largest decentralized app ecosystem. In the past year, Solana added multiple apps, leading all other chains in terms of app-generated revenues. Key Adoption Challenges Solana Has Faced (outages, client monoculture, scalability) Solana was not adopted overnight. The expansion in 2024 and 2025 followed years of bear market, even putting doubt on the chain’s survival. Solana was created to be scalable since inception, and has not, so far, created any strong need for building Layer 2 chains . One of the reasons for skepticism was Solana’s episode of network outages, when validators could not reach consensus on block production. Solana also started out with a tight-knit community, which created an isolated ecosystem with a different culture. The chain expanded its reach and mass appeal only after the addition of popular apps, such as meme coin launchpads. How the 2024-26 Roadmap Aims to Shift from Speculation to Infrastructure Adoption The 2024 bull market brought Solana back on the map. This time around, the SOL token grew slowly, while the market focused on Solana-based apps and real use cases. The roadmap running up to 2026 now takes into account the possibility for a sustainable ecosystem and a Solana developer ecosystem growth, instead of mere speculation. The increased use cases for Solana allow the network to be viewed as key infrastructure in decentralized finance and other on-chain tasks. The Solana network expanded its liquid staking, opening up new opportunities for decentralized finance. The appearance of Solana spot and staking ETFs meant SOL carried value for traditional finance. The emergence of treasuries also viewed SOL as an underlying asset for growth, instead of mere price speculation. As of October 2025, SOL traded near $200, reflecting expanded DeFi and DEX trading, meme activity, lending, and more. Major Upgrades on the Horizon The two major upgrades for Solana are the full Firedancer upgrade, and the Alpenglow consensus upgrade, with the goal of increasing transactions per second and speeding up consensus finality. Firedancer Validator Client Firedancer is a Solana validator client developed by the Jump Crypto team, with the goal of boosting the existing infrastructure. The Solana Firedancer upgrade has been tested since 2024 in the ‘Frankendancer’ hybrid version. A production-grade client has been rolling out to mainnet validators during 2025. The validator client is written in C/C++, re-implementing much of Solana’s consensus and transaction-processing logic. The Firedancer validator code is a third-party client, currently in advanced testing and limited mainnet use. The goal of Firedancer is to make the Solana network run on diverse validator clients, reducing the risk of failures and network outages. In internal tests, Firedancer has targeted handling up to 1M transactions per second (TPS), enough for mass scalability. As of October 2025, Solana reported 905 to 971 active validators (based on reporting technique or short-term shifts), down from over 1,300 at one point. The validators currently run Solana’s native validator node software Agave, Jito-Solana, optimized for MEV, and the early version of Firedancer. An estimated 207 validators ran the Frankendancer version as of October 2025, up from 32 validators in June. Today, most MEV-optimized orderflow still runs through Jito-Solana. But Firedancer is being integrated into Solana’s MEV and block-scheduling stack. Firedancer essentially restarts the way the blockchain handles its transaction flow, creating a new opportunity for Solana scaling. Alpenglow Consensus Upgrade The Alpenglow protocol was first announced in May 2025, suggesting a new approach to Solana consensus. The Alpenglow consensus mechanism redesigns Solana’s approach to coordinating validators. Alpenglow employs Votor, a lightweight voting protocol that finalizes blocks using a single or dual-run voting process. The mechanism reduces latency to milliseconds, while eliminating gossip between validators. The protocol has an inner structure of certification, and is able to notarize, skip, or finalize blocks based on validator votes. Validators use cryptographically protected messaging to exchange votes and prove consensus. Alpenglow will also include Rotor, a data distribution protocol, which will come at a later update. Alpenglow is expected to launch a public testnet by the end of 2025. The proposal for the upgrade passed in September 2025, and the mainnet application is expected in early 2026. Doubling Block Space & Compute Units A key part of the Solana roadmap 2025 is the doubling of block space, as well as the increase of compute units per block by 25%. The changes may be implemented after the chain votes on increasing the compute units limit per block. The Solana Firedancer upgrade will be part of the technology available to achieve the increased block capacity. The SIMD-0256 proposal has set the plan to increase the compute units per block from 48M to 60M. Compute units track the computing power needed to realize a Solana transaction. A higher limit aims for the execution of more transactions per block. Solana already increased block capacity by 25% in 2025, aiming for another big expansion in the last quarter. The main goal presented for that expansion is to prepare Solana for handling mainstream financial operations at a high capacity. Solana aims to become the rails for serving the global financial markets, ensuring speed for its stablecoin transfers, DeFi, and other applications. Improved Market Microstructure / Application-Controlled Execution (ACE) The Solana updates will shift the network toward app-based control and better transaction ordering. This will allow Solana to make its transactions more fair, avoiding aggressive MEV ordering and attacks on user activity. Ecosystem & Developer Tooling Upgrades Along with the improved chain features, Solana will expand its mobile stack. Apps will be able to build storefronts and boost real economic activity. Developers will also have access to ZK-compression, a new primitive for the creation of tokens at a fraction of the cost. Technical Impacts Solana has been launched relatively fast, requiring tweaks to its scalability and consensus. The upcoming Solana upgrades for 24-2026 will have a significant impact on app usage, user experience, expenses and most of all, transaction capacity and speed. Throughput & Finality The Solana Alpenglow consensus will result in finality in under 150 millisecond (ms). The rapid settlement, which does not wait, will be key to carrying high-frequency applications with real-time transactions. Waiting for an inefficient consensus, or suffering more outages is incompatible with Solana’s goals of becoming a finance hub. Trust & Resilience Different validator clients diversify the implementation of consensus, reducing the risk of bugs affecting all validators simultaneously. This helps avoid single-point failures that come from relying on one client. Currently, more validators are testing alternative client software, preparing for future adoption of newer, more efficient clients, especially Solana Firedancer. Cost & Friction Solana has already shown its capabilities as a fast and scalable solution, managing to carry the 2021 bull market with an inflow of DeFi, NFTs , and other transactions. In 2025, the Solana developer ecosystem growth is even more active. The upcoming Firedancer and Alpenglow updates aim to lower friction and transaction costs even more. The decreased, practically instant transaction speed is up to regular Web2 standards, making the Solana experience entirely frictionless and more user-friendly. Developer Hosting & dApp Deployment A more scalable environment will bring a more robust Solana developer ecosystem growth. Solana has already proven it can carry some of the most active apps, with the biggest fee production. Now, those apps can fulfill their goals even cheaper and faster, rivaling seamless Web2 activity. As of October 2025, Solana also demonstrated its validator ecosystem was resilient to cloud service outages. Equipping validators with various clients and more transactions per block will be one of the main factors for Solana growth in the coming years. Adoption Implications Developer Growth As of October 2025, Solana research showed the chain invited around 1,161 active app developers, in addition to 28 core developers. Innovation was almost constant in 2025, but Solana expects additional developer growth based on the 2025 roadmap updates. Solana is still behind the Ethereum Virtual Machine stack, which has over 4,800 monthly active app developers. Some of the upcoming development may be linked to institutional demand, fast payments, liquid staking, liquid re-staking, and other activities tailored to highly scalable financial operations. Institutional Integration Solana’s goals is to reach out to institutions, offering seamless infrastructure. As of October 28, 2025, Solana announced its network would be used by Western Union to launch a new stablecoin for low-cost, instant payments and remittances. Since the launch of Solana in 2020, the ecosystem evolved to carry out different tasks. In 2025, Solana expanded as one of the biggest carriers of USDC transactions. The upcoming Solana upgrades will further transform Solana into a network capable of offering solutions to institutional finance. Mass User Onboarding Solana apps have helped to achieve mass user onboarding. With a faster chain and more robust consensus mechanism, this process will accelerate. Solana activity hinged on the adoption of highly accessible wallets, with tools to reach all assets in the ecosystem. With the growth of user-friendly apps like Phantom, Jupiter, and ongoing mobile integration, Solana shows a commitment to retail users. The Solana ecosystem updates are happening both at the protocol and the app level, as all teams aim to offer an easier experience. Multi-Sector Utility Solana has gone through some of the most notable crypto cycles, tapping multiple sectors in the process. Since 2021, Solana adopted gaming and NFTs. Following the 2022-2023 bear market, Solana caught up with DeFi activity, lending, and more. The best product-market fit for Solana turned out to be meme tokens following the launch of Pump.fun . While not all sectors were financially successful, they still helped Solana test its infrastructure on multiple use cases. In 2025, the expansion of tokenization reached Solana, with tokenized bonds and other assets. Competitive Positioning As of 2025, the main chains are still competing to become the main hub for both crypto-native activity and mainstream finance. Solana has surpassed Ethereum on several metrics, especially aggregate app-generated revenues over parts of 2024–2025. For now, there is still no way to tell which chains institutions would pick. However, Solana has surpassed chains from previous crypto cycles such as Avalanche, by repositioning quickly and retaining a lively community. Risks and Roadblocks Ahead Deployment Complexity The upcoming Solana upgrades will happen at a period of peak Solana activity. So far, validators have slowly upgraded their client software to Frankendancer. However, the goal for Solana would be to upgrade to Firedancer and Alpenglow without stalling block production. Solana is used for live DEX trading and perpetual DEX swaps, meaning any slowdown could lead to losses. Validator Economics & Decentralization Solana validators vary in their goals and origins. Initially, the network started with thousands of validators, later culling them to under 1,000. As of November 14, Solana had 903 validators . Some validators are branded and prominent, while others were experimental and depended on Solana subsidies to launch. Using different clients and offering a high speed and secure consensus mechanism will further increase the decentralization of validators. Competition & Ecosystem Churn Solana is trying to compete for on-chain developers, so far surpassing most networks. Higher speeds and instant settlement may make more apps decide to launch a Solana version. Regulatory/Market Conditions Using Solana is tied to value transfers, some of which may require regulatory approval. Solana currently carries USDC tokens, which are compatible with the US Genius Act and the EU MiCA regulation. The actual state of the network or consensus mechanism are still unregulated. Timeline & Milestones to Watch 2024-2025 Near-Term Milestones The Solana network will present its new clients as hybrid clients, or run testnets until their full implementation. In the 2024-2025 stage, Solana gradually implemented Firedancer versions, and prepared for Alpenglow. 2025-2026 Medium-Term Milestones Alpenglow is the most significant milestone for Solana. The mainnet launch is expected to arrive in early 2026, possibly by the end of Q1. Alpenglow will reduce finality to 150 milliseconds (ms), allowing Solana to increase dApp speed. What Adoption Metrics to Monitor Solana is showing multiple signs of competitive results. The total value locked presents the deposits to liquidity pools or lending apps, as well as SOL locked in liquid staking. One of the good metrics for Solana are dApp revenues, which reflects the real-time usage of dApps. Institutions are choosing Solana as their main platform. Fidelity has used Solana in its crypto offerings, while R3 has picked the chain for tokenization. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval and the growth of treasury companies also signals confidence in Solana. What This Means for SOL Investors and Stakeholders Tokenomics & Staking As of Q4, Solana expected several changes to its staking mechanisms. Solana inflation is still falling, down to 4.024% with a final value of 1.5%. In 2025, Solana is already in the middle of its inflationary journey. SOL staking may decrease its rewards from new issuance, and depend on app revenues. Validators are becoming more competitive in offering passive income on SOL staking. Additionally, Solana ETFs and treasury companies may increase competition between validators. Other Solana upgrades with the arrival of Alpenglow will include the elimination of voting fees, saving 80% of validator expenses. Network Value Solana aims to become the venue for new app building. A fast and more reliable network may increase adoption for developer teams, further boosting fees, economic activity, app revenues, value locked, and general value capture through SOL. Watchlist Items Solana’s upgrades like Firedancer and Alpenglow may create conditions for increased interest in SOL. As more app teams pick Solana, the chain shows metrics of success. The actual main net upgrades may serve as price triggers to cause rallies. Ecosystem growth signals will include both retail investors, whales, and corporates adoption, combining on-chain activity metrics with value captured.",Cryptocurrency Guides|avax|Ethereum|Jump Crypto|SOL|Solana|USDC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 16:00:10

This case represents one of the most significant prosecutions involving cryptocurrency and terrorist financing in recent years. How were these Bitcoin donations concealed? Jibreel Pratt used sophisticated digital tools to hide his illegal Bitcoin donations from authorities. He employed a combination of VPN services and encryption software to mask the transfers, demonstrating how technology can be misused for criminal purposes. The case reveals the ongoing challenges law enforcement faces in tracking cryptocurrency transactions intended for illegal organizations. What does this mean for cryptocurrency regulation? This sentencing sends a strong message about the consequences of misusing digital currencies. The nine-year prison term underscores the seriousness with which authorities treat cryptocurrency-related crimes, especially those involving national security threats. However, it also raises important questions about balancing privacy concerns with the need to prevent illegal Bitcoin donations. The prosecution highlighted several key aspects of the case: Use of multiple privacy tools to conceal transactions Intentional obfuscation of fund destinations Knowledge that the Bitcoin donations supported terrorist activities Persistent efforts to evade detection over time Why are Bitcoin donations particularly concerning? Cryptocurrency transactions can pose unique challenges for law enforcement compared to traditional financial systems. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin donations makes them difficult to track and regulate. However, this case demonstrates that authorities are developing increasingly sophisticated methods to detect and prosecute such activities. Key challenges in preventing illegal Bitcoin donations include: Cross-border nature of cryptocurrency transactions Anonymity features in some digital wallets Rapid evolution of privacy-enhancing technologies Global coordination requirements between law enforcement agencies What can we learn from this Bitcoin donations case? This sentencing serves as a crucial reminder that while cryptocurrency offers many benefits, it also carries significant responsibilities. The case establishes important precedents for how Bitcoin donations to illegal organizations will be treated under current laws. It also highlights the ongoing need for public education about legal cryptocurrency use. Looking forward, this case likely signals increased scrutiny of cryptocurrency transactions, particularly those involving: Large transfers to high-risk jurisdictions Patterns consistent with money laundering Use of multiple privacy tools in combination Transactions linked to known terrorist organizations Frequently Asked Questions What specific tools did Pratt use to hide the Bitcoin donations? He used VPN services to mask his location and encryption software to secure communications about the Bitcoin donations. This combination made tracking the transactions more challenging for authorities. How were the Bitcoin donations ultimately discovered? While specific investigative methods remain confidential, the case demonstrates that law enforcement has developed sophisticated techniques to trace cryptocurrency transactions, even when privacy tools are used. What sentence could Pratt have received? The maximum sentence for such offenses can be much longer than nine years, depending on the amount of Bitcoin donations and the specific charges. The final sentence reflects various factors considered by the court. Are all Bitcoin donations illegal? No, Bitcoin donations are perfectly legal when made to legitimate organizations and properly reported. The illegality in this case stemmed from the recipient being a designated terrorist organization. How can people ensure their cryptocurrency donations are legal? Always verify the recipient’s legal status, maintain proper records, and consult with financial advisors when making significant Bitcoin donations to unfamiliar organizations. What impact will this case have on cryptocurrency regulation? This ruling likely strengthens the case for increased regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency transactions while balancing privacy concerns with security needs.

54395819,627735,1763136051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54395819.jpeg,Alderney Eyes Bitcoin Mining To Become The Next ‘BTC Island’,https://bitcoinist.com/alderney-bitcoin-mining-next-btc-island/,"At Bitcoin Amsterdam on 13 November, Alderney politician Edward Hill delivered a direct pitch to the BTC community: help turn his tiny Channel Island into a Bitcoin-first jurisdiction, anchored in renewable energy and a pro-BTC regulatory stance. Hill opened by situating Alderney politically and geographically. “I’m from the little island of Alderney, which you may know are sister islands, Jersey and Guernsey that are traditional finance centers,” he said. “We are a Channel Island, but we are semi-independent. We are part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and we’re located 8 miles from France. We are a self-governing jurisdiction. We’re [a] British crown dependency, but we’re in partial fiscal union with our sister island in the Bailiwick of Guernsey.” The Next Bitcoin Island? From there, he moved quickly to why Alderney is now courting Bitcoin. Hill stressed that the government is actively seeking a strategic partner from within the ecosystem: “Why do we think Alderney could be attractive for potential Bitcoin entrepreneurs? We’re looking for somebody to take us on this journey.” He added later, “We are not Bitcoin specialists. I am from the government of the States of Alderney, but we are here to listen and learn.” A core part of his pitch is that Alderney already knows how to build digital industries under regulation. “Most importantly, we already have an established e-gaming industry which produces a GDP around about 84 billion million,” he said, tying that to an institutional template: “We want to mirror all these success in e-gaming where we have our own e-gaming commission and we have professional staff who handle that and ditto we’ve done the same with our renewables as well. So what we’re looking to do is extend that to Bitcoin.” Hill repeatedly framed Alderney as a flexible, low-friction jurisdiction for BTC companies and individuals. “We’re small and [a] stable government and we have a big appetite to diversify our economy,” he said. “We have an open canvas for you to match the business lifestyle requirements that we know that you’re looking for and have been unable to find without having to travel probably thousands of miles to more remote offshore centers.” He hammered home Alderney’s fiscal offer in plain terms. “We’re also very attractive from a tax point of view. No corporation tax, no capital gains tax, no VAT, no inheritance tax, and personal income tax of only 20%. I’m sure you all like that.” On top of that, the island imposes no wealth-based hurdles for newcomers: “We have no financial entry requirements for residency or house purchase. So you can come, you can buy a house. You do not have to pay vast fortunes in early buying expensive houses.” The most distinctive element, however, was energy. Hill linked Alderney’s major natural asset directly to Bitcoin mining: “Our island is located in one of the strongest tidal flows in the world and we are looking to at some stage with our exceptional tidal flow […] to link Bitcoin mining with renewable energy .” He added a striking visual twist by pointing to Alderney’s Victorian coastal defences: “These Victorian forts are already waiting for somebody to come and maybe set up some kind of Bitcoin community entrepreneur and also potentially to store Bitcoin mining systems.” On regulation, Hill emphasised that Alderney sits under Guernsey oversight but is actively engaging to make the regime fit BTC better. “We also are regulated by the Guernsey Financial Service Commission and they’re open to engage with us and with you about making the regulatory framework more usable for Bitcoin.” He drew a clear boundary around the initiative: “We will only be working with Bitcoin, no other asset.” He then outlined the scope of what Alderney is looking to build with the right partner: “Attracting new Bitcoin businesses to our island […] establishment of [a] Bitcoin research engineering campus, some kind of business park, a potential neo bank.” Education and values are part of that package. Hill said the island wants “public and government Bitcoin education to teach our community all about what you’re really about to dispel some of the skepticisms and rumors.” For that, he insisted, Alderney needs a deeply involved counterpart, not just registrations. “We’re looking for a production of some kind of strategic document… someone who could implement a plan and provide local education in Bitcoin and capacity building and also execute that plan with mutual agreement from ourselves as the States of Alderney.” Alderney’s gambit also places it in a small but growing club of islands that have tried to brand around BTC: the Isle of Man has long been marketed as “Bitcoin Island” as it attracted exchanges and payment startups under a bespoke regulatory regime, while Boracay in the Philippines has been promoted as “BTC Island” on the back of Lightning-based merchant adoption. Malta, for its part, styled itself as the “Blockchain Island,” and Madeira has leaned into its reputation as one of Europe’s most Bitcoin-friendly islands—context that Alderney now aims to update with its own, explicitly Bitcoin-only, renewables-driven twist.

The first spot XRP ETF has launched in the United States, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse has immediately jumped online to acknowledge what the market has been waiting for since the early days of the SEC v. Ripple case. His brief article carried the weight of a decade-long struggle: regulatory crackdowns, court delays, and an industry watching as XRP remained the only top-tier asset without an ETF product. Today, that era has ended. XRPC's Fiery Debut Transactions opened and XRPC exploded. More than $26 million worth of shares had changed hands in 30 minutes. That's not just a “strong start.” This makes XRPC poised to challenge the year's best ETF debut: Bitwise's Solana ETF ( BSOL ) currently holds the 2025 record with $57 million on its first day. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says XRPC could easily surpass this limit if early demand continues at this pace. This kind of volume confirms what Ripple supporters have been arguing for years: there is deep, unmet demand for regulated XRP exposure in US markets. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan contributed one of the clearest explanations of XRPC’s explosive start: “The median opinion on a crypto asset doesn't determine the success of an ETF. You'd rather have 20% of people like an asset than 80% of people vaguely like it. ETFs die from apathy, not disagreement.” XRP has never suffered from a lack of interest. It boasts one of the most active global communities in crypto, sustained institutional interest, and years of pent-up demand due to a regulatory freeze that previously prevented a US ETF from launching. The Bigger Picture As previously reported, ETF expert Nate Geraci said the spot XRP ETF would deal a final blow to the aggressive anti-crypto stance of previous SEC leaders. The successful launch of the XRPC is a symbolic milestone not just for XRP but for any asset seeking regulatory clarity. Garlinghouse didn't need a long explanation. The numbers spoke for themselves: $26 million in 30 minutes.

54395986,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89607,1763136301,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Software Engineer: People Think XRP ETF Is Targeting Retail, Think Again",https://timestabloid.com/software-engineer-people-think-xrp-etf-is-targeting-retail-think-again/,"Canary Capital’s new spot XRP ETF (ticker XRPC) made a truly stunning debut, racking up $26 million in trading volume within just 30 minutes. Its first-day total soared to around $58 million, making it one of the biggest ETF launches of 2025. According to software engineer Vincent Van Code, many people wrongly assume the ETF is designed just for retail traders. He argues the opposite: this product is tailored for institutions — hedge funds, family offices, and retirement accounts — that need a regulated way to hold XRP without the headaches of custody or self‑custody. Institutional Focus Over Retail Van Code explains that large funds face major barriers when buying and holding crypto directly. Custody, auditing, and compliance make traditional exchanges or cold wallets difficult for them. The XRPC ETF solves that. It gives these institutions instant, compliant exposure to XRP, via a familiar investment vehicle — not a risky crypto account. Funny thing, people think the XRP ETF is targeting retail, think again. Massive funds, retirements, family offices, hedge funds, you name it, are separate to invest in XRP, but due to complexities in audit and compliance, they can't just buy and hold on crypto exchanges, and… https://t.co/BicGmoZkjj — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) November 13, 2025 The early numbers speak for themselves. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas initially estimated $17 million for the first day. Instead, the ETF delivered $26 million in just 30 minutes. By the close, it had nearly $58 million in volume, just edging past BSOL’s $57 million. What the Structure Offers XRPC holds actual XRP tokens in custody with trusted platforms (Gemini and BitGo). Unlike some funds, it’s not a synthetic exposure ETF. The structure lets investors bypass private key management and wallet risk. It also qualifies for standard brokerage accounts as well as tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. Van Code suggests the real story here isn’t just hype. Institutional analysts likely spent days or weeks evaluating XRPC, weighing market conditions, asset fundamentals, and compliance logistics. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Now, many are poised to move quickly before arbitrage bots fully adjust. That could drive a rapid build-up of demand — not just in the ETF, but in XRP itself. Broader Market Impact This ETF launch could shift how capital flows into crypto. By enabling large, regulated players to gain XRP exposure, the market could see deeper liquidity and more stability. It also strengthens XRP’s narrative as a serious institutional asset — not just a speculative token. In short, XRPC’s breakout debut is more than a headline: it’s a gateway for big money. As Van Code points out, this ETF isn’t a play for retail traders. Its design, demand, and structure signal a clear bid from institutional powerhouses. If that continues, the effects on both the ETF and XRP could be profound. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Overnight funding markets remain tight, with increased pressure around Treasury settlement dates and limited relief expected from TGA adjustments. Bitcoin and equities are both feeling the liquidity squeeze, with Bitcoin down over 20% and the S&P 500 appearing expensive relative to reserves. Future Fed balance sheet expansion may eventually ease pressure, but easy monetary policy is unlikely to return soon. The liquidity drain we are witnessing in the market appears very real, well telegraphed for months, and is now being felt by risk assets. The liquidity that has left the marketplace is unlikely to return. Reserve Balances held at the Fed have fallen to $2.88 trillion from $3.38 trillion in the middle of July following the resolution of the debt ceiling. That means that over that period, about $500 billion was drawn from reserves as the Treasury General Account was replenished. Macrobond TGA Drain As the TGA rose, it drained excess cash from the reverse repo facility, effectively making it largely unused. As a result, overnight funding rates rose, and the usage of the standing repo facility rose. Signs that liquidity in the overnight funding market was tightening. Macrobond At present, the TGA stands at $943 billion, which is more than the $850 billion the Treasury Department has targeted for the December and March quarters, according to the latest quarterly refunding announcement . Macrobond That means we are likely to see the TGA fall by around $90 billion between now and year-end, which could help boost reserves back to around $2.9 to $2.95 trillion, but in the end, it probably won't be enough to materially change the tighter liquidity positions in the overnight funding market. The Treasury still has a lot of debt to issue, and there are settlement dates on the calendar when we tend to see overnight funding rates rise, tightening liquidity and widening spreads. More recently, we have seen the standing repo facility used more on treasury settlement dates. When usage at this facility increases, it means overnight funding rates are trading above 4%, the rate at which an institution can borrow from the Fed. Macrobond Importantly, until the Fed actively increases the size of the balance sheet, reserves will likely remain around their current level, just below $3 trillion. That is going to keep the overnight funding market tight, with increased pressure on Treasury settlement dates, tax pay dates, and quarter and month-end. Risk Assets Feel The Pain In the end, risk assets appear to be feeling the effects of the liquidity. Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD) has been the standout, with the cryptocurrency now having fallen by more than 20% since the middle of October. The movements of Bitcoin and reserves appear very similar, but it is the timing of those movements that makes it an imperfect comparison. But it seems clear that when reserves are abundant and liquidity is ample, Bitcoin can thrive; when reserves are shallow and liquidity is tight, Bitcoin pays the price. TradingView Over time, equities have followed the same footsteps as reserves, but again, not in a way that is easy to measure. One measurement worth tracking is the market cap of the S&P 500 (SP500) relative to reserve balances, and the ratio has expanded quite a bit, reaching 19.9. That is easily the most expensive the S&P 500 has been in terms of reserve balances. There may no longer be enough liquidity in the marketplace to support stock prices at their current levels. Macrobond At some point, the Fed will be forced to expand its balance sheet again, and this pressure will ease, but that doesn't mean it will be a party for risk assets. The latest round of easy monetary policy, which started in 2020, was extraordinary, and it has literally taken years to work its way through the system. That is over now, and the Fed is likely to be much more careful in the future when it comes to balance sheet expansion and its potential economic impacts.",AFMC|AFSM|ARKK|AVUV|BAPR|IVOO|IVOV|IVV|IVW|IWC|IWM|IWN|IWO|IWP|IWR|IWS|IYY|QQQ|SPLV|SPMD|SPMO|SPMV|SPSM|SPUS|SPUU|SPVM|SPVU|SPXE|SPXL|SPXN|SPXS|SPXT|SPXU|SPXV|SPY|SPYD|SPYG|SPYV|SPYX|SQLV|SSO|SSPY|SVAL|SYLD|TMDV|TPHD|TPLC|TPSC|UAUG|UJAN|UMAR|UMAY|UOCT|UPRO|USMC|USMF|USVM|MAGS|BTC-USD|SP500|SPX|DJI|NDX|DIA|VOO,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-14 16:07:50

The initiative, called Listing FastTrack, reflects a broader trend among major exchanges seeking to balance accessibility for emerging projects with transparency. The launch comes at a time when many founders have voiced frustration over slow, opaque, and costly listing procedures on major exchanges. Startups often face long wait times, inconsistent communication, and unclear fee structures — factors that can delay token distribution and harm early momentum. BingX's new portal promises a shorter approval process and a clear fee structure. The exchange, which claims support for over 170 public chains, said listings through FastTrack could go live within hours, backed by ongoing technical and marketing support from its internal teams. In a circulated press-release, BingX also highlights its $150 million protection fund and fully verifiable Proof of Reserves as part of its commitment to operational transparency. That safeguard has become particularly relevant in light of past incidents across the industry — from the 2022 exchange failures to more recent liquidity crises — that left users exposed to counterparty risk. Several platforms have since introduced on-chain audits or insurance-style reserve funds, but few have formalized these into fully traceable mechanisms. In the aftermath, platforms also sought to implement clearer frameworks for project onboarding. Streamlined programs may help exchanges compete for early-stage, maintaining both compliance and risk controls. “We are ready to collaborate with cutting-edge projects and connect them to our extensive global user base,” — said Vivien Lin, Chief Product Officer at BingX. Analysts note that speed and transparency are becoming key differentiators in the exchange landscape. “The ability to list tokens quickly with the prompt due diligence process is becoming a strategic advantage,” said a digital asset consultant familiar with exchange operations. “Projects now want more than just access to liquidity — they seek for a fair process.” FastTrack reflects an industry learning from its past missteps. After years marked by opaque listings and uneven governance, exchanges are beginning to recognize that transparency can be a competitive edge. For many emerging Web3 teams, reduced friction in listings could prove decisive in the early stages of growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At the same time, ADA tests a key $0.517 support level after breaking below its ascending trendline. Cardano vote tops 3B ADA on proposal to fund global exchange listings Cardano’s latest governance vote has drawn more than 3 billion ADA in support for a proposal that seeks a treasury-backed loan to pursue tier-1 exchange listings. The measure asks the on-chain treasury to release 5 million ADA as a repayable loan to finance a coordinated “global listing expansion” program. Cardano Treasury Vote Stake Chart. Source: X The vote reflects rising community engagement after Cardano’s transition to full on-chain governance this month. As ballots continue to come in, the proposal remains one of the most closely watched items on the network’s new governance dashboard. According to the proposal, the 5 million ADA loan would be administered through Intersect, the Cardano member-based organization overseeing governance operations. The plan outlines reporting requirements, repayment terms and oversight to ensure the funds are used for listing efforts rather than unrelated activities. Supporters argue that the initiative could strengthen Cardano’s presence on major trading venues by funding compliance, integration work and exchange-specific technical needs. Critics, however, have questioned whether treasury funds should be used for listings at all, even on a repayable basis. The vote remains open, and final tallies will determine whether the treasury approves the request for release of funds. ADA tests key $0.517 support after trendline break Cardano slipped below its ascending trendline on the 4-hour chart, putting fresh focus on support around $0.517, according to analyst Man of Bitcoin. He noted that ADA is now pulling back toward this level after failing to extend its recent advance, leaving bulls and bears watching the same line in the sand. Cardano ADA Trendline Break. Source: Man of Bitcoin on X If ADA holds above $0.517, the chart still allows for the “yellow” scenario on his chart, where price grinds higher in a diagonal pattern. In that path, the current move would act as a shallow wave-(2) pullback, with room for another leg up toward the previous resistance zone near $0.73 if buyers regain control.

According to reports, letters from banking and community groups filed in early November have raised sharp opposition about the plan and its possible effects. Sony’s Bank Plan Sony Bank filed to form a national trust bank called Connectia Trust, according to filings and public reports. The plan would allow Connectia to manage reserves for a US dollar-pegged stablecoin and offer custody and asset-management services for digital tokens. The OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1183 in March 2025, which clarified that national banks may perform certain crypto activities when they meet risk controls. Trust banks, however, do not take FDIC-insured deposits, and that difference is central to the debate. Advocates say the structure fits within the narrow scope the OCC laid out in Letter 1183. Critics say it does not. Questions include how reserves would be composed, how redemptions would work in stress, and what would happen to custody holdings if the trust were placed into receivership. Community bank groups and consumer advocates want clearer, more public explanations of those mechanics. Banking Groups Push Back On November 6, 2025, the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) sent a formal letter urging the OCC to reject the application. ICBA’s main point is that a trust charter could let a large corporate owner offer a product that looks like a deposit but lacks deposit insurance and typical bank obligations. They called this a form of regulatory arbitrage and warned it could create unfair competition for smaller banks. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition also filed opposition, arguing the OCC lacks authority to treat a stablecoin issuer like a traditional bank and calling for stronger consumer protections. Those groups have focused on three practical concerns: consumer confusion about what is and is not insured, unclear reserve transparency, and the lack of tested tools to resolve a trust bank that holds crypto assets. The letters stress the potential consequences of a run on a large stablecoin and the difficulty of unwinding token custody in a crisis. Systemic And Consumer Risks If a federally chartered trust issues a widely used stablecoin, it could set a legal precedent that other tech firms or financial firms might follow. That is why some filings argue the OCC should move slowly and demand stricter conditions. Reports have disclosed worries that retail users could treat the token like a bank deposit, when it would not carry FDIC protection. The risks are not just theoretical. Under stress, reserve assets might be sold quickly, and digital holdings could be hard to transfer within a receivership framework that was built for traditional assets.

54397560,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89626,1763139625,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Why Zero Knowledge Proof’s (ZKP) $100M Infrastructure Merges Blockchain, AI, and Privacy",https://timestabloid.com/why-zero-knowledge-proofs-zkp-100m-infrastructure-merges-blockchain/,"In a market where many projects sell ideas before delivering results, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has taken the opposite route. It built the entire system first, then opened the doors. With more than $100 million invested in infrastructure, a testnet ready from day one, and AI compute integration in place, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) introduces a fully developed framework instead of just a proposal. Now entering its whitelist stage, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is seen as a strong contender among the top cryptocurrencies to buy in 2025. It represents a new generation of blockchain networks that combine proven functionality with privacy-focused systems suited for enterprise and AI use. Building Before Selling: A Different Path Zero Knowledge Proof’s (ZKP) strategy goes against the norm in the crypto space, where teams usually raise funds before building. This project created a working ecosystem before starting its presale. The result is a network that already handles live computation, proof generation, and private transactions effectively. Its four-layer structure is fully operational: Hybrid Consensus Layer: Combines Proof-of-Intelligence and Proof-of-Space for efficient computing and energy use. Execution Layer: Runs private smart contracts that support both EVM and WASM standards. Zero-Knowledge Layer: Manages proof compression and real-time verification for better scalability. Storage Layer: Connects with IPFS and Filecoin for secure, decentralized, and encrypted storage. This setup is not theoretical; it already executes compute tasks, showing how AI and blockchain can work together securely. That early readiness gives Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) a strong edge over other presales and supports its position as one of the top crypto to buy before 2026. Privacy and Performance Working Together The key aspect of the Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system is its privacy-first compute structure. Every process, from validation to AI computation, happens inside a zero-knowledge framework. This setup ensures data verification without exposing any private information. For industries dealing with data protection challenges, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) provides a practical and secure solution. It allows businesses to run smart contracts and AI workloads that stay private, compliant, and verifiable. Instead of depending on third-party trust, operations are confirmed through cryptographic proofs. This makes Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) much more than a standard blockchain project; it forms the base for a verifiable AI-driven economy. It focuses on solving real-world issues across sectors like healthcare, finance, logistics, and data management. As privacy and data control become global priorities, Zero Knowledge Proof’s (ZKP) advanced readiness and dependable design make it a clear choice for those considering the top crypto to buy for long-term potential. Proof Pods Bring Computing Power to the Network Beyond its blockchain design, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) introduces a hardware layer through Proof Pods, small devices built to perform verified computational work for the network. Each Proof Pod supports AI tasks, produces zero-knowledge proofs, and contributes computing power to the system. This is not traditional mining. Instead of consuming energy to solve random hashes, these devices handle useful, privacy-focused computations that strengthen the network’s core function. This hardware addition gives Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) something rare in the crypto market, tangible utility. With Proof Pods already created, tested, and prepared for rollout, participants joining the whitelist are stepping into an ecosystem designed for large-scale adoption. When the presale opens, operators will connect their devices and earn Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) coins for completed and validated compute work. The reward model is based on productivity instead of speculation, which is why many see it as one of the top cryptos to buy now before the next development phase begins. Fair Auctions with Real-World Access The upcoming presale for Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is fully transparent and accessible to everyone, not limited to private groups or insiders. Each 24-hour auction cycle will release 200 million Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) coins, shared among participants according to their total contribution. This system ensures fairness by preventing early-stage advantages and offering clear access to all. The auction process also sets daily pricing standards used to determine Proof Pod rewards. Every action is logged and verified on-chain, reflecting the transparency that defines blockchain principles. With its established infrastructure, open access, and real computational purpose, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) stands out in a space often filled with speculative projects. For early participants looking for trust and clarity, this makes it one of the top cryptos to buy right now heading into 2026. How AI and Blockchain Work Together The merging of AI and blockchain is creating a major turning point in technology, and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is positioned at its center. Traditional AI systems face verification and privacy limits, while public blockchains often struggle with speed and confidentiality. Zero Knowledge Proof’s (ZKP) system solves both challenges at once. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, AI models can compute, train, and confirm results without revealing private data. This makes secure collaboration possible across industries that rely on strict data protection. The network supports decentralized AI agents, enterprise-level smart contracts, and privacy-based data operations within a single framework. Zero Knowledge Proof’s (ZKP) combination of cryptography, hardware, and computation reflects what many see as the next logical stage in blockchain progress, building systems that function before they go to market. The Takeaway Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) didn’t start with empty promises; it started with proof of work. With over $100 million already invested and a complete network built before the presale, the project has earned a reputation for credibility in a market tired of unfulfilled claims. Its privacy-first compute design, open auction format, and integration with AI-driven tasks make it more than a digital asset; it’s an entire economy built on verified computation. With the whitelist now open, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) offers early access to a project that could redefine trust and transparency in blockchain. For those exploring the top crypto to buy , it presents a unique mix of readiness, fairness, and real-world purpose, setting a strong example for the future of crypto.

In a technical analysis, he identifies a critical resistance zone that he believes must be reclaimed soon. Without recovery, he warns that the SOL price could break down toward a much lower level, deepening the cryptocurrency’s already persistent downtrend. Bitcoin Crash Caller Issues New Solana Alert After projecting BTC’s collapse four years ago, crypto market expert DonAlt is highlighting new risks in Solana. In one of his latest analyses, DonAlt shared a detailed look at Solana’s price structure, including a chart that highlights a major red resistance zone between $190 and $215. Related Reading: Ripple Exec Reveals Why The Bitcoin Price Is So High Now According to him, this is the range level Solana must recover to avoid a deeper correction. The analyst explained that his stance on Solana has been bearish for some time, and the recent rejection from this key resistance area has only reinforced that outlook. The SOL price chart shows several failed attempts to close above the red box, suggesting that sellers may still be controlling the trend despite recent accumulation. The upper range line around $250 has acted as an unyielding ceiling for months now, and DonAlt has indicated that as long as Solana trades significantly below it, the market should be considered structurally weak. Currently, the altcoin’s price has slipped toward mid-range levels, and the weekly timeframe is starting to exhibit early signs of a bearish breakdown. In a previous report, DonAlt presented the same chart structure, emphasizing that Solana’s price action remains “awful” unless buyers step in within two days to rescue the weekly close. If they fail to do so, he expects the cryptocurrency’s price to fall back toward the range support at $126. At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $141, meaning a decline to $126 would represent a more than 10% drop in value. Notably, the bearish pressure is visible on the chart candles, which continue to weaken each time Solana approaches the red resistance zone. The trend reflects a diminishing strength and a steady decline in momentum, further augmented by the broader crypto downtrend and rising volatility. SOL HTF Chart Signals Severe Breakdown Risk DonAlt has also displayed a High-Time Frame (HTF) chart that he considers one of the most bearish he has seen in recent months. The chart shows a clean rejection from the upper boundary near $208, underscoring the weakness developing in higher timeframes. Related Reading: XRP Set To Lead The Next Bull Rally: Crypto Research Firm Blows The Lid Open While many traders assume that bearish setups fail when they become too obvious, DonAlt suggests that the current situation with Solana is opposite. He points out that almost no one is panicking or even discussing the potential risks, which is even more unusual, indicating that this silence may be masking real vulnerability.

However, not all seems to be lost, as experts believe that the Digitap ($TAP) crypto presale can usher in a new era for the market. On the other hand, once the best crypto to buy Shiba Inu is struggling, while the Maxi Doge crypto presale gets pushed into the background, as Digitap’s utility takes center stage. Shiba Inu: The Ever-Struggling Memecoin Giant Shiba Inu has been facing difficulties for a long time before the recent market dump and fear. For a while now, the $SHIB price hadn’t made any significant moves, and red days were the norm for this once best crypto to buy . According to experts, this trend may continue for Shiba Inu, as the memecoin appears to be slowly fading into the background. Chatter about $SHIB is very low; there are no new significant events that could drive adoption, and even when something new happens, the $SHIB price doesn’t really respond. For instance, Shiba Inu recently announced that it now powers Unity Nodes , adding real-world utility to the memecoin. This, however, didn’t really move the needle much, as the $SHIB price didn’t react much. Currently, it’s at $0.000009583, rising by 4.4% since last week. However, Shiba Inu’s market cap and trading volume were in the red, decreasing by 2.18% and 5.4% respectively, in 24 hours. With this in mind, experts don’t see $SHIB as a good crypto to buy , as they believe it has been overshadowed for a while. And with new and more useful projects on the horizon, they believe that Shiba Inu could potentially fade into the background even further. Maxi Doge: A New Crypto Presale That’s Aiming to Turn Memes Into Lifestyle Maxi Doge is a new crypto presale that aims to become a top crypto to buy in the meme-plus-utility niche. The goal behind it is to blend community-driven hype with tangible features. But even though this sounds promising, experts are not quite convinced that Maxi Doge has what it takes to be among the best altcoins to buy , especially now. They say that the best altcoins to buy are the ones that come with real-world utility, ones that don’t need to rely on hype and community boosts to grow. And, for now, they believe that $MAXI is in such a position, as, at the end of the day, it’ll still be seen as a memecoin by the market. However, this hasn’t stopped the $MAXI presale from growing, raising over $3.9 million so far. Its current price is at $0.0002675, with a price increase expected in a few hours. Still, even with this demand right now, experts don’t believe that $MAXI is a stable condenser for their best altcoins to buy lists. What Makes $TAP #1 Among the Best Altcoins to Buy in 2025? Speculative promises and what-ifs are usually what investors associate with crypto presales . However, this time, it’s not the case with Digitap, as Digitap has been able to prove that it brings massive utility even though it still hasn’t launched yet. This was possible through Digitap’s app, which is available via the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. Via the app, people can finally hold, store, and spend both crypto and fiat from one place, receiving instant settlements and conversions as they do. With this, Digitap has emerged as the world’s first-ever omnibank, finally merging crypto and fiat successfully. Digitap also offers Visa-backed crypto cards via which people can spend crypto and fiat anywhere Visa is accepted. By doing so, they’ll also enjoy the best of both, including the widespread nature, accessibility, and comfort of fiat as well as the speed, privacy, and cost-effectiveness of crypto. So, according to experts, Digitap is suitable for both crypto and non-crypto users, a characteristic that could bring massive adoption to this project. With this in mind, they see Digitap as one of the most promising altcoins to buy in 2025, serving both the crypto and the non-crypto parts of the population. USE THE CODE “DIGITAP15” FOR 15% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES The $TAP Crypto Presale Is Defying Odds Even though most of the market is facing red streaks and has been doing so for weeks, the $TAP crypto presale is doing the opposite. Demand for $TAP has been rising steadily since the presale began, and experts say it’s all because of the potential Digitap offers. So far, the $TAP presale has raised over $1.7 million, selling more than 112 million tokens. At this moment, $TAP’s price is at $0.0297, but since this presale round is 78% complete, the price will rise to $0.0313 soon. $TAP’s launch price is set at $0.14, which would mark a 371% rise from $TAP’s current price. This means that, even at launch, early $TAP investors will see paper gains from $TAP, and experts say that this will be only the beginning. They believe that Digitap can change how people manage their money, and with this, it can catapult to the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the coming months. Metric Details Stage Price $0.0297 Next Stage Price $0.0313 Tokens Sold Over 112 million Capital Raised Over $1.7 million Fundraising Goal $10 million Utility Is Coming Back, and Digitap Might Just Usher It In According to experts, the memecoin era is long gone, and now, the utility era is on the rise again. This means that projects that actually provide value and real-world use cases are at the top of their best altcoins to buy lists, and this includes Digitap. The reason why Digitap has an edge over many others is that it’s bringing something new and in-demand to the market, which can change global money management and spill over into traditional markets, not just crypto. So, they believe that $TAP has massive potential, which is why it’s taking center stage alongside coins like Shiba Inu and Maxi Doge.

The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is now available on BNB Chain and as over-the-counter collateral on Binance. Representing over $2.5 billion in investments, BUIDL has begun to play a more central role in institutional capital efficiency within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Binance and BlackRock stated in a joint statement that BUIDL has “become a fundamental building block of on-chain finance.” The companies noted that this integration will allow Binance’s global institutional users to use their capital more efficiently while maintaining exposure to tokenized Treasury products. Related News: XRP Spot ETF Begins Trading - Makes an Incredible Debut, Here Are the Latest Figures Catherine Chen, Head of VIP & Institutional at Binance, announced that BUIDL has been integrated with the exchange's banking representatives and crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu. Chen explained that many institutional clients are “demanding more stable, interest-bearing assets that they can hold as collateral while actively trading.” BUIDL, issued by Securitize, functions as stablecoin-like collateral because it is designed to be pegged to the US dollar. The fund is currently actively used on the Ethereum mainnet, Layer-1 networks such as Aptos, Avalanche, and Solana, and Ethereum extensions such as Arbitrum, Polygon, and Optimism. The expansion to BNB Chain both increases the fund's accessibility and adds a new dimension to institutional collateral options. BNB Chain has gained significant momentum recently, particularly with the rise of derivatives platform Aster and its integration with Binance Alpha and Binance Wallet. Major platforms like Ondo Finance, which is growing in the real-world assets (RWA) space, have also begun integrating with BNB Chain. *This is not investment advice.

Investor interest has surged amid ETF speculation, institutional adoption, and regulatory developments. Market participants are closely monitoring whether the current market consolidation represents a temporary pause or the precursor to a major XRP price movement. Crypto X AiMan recently shared a video clip highlighting Garlinghouse’s perspective on XRP and the broader crypto ecosystem. In the statement, the CEO said: “Look, I think we clearly are seeing that ETFs have been popular. So the XRP interest has grown, and to me it’s just inevitable you’re going to see not just Bitcoin and ETH, you’re gonna see an XRP ETF.” BREAKING: Ripple CEO Drops HUGE PRICE WARNING on $XRP !!!

And I do think it creates upward pressure on the prices for many different cryptos, including XRP.” Institutional Adoption Driving XRP Demand Garlinghouse emphasized that rising ETF adoption is fueling increased institutional participation . XRP, he noted, is likely to join Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated ETF products soon. This development signals a broader acceptance of crypto by large-scale investors. According to the CEO, such institutional involvement is expected to create upward pressure on XRP prices and other major cryptocurrencies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETFs and Market Implications The launch of an XRP ETF could serve as a major catalyst for price growth . ETFs provide regulated entry points for institutional capital, allowing significant inflows into XRP. Analysts suggest that historically, ETFs have often sparked market rallies once approved or heavily anticipated. Could This Be the Final Shakeout? Current XRP consolidation is interpreted by some market observers as the “final shakeout” before a potential surge. Periods of low volatility frequently precede substantial upward movements in cryptocurrency markets. Garlinghouse’s remarks reinforce this narrative, highlighting the rising institutional demand and ETF momentum as key drivers. Strategic Considerations for XRP Investors Investors and traders are advised to closely track ETF filings, regulatory updates, and market volume trends. Garlinghouse’s statements underscore XRP’s positioning for institutional inflows, making strategic monitoring of technical levels essential. Awareness of these developments may provide early insight into potential market moves. Brad Garlinghouse’s warning, amplified by Crypto X AiMan, underscores XRP’s emerging role in the institutional crypto space. With ETF adoption accelerating and investor interest intensifying , XRP could be approaching a pivotal moment. Market watchers should remain vigilant as the token prepares for its potential next “moonshot.” Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This update could help clear the enormous pile of filings accumulated during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which left more than 900 applications waiting for review. Balchunas believes several crypto ETFs may act quickly: “My guess is some of those crypto etfs that didn't do the 8a thing will try and push out as soon as they can.” Shutdown Backlog and New Technical Rules Explained On November 13, the SEC published detailed guidance outlining how it would process the flood of filings submitted during the shutdown. The key clarifications include: Automatic 20-day effectiveness for forms filed without a deferral during the shutdown, under Section 8(a). No additional SEC action required even if the filing lacks Rule 430A information. Issuers may add an amendment deferral and request acceleration under Rule 461 if they want faster approval. Filings will be reviewed in the order they were received , and the SEC will automatically declare prior post-effective amendments effective unless an issuer requests a delay. Shutdown Delays and the Push for Automatic Approvals The shutdown, lasting from October 1 to November 12, became the longest in U.S. history. It halted the launch of multiple crypto ETFs that were expected to go live in October. In response, issuers began taking advantage of the automatic approval mechanism: submitting S-1 forms without a deferral, which automatically take effect after 20 days if the SEC does not object. This approach has already enabled multiple new funds to enter the market in November, including products from Canary Capital, Bitwise, and Grayscale. On November 13, the U.S. market expanded again with another launch: Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF, approved by Nasdaq and the SEC using the same automatic pathway. As the SEC clears its backlog and issuers accelerate their filings, the pace of new crypto ETF launches in the U.S. may soon increase significantly.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 17:05:28

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

JTO/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.549, resulting in a correction to $0.702. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2025 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO down today? JTO’s price gained selling pressure around local highs, resulting in a downward correction. This created a drop toward $0.615. Will the JTO price recover? If buyers hold above the $1 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will the JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on JTO news Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, a16z Crypto, has invested $50 million into Jito (JTO), a core protocol built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain. In return, a16z received an unspecified token allocation, aiming to foster “long-term alignment” between the two firms. Jito price prediction November 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have been aiming to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $120K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price.

According to CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn, this substantial growth in Binance stablecoin balance represents one of the largest monthly increases we’ve seen recently. When traders move this much stablecoin onto an exchange, it typically indicates they’re preparing to make significant asset purchases. The growing Binance stablecoin balance suggests increased confidence and anticipation of market opportunities. This movement isn’t just random activity. The expanding Binance stablecoin balance shows that investors are positioning themselves strategically. They’re likely waiting for optimal entry points or anticipating specific market developments that could create profitable trading opportunities. Why Are Traders Flooding Binance With Stablecoins? Traders choose to increase their Binance stablecoin balance for several strategic reasons: Market readiness – Having funds readily available for quick execution Risk management – Avoiding volatility while waiting for opportunities Liquidity positioning – Being prepared for sudden market movements Yield opportunities – Some stablecoins offer earning potential while waiting The substantial growth in Binance stablecoin balance reflects sophisticated trading strategies.

Why does Binance stablecoin balance growth matter? Growing stablecoin balances often indicate traders are preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies, potentially signaling upcoming market movements and increased trading activity. How quickly can these stablecoins affect the market? These funds can deploy rapidly during market opportunities, sometimes within hours or days, creating immediate price impacts on targeted assets.

How reliable is stablecoin balance as a market indicator? It’s considered a reliable secondary indicator when combined with other metrics like trading volume, open interest, and market sentiment analysis. Can this data predict specific price movements? While it indicates potential market activity, it doesn’t predict exact price directions or timing, as many factors influence cryptocurrency prices. Found this analysis helpful?

Speaking at the launch conference, Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu, emphasized that AI needs to be integrated into every aspect of today’s workflows. He commented, “When you internalize AI, it becomes a native capability and transforms intelligence from a cost into a source of productivity. We should focus on integrating AI with every task we do to make it a native driving force for corporate and personal growth.” However, Ernie 5.0 still leaves some investors and analysts unimpressed. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Robert Lea noted that, despite its strengths, the model doesn’t stand out sufficiently from others. He added, “The revamped AI lineup is unlikely to transform its earnings outlook, which remains highly challenged.” Baidu is also preparing to launch Kunlun chips Baidu announced on Thursday its plans to launch Kunlun chips. The Kunlun M100 is expected to arrive in 2026, while the Kunlun M300 is anticipated to arrive in early 2027. Forrester Vice President and Principal Analyst Charlie Dai noted that Kunlun’s chip strategy will play a significant role in reducing dependence on foreign GPU suppliers and achieving both cost-effectiveness and performance effectiveness. Regardless of its mixed reception, Baidu considers Ernie 5.0 central to its cloud business and long-term ambitions to infuse AI throughout its ecosystem — from search and maps to smart devices and enterprise tools. The company also hopes that a common AI layer will attract more developers to architect on its platform, generating subscription revenue and increasing cloud utility. Whether those goals come to pass could depend on Baidu’s ability to accelerate upgrades, overhaul the user experience, and gain a leadership role in China’s cut-throat AI industry. Li also spoke with great confidence about how the future of AI-human interactions should naturally move in this direction, where there will be a standard interaction layer across the entire AI age. Baidu also opened its HuiboXing digital human technology to developers worldwide. Sales generated by digital human livestreams jumped 91%, and livestream sessions increased 119% compared to last year’s Singles Day. Lu Yanxia, research director at market consultancy IDC China, speaking on Baidu’s developments, remarked, “The multimodal LLM is an undeniable future development direction for generative AI technology.” Still, competitors are stepping up. Alibaba said it plans to revamp its main mobile AI app to resemble ChatGPT. Though on Friday, its shares slid 3.5%.

The latest numbers reveal something extraordinary – Sui DEX volume has not just grown, but exploded to unprecedented heights for the third consecutive quarter. This sustained momentum signals a fundamental shift in how traders and liquidity providers are embracing the Sui network’s capabilities. What’s Driving the Record-Breaking Sui DEX Volume? The platform recently announced staggering statistics that have caught the attention of the entire DeFi community. With a daily average Sui DEX volume reaching $456 million, the network demonstrates robust trading activity that rivals established players in the space. Moreover, the total value locked across Sui’s DeFi ecosystem now stands at an impressive $2.11 billion. This consistent growth pattern across three straight quarters suggests several key advantages: Scalability – Sui’s architecture handles high transaction throughput Low fees – Competitive gas costs attract more users User experience – Intuitive interfaces lower entry barriers Liquidity depth – Ample trading pairs and minimal slippage How Does This Sui DEX Volume Compare to Other Networks? When we examine the broader DeFi landscape, the sustained Sui DEX volume growth becomes even more remarkable. Many networks experience volatile trading patterns, but Sui has maintained an upward trajectory through various market conditions. This consistency indicates strong fundamentals rather than temporary speculation. The $2.11 billion TVL figure places Sui among the top tier of DeFi ecosystems. This metric matters because it shows how much capital participants are willing to commit long-term. Higher TVL typically correlates with greater network security and more sophisticated financial products. What Benefits Does High Sui DEX Volume Create? Elevated Sui DEX volume generates multiple positive effects throughout the ecosystem. First, liquidity providers earn more fees from increased trading activity. Second, traders benefit from tighter spreads and better execution prices. Third, developers gain confidence to build more complex applications knowing there’s substantial user activity. However, maintaining this level of Sui DEX volume presents challenges too. The network must continue scaling its infrastructure to handle peak loads. Security becomes increasingly critical as more value flows through the system. Regulatory scrutiny often follows successful platforms as they grow. Where Could Sui DEX Volume Go From Here? Looking forward, several factors could influence future Sui DEX volume trends. Broader cryptocurrency market conditions always play a role in trading activity levels. The development of new DeFi primitives on Sui might attract different types of users. Partnerships with traditional finance institutions could bring additional capital and legitimacy. The most promising aspect remains the consistent quarter-over-quarter growth in Sui DEX volume. This pattern suggests organic adoption rather than temporary hype. As more users discover Sui’s technical advantages and thriving ecosystem, the network appears well-positioned for continued expansion. Frequently Asked Questions What makes Sui DEX volume different from other networks? Sui’s unique parallel transaction processing allows for higher throughput and lower latency, enabling more efficient trading and contributing to sustained volume growth. How does high DEX volume benefit ordinary users? Increased volume means better liquidity, tighter spreads, and improved price execution for all traders, from small retail users to large institutions. Is the Sui DEX volume growth sustainable? Three consecutive quarters of record growth suggest strong fundamentals, though future performance depends on continued network development and market conditions. What risks come with high trading volume? Increased volume can attract regulatory attention and requires robust security measures to protect user funds against potential exploits. Can newcomers easily participate in Sui DEX trading? Yes, most Sui DEX platforms feature user-friendly interfaces similar to centralized exchanges, making them accessible to crypto beginners. How does TVL relate to DEX volume? Total Value Locked represents capital available for trading and lending, while volume measures actual trading activity – both indicate ecosystem health.

54398275,https://cryptonews.com/?p=452174,1763141128,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54398275.jpeg,"Weekly Crypto Regulation Roundup: Stablecoin Boom, CFTC Power Moves, and Senate Shake-Ups",https://cryptonews.com/news/weekly-crypto-regulation-roundup-stablecoin-boom-cftc-power-moves-and-senate-shake-ups/,"A wave of major policy developments across Washington is reshaping the U.S. digital asset regulatory environment, with stablecoin warnings from the Federal Reserve, new clarity emerging at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), fresh Senate dynamics, and shifting positions at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This shows a transformative moment for how the U.S. will govern crypto markets heading into 2026. Fed Governor Warns Stablecoin Surge Could Push Down U.S. Interest Rates A senior Federal Reserve official has issued one of the strongest warnings yet about the macroeconomic implications of the booming stablecoin sector. Fed Governor Stephen I. Miran, speaking at the BCVC Summit 2025 in New York, said the rapid rise of dollar-backed stablecoins—which now process trillions in payments—could become a force shaping long-term interest rates. Fed Gov. @SteveMiran warns the growth of stablecoins could force U.S. interest rates lower, predicting the market could expand to $3 trillion in years to come. #Stablecoins #Fed #rates https://t.co/I5BfzfZawn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 10, 2025 In a speech titled “A Global Stablecoin Glut: Implications for Monetary Policy,” Miran argued that mounting global demand for dollar-backed tokens is increasing purchases of U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality dollar assets. That, he said, mirrors the “global savings glut” of the early 2000s that helped drive interest rates lower worldwide. “Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,” Miran warned. “Their growth increases the supply of loanable funds in the U.S. economy, placing downward pressure on the neutral interest rate.” The remarks show how deeply crypto—once dismissed as fringe—is now entangled with core questions of U.S. monetary policy. CFTC Leadership Shake-Up: Trump’s New Nominee Heads Into Crucial Senate Hearing In a separate development, the CFTC is entering a leadership transition. President Donald Trump has nominated Michael Selig, a senior SEC official known for his pro-crypto stance, to serve as both chairman and commissioner of the CFTC. Trump's CFTC nominee, @MikeSeligEsq of the @SECGov to face senate hearing on Nov. 19, following the withdrawal of a prior nominee #CFTC #SEC #Trump https://t.co/H4gUa4kzB3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Selig, currently chief counsel for the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, is set to face a high-stakes Senate confirmation hearing on November 19. His nomination follows the unexpected withdrawal of the administration’s earlier pick, former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz. The shift comes at a moment of institutional turbulence for the agency. With the CFTC facing mounting pressure to define its role in regulating digital commodities—and now preparing for some of the most consequential policy expansions in its history—Selig’s hearing is expected to draw intense industry and political scrutiny. CFTC Prepares to Approve Leveraged Crypto Trading in the U.S. Amid its leadership changes, the CFTC is simultaneously preparing to authorize leveraged spot cryptocurrency trading on regulated U.S. exchanges as early as next month. Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirmed the plans in a post on X, indicating a major shift that could bring institutional-grade leveraged products directly to American investors. The talks involve major market operators, including CME Group, Cboe Futures Exchange, ICE Futures, and crypto-native platforms such as Coinbase Derivatives, Kalshi, and Polymarket U.S. Pham said the agency is using its existing rulebook to “swiftly implement recommendations” from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets while Congress continues to debate a broader legislative framework. If finalized, the approval would mark one of the most significant advances for the U.S. crypto market infrastructure in years. Crypto Lawyer John Deaton Launches New Senate Bid On the political front, well-known crypto attorney John Deaton is launching another U.S. Senate run . The pro-XRP lawyer, who previously attempted to unseat Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has announced a 2026 campaign—this time targeting Democrat Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Crypto attorney John Deaton is running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts again, but hasn't mentioned any pro-crypto policies in his campaign. #JohnDeaton #CryptoLawyer #MassachusettsSenateRace https://t.co/vNoEGNTp6q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Deaton, known for filing amicus briefs in major SEC crypto lawsuits, framed his campaign as a fight for “leaders who know how to deliver results.” The race is set to become another flashpoint between crypto advocates and long-time industry critics. Senate Market Structure Bill Would Expand CFTC Power—With Key Gaps A new bipartisan market structure bill emerging from the Senate could reshape digital asset oversight by giving the CFTC sweeping authority over spot digital commodities such as Bitcoin and Ether. The draft, released by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), builds on the House-passed CLARITY Act. It proposes registering centralized platforms as Digital Commodity Exchanges (DCEs) with defined operational and custody standards. However, despite its potential to unify the regulatory environment, major gaps remain—including questions about stablecoins, decentralized finance, and the role of the SEC. With the Senate divided and committee jurisdictions overlapping, the bill faces a challenging path forward. Blockchain Association Praises Progress on Senate Draft The Blockchain Association welcomed the Agriculture Committee’s draft as a meaningful milestone. CEO Summer Mersinger, a former CFTC commissioner, said the proposal represents an “important step” toward clear rules for digital assets and praised bipartisan momentum following the House’s progress earlier this year. The association called for continued collaboration between the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees to craft a unified framework capable of positioning the U.S. as a global crypto leader. SEC Considers Establishing a ‘Token Taxonomy’ In a major policy shift, SEC Chair Paul Atkins announced he is weighing the creation of a federal “token taxonomy” intended to clarify which crypto assets qualify as securities. SEC Chair Paul Atkins is weighing whether to establish a ""token taxonomy"" at the agency, the regulator announced Wednesday. #SEC #PaulAtkins https://t.co/pQB9EQK1La — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s FinTech Conference, Atkins suggested the taxonomy would be anchored in the Howey Test but adapted to provide greater regulatory certainty. The proposal marks a departure from the SEC’s years-long reliance on enforcement-driven classification and could indicate a greater willingness to work with Congress on structural reform. Government Shutdown Ends—Easing Pressure on Crypto Policymaking Finally, President Trump has signed legislation formally ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which lasted 43 days. The reopening may help restart stalled crypto policymaking, including appropriations-sensitive regulatory initiatives. The shutdown’s resolution was also a victory for Polymarket bettors, most of whom predicted the government would reopen between November 12 and 15.

Although trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average is a bullish sign, the speculative horizon is clouded with doubts. The price action has to settle above the area of convergence encompassing resistance levels of $3,650 and $3,710 to establish a bullish scenario, with the price attempting to reach $3,900. The prolonged period of consolidation for the crypto heavyweight has made many investors look for the best crypto to invest in, especially in the more promising and volatile markets than the slow recovery of the major currencies. This data-driven exploration has turned to the high-potential presales in the defi crypto world. The Slow Rise of Ethereum The recent 8% rise from lows around $3,520 is certainly improving Ethereum’s technical posture. In terms of on-chain data, point estimates of whale wallet growth suggest steady accumulation at current prices, while bullish trend lines provide support at $3,520. However, the margin for error is also much less forgiving. If the $3,650 ceiling is not breached, the coin will likely make another trip down to $3,500, causing the consolidation phase to last longer. As for the investors sitting on large caps like ETH, this steady rise is a perfect example of why one should focus more on diversification. This simply means investing into more emerging projects with much better token metrics and short-term use cases clearly defined. The best crypto to buy now is often hidden below the 10 largest coins. Mutuum Finance: Trading Phenomenon During Market Sluggishness As Ethereum slowly advances through its recovery, soaring demand is artistically captured by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The ongoing presale is a defining moment, having raised over $18,700,000 and allocated tokens to more than 17,950 holders. The project has advanced to Phase 6, selling MUTM tokens at $0.035. Over 90% of the allocation has been acquired by investors, indicating the speed at which the window is closing. This is the final window of opportunity to close tokens at this price before the Phase 7 price surge starts. The price increase until the Phase 7 price is $0.040, which is near a 20% price increase from the current selling price. The price set for launch is $0.06, which indicates a potential 400% return on investment. This makes MUTM a strong contender for the best crypto to invest in short term due to the substantial increase in price. A live presale dashboard with a 24 increase during a cycle keeps track of the 50 contributors. For most participation, MUTM provides the user ranked number one every day a $500 MUTM bonus as long as the user does at least one transaction during the 24 hour cycle that resets each day at 24:00 UTC. Real Yield with A DeFi Protocol Mutuum Finance has a promising investment thesis that goes well beyond the mechanics of a typical presale. The team has confirmed that their first protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025 , putting to rest the doubts surrounding its tangible product. Apart from giving primary market access to ETH and USDT, the first operational milestone will also demonstrate the project’s core lending and borrowing ecosystem which comprises Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot. The project has the potential to shift the speculation in the crypto market by offering tangible use cases and easily monetizable offerings. For crypto investors, this emphasis on creating a functioning and sustainable ecosystem will offer a beneficial edge in a bull market. Diversify into Momentum The crypto market is two-sided at the moment. Established assets are still recovering while new assets like presale assets are skyrocketing in value. While Ethereum tries to capitalize on their profits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating its own, specialized presale that is slated to grow exponentially. The presale’s advanced stage signals that the most advantageous entry point is about to vanish. Due to the current potential of this new crypto coin has, this new crypto coin should be held in the portfolio as to maximize the potential takedown profits that can be generated. This is the easiest and most direct response for crypto investors in the current market.

The rumors were fueled further after MSTR shares fell to their lowest levels in a year. The allegations came to light with a note shared by Walter Bloomberg on his X account. The post stated that Arkham data showed that Strategy's Bitcoin holdings had decreased from 484,000 BTC to approximately 437,000 BTC. It was stated that it was unclear whether this difference of approximately 47,000 BTC was a sale or a transfer, but it was claimed that this was the first decrease since July 2023. Saylor immediately responded to these claims, saying, “This rumor is not true.” Related News: SEC Takes Major Step for Delayed Altcoin ETFs! Bloomberg Analyst Reveals Next ETF! While Arkham claims Strategy holds 437,431 BTC, it also includes a note indicating the company sent 107,319 BTC to Fidelity Custody. In contrast, Strategy's own official dashboard shows a total of 641,692 BTC. This significant discrepancy raises questions about the data tracking platforms' measurement methods. Saylor not only stated that there was no data supporting the claims, but also announced during a live appearance on CNBC that Strategy had accelerated its Bitcoin purchases. “We're buying, and we're buying a lot,” he said. “We'll be releasing our next buying report on Monday morning.” When asked what price levels they were buying at, Saylor said the company had been collecting BTC at all recent price ranges. He also noted that purchases were made at around $95,000 today, adding that Strategy now owns “almost 3.1%” of the Bitcoin network and that their average cost per BTC is $74,000. *This is not investment advice.

54398991,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89633,1763142424,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto Heavyweights Launch Global Standards for Blockchain Payments,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-heavyweights-launch-global-standards-for-blockchain-payments/,"While the crypto industry continues to grow in popularity around the world, it’s recently been given a major boost in that quest. It came as a group of major crypto firms have banded together to create a set of global standards for blockchain payments. Across the industry and outside of it, the move is a welcome one. Many feel that it will go a long way toward enhancing trust in the industry. While many governments around the world still grapple with how best to regulate crypto, the move is seen as a positive one as the industry seeks to effectively police itself through it. The coalition includes massive crypto firms like Ripple, TRON, and Nodle. The aim is to make digital payments easier. A large part of this design will be to make payments interoperable across platforms. One of the major barriers to crypto payments becoming more mainstream has been this issue. Just as banks have agreements in place with one another and work with large, global networks, crypto blockchains have largely remained unable to operate across each other’s networks. Across various industries, crypto payments have continued to grow more popular. Many use them now for options like online shopping at eCommerce stores that accept them. Online gaming use has also been growing. The iGaming industry has proven to be a huge adopter of crypto payments. However, with gambling laws often stringent, the option of using virtual coins at sweepstake casinos is rapidly growing in stature. Among the best online sweepstakes sites , more players are using virtual coins to wager and play their favorite casino games. The appeal here is that they can experience all the fun without upfront real money investments. The ability to play with digital coins mirrors the way crypto payments are made. With everything done online, the convenience is something physical gaming rooms and casinos simply can’t compete with. However, while these kinds of payment models may bear similarities with crypto and digital currencies, the key difference is value. When using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum for example, not only do these tokens have real money value, they are actually quite valuable . While many purchase and hold crypto for their growth potential, the ability to make purchases and use them for online services has grown widely in recent years. The partnership to provide new standards for such payments arrives at a time when global regulators are pushing for greater transparency in digital finance. Cross-border payments remain fragmented, with each network running on its own system. The absence of shared technical and operational rules has created inefficiencies and security gaps . By creating a unified standard, these companies hope to make crypto transactions as smooth as traditional bank transfers while maintaining decentralisation. This move is seen as an early step toward building trust among governments and large financial institutions that remain cautious about the crypto sector. The collaboration between these crypto leaders reflects a broader shift toward cooperation rather than competition. TRON founder Justin Sun and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse have both emphasised that shared standards are essential for mainstream adoption. They argue that the lack of a unified approach has slowed progress in areas like remittances and retail payments. A consistent protocol for how information is exchanged between blockchains could dramatically speed up adoption for small and large businesses alike. The proposed standards will focus on interoperability, which allows separate blockchains to communicate and complete transactions seamlessly. This concept could allow a user to send tokens from one blockchain to another without using a central exchange. It would also reduce costs and cut down transaction times, particularly in markets where access to global banking systems is limited. The long-term hope is that these standards can become the digital equivalent of SWIFT codes or ISO formats that banks use for traditional payments. Regulation remains a key challenge. Governments across the United States, Europe, and Asia are working on crypto-specific frameworks, but progress varies widely. In some regions, crypto payments are treated as speculative activity, while in others they are being integrated into everyday commerce. The crypto industry hopes to show that it can set its own best practices without waiting for heavy-handed regulation. This self-governing model could encourage collaboration between private companies and regulators instead of confrontation. The new initiative is also expected to improve consumer protection. Standardisation can reduce errors, prevent double spending, and make it easier for users to verify transactions. It could also encourage more transparency from service providers by creating clear reporting and compliance structures. As more businesses adopt crypto payments, having a shared set of expectations for how these systems operate will be essential.

CRCL reported FQ3 2025 results with 66% revenue growth and 108% USDC circulation growth, reinforcing its premium valuation and leadership in digital payments. Strategic partnerships and favorable market trends position CRCL for continued expansion, supported by a bullish outlook on stablecoin adoption and regulatory tailwinds. Assign a Strong Buy rating with a $134 price target, reflecting a 55% upside, driven by high growth, robust moat, and pro-crypto sentiment. Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE: CRLC ) is a global fintech that mainly focuses on digital assets, payments, and public blockchains. The company is known to be the issuer of USDC and EURC stablecoins, and a pioneer of the current digital asset revolution. Circle Internet Group also provides fintech services to businesses that seek to integrate blockchain-based payment and stablecoin solutions into their operations. CRCL debuted on June 4, 2025 , and has experienced significant demand for the company's stock. It has exceeded the initial price tag of $31 roughly 10x, reaching an all-time high 19 days later on June 23, 2025, hitting $298 price target . The stock has consolidated since then, yet now I think it has approached levels that may appear compelling to the long-term investors. I think Circle Internet Group experiences substantial multi-year tailwinds, which could result in the stock price appreciation and broader market outperformance. Based on this ECB article , CRCL is the second-largest stablecoin issuer in the world, and I believe the company positions itself to dominate the space over the following decade. That is why I think Circle Internet Group is a Strong Buy with a $134 price target over the next 12 months. This reflects a 55% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. The Second Ever Quarterly Report: Streak Continues, FQ2 2025 Highlights A Double-Beat On November 12, Circle Internet Group presented its second-ever quarterly report, highlighting FQ3 2025 results. The fintech pioneer continues its successful track record, indicating a double-beat performance. The market reacted to the results with a 5% decline in the pre-market session. Circle posted $740 million in revenue, suggesting a 66% growth on a year-over-year basis, and $40 million above what the market had anticipated. The bottom line arrived at $0.64 in GAAP EPS, and $0.46 above the analysts' estimate. These results indicate strong demand, solid growth, and argue for premium valuation. CRCL: FQ3 2025 Key Highlights (Circle Internet Group Investor Relations) In the earnings presentation , the company highlighted $73.7 billion in USDC circulation, suggesting significant network growth, representing a 108% growth on a year-over-year basis. The clients are leveraging Circle's network to optimize payments and cross-border transactions, which is also justified by $9.6 trillion in USDC on-chain volume, indicating 6.8x growth on a year-over-year basis. It seems that CRCL is gradually becoming one of the future leaders in the global payments landscape. Management highlighted that USDC has achieved a 29% market share in terms of stablecoin circulation volume this quarter. The overall circulation has grown 59% on a year-over-year basis, with Tether (USDT) leading the industry with roughly $175 billion of stablecoin network. Although the market may discount Circle due to being the second-largest in the space, I argue that this doesn't cloud the outlook at all. Based on this Citigroup research, the global stablecoin market size reached $282 billion in 2025, and on the base-case basis is anticipated to reach $1.9 trillion by 2030. This represents a 46.46% CAGR. If Circle coin maintains a dominant position in the space, it would significantly benefit from stablecoin market growth if tailwinds materialize. This heavily supports the bullish outlook for the company. CRCL: FQ3 2025 USDC Market ShareCRCL: FQ3 2025 USDC Market Share (Circle Internet Group Investor Relations) CRCL: FQ3 2025 USDC Market Share (Circle Internet Group) In addition, Circle continues partnerships, which drive network growth and top-line expansion. For instance, on September 17, the company announced a partnership with Kraken, aiming to expand USDC and EURC access and accelerate the utility of stablecoins on their platform. Furthermore, on September 30, Deutsche Boerse Group announced a collaboration with CRCL to advance the adoption of stablecoins in Europe. This is meaningful because Deutsche Boerse Group provides market infrastructure services to capital markets, including the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. These collaborative initiatives support a bullish and ambitious outlook and may significantly contribute to USDC's network growth. In addition, Circle Internet Group highlighted that the strong momentum for its network reflects 29 financial institutions enrolled, 55 in eligibility reviews, and roughly 500 are currently in the pipeline. With more entities on board, CRCL will strengthen its moat, and this supports a bullish narrative and positive outlook for the company. CRCL: FY2025 Outlook (Circle Internet Group Investor Relations) Management provided an update to the previously guided FY2025 outlook. CRCL anticipates a 40% CAGR for its USDC circulation, with $95 million in other revenue for FY2025. RLDC Margin is expected to reach roughly 38%, and adjusted operating expenses are expected to come in at approximately $502.5 million in FY2025. I believe the company appears to be well-positioned to achieve these targets. In addition, these expectations highlight improving fundamentals, which support a positive narrative. To conclude, this has been a solid quarterly performance for the stablecoin leader. The USDC network is expanding, with more institutions on board. I believe the significant pipeline of 500 institutions appears promising and reflects bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the company strengthens its market dominance and should benefit from the stablecoin market growth if the market share is sustained. Circulation in stablecoins has surged 59% over the past 12 months, indicating a strong demand for an innovative approach for digital assets and a global payment solution. I think the trend of rising demand is likely to continue, and Circle appears to be well-positioned to remain one of the key beneficiaries over the next years. Circle Appears Fairly Priced, But I Argue There Is Room For Multiple Expansion If Growth Delivers Circle Internet Group is currently trading at roughly 68 forward P/E versus the FY2026 estimate of $1.25. Although this indicates more than 2.5x overvaluation versus peers at 24x , and the average company in the S&P500 at approximately 23x earnings multiple , I argue that Circle deserves a premium valuation, and there is more room for multiple expansion if growth delivers. The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 8.24 and 8.58, respectively, support the thesis of premium valuation, indicating a 2.3x overvaluation versus the sector medians of 3.56 and 3.59. This may partially cloud the positive outlook. These valuation metrics suggest that the market may have already partially priced in the future revenue growth. CRCL: Revenue (Quarterly) (Seeking Alpha) Although this could be a possibility, based on the recent quarterly results, CRCL achieved more than 60% top-line expansion; therefore, a 2.3x premium, in terms of earnings multiple, may appear insignificant. The revenue growth rate indicates roughly 6x outperformance versus the benchmark's historical revenue growth rate of 10% , and more than 6x advantage versus the sector median of 8.47% revenue growth over the past 12 months. Given this, I argue that there is more room for multiple expansion if CRCL can sustain such phenomenal top-line growth. CRCL: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) Circle Internet Group is a low-leveraged business, and that is a significant argument for bullish continuation. The digital asset disruptor has approximately $222 million in total obligations , which could appear meaningful, but the company also has $1.35 billion in cash; thus, it could pay its debt with ease. Moreover, the stablecoin companies are acquiring more treasury bills than most foreign countries , and in this way, they heavily contribute to the reshaping of fixed-income markets. Followed by the GENIUS Act signed by President Trump in July, the pro-crypto administration established a clearer framework for stablecoins. This heavily contributed to the adoption of the digital assets and a more favorable environment, driving the positive sentiment. In addition to this, stablecoins are usually pegged to the US dollar and are backed 1-to-1 with reserves; thus, if demand for stablecoins grows, issuing companies may become one of the largest holders of treasury bills in the world. I also think this is a significant tailwind for the company, indicating that a larger USDC network would be backed with t-bills that are yielding revenue for CRCL. I also believe the trend of stablecoin adoption is likely to continue, and if administration remains pro-crypto, this could lead to the acceleration of digital asset demand. CRCL: Cash From Operations (Quarterly) (YCharts) Furthermore, the sentiment tied to Circle Internet Group is heavily dependent on the cryptocurrency environment. If investors are feeling more bullish, equities with crypto exposure may experience a positive sentiment shift, driving the stock prices higher. To highlight, the past three months of the year typically indicate a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies. Although this year both Bitcoin and Ethereum are down in Q4 , these underlying assets historically delivered double-digit returns in terms of both medians and averages. I think that the Fed easing cycle, pro-crypto administration, and meaningful increase in the digital asset treasury companies, such as Bitcoin treasury companies , which are supporting a floor price of underlying assets, support my bullish thesis that seasonality may still be in play. This would be a favorable environment for Circle, which could spark an end-of-year rally. Management achieved 6.34% return on total capital (TTM), which signals a 58% advantage versus peers at 4.01%. Circle Internet Group generated $523 million in cash from operations on a TTM basis, implying more than a 4x outperformance versus the sector median of nearly $121 million. To conclude, Circle is pioneering its way to dominate the rapidly growing industry of stablecoins and digital assets. The company is experiencing significant demand for its services, resulting in a surge of network growth. Based on the quarterly reports, the stablecoin issuer achieved more than a 60% revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, and if management can sustain this expansion rate, it is likely to maintain its dominant stance in the landscape over the following years. If this materializes, CRCL would also likely become one of the key beneficiaries of the digital asset revolution, driving a bullish narrative. Wall Street anticipates a negative $0.82 in diluted EPS for FY2025, $1.25 for FY2026, and $2.50 in diluted EPS for FY2027. Based on the analysis, I believe Circle remains well-positioned to achieve these targets, especially if a significant pipeline of institutions adopts the company's USDC solutions. If we apply a forward P/E of about 55 to the FY2027 EPS estimate of $2.50, we arrive at my price target of $134. This would represent a slightly more than 2x premium versus peers and the benchmark, justified by rapid revenue growth and dominant stance in a revolutionary landscape. I think the company experiences significant tailwinds, and if they materialize, Circle may become a dominant player in the stablecoin adoption for years to come. Main Risks And Concerns There are risks and concerns tied to Circle Internet Group that could meaningfully impact the stock price performance in the near term. To begin with, the company is heavily dependent on the monetary policy and a high-interest-rate environment. Its top-line growth is driven primarily by interest earned from high yield. Therefore, if the Fed reduces the funding rate significantly, this may result in weaker-than-anticipated revenue growth, and that may cloud the company's outlook. Although the current administration in the US appears to be pro-crypto, the global situation remains uncertain. If any unfavorable regulations and administration policies around the globe arise, this could meaningfully impact Circle's future outlook and sentiment in countries other than the US. Circle Internet Group experiences fierce competition from Tether. Although the company appears to have a dominant stance in the landscape, substitution risk remains. Digital institutions may favor the leading company in the field, which could contribute to the negative outlook. In addition, with the rise of stablecoin adoption, there may be more institutions issuing their own digital assets. For instance, based on this article, European banks are considering launching euro-denominated stablecoins to counter US dominance. This may appear concerning, but based on the stablecoin market growth, it is likely that there will be more players in the field to supply the rapidly growing demand. Thus, I think these concerns may appear overblown. Circle is also heavily dependent on the crypto sentiment. The stock correlates to crypto volatility, and it could be a challenge for long-term investors to stomach significant price swings. Although I think Circle is likely to become more stable as the business grows, in the short term, this remains a concern and feature to underline. On the other hand, if none of the risks and concerns materialize, I think Circle remains well-positioned to benefit from broader stablecoin market growth. Conclusion: Circle Is A Pioneer, Experiencing Significant Tailwinds — A Strong Buy I think Circle Internet Group may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who seek exposure to the cryptocurrency landscape through equity markets. CRCL is a pioneer in the high-growth, high-demand revolutionary industry of digital assets and payment solutions, and I think the trend is likely to continue, justified by pro-crypto administration and successful adoption of stablecoins. Although the company remains highly volatile and dependent on both cryptocurrency sentiment and monetary policy, I think the tailwinds highlighted in the article outweigh the headwinds. I also believe that with a significant growth in the USDC network, and with more digital assets issued and being backed with treasury bills, CRCL is likely to become a more stable stock, justified by a larger moat and strong balance sheet. Given this, it may attract long-term investors seeking a more stable investment environment. I rate Circle Internet Group a Strong Buy with a $134 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests a 55% upside possibility and broader market outperformance. I think the company pioneers its way to dominate the stablecoin landscape over the following decade, and that heavily supports its bullish narrative. 18 Wall Street analysts forecast a $163 price target, reflecting a 89% upside possibility. Although this is definitely a possibility, I favor a more conservative approach, leaving me room for error.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-14 17:49:30
54399487,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=860815,1763142947,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54399487.jpeg,Google submits sweeping EU compliance plan after €3 billion ad-tech fine,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-offers-ad-tech-fixes-to-eu/,"Google has submitted a sweeping compliance plan aimed at overhauling its ad-technology operations across Europe. The move comes after the EU fined the company €3 billion for what regulators deemed unfair “self-preferencing” in its digital ad business. The European Commission’s punishment targets the tech firm’s dominance in three areas of the ad-tech supply chain. Google lets website owners decide ad prices and use more tools Google will now allow publishers to decide how much they want to charge for ads on their website through the company’s Ad Manager platform . The tech giant always favored its own services over others by setting uniform pricing rules that discouraged competition. But after the EU fined the company billions, Google had no choice but to relinquish its unfair monopoly in advertising and create a more competitive bidding space. Apart from adjusting its pricing, the company will also enhance interoperability across its ad tech services, enabling advertisers to market across multiple websites. At the same time, publishers will be able to bundle various tools that work well for their content and audience, rather than relying on the limited configurations provided by the tech firm. While all this is happening, the global digital advertising market is projected to reach $757.5 billion in 2025. The market expects Google to generate $205 billion in revenue, with $171.7 billion from search ads and $33.3 billion from display ads. The California-based company has consistently taken the largest share of ad revenue, prompting regulatory authorities to monitor its market influence. The parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc., stated that the changes will comply with EU standards while maintaining the utility of its ad platform. Google says these fixes will be rolled out “over time” to give publishers and advertisers enough time to prepare for and test the new tools. The company did not provide specific dates, but the phased approach is expected to minimize disruptions to existing advertising campaigns. And Google will have the opportunity to experiment with how its changes impact business — all while demonstrating to the European Union, which is investigating the company for anticompetitive behavior, that it can comply with regulators’ demands. The European Union insists Google was not playing fair in how it shows and sells ads The EU fined Google because it alleged that the company favored its own ad tools and exchanged data with competitors, making it harder for small companies to compete. EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera said the tech firm will eventually have to sell or split parts of its ad technology business to comply fully with EU rules. Google disagrees with the ruling and plans to appeal the fine, arguing that it is too harsh and that the company has not broken any rules. However, the company is modifying its ad tech services to demonstrate to the EU that it is willing to comply while still defending itself in the appeal process. The appeal could take many months or years, so Google will continue to run its ad business and gradually roll out changes to its platform during this time. This step-by-step strategy will enable the company to continue dominating digital advertising, maintain steady revenue, and demonstrate compliance while challenging the EU’s decision. Analysts say the EU’s decision will make the market fairer, but it won’t be as effective at stopping dominance entirely as breaking up Google’s ad business. Many publishers and advertisers are pleased with the news and say they will now be able to compete fairly with larger players. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Meanwhile, crypto XAU has also highlighted a bearish setup that could spark a further decline to $0.15. Dogecoin Price Risks Drop To $0.16 With Double Top Adam And Eve Pattern In a TradingView post, Tripy revealed that a classic Adam and Eve pattern has formed for the Dogecoin price. The analyst warned that market participants may see volatility around the breakdown, but that the pattern rarely fails. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could suffer a decline to as low as $0.16 due to this double top pattern. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price “Historic Mega Run” – Here’s The Target Tripy also revealed that the MACD and volume are falling, indicating that a sell-off is coming for the Dogecoin price. A positive is that the analyst expects DOGE to rebound from the $0.16 range. The sell-off in the foremost meme coin is underway, with DOGE recording a significant decline yesterday as Bitcoin dropped below $100,000 for the second time this month. Crypto analyst XAU drew a bearish setup toward $0.15 for the Dogecoin price. He noted that DOGE remains under strong bearish pressure, following multiple Breaks of Structure (BOS) and Market Structure (MSS) on the 3-hour timeframe. The analyst further stated that after a brief consolidation phase, the price continues to respect the descending trend, indicating a lack of bullish strength. Notably, the Dogecoin price had attempted a minor upward correction toward the psychological $0.2 level but failed to reclaim the zone. As a result, XAU has warned that this may trigger a sharp drop toward the $0.15 level, which will confirm continuation of the broader bearish trend. The analyst added that momentum remains weak and sellers continue to dominate short-term rallies, indicating further downside pressure. DOGE Reenters Broadening Wedge In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that the Dogecoin price has reentered the broadening wedge after a “Spring Action.” He added that this pattern was last seen in 2024, just before a massive surge. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could still rally to $0.8, despite the current bearish price action. A rally to this level would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the foremost meme coin.

54399369,627764,1763143248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54399369.jpeg,Dogecoin Back In Focus As Elon Musk Says X Money Is ‘Coming Soon’,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-elon-musk-x-money-coming-soon/,"Elon Musk has again pushed his “everything app” vision for X into the spotlight, telling users that a native payments layer, X Money, is now close to launch – and reigniting questions over whether Dogecoin, Bitcoin or crypto at large will be part of it. In a post on Nov. 13, Musk announced a major technical milestone for the platform: “X just rolled out an entire new communications stack with encrypted messages, audio/video calls and file transfer. X Money comes out soon. Join us if you want to build cool products. X will be the everything app.” Will X Money Integrate Dogecoin? That line caps a multi-year effort to rebuild X’s back-end as a super-app spine. Earlier, Musk described the new XChat layer as “built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture,” tying the messaging stack explicitly to the cryptographic model popularized by Bitcoin, even though no on-chain component has been announced. On the payments side, X Money is no longer just a concept. The service has entered limited beta, offering peer-to-peer transfers, a digital wallet and bank or debit-card connections, with settlement handled through Visa Direct. X has secured dozens of US money-transmitter licences, though key jurisdictions such as New York remain pending, which continues to delay a full nationwide rollout. So far, all official product descriptions put X Money firmly in the fiat camp at launch: a Venmo- or Cash App-style wallet inside X, backed by Visa, focused on traditional payment rails. Neither Musk nor X has committed publicly to integrating crypto in the first release. Yet the crypto signals around Musk have intensified in parallel with the X Money messaging. On Oct. 14, in response to a discussion about monetary debasement, he declared:“Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.” The remark was read widely as a renewed endorsement of Bitcoin’s “hard money” properties after years of relative silence, and it aligns with Musk’s broader narrative that fiat currencies are structurally fragile. Earlier this month, Musk has once again put Dogecoin back at the centre of social-media attention . On Nov. 3, Dogecoin community member DogeDesigner reposted the slogan “No Highs, No Lows, Only DOGE” alongside a screenshot of Musk’s 2021 vow that “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon.” Musk replied with just two words: “It’s time.” That minimalist update was enough to ignite trading frenzies in DOGE-linked instruments. A DOGE-1 memecoin tied to the lunar mission surged roughly 300–350% in the days after the post, while derivatives volumes in Dogecoin itself spiked by orders of magnitude on some venues, even as spot price action remained more muted. The pattern is familiar. For years, Dogecoin has traded as a high-beta bet on Musk’s product roadmap and memes. Double-digit intraday moves in DOGE following earlier Musk posts such as “One word: Doge” or his “people’s crypto” comments were common for years. Crucially, however, there is still no explicit link between Dogecoin and X Money in any official communication. X’s payments documentation and third-party reporting consistently describe a product that launches as a fiat wallet and P2P system. The crypto layer – whether BTC, Dogecoin or stablecoins – remains in the realm of possibility rather than confirmation. Musk has, if anything, narrowed the scope in one important respect. In response to waves of “X token” rumours, he has repeatedly insisted that none of his companies will issue a native coin, writing in late 2023 that “none of my companies will ever create a crypto token.” That means any eventual crypto support inside X Money would almost certainly rely on existing assets rather than a proprietary token. Taken together, Musk’s recent posts sketch a clear but incomplete picture. On one side is a rapidly evolving infrastructure: encrypted messaging in Rust, a Visa-backed wallet, and money-transmitter licences across much of the US. On the other is an increasingly loud set of ideological and cultural signals: Bitcoin as an energy-anchored antidote to “fake fiat,” and Dogecoin as the meme-driven transactional asset most closely tied to Musk’s public persona.

Over a short 24‑hour window, more than 149 million units of XRP—equivalent to approximately US $336 million—were withdrawn from centralized exchanges. According to Pumpius, this mass movement is unlikely to stem from ordinary retail trading behavior. On‑chain and analytics‑platform data confirm a steep reduction in XRP holdings on major exchanges. One source shows that in early November 2025, the reserve of XRP on Binance alone fell below 2.8 billion tokens, after continuous declines from earlier months. Additional reports corroborate that the 149 million‑token exodus has significantly tightened liquidity in the exchange‑based supply. XRP SUPPLY ON EXCHANGES IS COLLAPSING More than 149 million XRP worth roughly 336 million dollars has been pulled off centralized exchanges in just 24 hours. This is not normal retail movement. This is mass accumulation, the kind of behavior that happens when big players… pic.twitter.com/gd7zBAHjvi — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 14, 2025 Why the Supply Drop Matters When tokens leave exchanges, they typically move into self‑custody or cold storage, reducing the amount immediately available for trading. This shift means fewer tokens stand ready to be sold when buy‑side demand rises. Consequently, even modest buying pressure can spark outsized price reactions. The withdrawals suggest large holders are preparing for an event beyond everyday speculation—distributing assets into private custody in anticipation. As Pumpius described it: “not normal retail movement.” Meanwhile, analytics platforms are warning of a potential “supply crisis” that could invigorate XRP’s next upward move. Connecting the Dots: Institutional Flows & ETF Activity Coincident with the supply contraction, institutional interest in XRP has accelerated. The debut of the spot‑XRP ETF product XRPC recorded robust early inflows , adding an institutional layer to on‑chain scarcity. The interplay between diminishing exchange reserves and rising institutional demand suggests that XRP may be entering a structural phase where supply cannot easily adapt to sudden demand surges. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Might Be Loading If large holders are strategically withdrawing XRP ahead of a demand shock, the market may be primed for a sharp supply‑squeeze. Reduced selling pressure means buyers entering the market could face far less resistance. That setup often precedes periods of enhanced volatility and sustained upside. However, the absence of immediate price acceleration also indicates patience may be required. The region of accumulation may extend before the supply‑shock dynamic fully manifests. Final Thoughts The dramatic withdrawal of XRP from exchanges, combined with increased institutional attention, signals a potentially transformative moment in the asset’s market structure. With liquidity tightening, the next demand wave—when it arrives—could have an outsized impact on price behavior. If large holders are indeed loading ahead of something substantial, the question shifts from if to when. For now, the evidence points to a market quietly repositioning itself for the next phase.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $95,985.76 on the Binance USDT market, sending shockwaves through the digital asset community. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Drop? The sudden decline in Bitcoin price has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several potential factors that could be influencing this downward movement. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone tracking cryptocurrency trends. Key factors affecting the current Bitcoin price include: Market sentiment shifts among institutional investors Technical resistance levels around $96,000 Broader economic indicators impacting risk assets Trading volume patterns across major exchanges How Significant Is This Bitcoin Price Movement? While any drop in Bitcoin price captures attention, context matters greatly. The current trading level represents a notable pullback from recent highs. However, experienced traders know that volatility is inherent to cryptocurrency markets. The Bitcoin price has shown remarkable resilience throughout 2024, making this correction part of normal market cycles. Historical data suggests that such movements often present buying opportunities for long-term investors. What Should Investors Watch Next? Monitoring key support and resistance levels becomes essential when the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements. The $95,000 level now serves as immediate support, while reclaiming $96,500 could signal renewed bullish momentum. Traders should pay attention to: Daily trading volume patterns Major exchange order book depth Institutional flow data Market sentiment indicators Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? Many seasoned investors view price corrections as potential entry points. The current Bitcoin price movement might attract those who missed earlier buying opportunities. However, proper risk management remains paramount in volatile markets. Remember that cryptocurrency investing requires: Diversification across assets Clear risk tolerance assessment Long-term perspective Regular portfolio rebalancing Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility The Bitcoin price movement below $96,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market dynamics. While short-term fluctuations can be dramatic, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong. Smart investors use these moments to reassess their strategies rather than make panic-driven decisions. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $96,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely results from combination of technical factors, market sentiment shifts, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets. How low could Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, key support levels to watch include $95,000 and $93,500 based on historical price action and technical analysis. Should I buy Bitcoin at current prices? Investment decisions depend on individual risk tolerance and financial goals. Many investors view price corrections as potential buying opportunities, but always conduct your own research. How long might this Bitcoin price correction last? Cryptocurrency corrections can last from days to weeks. Monitoring trading volume and market sentiment can provide clues about potential duration. What’s the long-term outlook for Bitcoin price? Most analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, though short-term volatility is expected to continue as the market matures. How does this Bitcoin price movement compare to historical patterns? Current volatility falls within normal historical ranges for Bitcoin, which has experienced much larger percentage moves throughout its history. Found this analysis helpful?

However, analysts say the XRP price prediction still points to a breakout above $4 soon. Following its debut on November 13, the Canary Capital XRPC product recorded $26 million in trading volume within its first 30 minutes before ending the day with over $58M in trading volume to surpass the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF as the top ETF launch of 2025. CryptoAmerica journalist Eleanor Terrett applauded the XRP army for consistently showing support for the token, which earned XRP the largest ETF launch of the year. Wowza. $XRPC surpassed $BSOL to become the biggest ETF launch of the year. TBH tho, with the $XRP Army behind it, is anyone really surprised? https://t.co/7k649KCQFo — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) November 13, 2025 She said, “ TBH tho, with the $XRP Army behind it, is anyone really surprised? “ VanEck Exec Applauds XRP Army On Record ETF Launch VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, also applauded XRP maxis, though he said he didn’t understand what the Ripple “ blockchain ” actually does. “But I’ll always respect the passion required to pretend it does something. So keep hustling!” he added. Crypto analyst at Cypress Research attributed today’s XRP price slump to the general crypto market weakness that saw Bitcoin drop below $96,000 for the first time since May. However, he believes that when the fundamentals flip back risk on, and the uncertainty and headwinds calm, $XRP will easily hit $3.82 , then $4.44 before flying to $5.17 . “Our institutional software has shown dark pools sitting at each of these levels” , he added. XRP Price Prediction: Falling Wedge Signals Bullish $4 Breakout Ahead The XRP chart shows the price sitting directly on a major support zone around the $2.25–$2.40 area, which has repeatedly acted as the base of a long descending channel. The structure suggests that XRP has been consolidating inside a falling wedge, a pattern that typically signals bullish reversal once the upper trendline is broken. The RSI sitting near mid-40s reflects neutral momentum but leaves room for a rebound without being overbought. Source: TradingView If XRP holds the support zone and begins to curl upward as the chart projection indicates, the next logical targets are the Fibonacci resistance levels at $2.57, $2.78, and $2.99. A confirmed breakout from the wedge would open the path toward the higher levels at $3.24 and ultimately $3.66. PEPENODE $2M Presale Offers 604% Staking Yield If XRP finally breaks out of the $4.00 psychological level, it would mean low-cap crypto coins would also pump. More investors are now looking at early projects that bring real features like staking, useful functions, or active communities right from launch, particularly when they can get in before the token goes public. One such presale project gaining traction is Pepenode (PEPENODE) . This gaming-style meme coin has brought in over $2 million in presale funding and caught the eye of market watchers who believe there’s potential for strong gains as it gains steam. The project transforms a basic meme token into a mining-themed game running on Ethereum. Token holders can purchase virtual mining equipment and improve their digital facilities through a web-based control panel, creating their own server setup that tracks mining power, energy costs, and earnings. Rather than managing actual equipment, users interact with a simple screen where each piece of equipment increases their earnings and opens up more ways to play. PEPENODE sells for $0.00115 right now, letting new buyers get in at a low price before it increases in the next 24 hours. Investors can purchase $PEPENODE with ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card, and can lock their tokens right away to earn around 607% per year.

This latest action demonstrates how authorities are rapidly adapting to combat crypto-related crimes on an international scale. What Does This USDT Seizure Mean for Crypto Security? The recent USDT seizure represents one of the largest cryptocurrency confiscations tied to North Korean cyber operations. According to CoinDesk reports, this marks a significant escalation in the DOJ’s efforts to disrupt illicit financial networks. The targeted USDT seizure specifically aimed at funds connected to North Korean hacking groups known for targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions. This enforcement action follows a pattern of increasing regulatory scrutiny on stablecoins like Tether. Moreover, the successful USDT seizure demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are developing sophisticated tracking capabilities for blockchain transactions. Therefore, this case sets an important precedent for future cryptocurrency enforcement actions. How Do Authorities Execute a USDT Seizure? Executing a USDT seizure involves complex coordination between multiple agencies and requires specialized blockchain forensic tools. The process typically includes: Identifying suspicious transaction patterns on the blockchain Tracking fund movements across multiple wallets Working with cryptocurrency exchanges to freeze assets Obtaining legal authorization for asset seizure Coordinating with international law enforcement partners This particular USDT seizure required extensive investigation into North Korea’s cyber operations. The department focused on funds obtained through various illicit activities including ransomware attacks and exchange hacks. Why Target North Korean Crypto Operations? North Korea has emerged as a significant threat in the cryptocurrency space, using digital assets to bypass international sanctions. The successful USDT seizure disrupts their ability to finance prohibited weapons programs and other illegal activities. This enforcement action sends a clear message that the United States will aggressively pursue foreign actors exploiting cryptocurrency for malicious purposes. The timing of this USDT seizure coincides with increased global attention on North Korea’s cyber capabilities. Furthermore, it highlights the growing sophistication of international law enforcement in combating crypto crimes. The department’s ability to track and seize these assets represents a major victory for financial security. What Are the Implications for Crypto Investors? For legitimate cryptocurrency users, this USDT seizure actually represents positive development. It demonstrates that: Regulatory frameworks are becoming more effective Illicit activities can be identified and stopped The ecosystem is becoming safer for legitimate participants Stablecoins remain subject to legal oversight However, investors should remain vigilant about compliance requirements and ensure they maintain proper documentation for all transactions. The continued focus on enforcement means that regulatory compliance remains crucial for long-term participation in cryptocurrency markets. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Enforcement This landmark USDT seizure likely signals the beginning of more aggressive enforcement actions against bad actors in the cryptocurrency space. As authorities refine their tracking capabilities, we can expect to see more coordinated international efforts to combat crypto crime. The success of this operation will probably encourage similar actions against other state-sponsored hacking groups and criminal organizations. The department’s ability to execute such a significant USDT seizure demonstrates that the age of anonymous cryptocurrency transactions may be ending. This development ultimately benefits the entire ecosystem by increasing trust and legitimacy in digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions What is a USDT seizure? A USDT seizure occurs when law enforcement authorities legally confiscate Tether stablecoins from individuals or entities involved in criminal activities. Why does the DOJ target North Korean crypto operations? North Korea uses cryptocurrency to bypass international sanctions and fund illegal weapons programs, making their crypto activities a national security concern. How can authorities track and seize cryptocurrency? Authorities use blockchain analysis tools, work with exchanges, and employ traditional investigative methods to identify and freeze illicit crypto assets. Does this affect legitimate cryptocurrency users? No, these enforcement actions target criminal activities and actually help create a safer environment for legitimate cryptocurrency participants. What happens to the seized USDT? Seized cryptocurrency is typically held as evidence during legal proceedings and may be liquidated or distributed according to court orders. Will we see more crypto seizures in the future? Yes, as law enforcement capabilities improve, we can expect increased enforcement actions against illicit cryptocurrency activities.

The fund’s first-day trading volume beat estimates, a development that has shocked even the community. Canary’s XRP ETF Records $58 Million In Day One Trading Volume In an X post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) recorded $58 million in day one trading volume. He further noted that this is the most of any ETF launched this year, among the 900 launched. With this, the fund also edged Bitwise’s Solana ETF , which recorded $57 million in day-one trading volume. The Bloomberg analyst added that the two of them are in a league of their own, as the third-best launch this year is $20 million away. Meanwhile, Canary’s XRP ETF beat estimates, with Balachunas predicting $17 million in day-one trading volume and his colleague James Seyffart predicting $34 million. Canary Capital’s CEO Steven McClurg had joined in on the conversation, asserting that the fund was going to record way over $34 million in trading volume, which eventually happened. Seyffart had admitted that it was possible, stating that “ XRP army is real and no joke,” thereby crediting the community’s effort for such performance. Commenting on this development for the fund, market expert Nate Geraci noted that almost every single spot crypto ETF launch has significantly exceeded TradFi’s expectations. He declared that there is a lesson in that, as there is still significant skepticism from the old guard in TradFi. However, he added that investors who are voting with their money are what matter and that the top ETF launches in the last 2 years have been dominated by crypto. Canary’s Fund Records $245 Million in Net Inflows Canary Capital revealed that its XRP ETF recorded $245 million in net inflows. This also topped Bitwise’s Solana ETF, which recorded almost $70 million in first-day inflows. Geraci explained that the inflows are way higher than the trading volume because of in-kind creations, which don’t show up in trading volume. In-kind creations allow the issuer to create shares with the token instead of cash. Meanwhile, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan also commented on the success of the fund. He noted that the median opinion of a crypto asset does not determine an ETF’s success. He further remarked that one would rather have 20% of people love an asset than 80% of people who vaguely like it. Hougan added that ETFs die from apathy, not disagreement. The Bitwise CIO made this comment because the token is believed to be one of the most ‘hated’ crypto assets . At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.28, down over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Bitwise|Canary Capital|Canary’s XRP ETF|Coinmarketcap|Eric Balchunas|James Seyffart|Matt Hougan|Nate Geraci|ripple|Solana Spot ETF|Steven McClurg|XRP news|XRP price|XRPC|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 19:00:00

According to Davis, old buyers can return and push a token higher even when network use is low. That is part of why some traders treat certain assets as almost cult-like. Sentiment matters, but momentum matters more than steady on-chain growth in many cases. Technical Signals Point To A Narrow Upside If Key Levels Break TradingView analyst “AltcoinPiooners” has highlighted recent price action and a possible shift in market pressure. Reports show ADA tested support at $0.53 after hitting $0.60 on November 11 and falling the next day. Analysts See A Clear Path, But Risks Remain According to the analyst, ADA could move to $0.62 and then to $0.65 if $0.60 is cleared, a move that would equal more than a 16% gain from current levels. Reports also revealed that Cardano whales added 348 million ADA over four days while the price dipped below $0.50 recently. On the flip side, a failure at support could send ADA down toward $0.52. That risk was flagged by the same analyst.

The project still commands a loyal base, steady interest from long-time holders, and a market cap in the billions.

The newly public fintech, which completed its IPO in September, reported sharp year-over-year gains across revenue, earnings, and loan originations, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of its blockchain-based lending infrastructure. Revenue and earnings far exceed expectations The company reported quarterly earnings of $89.8 million, or 34 cents per share, more than triple the $27.4 million, or 9 cents, recorded in the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected earnings of just 15 cents per share. Revenue came in at $156.4 million, up from $101 million a year ago and well above consensus estimates of $119.4 million. Bernstein analysts described the results as a “massive beat,” noting that adjusted revenue of roughly $156 million was 30% ahead of expectations. Adjusted EBITDA reached about $86 million, 60% above forecasts of roughly $54 million, with margins expanding to almost 55%. The performance underscores Figure’s rapid scale-up in the months following its Nasdaq debut. Founded by SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney, the company has grown into the largest independent non-bank originator of home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs) in the United States. Tokenized loan growth powers core marketplace Loan originations climbed to $2.5 billion in the third quarter, up roughly 34% from the previous quarter and about 70% higher year over year. Figure’s core HELOC offerings accounted for roughly $2.4 billion of volume, significantly outpacing the broader HELOC market, which grew around 4% over the same period. A key driver of this growth is the company’s blockchain-based partner ecosystem. Partner-originated and tokenized loans made up approximately $1.9 billion of total volume, or 76% of all originations. The company’s Figure Connect marketplace, its primary tokenized origination channel, contributed about $1.1 billion — up 48% quarter over quarter — and accounted for nearly half of all loan activity. New product categories also gained traction, generating more than $80 million in volume. These include crypto-backed loans, small and medium-business loans, and debt service coverage ratio loans, reflecting early diversification outside Figure’s HELOC roots. As tokenized partner channels expand, profitability has followed. Partner-branded and intermediated loans delivered take rates of around 4.2%, up 36 basis points from the prior quarter, while take rates on Figure-branded loans rose to roughly 7.1%. Expanding ecosystem strengthens long-term outlook Figure also reported expanding adoption across its broader ecosystem. Active partners on its platforms increased from about 170 to roughly 246 during the quarter, while marketplace participants on Connect rose from 27 to 33. This growing network positioned the company as what Bernstein analysts called the “category leading tokenization platform for credit.” The analysts reaffirmed their outperform rating and $54 price target on the stock, implying roughly 56% upside from Thursday’s close. They pointed to structural growth in tokenized loan origination — particularly through Connect — as central to their long-term investment thesis. Still, they cautioned that macroeconomic conditions, including potential rapid interest-rate declines and a slowdown in private-credit markets, could influence performance. And while Figure’s DeFi initiatives, including its expanding YLDS stablecoin supply, show “promising progress,” they have yet to materially contribute to revenue. With strong execution, rising partner demand, and expanding blockchain-based lending infrastructure, Figure Technology Solutions remains well-positioned as it builds on its breakout third-quarter performance.

Traders and analysts are divided. Some warn of further losses, while others suggest a potential rebound. The focus is on the 50‑day versus 200‑day moving averages crossover, commonly called a “death cross.” This pattern has historically indicated trend shifts and now has XRP enthusiasts closely watching the charts. The death cross occurs when the 50‑day simple moving average crosses below the 200‑day moving average. It typically signals a shift from short‑term strength to long-term weakness. For XRP, this crossover happened while prices hovered near $2.40. Analysts now debate whether this signals continued downside or marks the start of a bullish reversal. #XRP Death Cross pic.twitter.com/xFlu3RUkDB — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 14, 2025 According to a viral post by Steph Is Crypto, this death cross may not be bearish. Steph points to prior occurrences in 2017 and 2020 when similar patterns coincided with major market bottoms. In both cases, XRP surged significantly after forming the crossover, suggesting the pattern could signal an opportunity rather than a decline this time. Implications on XRP Price Some analysts interpret the death cross as a warning. Critical support lies between $2.30 and $2.20. A breakdown below this zone could trigger further losses toward $2.00 or lower. Indicators like RSI and MACD suggest declining momentum, while open interest weakens. If sellers dominate, XRP could experience extended pressure. Steph’s analysis highlights a contrarian viewpoint. Historical patterns show that death crosses often marked the low points before major rallies. In 2017, XRP bottomed near $0.20, later climbing to $3.84. In 2020, it hit $0.11 during the COVID crash and surged to $1.96. This perspective suggests the current death cross may mark a potential bottom. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels and Catalysts Traders should monitor immediate support and resistance levels. Holding above $2.30‑$2.20 could sustain bullish momentum. Breaking resistance near $2.50‑$2.60 would strengthen recovery prospects. External catalysts, including ETF flows and macroeconomic trends, could also impact price direction. Strategy for Traders and Investors The death cross calls for cautious and strategic positioning. Bears may tighten stops or reduce exposure. Contrarian bulls may see this as a buying opportunity, referencing Steph’s historical analysis. Discipline in risk management remains essential for both approaches. XRP’s daily death cross is a pivotal moment, blending caution with potential opportunity. Its ultimate implication will be determined by how the market reacts. Support holds, resistance flips, and external catalysts will shape the next move.

In a Thursday press release, Upexi, which previously allocated $300 million into Solana, confirmed that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase program to be executed at the timing, manner, and price the management team believes is most advantageous. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 “We view the repurchase program as an additional tool to enhance shareholder value and will deploy it only when management believes the repurchase represents an attractive return on capital without compromising our ability to pursue strategic growth or maintain a strong treasury position,” commented the head of the company, Allan Marshall. By reducing the number of shares in circulation, Upexi would effectively increase the amount of SOL tokens that each share represents, which should result in a higher return on investment (ROI) down the road if Solana recovers. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Nears Key Trend Line Support – Can It Bounce Back? In the past 24 hours, SOL has dropped by 10% to $141 per token. Trading volumes surged by 42% to $8.4 billion, as selling pressure seems to be increasing. This creates an opportunity for SOL treasuries to pile in at a 30% discount compared to where SOL traded a few weeks ago. SOL has been dropping in a near vertical move over the past few sessions. The $135 zone now stands out as a major support area, since it lines up with the lower boundary of the current price channel and a previous demand region that sparked a strong rebound back in June. A recovery toward $185 would signal that SOL has likely set a local bottom. History shows that positioning early in leading ecosystems like Solana has rewarded investors many times before. This is where Best Wallet Token ($BEST) enters the conversation, offering one of the strongest presale narratives of the year. One of the token’s biggest advantages is its built-in access to early-stage crypto projects , giving holders the chance to enter high-potential launches before the wider market.

Is ZKP the Best Crypto to Buy This Year?",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-targets-7k-but-zero-knowledge-proofs-whitelist-is-dominating-the-market-is-zkp-the-best-crypto-to-buy-this-year/,"Ethereum Targets $7K, But Zero Knowledge Proof’s Whitelist Is Dominating the Market! Is ZKP the Best Crypto to Buy This Year? Ethereum remains one of the most influential and resilient assets in the crypto market. As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications, it continues to drive innovation even amid broader volatility. Over the past few weeks, Ethereum has shown mixed performance, hovering around $3,756 as of early November, but long-term indicators still point to bullish momentum. Meanwhile, a new entrant called Zero Knowledge Proof is capturing attention as its whitelist goes live, fueling interest among investors looking for the next major trend in 2025. Together, these two projects, one established, one emerging, highlight the dual narrative defining the next cycle: maturity and innovation. Ethereum Price Prediction: Steady Path Toward $ 7 K Ethereum has faced near-term softness, with prices down around 16% over the past four weeks, according to TradingEconomics. However, the overall trend remains constructive. Year-on-year, ETH has gained roughly 57%, based on YCharts data, confirming strong structural growth. Technical indicators, including a rising 200-day moving average, suggest that the long-term foundation remains solid despite recent consolidation. In the short term, analysts expect Ethereum to stabilize in the $3,500–$4,500 range, with resistance near $4,800. Should the network maintain transaction volume growth and attract continued institutional inflows, a breakout above $5,000 could open the door toward the $6,000–$7,000 zone over the next 12–24 months. Institutional staking demand and Ethereum’s critical role in Web3 infrastructure are key catalysts. The network’s dominance in DeFi, NFT platforms, and smart contract deployment keeps it central to the crypto economy. Even with competition from newer chains like Solana and Avalanche, Ethereum’s established security and liquidity make it the best crypto to buy for investors seeking steady exposure to blockchain growth. Zero Knowledge Proof’s Whitelist Is Breaking the Internet! While Ethereum continues to anchor long-term portfolios, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has entered the spotlight as the next mega trend, a new privacy-first blockchain ecosystem now opening its whitelist phase. What sets ZKP apart is its scale and readiness: the team invested over $100 million before selling a single token, building real infrastructure for decentralized computation and privacy integration. The ZKP whitelist opened to massive interest, with over 200,000 registrations in its first 24 hours, showing unprecedented demand for early access. Backed by a unique architecture designed to merge AI, cryptography, and blockchain privacy, ZKP’s upcoming presale is being watched across the industry. The network’s design integrates Zero Knowledge Proofs, allowing verification of transactions and computations without revealing underlying data. This model could enable secure AI collaboration, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and confidential data validation, a field that experts, including Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, have called the future of blockchain scalability and privacy. ZKP’s approach includes an Initial Coin Auction (ICA) system, a transparent alternative to traditional presales. Tokens are distributed daily in proportion to contributions, ensuring fairness and preventing early centralization. For now, though, the whitelist is the only entry point, and it’s filling fast. This combination of high-end cryptography, decentralized compute capability, and massive pre-launch investment has made ZKP a top contender for the best crypto to buy in 2025, especially for investors who want to position early in what could become the defining infrastructure of Web3 privacy. Ethereum and ZKP: Two Forces Shaping the Next Cycle Ethereum and ZKP represent two phases of blockchain evolution, stability, and transformation. Ethereum remains the trusted network that anchors the global decentralized economy, while ZKP is building the bridge to the privacy and AI-integrated future of that same ecosystem. Ethereum’s value lies in its proven adoption: it processes billions in daily value and continues to attract developers and institutions. ZKP’s value lies in its timing, entering the market at the moment privacy, computation, and AI are converging. For investors, the distinction is clear: Ethereum offers blue-chip reliability, while ZKP offers early-stage asymmetry. The two assets don’t compete; they complement each other. A balanced portfolio with both could capture both the current foundation of Web3 and its next generational leap. Investor Outlook: Why Timing Matters Now The key question for 2025 investors isn’t whether Ethereum will rise; it’s how much and how fast. With regulatory clarity improving and institutional staking expanding, Ethereum’s price prediction remains optimistic. A base case sees ETH at $6,200 by late 2025, while a bullish setup could push it toward $7,000 or beyond. At the same time, ZKP’s whitelist launch presents a rare early-access opportunity. The presale isn’t live yet, but the early response already mirrors the beginnings of previous top-performing crypto cycles. If privacy and AI integration dominate the next narrative, ZKP could emerge as one of the best cryptos to buy before the 2025 bull market fully ignites. Final Takeaway Ethereum remains the standard-bearer of smart contract ecosystems, with a realistic 2025 price range of $6,000–$7,000 supported by strong fundamentals and institutional demand. But the market’s next chapter is being written by innovators like Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP), whose live whitelist marks the beginning of a privacy-first revolution in blockchain. In this cycle, smart investors are looking at both ends of the spectrum, the proven strength of Ethereum and the early-stage promise of ZKP. The combination could define not just the best crypto to buy in 2025, but the narrative that drives Web3’s next global expansion.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $94,970.95 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant downturn for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $95,000? The sudden Bitcoin price decline has left many investors wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that contributed to this downward movement. First, increased selling pressure from institutional investors created a cascade effect. Second, regulatory uncertainties in key markets added to the negative sentiment. Moreover, technical indicators showed weakening support levels that failed to hold. This Bitcoin price movement represents one of the most substantial single-day drops in recent months. The market reaction has been immediate and widespread, affecting not just Bitcoin but the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, experienced traders recognize that such corrections often present buying opportunities for long-term investors. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? The current Bitcoin price situation demands careful analysis rather than panic. Here are key considerations for investors: Market cycles are normal – Cryptocurrency markets historically experience volatility Support levels matter – Watch for how the Bitcoin price behaves around $94,000 Long-term perspective – Historical data shows recovery after major corrections Diversification strategy – Never put all your eggs in one basket While the current Bitcoin price may cause concern, it’s crucial to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. The fundamental technology behind Bitcoin remains strong, and adoption continues to grow globally. Therefore, this price movement might represent a temporary adjustment rather than a long-term trend reversal. How to Navigate the Current Bitcoin Price Environment Successful cryptocurrency investing requires strategy during both uptrends and downtrends. The current Bitcoin price situation offers valuable lessons for all market participants. First, establish clear risk management protocols. Second, maintain emotional discipline when making trading decisions. Furthermore, stay informed about market developments that could affect Bitcoin price movements. The Bitcoin price action below $95,000 serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investing carries inherent risks. However, it also presents potential opportunities for those who understand market dynamics. Many seasoned investors view such corrections as healthy market mechanisms that prevent unsustainable bubbles. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the Bitcoin price to drop below $95,000? The decline resulted from combined factors including institutional selling, regulatory concerns, and technical breakdown of key support levels. Should I buy Bitcoin at the current price? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consult with a financial advisor before making cryptocurrency investments. How low could the Bitcoin price go? While predictions vary, most analysts watch the $92,000-$93,000 range as the next major support level for Bitcoin price stability. Will Bitcoin recover from this price drop? Historical patterns suggest Bitcoin has recovered from similar corrections, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements typically influence the broader cryptocurrency market, with most altcoins following Bitcoin’s trend direction. What indicators should I watch for Bitcoin price recovery? Monitor trading volume, institutional inflows, and key resistance levels breaking upward for signs of sustainable Bitcoin price recovery. Found this analysis helpful?

As a close associate of former President Trump, Miran’s stance carries substantial weight in monetary policy discussions. Why This Interest Rate Cut Matters Now Governor Miran’s position comes at a critical juncture for the economy. He argues that current economic data clearly supports lowering rates. Moreover, his emphasis on dovish rather than hawkish policy suggests a fundamental shift in approach. This potential interest rate cut could affect everything from mortgage rates to cryptocurrency valuations. The Federal Reserve faces several key considerations: Inflation trends and economic growth indicators Employment data and consumer spending patterns Global economic conditions and trade dynamics Market stability and investor confidence measures What Does Dovish Policy Mean for Investors? When the Fed adopts a dovish stance, it typically means they prioritize economic growth over inflation concerns. This approach often leads to lower borrowing costs and increased liquidity in financial markets. For cryptocurrency investors, a potential interest rate cut could signal several important developments. Lower interest rates generally make riskier assets more attractive. Therefore, we might see increased capital flowing into cryptocurrencies as investors seek higher returns. This dynamic creates opportunities but also requires careful risk management. How Could This Impact Cryptocurrency Markets? The relationship between Federal Reserve policy and cryptocurrency markets has become increasingly important. A significant interest rate cut could trigger multiple effects across digital asset classes. Lower rates typically weaken the US dollar, which historically correlates with stronger cryptocurrency performance. Key potential impacts include: Increased institutional interest in crypto assets Potential for higher trading volumes and liquidity Changed risk appetite among traditional investors Altered regulatory focus and policy discussions What Challenges Does the Fed Face? Implementing an interest rate cut involves balancing multiple economic factors. The Federal Reserve must consider both domestic conditions and international implications. Governor Miran’s advocacy for lower rates comes amid ongoing debates about the appropriate timing and scale of monetary easing. Current challenges include managing inflation expectations while supporting economic growth. Additionally, the Fed must consider how their decisions affect global financial stability and emerging markets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given Governor Miran’s push for an interest rate cut , cryptocurrency investors should monitor several key indicators. Pay close attention to Federal Reserve meeting minutes and economic data releases. Furthermore, track dollar strength and traditional market reactions to Fed announcements. Consider these strategic approaches: Diversify across different cryptocurrency sectors Maintain appropriate risk management protocols Stay informed about macroeconomic developments Prepare for potential increased market volatility Conclusion: Navigating the Changing Monetary Landscape Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran’s renewed call for an interest rate cut represents a significant development in monetary policy discussions. His dovish stance could signal important changes ahead for both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. As investors, staying informed about these macroeconomic shifts becomes crucial for making sound investment decisions in an evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What is an interest rate cut? An interest rate cut occurs when the Federal Reserve lowers its target for the federal funds rate, making borrowing cheaper and potentially stimulating economic activity. How does an interest rate cut affect cryptocurrencies? Lower interest rates typically weaken the US dollar and make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive to investors seeking higher returns. Why is Governor Miran calling for rate cuts now? Governor Miran believes current economic data supports lower rates and that the Fed should prioritize economic growth through dovish monetary policy. What’s the difference between dovish and hawkish policy? Dovish policy focuses on stimulating economic growth, often through lower rates, while hawkish policy prioritizes controlling inflation, typically through higher rates. How quickly could an interest rate cut happen? The timing depends on economic data and Fed consensus, but could occur as soon as the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting if conditions warrant. Should cryptocurrency investors adjust their strategies? Investors should monitor Fed policy developments and consider how changing interest rates might affect market dynamics and risk appetite.

Exports from the EU to the rest of the world also went up 7.7% YoY to €256.6 billion in September, while imports surged 5.3% to reach €237.1 billion. Eurostat’s data published on November 14 showed that the eurozone’s September trade surplus had notably jumped by €17.5 billion from August’s €1.9 billion. The data also confirmed that the trade surplus surged 33.5% YoY from €12.9 billion in September 2024 to €19.4 billion in September 2025. Eurostat emphasized that the resulting surplus indicated the positive trade momentum with the United States. The resulting surplus emerged as the positive effects of the new U.S.-EU trade agreement began to materialize. EU’s U.S. exports jump to €53.1B in September Eurostat’s data revealed that EU exports to the U.S. surged 15.4% YoY to €53.1 billion in September. Imports from the U.S. also strengthened, climbing 12.5% YoY to €30.9 billion. The EU’s trade surplus with the U.S. improved to €22.2 billion, up from €18.5 billion in September 2024. However, the trade agreement signed by the EU and the U.S. in August may soon face its first major criticism. Ruben Segura-Cayuela, an economist at Bank of America, claimed that the deal was shaky from the start. He notes that unresolved issues and a lack of clarity around key commitments will hinder the deal. The BOA economist disclosed that there are key elements, such as the EU’s promised tariff cuts on industrial goods. He noted that they have yet to be finalized or approved. Ruben further noted that contradictions over the extent of regulatory alignment also persist, especially in sensitive sectors such as investment, defense, and energy. The Commission is expected to present a revised implementation plan to Washington aimed at resolving these commitments. EU-China trade weakens as chemicals drive EU’s global surplus Eurostat’s data confirmed that China’s trade with the EU has continued to decline amid the strong growth in U.S. exports. Exports to China plunged 2.5% YoY in September to €16.7 billion, indicating subdued Chinese demand. Exports to Turkiye also slipped 1.5%, while exports to Japan rose 3.5% and those to Mexico increased by 11.1%. Exports to South Korea also surged 6.6%, and to India by 7.7%. Meanwhile, chemical products drove the overall EU trade balance, which showed a significant improvement. Eurostat’s data revealed that the EU had a surplus of €16.3 billion in September, reversing a €4.5 billion deficit from the previous month. The shift was largely driven by the chemicals sector, whose surplus increased from €15.4 billion in August to €26.9 billion in September. However, the surplus for vehicles and machinery narrowed from €16.4 billion to €13.8 billion YoY. The EU’s overall trade balance improved by €6.8 billion YoY. From January to September 2025, the eurozone also recorded a surplus of €128.7 billion, a 4.17% decrease from €134.3 billion in the same period in 2024. Similarly, the EU’s surplus dropped 7.69% YTD to stand at €104.3 billion.

According to a popular Chinese BTC miner on X , the previous generation of Bitcoin mining machines, the S19 and M60 series, have reached shutdown price, and if those running them do not shut them down, the electricity bill next month will start losing money. Outdated miners are packing up The announcement comes as miners are ditching the older generation of Bitcoin mining equipment because of limiting factors like higher power draw and lower hash rates. Small and mid-sized miners that can’t boast scale like giants like Marathon Digital or Riot Platforms have been getting shut down the most, with the less efficient legacy equipment being idled first to preserve cash flow. This has reportedly contributed to a slight dip in global hashrate with operators prioritizing newer, energy-efficient rigs. About half of the network’s miners were already at or near “shutdown prices” as of earlier this year, but the current dip has been fanning the flames. How the mining industry is faring amid the current BTC dip The current dip makes it the third time Bitcoin has dipped beneath the $100,000 mark in November, and that has strengthened fearmongers who have been calling the top for weeks on end. The fall has also affected Bitcoin mining stock prices, which were swept up in a wider market sell-off on Friday that drained nearly $8 billion from the cohort’s collective market capitalization in one day. Miners Bitdeer Technologies Group and Bitfarms have reported dumps of 20% and 17%, respectively, in their share prices, while Cipher Mining’s fell 13%. Even Mara Holdings, which holds the most Bitcoin among miners, was down over 10%. According to BitcoinMiningStock.io, a platform that tracks metrics for 34 publicly traded Bitcoin mining stocks, the sector’s market cap dropped from $69.1 billion to $61.3 billion between November 12 and November 13. Week-over-week, the cohort’s total capitalization is down 22% from $78.7 billion, and they’re down an extra 35% from the all-time high capitalization of $94.2 billion they achieved on October 15. Bitcoin miners who had dipped into AI were affected more than most.

Despite the broader downtrend playing out over the past few weeks, the on-chain supply dynamic remains interesting. But technically, the buyers are losing ground fast as momentum shifts further in favor of the sellers. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH is holding just above a key support zone around $3,000. The price has dropped below the $3,800 level and the 100-day moving average, located around the $3,400 mark, flipping both levels into resistance. The 200-day MA is also gradually sloping down now, reflecting weakening medium-term trend strength. The RSI has also dropped to around 33, which shows bearish momentum but also brings ETH closer to oversold territory. If the asset fails to hold above $3,000, the next major support sits around the $2,500 zone, which also aligns with a previous demand area from early Q3. If buyers want to regain control, they need to reclaim $3,800 with strong volume and flip the 100-day and 200-day moving averages again. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, ETH broke the bearish flag to the downside and confirmed a continuation lower. After failing to reclaim the $3,600 resistance area, the price sold off hard and is now testing the demand zone at $3,000. The structure remains bearish with clear lower highs and lower lows forming since early October. Momentum also remains weak. The RSI is hovering around 33 on this timeframe too, showing potential for further downside. If the $3,000 support zone breaks, the $2,600 area becomes the next key level to watch. Short-term bounces toward $3,300 or even $3,400 may simply offer sell opportunities unless accompanied by a volume spike and a clean breakout above the $3,800 resistance zone. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve Exchange reserves for Ethereum continue to drop and are now at multi-year lows. With just over 15 million ETH sitting on centralized exchanges, this is a structurally bullish sign over the long run, which indicates a continued trend of accumulation and self-custody. However, despite this bullish supply trend, the recent price action shows that demand isn’t strong enough to absorb current spot selling. In other words, the supply is low, but buyers aren’t stepping in aggressively enough, which allows corrections like the one being witnessed now. Until demand picks up meaningfully, the price may stay under pressure even with positive on-chain flows.

Here Are the Opinions",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-spot-etf-approved-so-why-is-the-price-falling-here-are-the-opinions/,"This week was seen as a “big moment” for XRP, which is linked to Ripple. After years of filings, a dedicated spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) began trading in the U.S. for the first time on Thursday. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse celebrated the launch by saying, “It’s finally happening!” On paper, the new spot XRP ETF launched by Canary Capital is off to a strong start. It attracted nearly $250 million in investments on its first day, and analysts predicted the ETF could generate a trading frenzy reaching $5 billion in its first few months. This demand was expected to push the XRP price higher. However, contrary to expectations, the XRP price has fallen by nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. It is still trading 37% below its all-time high of $3.65, set in July. Analysts believe the root of the problem lies in a broader market turmoil. On October 7th, the cryptocurrency market peaked at $4.3 trillion. But a few days later, the situation reversed completely. Related News: RWA Altcoins Developers Have Been Focusing On Most Recently Have Been Revealed - Here's the List On October 10, $19 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in just one day. This decline led to the subsequent month of wiping out nearly $1 trillion in total market capitalization, or one-fifth of all crypto assets, according to CoinGecko data. While a brief recovery was seen at the beginning of the week following the end of the US government shutdown, the $870 million sell-off from Bitcoin ETFs on Thursday added to the pressure. The same day Bitcoin fell below $100,000 for the third time this month. Max Gokhman, vice president of Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions, told Bloomberg: The current sell-off is fully correlated with riskier assets. However, the magnitude of the move is sharper because volatility is higher in the crypto market. Until there is broader institutional participation beyond Bitcoin and ETH, crypto's sensitivity to macro risks will remain high. Some market experts are warning that the crypto market could see a resurgence, barring any new negative developments. However, the XRP ETF's first week has shown how quickly launch expectations can be eclipsed by market realities. *This is not investment advice.

The drawdown followed a week of weaker closes after early-November levels near $110,000, reinforcing a shift from momentum to repair. The sentiment gauge sits in fear territory, with readings around the low 20s this week, which aligns with heavier risk reduction rather than a discrete headline shock. That tone meets a well-timed update from 10x Research , whose October 22 “Bear Market Watch” called for a first leg toward $100,000 while flagging fading on-chain and derivatives support, a stance consistent with how this pullback has traded so far. What Drove The Latest Breaks Macro cues have leaned hawkish, and fund data show stress concentrated in Bitcoin vehicles. Nearly $1.0 billion of net outflows were seen from Bitcoin-focused products in the week through November 3, even as other coins saw offsetting interest, which helps explain why the heaviest pressure sat on BTC spot pairs. Pricing across majors reflected that tilt, with Bitcoin leading declines and Ethereum lagging shortly after. Community chatter tracks that split: trading forums and research feeds focused on the mix of ETF redemptions, tighter basis, and thinner order books during U.S. hours, while the fear index slide echoed a rotation from dip-buying to protection. That mosaic fits a reset rather than a single catalyst and leaves the next phase tied to whether flows stabilize into the weekend. 10x Derivatives Edge: BTC & ETH Volatility/Options Analysis https://t.co/OuoVxuEHWj The volatility setup in BTC and ETH is unusually clean, with 1-month implied volatility sitting almost exactly at realized levels, meaning traders can own gamma with no carry penalty and express… — 10x Research (@10x_Research) November 14, 2025 Liquidity, Basis, And Spot Depth To Watch Repair phases tend to start with better depth on BTC and ETH pairs , since tighter spreads and thicker ladders indicate that market makers are willing to warehouse inventory through the overnight cycles. When that rebuild appears together with calmer funding and a basis that drifts toward neutral, rallies last longer because cash demand replaces squeezes that fade at the close. Kaiko and exchange dashboards help confirm these mechanics during busy windows, and they pair well with simple checks on intraday spread behavior around U.S. data drops. Stablecoin supply trends add a second filter. Net issuance that turns higher for more than a few sessions often coincides with firmer spot settlement, while flat or negative supply leans against durable recoveries even when prices bounce intraday. Tracking issuance alongside exchange balances helps separate real demand from transient covering, especially when ETF flows pull in the other direction. Bitcoin Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) 10x Research’s Track Record And Current Read 10x Research stresses a process that blends on-chain flows, derivatives positioning, and macro context. The team has a documented record of calling year-end direction in 2022, 2023, and 2024, while warning that the usual fourth-quarter fuel was missing. Their update keeps attention on whether funding cools, depth rebuilds, and realized loss pressure eases on-chain, since those shifts often precede better closes rather than just better opens. Ethereum needs a steadier close to pull basis back toward neutral, and large-cap tokens such as Solana and XRP typically firm after BTC depth improves rather than before it, which is why the first checks sit with Bitcoin order books, ETF flow direction, and the fear gauge drift over consecutive sessions. If those series stabilize together, the reset turns constructive; if they split, volatility lingers.

Her recent comments about the December rate cut suggest a more cautious approach than many market participants expected. Why is the December Rate Cut Facing Resistance? Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan stated clearly that supporting another December rate cut would be “difficult” given current economic conditions. This position matters because: She serves as a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee Her views reflect growing caution within the Fed Markets had priced in more aggressive rate cuts Logan emphasized she will closely monitor incoming data and financial conditions before making any decisions. This data-dependent approach means every economic report between now and December carries significant weight. What Data Will Influence the Final Decision? The Fed’s hesitation about a December rate cut stems from several key factors that require careful monitoring. Logan specifically mentioned watching: Inflation trends and price stability metrics Labor market conditions and employment data Financial market stability and credit conditions Global economic developments and risks Each of these data points will play a crucial role in determining whether a December rate cut becomes reality or remains on hold. The Fed wants clear evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward their 2% target. How Should Investors Prepare for This Uncertainty? With the potential December rate cut now in question, investors need to adjust their strategies accordingly. Here are actionable steps to consider: Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes Monitor economic calendars for key data releases Stay informed about Fed communications and speeches Maintain flexibility to adjust positions as new information emerges Remember that Fed policy decisions create ripple effects across all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies and traditional investments. The Bottom Line: Patience Over Predictions Logan’s comments serve as a crucial reminder that the Fed remains committed to its data-dependent framework. The potential December rate cut isn’t off the table, but it’s far from guaranteed. Investors should focus on the economic fundamentals rather than trying to predict exact timing. The coming months will provide critical information that will shape the Fed’s final decision. Until then, maintaining a balanced approach and staying informed represents the wisest course of action. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Lorie Logan hesitant about a December rate cut? Logan wants to see more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward the Fed’s 2% target and needs to assess how financial conditions evolve in coming months. What would change her mind about supporting a rate cut? Clear signs of cooling inflation, weakening labor market conditions, or deteriorating financial stability could make her more open to supporting rate cuts. How do Fed rate decisions affect cryptocurrency markets? Lower interest rates typically support risk assets like cryptocurrencies by making borrowing cheaper and reducing competition from yield-bearing traditional investments. When will we know for certain about the December decision? The final decision will be announced after the December 17-18 FOMC meeting, but clues will emerge through economic data and Fed communications in the interim. What economic reports matter most between now and December? Key reports include CPI inflation data, employment reports, retail sales figures, and GDP growth estimates. How can retail investors stay updated on Fed policy changes? Follow official Fed communications, monitor financial news outlets, and watch for speeches by Fed officials like Logan.

In a chart posted on X on November 13, he highlighted a potential “range retake” that could set up a move toward the previous range high at roughly $0.218—if DOGE can break and hold above $0.18. Dogecoin Bulls Have A Target “DOGE has been relatively strong the past few days. Overall market is obviously weak and choppy,” he wrote. At the time of his chart, Dogecoin traded around $0.172 on Binance, sitting just below a key green support band marking the range low between $0.17 and $0.18 . The range high—drawn at $0.21817 —remains the upside target if price can reclaim the lower boundary. The distance between the band and the top of the range is 23.1%, a move Daan considers technically clean if momentum aligns. The trader also pointed to a narrative circulating in US markets: proposed 2,000-dollar stimulus or dividend checks by the Trump administration. He noted the psychological connection many retail traders still have to the “stimmy check” era of 2020–2021, when Dogecoin was one of the cycle’s strongest performers. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Load Up: 4.72 Billion DOGE Vanish Into Mega Wallets “I think the 2,000 dollar stimulus/dividend checks to US workers might have re-ignited some muscle memory,” he said, adding that younger traders often look for speculative assets rather than Bitcoin or Ethereum when deploying unexpected cash. Technically, the setup he is monitoring is straightforward: DOGE previously broke below its established range, flushed to lower lows, and is now attempting to push back into the band. His chart shows two rounded swing lows, suggesting a potential base forming. A reclaim of the green zone—validated by closing strength above $0.18 —would signal that sellers have lost control and that the upper boundary at $0.218 could come back into focus. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Load Up: 4.72 Billion DOGE Vanish Into Mega Wallets “Regardless of all that, I am watching closely here for this range retake,” he wrote. “I think it could make for a clean setup for a move back to the range highs. Need BTC & ETH to hold the floor for that to play out obviously.” That final clause underscores the conditional nature of his view. Dogecoin often behaves as a high-beta expression of market risk, and Daan is explicit that a broader market breakdown would invalidate the scenario, even if DOGE briefly trades above $0.18. Questions about his seemingly long-oriented emphasis prompted clarification. One user asked why he focuses mainly on upside setups, prompting Daan to respond: “I do both sides personally for short term scalps. But the moment you post short setups people get quite angry.” He added that long setups tend to offer better risk-to-reward for most traders and that shorting after recent “big liquidation flushes” like the October 10 event is generally less appealing. His posted chart reflects that preference: a potential bullish reclaim rather than an attempt to fade resistance. For now, the key remains unchanged—confirmation only comes with a sustained break above $0.18. Without that level, Dogecoin stays inside its lower consolidation, with Bitcoin and Ethereum setting the broader context for whether the memecoin can extend its relative strength. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.15943.

Keep Hustling",https://timestabloid.com/vaneck-exec-dear-xrp-maxis-i-will-pretend-your-blockchain-does-something-keep-hustling/,"The crypto industry thrives on sharp commentary, intense tribal debates, and moments that instantly ignite conversation. This week delivered another flashpoint when a senior executive from one of the largest asset managers stirred the XRP community with a pointed remark. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, shared the statement that triggered the uproar. His position adds weight to every remark he makes, and this one was no exception. His post spread quickly across X and drew comments from analysts, traders, and dedicated XRP supporters. Many saw it as playful criticism, while others viewed it as disrespectful toward a long-standing project. Why Sigel’s Comment Hit a Nerve Sigel’s words landed at a sensitive moment for XRP. The asset has seen renewed momentum from institutional flows, ETF activity, and broader market speculation. XRP supporters often feel misunderstood by analysts who question the project’s utility. Dear XRP maxis, I may never understand what your “blockchain” actually does, but I’ll always respect the passion required to pretend it does something. So keep hustling! — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 14, 2025 That tension made the community more reactive to Sigel’s tone. His remark, though humorous, was seen by many as a dismissal of years of development and adoption. The Broader Debate Over Utility and Perception XRP has often faced debates about its real-world utility . Critics argue that the blockchain has not delivered enough visible breakthroughs. Supporters counter with examples of payment corridors, liquidity solutions, and enterprise integrations. This clash reflects a deeper divide between community conviction and institutional skepticism. Sigel’s post revived that discussion by poking at the project’s perceived shortcomings. Institutional Influence and Market Sensitivity Comments from top asset managers can shape sentiment. VanEck is a major player in digital asset products. When a researcher from such a firm shares a sarcastic remark, traders take note. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Markets often react not because the comment changes fundamentals but because it reveals institutional attitudes. Some analysts argued that his tone suggests lingering hesitation among traditional firms toward XRP’s long-term use cases. XRP Community Pushback and Defense The XRP community responded with its usual intensity. Supporters defended the project’s track record and future potential. Many argued that institutional skepticism has existed for years, yet has never slowed the project’s technical evolution. Others suggested that such comments highlight a lack of deeper research into the protocol’s capabilities. The reaction demonstrated how strongly the community protects its narrative. A Measured View of the Situation Sigel’s remark may be humorous, but it exposes a recurring theme. Crypto communities often take critiques personally, while analysts sometimes underestimate the cultural power of those communities. The truth usually lies between those extremes. Investors must separate emotional reactions from objective analysis. They should examine adoption metrics, technological progress, and regulatory developments. The episode reveals more about crypto culture than about XRP’s fundamentals. Communities remain passionate and sensitive. Analysts remain blunt and often provocative. The debate will continue, as always. What matters most is clear, verifiable progress, not the tone of a single post.

Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse, who said last year that banks pushed his industry out, is now asking the administration for approval to form a bank as part of a wider scramble by crypto firms and retailers to get the legal status they need to run full-service financial operations. Coinbase and Wise are making the same move, and Amazon and Walmart are exploring a broader push into services that look and feel like offerings from a traditional bank. Trump-appointed regulators are signaling openness, and that shift has become a major point of tension between established banks and the rising group of crypto-aligned applicants trying to enter a field that has shut them out for years. The Comptroller of the Currency, Jonathan Gould, said at a Treasury-related conference last month that he wants crypto activity “done within the banking system,” as long as the law allows and regulators can keep conditions safe. Jonathan’s office oversees nationally chartered banks and sits at the center of this wave of applications that firms are filing to move into the bank world. Companies file trust charter applications to enter the banking system The filings landing on regulators’ desks are mostly national trust charter applications, which are different from a full bank charter. Trust companies cannot take deposits or issue loans. They hold assets and charge fees to safeguard them, and because they don’t accept deposits, they do not get federal insurance. The Wall Street Journal reported that twelve trust charter applications have been filed this year, the highest level in at least eight years. Ripple, Coinbase, and Wise are included in that group, and they were joined by Sony Bank, which is tied to the larger Sony corporation. The rapid pace set off alarm bells among large lobbying groups for the financial sector. They argue that allowing these companies to open any kind of bank structure without meeting the same heavy oversight will create uneven competition and potential financial risk. These groups say regulators have limited who can start a bank since the 2008-09 crisis, and they believe those limits were necessary to prevent dangerous behavior. The Bank Policy Institute recently sent letters to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency asking the agency to reject the applications from Ripple, Wise and Sony Bank. The Independent Community Bankers of America also wrote in opposition. The BPI warned that approving Coinbase’s application “could significantly increase risks to the U.S. financial system.” Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad pushed back and said the group was only trying to guard the interests of traditional banks. Stablecoins bring new pressure on banks and drive regulatory fights Recent friction between applicants and banks has grown more obvious. Some crypto firms say they were victims of “debanking,” which includes being removed from accounts due to political pressure. Those claims helped prompt an executive order from President Trump aimed at stopping politically motivated account closures. The companies applying for charters say they want to offer fiduciary services and issue stablecoins, which are designed to keep a fixed value, so they can serve customers who need a regulated partner for crypto activity. The scramble for stablecoins is connected to deeper concern among banks that retailers might set up their own payment systems if stablecoins gain wide use. Amazon and Walmart were among the companies The Wall Street Journal said had been studying whether they should release a stablecoin. Their involvement would give them tools that look like services usually offered by a bank, which could cut out banks and credit-card companies altogether. Trump later signed the GENIUS Act , which gives the OCC the job of approving and monitoring stablecoin issuers. The act does not require a bank charter to issue stablecoins, but most issuers must be considered financial firms. That may push companies to partner with others instead of releasing their own coins. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also said it would revisit industrial loan charters this year, a type of charter that has helped companies like Toyota finance customer purchases. The review is expected to look at whether these charters should be easier to obtain. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The analyst stated that Bitcoin reacted accurately from the lower band of the long-followed giant megaphone formation and argued that maintaining this level is of critical importance. According to Colin, Bitcoin has fit this formation perfectly so far, and a break below the lower band could turn the current weak outlook into a much more negative picture. The analyst also highlighted the “death cross,” which he said is just one day away for Bitcoin. In this formation, the 50-day moving average falling below the 200-day moving average is generally seen as a timing signal indicating a market bottom. Colin noted that in past cycles, bottoms have followed death crosses, and stated that a strong bounce is likely following this cross. However, he noted that it's not yet clear whether this move will mark a new uptrend or simply a relief rally. Another indicator showing weakness for Bitcoin is the 50-week moving average. Colin stated that if weekly closes continue below this level, the possibility of a bear market will increase. He stated that short-term spikes are normal, but a two-week or longer close would create a negative outlook. He also noted that the correlation between global M2 money supply and Bitcoin has been deteriorating for months, a typical divergence seen in previous cycle peaks. Therefore, he found some analysts' comments that “Bitcoin will catch up with M2 again” inaccurate, stating that this ignores cycle peak behavior. Related News: Donald Trump's Son Eric Trump Commented on the Decline in Bitcoin and Altcoins The analyst noted that the gold chart also provides a significant leading signal for Bitcoin, adding that gold's recent strong rally could have a delayed impact on Bitcoin. He explained that with the gold price movement being pulled forward by approximately 80 days, Bitcoin has reached the same level as gold's upward trend, and that this, combined with the megaphone formation and the looming death cross, increases the likelihood of a short-term bounce. In his overall assessment, Colin Talks Crypto noted that technical indicators point to a strong uptrend in the short term, but it is too early to tell whether this is a path to a new all-time high. He stated that he holds 96% of his portfolio in Bitcoin, a protective approach during periods of uncertainty. He added that altcoins lose much more value in a true bear market, making him cautious. Still, he said a new peak by the end of the year or in January is the primary scenario, with the second possibility of a shallower decline followed by a short-lived mini-bear market, allowing for a new rally in 2026, albeit a small one. Finally, the analyst noted that he has not yet seen any signs of “excessive enthusiasm” or “inflation” in the current cycle, with Bitcoin going through this cycle with a more cascading and slow-moving structure. *This is not investment advice.

Official numbers released on Friday showed that investment in China dropped more than 11% in October from a year earlier, the worst single‑month fall since the early Covid shutdowns in 2020. Economists said the hit was alarming because investment makes up almost half of China’s GDP , and this slump landed while the country was already dealing with weak exports. The scale of the setback stunned analysts because the dive in fixed‑asset investment began in July, but it still did not show the kind of damage one would expect in broader growth data. Gross capital formation, a different investment measure, actually added almost a fifth of the third‑quarter GDP growth. That mismatch pushed economists into a scramble to understand why one part of China’s investment machine was falling apart while another part was still adding power. Analysts question the data as the slump deepens Ding Shuang at Standard Chartered said the drop in investment was hard to explain because the scale of the fall did not line up with other indicators. He said the drag from investment would be even heavier in the fourth quarter and would likely become the main reason GDP growth slows. The timing raised eyebrows because the downturn started around the launch of the government’s “anti‑involution” campaign, which was aimed at reducing excess output in several industries. Officials never gave targets for cutting investment or capacity, making it impossible to know how much of the slump came from the policy itself. Economists warned that reducing industrial investment without offering stimulus could weigh on jobs and income. They said weak domestic demand remained a problem because the country has struggled to shift from investment‑driven growth to consumption‑driven growth, especially while the property market stayed in crisis. Calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics data showed fixed‑asset investment falling 6% to 7% across the third quarter, but the NBS only releases year‑to‑date totals. The bureau said falling prices dragged down the FAI numbers while gross capital formation reflected adjusted real growth. It also said the two measures count different things, including land fees and used equipment inside FAI. Adam Wolfe at Absolute Strategy Research said the fall in FAI was too sharp and too broad to blame on those differences alone. He pointed out that other parts of China’s economy did not show the same kind of distress. Industrial output grew 6.1% in the year to date, and retail sales climbed around 4%. Economists also said it had become harder to judge the real condition of the economy because several official and private data series were halted in recent years. Some analysts said FAI was an old Soviet‑style measure that had long faced problems like double‑counting, though reports from the Peterson Institute said recent reforms had narrowed the gap between the two investment measures. Industry breakdown exposes sharper weakness Analysts at Gavekal Dragonomics said corporate investment likely slowed for a long time, and the recent drop in FAI might be more about changes in reporting than an actual collapse in activity. They said officials across China might under‑report investment to look loyal to the “anti‑involution” push. Other factors were also hurting investment, including worsening conditions in property, falling real estate spending, and slowing infrastructure spending as local governments focused on hidden debt and unpaid bills. Manufacturing investment took a harder hit, slowing to 2.7% growth in the first 10 months after sitting near 9% in May. Industry‑level data showed big declines in sectors targeted by the campaign, such as electric equipment and machinery, which includes batteries and solar panels. Investment in that category fell more than 9% this year, with the slide starting in August 2024. But other targeted sectors did not slow. Auto investment jumped almost 18%. Goldman Sachs economists looked at cement demand implied by FAI and compared it with actual cement output. They said the gap narrowed recently, which could mean the NBS adjusted data to prevent over‑reporting.

On a recent podcast, Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, and former prosecutor Erin West, founder of Operation Shamrock, detailed how pig-butchering has evolved into a transnational crime model that blends human trafficking, money laundering, and crypto-driven fraud. Both experts warned that the scale of these schemes and the criminal networks behind them has expanded far beyond traditional scam activity. Source: Chainalysis Why Are Pig-Butchering Rings Exploding Despite Billions in Seizures? West said the threat now touches every corner of the financial system. “If anybody is touching money in any way, you’re part of this,” she said, stressing that the issue requires deeper awareness from banks, exchanges, and regulators. Pig-butchering scams rely on long-term social engineering. Criminals build trust with victims, often through dating apps, social media, or unsolicited messages, before steering them toward fake cryptocurrency investment platforms. The goal is to “fatten” victims with false profits before draining their accounts entirely. Fierman and West described how criminal groups across Southeast Asia run dormitory-style compounds where trafficked workers are forced to operate these schemes. Victims abroad lose life savings, while victims inside the compounds are held against their will and coerced into participating. Chainalysis data shows that pig-butchering activity surged by nearly 40% in 2024, contributing to more than $9.9 billion in overall crypto scam revenue that year. Source: Chainalysis The U.S. Department of Justice seized about $225 million linked to these scams in 2023 , one of several early indicators of how large the ecosystem has become. The experts also pointed out a secondary layer of exploitation that often goes unreported. After victims are defrauded, they are frequently contacted again by fake recovery firms posing as law enforcement or private investigators. “Once this happens to you, you will be put on a list,” West said. “You are even more likely to get hit up again.” Pig-Butchering Scams Spur Coordinated Global Enforcement as Losses Reach Record Levels The surge in pig-butchering scams is unfolding alongside a series of major international enforcement actions. In October, U.S. authorities announced the largest crypto seizure ever tied to global online fraud , targeting Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group and its chairman, Chen Zhi. @USTreasury has moved to make its largest-ever cryptocurrency seizure, targeting $12B in #Bitcoin from a global ""pig butchering"" scam. #US #PigButchering https://t.co/6JpciJNrod — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 At the same time, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned 146 people and entities connected to the group , describing it as a transnational criminal enterprise engaged in fraud, extortion, and forced labor. Private-sector involvement has expanded alongside these government efforts. In August, Tether froze nearly $50 million in USDT linked to a Southeast Asia-based pig-butchering ring after investigators traced the funds across 19 addresses. That same month, Binance joined the T3+ intelligence initiative , led by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs, helping freeze nearly $6 million tied to another scam case. @Binance has joined the new T3+ crime-fighting alliance — and in its first case, helped freeze $6M from a pig butchering scam. #CryptoCrime #Binance https://t.co/Twontg49DA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 The exchange said its internal systems prevented 7.5 million users from losing almost $10 billion to fraud between December 2022 and May 2025. Coinbase has participated in similar efforts. In June, the exchange assisted the U.S. Secret Service in recovering $225 million in USDT , one of the agency’s largest crypto seizures. Investigators traced the funds to 140 OKX accounts, many registered under trafficking victims coerced into running scam operations. @coinbase helps US Secret Service seize record $225 million in USDT from pig butchering scams in landmark operation targeting international criminal networks. #Coinbase #CryptoScam https://t.co/ksWEAw0vCD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The scale of losses continues to escalate.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $98,838, it will fuel a bullish rally to $107,090. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $94,780, beginning a bearish trend to $92,750. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , miners sent a total of 210K BTC to exchanges in October, while the past week saw 122,000 coins flow into Binance. Bitcoin price prediction November 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $103K due to the market crash in October. However, it is now facing heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around November 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction November 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 21:00:00

Instead of offering predictions or excitement, he framed the moment as a straightforward test for the asset, noting that if XRP cannot climb into double-digit territory once this many ETFs are live, the market may end up treating it as a joke. The comment brings into question what price level actually represents meaningful progress once institutional money enters the picture for XRP. Why The Comment Landed Strongly Ledferd reacted to a screenshot listing nearly every major issuer preparing an XRP product, including firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck, Invesco, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, Hashdex, and ARK Invest. The number of issuers alone means that XRP is entering a phase where institutional exposure will no longer be theoretical. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP “Supply Crisis” To Trigger The Next Parabolic Rally The general consensus is that when these ETFs hit the market, XRP will receive massive institutional inflows comparable to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which, in turn, would be reflected in its price action. With this in mind, the pundit noted that XRP will be the “joke of the year” if these ETFs do not bring the cryptocurrency’s price to at least double digits.” Where XRP Needs To Trade For ETFs To Matter The numerical reality behind this expectation is straightforward. XRP is currently trading well below the $3 price level. Particularly, XRP is trading at $2.3, which means even a return to its $3.65 all-time high would require a price increase of about 40% from present levels. To reach actual double digits above $10, it means the price of XRP would need to rise more than 320% from its current price. Before XRP can target double digits, however, it must convincingly break and close above the region between $3 and $3.65. This region is a structural pivot because it is where previous rallies have lost momentum If ETF demand is genuine, the first sign of it will be whether XRP can push above the $3 line and hold it as support. Such a move would confirm that new inflows are not being neutralized by selling pressure and that the buying pressure is absorbing tokens at a faster rate than they are being distributed. Related Reading: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP XRP currently has a total circulating supply of 60 billion tokens. Therefore, a move to $4 implies a market cap of $240 billion. On the other hand, a move to $10 implies a valuation above $600 billion. A $600-billion valuation would place XRP behind only Bitcoin in terms of market cap rankings. These numbers matter because ETF impact is not measured by price alone but by how much capital is required to move an asset of this size. If Spot XRP ETFs begin attracting even a small fraction of the inflows seen in early Bitcoin ETF trading, the push to $4 becomes more realistic. At the time of writing, the first US Spot XRP-backed ETF has officially been launched by Canary Capital with ticker XRPC and began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on November 13, 2025.

54405167,627832,1763154036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54405167.jpeg,A Bearish Administration: Here’s How The Bitcoin Price Has Fared Since Donald Trump Became President,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-donald-trump-2/,"Bitcoin holders have been watching the market closely since Donald Trump returned to the White House, and initial bullishness surrounding Trump’s election has been quickly eroded by his policies. Over the first 300 days of Trump’s presidency, the market has been in a bearish environment, and the Bitcoin price has struggled to rise, as Trump moves back and forth with tariffs, especially with China. Bitcoin Price Struggles Early In Trump’s Term: Weak Momentum And Deep Dips According to the chart, Bitcoin lost its footing almost immediately after Trump took office. Within the first 40 days, the price fell below the 0% mark and continued sliding toward –10% and then –20%. This decline was triggered by the tariff announcements that came at the start of Trump’s administration, signalling the start of what has been a bearish administration so far despite Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Instead of stabilizing quickly, Bitcoin remained stuck in this lower range for weeks. From approximately Day 40 to Day 90, the price traded mainly between –10% and –20%, indicating a market lacking confidence and little upward momentum. There were small upward pushes, but none created a breakout or a lasting trend. By the time Bitcoin reached Day 100, the market still looked undecided. Small recoveries kept bringing the price close to the neutral line, only for it to fall back again. The repeated swings around 0% suggest the market was not ready to commit to a strong rally. Some Recovery, But No Real Strength Through The Mid-Term The Bitcoin price saw a recovery through, as the trade wars began to ease off, eventually hitting a new all-time high above $126,000. However, this uptrend did not last long, with the US government shutdown bringing the market down once again. Now, even with the shutdown ending and the US government expected to resume, as well as Donald Trump announcing a $2,000 rebate check for Americans, the Bitcoin price is still struggling, and has now fallen below the $100,000 psychological level for the second time this month, crashing sentiment with it . So far, the data suggests that Bitcoin has been moving in a weak, cautious market environment since Trump became president. Instead of strong rallies or sustained growth, the chart reveals extended periods of negative performance, brief and small recoveries, declining momentum after each attempt to rise, and no clear upward trend over 300 days. The price performance reflects a market dominated by uncertainty and caution. Traders may be hesitant to take significant risks, and the Bitcoin price , currently trading 20% below its all-time high, has not displayed the strong, rapid growth many anticipated. Without a major market catalyst, this slow and unstable trend is likely to persist.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 21:00:36

The company is still trying to rebuild its standing after years of delays, but the momentum isn’t going its way. Its latest earnings beat showed some strength in data center products, yet the company is still struggling to steady itself, according to Yahoo Finance. While it tries to fix its long-running problems, AMD is taking slices of the same markets Intel used to dominate without competition. The pressure is coming from every direction. In both the PC and data center sectors, AMD is not waiting for Intel to recover, as the numbers coming out of New York this week made that painfully clear for Intel bulls. AMD sets aggressive revenue goals At AMD’s Financial Analyst Day in New York on Tuesday, Lisa Su told investors she expects the company to take 50% of server CPU revenue in the next three to five years through its Epyc chips. For context, AMD currently holds about 40%, and it wants to close the gap entirely. Su also said the company is looking for 10% revenue growth across its client division, which handles gaming and PC chips. That would push AMD above 40% client revenue share, up from today’s 28%. Those targets point to a huge drag on Intel, which Mercury Research says could see its client market share fall from 72% to about 60%. And because Intel and AMD are the only companies building x86 chips, the impact hits the core of Intel’s identity. These chips power the bulk of today’s PCs and servers, making this fight central to the future of both companies. Not everyone thinks these numbers are guaranteed. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, called AMD’s goals “somewhat aggressive/aspirational, but also not necessarily outside the realm of possibility if one wants to dream.” It was a polite way of saying the ambition is large, and the market will decide how much AMD gets. But the threat to Intel is not theoretical. It is happening now. Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, said AMD has performed “incredibly well” in the data center CPU business. Daniel said the company is winning sales from hyperscalers and expanding inside the enterprise sector at a steady pace. He added that AMD’s run has been helped by Intel’s own problems, which have dragged on for several years and created openings for AMD to move in. Intel tries to recover while fighting on multiple fronts Intel is not just standing still. The company has started rolling out its long-delayed 18A chip technology, used inside the Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs for PCs and the Xeon 6+ chips for servers. These products are meant to show progress after years of setbacks that frustrated investors and customers. The reality, though, is that both Intel and AMD are also chasing Nvidia. Nvidia holds between 80% and 90% of the AI GPU market, putting everyone else in a distant position. But AMD is already ahead of Intel in this space. Su told attendees she expects AMD’s AI GPU revenue to jump 60% in the next three to five years, climbing from the $16 billion the company projects for 2025. Intel revealed its own next-generation AI data center chip in October. Called Crescent Island, the chip uses the company’s Xe3P microarchitecture and will include up to 160GB of memory. It is part of Intel’s plan to regain relevance in AI after falling far behind. Daniel summed up the situation like this:- “Intel is healing right now. It is finding focus and improved economics. But AMD is executing and has momentum. The chance of Intel losing its No. 1 position in CPU and DC CPU is real. It has the chance to rectify, but the risk is there.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|Intel,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 21:05:22

But make no mistake, the stock is still down around 9% since Elon Musk locked in that $1 trillion compensation package, which passed earlier this month. The bounce today doesn’t undo the pain from the rest of the week. As it stands, Tesla is sitting 7% lower since Monday, and it just broke through the $400 level, a price many on Wall Street considered a floor. Yesterday, the stock dropped to levels we haven’t seen since September. But it’s not just a Tesla thing, there’s just so much pressure on tech names. One big trigger: the odds of a December interest rate cut are falling fast, and that’s killing momentum for risky stocks. With the Fed unlikely to lower rates soon, money is flowing out of Big Tech, and Tesla is right in the blast zone. AI worries push investors out of Tesla On top of rate fears, there’s something else chewing at Tesla’s stock: concerns that the AI hype cycle might be cooling off. When capital starts shifting out of high-valuation names into safer territory, companies like Tesla, which trade heavily on future innovation, get dumped. That shift is fueling the exodus. Still, not everyone’s running for the hills. Analysts like Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley are zooming out to the long-term view. In his list of “way too early” robot predictions for 2026, Jonas said Tesla will likely remove the safety driver from its Robotaxi trials in Texas and at least one other U.S. state. He wrote , “2026 is the year when robotaxis cross over from science fiction to reality with consumers, investors.” Jonas is betting on Tesla pushing ahead in autonomous driving and robotics. He thinks Musk’s other project, xAI, will become more important to Tesla’s future. He predicts xAI will help the company scale its humanoid Optimus robot program. “A Tesla robot plant is the ‘mother’ of the next generation of robots,” Jonas wrote. He sees the connection between Tesla and xAI as a big deal going forward, especially as xAI ramps up its computing power and “truth-seeking” tools. At Tesla’s recent shareholder meeting, Musk confirmed that Austin’s Robotaxi safety drivers would be removed by year-end. He also listed Miami, Dallas, Phoenix, and Las Vegas as cities where Robotaxi testing will expand soon. As for the robots? Tesla said it will build a 1-million-unit Optimus production line at its Fremont, California factory. That’s just the start—Musk wants to scale to 10 million units at Giga Texas. Right now, Optimus is still in pilot production at Fremont. Jonas has an Overweight rating on the stock, with a $410 near-term target and a wild “bull case” of $800. Not to be outdone, Dan Ives of Wedbush also chimed in from the Yahoo Finance Invest event in New York. “In my opinion, it’s going to be the most important chapter ever in Tesla’s story,” he said, talking about the company’s AI plans. Ives views the recent approval of Musk’s pay package as a “bright green light” for Tesla to go full steam ahead with autonomous driving and robotics. He slapped an Outperform rating on the stock, along with a Street-high $600 price target.

This massive USDT whale transfer, valued at approximately $244 million, represents one of the most significant cryptocurrency movements recently reported by Whale Alert. But what does this enormous transaction really mean for the crypto ecosystem? Why This USDT Whale Transfer Matters When we see a USDT whale transfer of this magnitude, it typically signals major market activity ahead.

Therefore, market analysts closely monitor these transactions for clues about future price direction. What Makes This USDT Whale Transfer Different? Several factors make this USDT whale transfer particularly noteworthy. The sheer size – nearly a quarter billion dollars – commands attention. Moreover, the unknown origin wallet adds an element of mystery. Is this a institutional player, a crypto fund, or an individual whale? The anonymity keeps market watchers guessing about the sender’s intentions. Practical Insights for Crypto Investors For everyday cryptocurrency investors, monitoring USDT whale transfers provides valuable market intelligence.

Frequently Asked Questions What is a USDT whale transfer? A USDT whale transfer refers to large-scale movements of Tether stablecoin, typically involving millions of dollars, usually by major investors or institutions.

How can I track whale transfers like this? You can monitor whale transfers using blockchain explorers and services like Whale Alert that track large cryptocurrency transactions across major blockchains. Should I worry about large USDT transfers? While large transfers can indicate market movements, they’re just one data point among many.

BlackRock’s fund holds $2.5 billion and carries the full name BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, and Binance is making it one of only three tokenized assets allowed for collateral use. The update also came with another change. A press release on Friday said BUIDL will launch a new share class on BNB Chain, the network created by Binance and used widely across its products. The announcement ties BlackRock even tighter to the exchange as both sides continue to build out their crypto presence. Binance expands collateral options with BUIDL For years, traders used Tether or USDC for collateral because there were no real alternatives that worked at scale. Those tokens kept the system moving even though they didn’t offer any yield. But now tokenized money‑market funds like BUIDL give traders access to real‑world returns while still staying inside the crypto markets. That is the main reason platforms have been looking at them. It changes how risk and liquidity move, and big firms are trying to get ahead of that shift. BUIDL was first issued last year as BlackRock’s first tokenized fund built for qualified investors on a public chain. The tokenization was handled by Securitize, and the fund is the biggest of its type based on data from RWA.xyz. With Binance now accepting it, traditional financial products are moving closer to replacing stablecoins in some parts of trading. Robbie Mitchnick, who leads digital assets at BlackRock, said in the release, “This milestone highlights our continued focus on transforming tokenization from concept to practical market utility. We’re helping bring foundational elements of traditional finance into the onchain finance arena.” Talks about making BUIDL eligible as collateral started last year between BlackRock, Securitize, and the biggest exchanges, including Binance. Data from JPMorgan and RWA.xyz shows the tokenized market is still small at about $36 billion, and most of the activity comes from crypto‑native firms instead of Wall Street giants. But demand has been rising as more traders look for alternatives to stablecoins. This latest development also lands during a messy period for Binance. Changpeng Zhao, the co‑founder of the exchange, recently received a pardon from Donald Trump after the company pleaded guilty to US anti‑money‑laundering and sanctions violations. The settlement cost $4.3 billion, and the exchange is still trying to rebuild stability while expanding its products.

The platform, which serves 57 million monthly users, plans to enable fast movement of digital dollars across multiple networks. However, it intends to start with Solana, a decision that signals rising confidence in high-speed, low-cost settlement rails. The move comes at a time when demand for cross-border efficiency continues to grow. Besides, stablecoins remain central to real-time settlement strategies across consumer apps. The integration appears positioned to accelerate user adoption once the feature goes live next year. Solana Powers the First Phase of the Rollout Solana confirmed its involvement after sharing a demonstration by Circle’s Jeremy Allaire, who showcased a transfer using USDC on Solana. The demonstration underlined the network’s role in powering Cash App’s initial phase. Moreover, the network stands out due to its throughput and fee structure, which aligns with the platform’s need for instant payments. Solana trades around $142.59 with a market cap of nearly $79 billion. The asset shows mild intraday strength but remains down over the past week. Consequently, the price action reflects broader risk pressure across major cryptocurrencies. However, the network continues to capture attention as more payment platforms evaluate faster settlement rails. Analysts Track Key Levels as Solana Trends Lower Source: X Despite renewed attention, analysts maintain a cautious tone. Crypto Tony notes a steady grind toward the $95 demand zone as Solana forms clear lower highs and lower lows. He identifies weakening support layers and highlights the importance of the $125 to $135 region. Additionally, he warns that the path to $95 remains open unless Solana reclaims $165. More Crypto Online shares a similar outlook while monitoring a short-term resistance cluster. He views $148.11 as a key trigger for a potential shift in momentum. A decisive move above that level could signal a local low and redirect attention toward the $157 to $167 band. However, he stresses that failure to break through leaves the asset exposed to deeper retracements.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|USDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 21:21:27

According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Ford must also forfeit more than $1 million and repay over $170,000 in restitution. Fraudulent promises land Wolf Capital’s founder in trouble From January to August 2023, Ford offered his investors returns of 1-2% per day, an annualized rate of approximately 547%, through “the company’s website and other social media and internet-based promotion activities” on platforms such as Telegram and Discord. Ford reportedly lied about the company’s financial status, diverted funds into personal accounts, used some for personal expenses, and also incurred large amounts of trading losses. While all of these were happening, US prosecutors claim that Ford was still soliciting funds from existing and new investors. By mid-2023, however, the scheme began to crumble as investors began reporting delayed withdrawals and numbers in their accounts that didn’t add up. The patchwork gave out in August 2023 when Ford shut down the platform. Ford’s victims promptly hit state and federal agencies with a wave of complaints, which led to the beginning of Ford’s problems. In his plea deal, Ford acknowledged lying to investors even after he and his co-conspirators had already siphoned their money away. “I made that and other similar false statements with the intent to induce individuals to invest their money with me and Wolf Capital and to remain invested,” he said, according to court documents . The DOJ added that Ford knew the advertised returns were impossible to achieve. Still, the operation pressed on, raising $9.4 million from about 2,800 people. In reality, investigators say the scheme operated like a classic Ponzi structure , with new deposits used to prop up the illusion of success while funds flowed to Ford and other insiders. Ford faces 5 years of jail time The case, which has been actively pursued by the DOJ’s Fraud Section and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Criminal Investigations Group, saw Ford plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in January 2025. The USPIS is reportedly still carrying out investigations on the case. At sentencing, the court hit Ford with a 60-month prison term on top of the over $1 million in repayments that the government imposed on the accused. With Ford now sentenced, the focus shifts to what his conviction means for those who lost their capital in the investment. The restitution and forfeiture orders may be some sort of salve for the victims of Ford’s scheme, but US authorities acknowledge that full recovery remains unlikely for many of the individuals who trusted Wolf Capital with their money. The DOJ has been actively prosecuting crypto-related Ponzi schemes , with one similar case being that of David Kagel , a disbarred California attorney, who reportedly defrauded his victims of about $9.5 million. He was sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to his role in the scam and was also ordered to pay around $14 million in restitution late last year.

SAP is set to settle with the European Commission if it can confirm through feedback from customers and competitors that the company intends to comply with its competition rules. SAP is close to settling with the European Commission It appears that SAP SE will be able to avoid paying an antitrust fine as the European Commission is currently preparing to ask the company for more details regarding its offer to settle an investigation into its software management program. According to people familiar with the matter, SAP submitted several commitments this week in order to address the allegations that it restricted competition through its software management program, especially related to its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. The Commission is expected to begin a market test of those commitments soon and ask customers, competitors, and other industry groups to give feedback on the firm’s offer. SAP is one of Europe’s largest software companies, and its ERP system is widely used by corporations and institutions. The offer is centered around concerns pointed out by regulators during their review. SAP is proposing changes like giving customers more freedom to switch to rival providers and also providing clearer information about its fee structures. Regulators questioned whether SAP’s rules made it harder for customers to choose other suppliers that were charging less for maintenance and support services. If the feedback from competitors and customers raises no serious objections, regulators are likely to drop the threat of fines. EU compliance and investigations Under EU competition rules, companies can offer remedies when their practices raise concerns, and regulators will then decide whether the commitments fully address the issues. A market test is a key part of this process because it allows businesses and other affected parties to weigh in before the Commission makes its final ruling. SAP said in a statement that it does not expect the case to have a visible impact on its financial performance. The European Commission first announced its investigation into the company in September when Teresa Ribera, the EU’s antitrust chief, said her unit would investigate the concerns about SAP restricting competition. SAP has been adjusting its services from traditional on-premise software to cloud-based subscription services. The firm’s cloud sales this year are expected to reach at least €21.6 billion, which is more than triple the amount recorded in 2019. The EU previously investigated Microsoft when concerns rose over the merging of its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office packages. Microsoft later agreed to separate Teams from Office in Europe to address the Commission’s competition concerns.

Market history shows that XRP has found it difficult to muster enough momentum to spark explosive growth without the need for key market drivers. The limelight is already focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.035 DeFi crypto that has already caused quite a buzz in the sector. The twin lending platform that MUTM provides has the potential to enable lending as well as borrowing within the same ecosystem. The current Stage 6 presale has sold over 90% of the supply; therefore, there is FOMO evident among investors. Mutuum Finance is the next big new crypto investment opportunity that has greater potential growth compared to XRP. XRP Ranges Sideways as Buyers Target Major Inception Levels The current trading range of Ripple (XRP) between $1.90 and $3.38 in 2025 has left many investors unsure about the next move. Experts such as Ali Martinez believe that it might be better to buy XRP closer to the $1.90 marker to take advantage of potentially moving upwards if the current bull trend resumes. Since macrofinancial considerations such as the success of spot XRP ETF and DTCC inclusion combined with renewed liquidity in the US are behind the optimistic outlook, current trades are cautious in terms of price momentum. While the spotlight rests with projects that are useful and possess tremendous growth potential, one investment that has gained attention with the potential to act as an alternative to projects with higher growth potential in 2025 is the DeFi crypto, Mutuum Finance. This new crypto has been attracting investors who are looking for tangible utility and strong adoption potential. Presale Trend Experiences Surge Mutuum Finance is quickly making its name among the most anticipated DeFi crypto projects set to launch. The current presale has seen over 17,950 people participate and raise over $18.8 million. Phase 6 has already reached over 90% completion with the MUTM tokens retailing at $0.035, a significant increase from $0.01 seen during Phase 1. As the presale approaches Phase 7, the token price is set to rise by 20%, pushing MUTM closer to its expected listing price on the exchange with a projected value of $0.06. Overall, with widespread adoption and an increasing price trend, Mutuum Finance offers an attractive entry opportunity to initial investors targeting growth and multiple returns in the new crypto sector. Stablecoin and Layer-2 Scaling Looking forward, one of the key projects that Mutuum Finance has in the works is the development of an over-collateralized stablecoin. The introduction of stablecoin is essential to ensure that there is liquidity retained within the ecosystem. Stablecoin has been one of the key components that form DeFi crypto; stablecoin facilitates predictable loan transactions and ensures that funds are retained within the ecosystem. Furthermore, the project has also pinpointed the integration with Layer-2 technology as another significant milestone. Layer-2 technologies will ensure that there are lower fees and faster speeds. This makes the platform more attractive to retail and professional traders alike. Not only does this improve the usability of the platform by making it more accessible to people who want to participate in DeFi crypto activities, but it also ensures that MUTM grows and prospers in the DeFi industry. Strategic Project Positioning The initial offering from Mutuum Finance is set to include various essential features in its arsenal that will definitely boost demand for its token. At the same time, there is strong emphasis on fundamentals. The aim here is to find the perfect blend that will attract novices as well as seasoned players to the new crypto sector. The dual-lending structure in Mutuum Finance represents an ecosystem that combines lenders, borrowers, and liquidators to ensure that there is liquidity and stability within the system. The lenders are also presented with the opportunity to either use stable or variable interest rates; stable rates are ideal during times of market volatility. The website and the platform will be operational from day one, so lending and borrowing will be possible immediately after listing the token. In doing so, the team at Mutuum Finance has integrated the token’s value with the active use of the platform to ensure that there is demand generated for the token from day one rather than waiting months to gain those benefits. There is already over $18.8 million raised and over 18,000 contributors for MUTM presale. Prices will increase to $0.04 during Phase 7. Tokens are set to skyrocket with such massive potential ahead thanks to the DeFi crypto strategy involving dual-lending platforms with stable cryptocurrencies and Layer-2 scaling for MUTM over more mature cryptocurrencies such as XRP.

The BIT narrative movement within the SOL ecosystem is quietly driving a core evolution of the platform, cementing the network’s position as a leading blockchain. How BIT Is Reshaping The Solana Infrastructure BIT is quietly becoming one of Solana’s most underrated narratives right now. An analyst known as CryptoDoc has revealed on X that Bitdealernet is building an asset-backed meme launchpad, where every token launch on their platform is tied to real iGaming products with millions of active players. Related Reading: Solana DEX Volume Hits $5B as Best Wallet Token Surpasses $16.9M The project has integrated directly with major Solana Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms, including Meteora and Jupiter, which gives the token instant access to SOL’s premier DeFi tools. Additionally, it has established direct connections with popular trading platforms, including Axiom, Bonkbot, Photon, and BullX; an integration that provides liquidity, reach, and utility from day one. This project leverages over 4 million users across its gaming ecosystem this year alone. With the corporation of KOL rev share mechanics, which creates powerful incentives that align with the entire ecosystem to be deflationary by design. These features are why this looks like the next evolution of meme economics. According to cryptoDoc, this is not just another meme, but it’s a meme with a business behind it, and BIT is setting the new standard for sustainable meme tokens. Strategic Deployment Of The Bitdealer App Chain An X analyst, BCBlueSkyVC, has also mentioned that Bitdealer may still be in its early stages, but the vision it is building toward is undeniably massive. While Bitdealernet is currently laying its foundational pieces, the roadmap reveals a bold, structured direction with important steps.

This launching of NFT-based Player Profiles innovation transforms user identity into valuable digital assets, increasing transparency in token management and strengthening community trust. If executed with precision, Bitdealer could evolve into a segment-defining platform where meme culture meets iGaming utility and DeFi incentives to create a unified Web3 experience. The project’s vision is bold, and its direction is clear, which will make crypto a fun and transparent space to be in that truly rewards real users, not just speculators. Bitdealer is not simply building another launchpad, but it’s creating a cultural-financial hub on Solana, where digital culture, gaming, and decentralized finance resonate in oneness to reward real users.

The Nasdaq-listed company revealed that the ETH treasury revenue of $4.94 million contributed to the record. The Nasdaq-listed company posted a net income of $65.6 million in the quarter, driven by unrealized gains of $73.7 million. It also revealed a $4.94 million increase in revenue, representing a 568% increase from the same period last year. Notably, $4.94 million represented an 78% increase from the second quarter. BTCS stated that its revenue for the nine months ended September 30 totaled $9.40 million. Additionally, the $9.40 million was 2.3 times more than 2024 revenues and rose 437% year over year. Per the report, the Builder’s plus earnings totalled $3.36 million, showing a 730% year-over-year increase and a 34% quarter-over-quarter surge. The press release revealed that the Builder plus revenue increased due to order flow, transaction volume, and technical improvements throughout BTCS’s block-building infrastructure.

He claimed that practicing the ETH-first strategy led to good record revenue and strong profitability. Allen also said that the increase in the ETH per share indicates the usefulness of integrated work. He added that the rise of ETH per share demonstrates a capital-efficient approach of the Nasdaq-traded company. Additionally, Allen mentioned that the introduction of the third company unit of the company, Imperium, can be considered a landmark in the company’s building of its DeFi infrastructure and ETH-first strategy. According to Michael Prevoznik, Chief Financial Officer of BTCS, the expansion of ETH generated huge unrealized benefits for BTCS, which were further enhanced by effective balance sheet management. Prevoznik emphasized that BTCS used both traditional and decentralized fundraising sources, such as the firm’s ATM program, ETH-backed loans, and convertible notes issued at conversion rates higher than the market rate. BTCS increases ETH holdings through DeFi operations The earrings coincide with BTCS’s recent acceleration of ETH acquisition. The Nasdaq-listed company began with a $1 million ETH reserve in June, marking the start of a strategy that has evolved into one of the largest reserves held by a publicly traded company. On July 24, Cryptopolitan reported that the company deposited $100 million in Lido staked ETH (stETH) on Aave at an annual percentage yield (APY) of 3% and borrowed $30 million in USDT from the protocol at a rate of 5%. BTCS utilized the $30 million stablecoin loan to acquire more ETH, which it staked at 4% APY. According to Charles Allen, using Lido to stake ETH and raising $30 million in USDT allows BTCS to provide a net yield of $2.7 million per year (2.7%). He described the strategy as an effective exposure to ETH and just the beginning of what the company is doing. Notably, on July 14, BTCS borrowed $2.34 million in USDT using the Aave protocol to purchase ETH. The Nasdaq-listed company purchased 2,731 ETH, valued at $8.23 million at the time, adding the loan to its cash on hand. Additionally, the purchase of ETH increased the total holdings of ETH to 31,855 ETH. According to the Nasdaq-listed company, the total assets under the balance sheet increased 632% to $298.86 million in quarter 3 2025, up 681%, as a result of immense ETH accumulation. The company noted that the number of common shares outstanding rose to 47.1 million, up 114% sequentially, in contrast to the company’s 392% increase in market valuation since the start of 2025. Additionally, as of September 30, 2025, ETH holdings had increased to 70,322 ETH, a 380% increase from quarter 2 2025 and a 676% year-to-date increase, totalling $291.58 million.
