54365374,627020,1763074803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,List Of 16 Blockchains That Can Freeze Your Crypto On-Chain; Bybit Report,https://bitcoinist.com/blockchains-freeze-your-crypto/,"A new study by Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab has revealed that 16 major blockchain networks can freeze users’ crypto on-chain. This capability allows blockchain foundations or validators to step in and restrict transactions , thereby challenging the core principle of decentralization. While these freezing mechanisms are often employed to prevent hacks , and other security risks, they also raise concerns about control, transparency, and the potential reintroduction of centralized authority in decentralized networks . Bybit has disclosed that its research report is the first large-scale investigation to identify which blockchains possess freezing capabilities and how they operate. Bybit Exposes Blockchains With Crypto-Freezing Powers In a Press Release , Bybit released a new research, unveiling blockchains with fund freezing mechanisms and examining the impact these capabilities have in the DeFi space. The study analyzed a total of 166 different blockchain networks and found that 16 currently possess crypto freezing powers, while 19 could support similar functions in the future. To carry out this research, Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team utilized an AI agent to filter blockchains through in-depth manual code reviews, as most networks do not openly document these features. The research team categorized the freezing capabilities of the 16 blockchain networks into three main mechanisms: Hardcoded Freezing: It is embedded directly in blockchain’s core code, seen in networks like Chiliz (CHZ), Viction (VIC), XDC Network (XDC), Binance Coin (BNB), and VeChain (VET). Configuration-based Freezing: Controlled through validator or foundation settings, found in Harmony (ONE), Havah (HVH), SUPRA, APTOS (APT), EOS, Oasis (ROSE), WAX (WAXP), SUI, LINEA, and WAVES. On-chain Freezing: Executed via system-level contracts, present in blockchains like Huobi ECO Chain (HECO). Bybit has reported that fund freezing occurs when a blockchain locks a user’s assets without their consent . They highlight that these capabilities give these networks a level of control similar to that of traditional banks. The team has also emphasized that the research aims to provide greater transparency on blockchains while laying the groundwork for future studies and risk assessments in the digital asset industry. Real Cases Of Blockchain Fund Freezing Bybit’s Lazarus Security Lab team has also highlighted real-world incidents where crypto freezing was used to protect users and mitigate losses. Notably, in 2025, the SUI Foundation froze $162 million in assets following the Cetus Protocol hack in May, which resulted in a loss of over $220 million . Following this, Aptos added blacklisting functions to its network. In 2022, the BNB Chain used hardcoded blacklists to contain a $570 million bridge exploit, preventing the attacker from accessing the funds. Notably, in 2019, VeChain set an early precedent by freezing funds after a $6.1 million breach . Meanwhile, Cosmos’s modular account design may allow similar interventions in the future. These cases demonstrate how fund-freezing functions can act as emergency tools during large-scale security incidents . Bybit points out that although centralization remains a concern, many networks are implementing practical safety measures, even if they challenge the principle of complete decentralization, which is the core tenet of blockchain technology.",Crypto News|APTOS (APT|Binance Coin|BNB|BNB Chain|Bybit|Cetus Protocol|chiliZ|CHZ|Cosmos|crypto|crypto adoption|Crypto Market|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency market|DeFi|EOS|Havah|HECO|Huobi ECO Chain|HVH|Lazarus Security Lab|Linea|OASIS|ONE|Rose|SUI|SUI Foundation|SUPRA|VeChain|VET|VIC|Viction|WAVES|WAX|WAXP|XDC|XDC Network,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|SUI|XDC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-13 23:00:03

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Upexi has authorized a $50 million share repurchase program, showing a broader shift toward capital preservation even as firms continue to hold massive Solana reserves on their balance sheets. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 Upexi Greenlights Share Buyback Amid 47% Stock Drop Upexi, a Solana-focused digital asset treasury company and consumer brands operator, said its board approved the buyback to provide “flexibility to purchase shares in the open market” depending on market conditions. The company emphasized that the program reflects confidence in its long-term strategy while maintaining a strong treasury position. . @UpexiTreasury Announces $50 Million Share Repurchase Program ""This share repurchase program underscores our confidence in Upexi’s strategy, balance sheet, and long-term growth trajectory,"" said Upexi CEO @UpexiAllan Read more here https://t.co/6e8YsQ5DeF — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) November 13, 2025 The CEO, Allan Marshall, also added that the repurchase is a tool to enhance shareholder value and will be executed only when returns are attractive. The company’s treasury holds roughly 2 million SOL, valued at $283 million, representing about 0.35% of Solana’s total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Despite a recent decline in Solana’s price, from about $143 to $134, Upexi’s on-chain reserves remain among the largest institutional holdings in the ecosystem. The firm’s crypto-backed position has, however, been mirrored by sharp volatility in its own stock, which has fallen nearly 47% over the past month from a high of $6.50 to around $3.43. Source: Sol Treasury Upexi’s move comes amid a turbulent period for Solana-linked treasuries. According to institutional reserve data, the top 20 Solana treasury and ETF holders control 24 million SOL worth about $3.4 billion, or 3.5% of the total supply. Source: Sol Treasury Around half of these holdings are staked for yield at an average return of 7.7%, while the remainder remains liquid for balance sheet management. Forward Industries (FORD) leads with 6.8 million SOL valued near $966 million, followed by Solana Company (HSDT), DeFi Development Corp (DFDV), Sharps Technology (STSS), and Upexi rounding out the top five. These firms account for roughly 76% of all institutional Solana holdings, showing how companies use digital assets strategically. Solana Treasury Firms Trade Below Asset Value as Institutions Maintain Positions Market data shows that despite Solana’s price drop of nearly 7% in 24 hours, institutional positions have largely remained intact, with no major liquidations reported. Analysts view this stability as a sign of long-term confidence in Solana’s network fundamentals and its growing role as a blockchain for corporate treasuries. Public market valuations differ. Most Solana treasuries are currently trading at a discount to their net asset value (mNAV), indicating investor caution Upexi’s mNAV stands at 0.68, while Forward Industries sits at 0.82, suggesting cautious sentiment in equity markets despite strong on-chain balance sheets. The divergence between treasury value and stock performance has been a defining feature of the DAT sector. Upexi, which reported $66.7 million in net income in its most recent quarter, driven largely by $78 million in unrealized Solana gains, still faces investor skepticism tied to broader crypto market swings. Its stock previously surged more than 600% after revealing its Solana strategy earlier this year, but has since retraced sharply as digital assets weakened. Other treasuries act similarly. On November 6, Forward Industries authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program for flexibility amid volatility. Forward Industries — the Solana treasury company — has filed its Resale Prospectus Supplement with the @SECGov and authorized a $1B share repurchase program. #Solana $FORD https://t.co/kpG7BxEeb8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 4, 2025 Despite the short-term pullback in prices, the overall trend in corporate Solana holdings remains upward. The rise of Solana-focused treasuries marks an evolution from the Bitcoin treasury strategies that dominated earlier cycles. These firms use Solana not only as a store of value but also as a yield-generating asset through staking and validator participation. Companies like DFDV , which stakes its entire 2.2 million SOL holding, illustrate how treasury management in crypto is becoming more active and income-driven.

As the cryptocurrency prepares for its long-awaited Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) debut, the balance of XRP on major exchanges continues to decline. Analysts are warning that an impending supply crisis could spark a significant surge in the XRP price, which is currently more than 34% below its all-time high levels. XRP Supply Shortage To Trigger Parabolic Surge Amidst ongoing market volatility and whale capitulation, crypto market expert Arthur remains positive about XRP, drawing attention to a series of on-chain developments that could mark the beginning of a parabolic upward move. In his post on X social media, the analyst emphasized that an XRP could soon see a supply crisis, which may ignite its next price explosion. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals Final Nail In The Coffin For XRP, What This Means According to recent chart data from CryptoQuant, XRP reserves on Binance have fallen to about 2.79 million tokens, marking a sustained decline that began in early 2025. The chart also shows that while XRP’s price has remained relatively stable between $2 and $3, the available supply on almost all major cryptocurrency exchanges has continued to decline drastically. Arthur has revealed that this signals a growing imbalance between supply and demand, which could set the foundation for a bullish move. Arthur has also referenced a prediction made by JPMorgan analysts, who estimated that between $4 to $8 billion could flow into the upcoming XRP Spot ETFs once they launch in the market. This projection indicates confidence in XRP’s future institutional demand and interest as a legitimate digital asset class. The analyst has suggested that increased ETF demand from institutions, combined with limited liquidity, could create a “perfect storm” for a price breakout of XRP. Additionally, the analyst has revealed that the XRP ETF could also see a surge in retail demand, contributing to its projected price appreciation. Currently, reports indicate that approval of XRP Spot ETFs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending. However, prominent analysts like Nate Geraci remain confident that these investment products will be launched soon. Binance XRP Reserve Data Shows Steady Losses Delving deeper into XRP’s supply on exchanges, CryptoQuant’s data shows that the cryptocurrency’s reserve on Binance is sitting at approximately 2.785 billion tokens as of November 12, 2025. Notably, this marks a decrease of over 10 million tokens from the previous day, when 2.795 billion XRP was recorded. Since the beginning of November, Binance’s XRP balance has been declining, hovering just above the 2.7 billion token threshold. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Earlier in October, reserves dipped to 2.74 billion tokens, one of the lowest levels recorded in almost a year. While balances briefly rebounded in mid-October, the latest data shows a renewed downward trajectory, suggesting that selling pressure may have eased and accumulation could be taking place off exchanges.

Whale Alert, the popular blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering movement of 5,969 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This enormous Bitcoin transfer, valued at approximately $596 million, represents one of the most significant movements we’ve seen recently. But what does this massive Bitcoin transfer really mean for the market? What This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Reveals When we see a Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude, several important questions arise. Why would someone move nearly 6,000 BTC in a single transaction? This substantial Bitcoin transfer could indicate several possibilities. The sender might be a large institution repositioning assets, a wealthy individual consolidating holdings, or even an exchange managing internal wallets. The fact that this Bitcoin transfer went to an unknown wallet adds another layer of mystery to the situation. Large Bitcoin transfers often signal significant market movements ahead. Historical data shows that massive movements frequently precede price volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every large Bitcoin transfer indicates immediate market impact. Sometimes these transactions represent routine portfolio management or security measures. Why Should You Care About This Bitcoin Transfer? You might wonder why a single Bitcoin transfer matters to the average investor. The answer lies in market psychology and liquidity. When whales make moves this substantial, they can influence: Market sentiment – Large movements often trigger speculation Price discovery – Significant transfers can affect supply dynamics Investor confidence – Whale activity signals institutional interest Trading volume – Large movements increase overall market activity This particular Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase stands out because of its sheer size and timing. The movement from a known exchange to an unknown wallet suggests the assets are being moved into cold storage or private custody. This Bitcoin transfer pattern often indicates long-term holding intentions rather than immediate selling pressure. Understanding the Impact of Large Bitcoin Transfers Every significant Bitcoin transfer tells a story about market dynamics. The $596 million valuation of this transaction highlights Bitcoin’s continued dominance in the cryptocurrency space. Such substantial movements demonstrate that major players remain actively involved in the ecosystem. This Bitcoin transfer also underscores the importance of transparency in blockchain transactions. Thanks to services like Whale Alert, we can track these movements in real-time. However, the anonymous nature of the receiving wallet reminds us that privacy remains a key feature of cryptocurrency transactions. What This Bitcoin Transfer Means for Future Price Action Analyzing this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at historical patterns. Large movements to unknown wallets have often preceded: Price consolidation periods Increased institutional accumulation Reduced exchange liquidity Long-term bullish sentiment The timing of this Bitcoin transfer coincides with broader market developments that could influence future price trajectories. While we cannot predict exact outcomes, the movement of nearly 6,000 BTC certainly warrants attention from serious market participants. Key Takeaways From This Monumental Bitcoin Movement This substantial Bitcoin transfer serves as a powerful reminder of several crucial market realities. First, institutional-sized movements continue to shape the cryptocurrency landscape. Second, the transparency of blockchain technology allows us to monitor these developments in real-time. Finally, the movement from exchange to private wallet suggests confidence in long-term value preservation. The $596 million Bitcoin transfer represents more than just numbers on a screen. It demonstrates the maturing infrastructure that supports large-scale cryptocurrency transactions and the growing sophistication of market participants. As the ecosystem evolves, we can expect to see more of these significant Bitcoin transfers that shape market dynamics and investor strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin whale transfer? A Bitcoin whale transfer refers to large movements of Bitcoin, typically involving thousands of coins, usually executed by wealthy individuals or institutions known as ‘whales’ in cryptocurrency terminology. Why do large Bitcoin transfers matter? Large Bitcoin transfers matter because they can signal institutional moves, affect market liquidity, influence price sentiment, and indicate accumulation or distribution patterns among major holders. How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? You can track large Bitcoin transfers using blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or monitoring services like Whale Alert that specifically report significant cryptocurrency movements. Does moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets affect price? Moving Bitcoin to unknown wallets often indicates long-term holding intentions, which can reduce immediate selling pressure and potentially support price stability or future appreciation. What does a transfer from Coinbase usually mean? A transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet typically suggests assets are moving into private custody for long-term storage rather than immediate trading purposes.

With Bitcoin down by 7% in a month, and with Ethereum down by 11%, traders may be looking for alternatives to boost their portfolios, and one such alternative is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has been enjoying a successful presale. It’s planning to launch a market-first mine-to-earn platform, enabling holders to mine cryptocurrencies without having to invest in expensive hardware. This feature distinguishes it from most other new meme coins, which is why it could rally strongly once it lists in the next few weeks. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today – 13 November The past few weeks have been rough for the cryptocurrency market, with fears related to an AI-led bubble causing investors to pull funds out of major tokens. This has impacted most cryptocurrencies, even if fundamentals remain generally strong, and the situation may not pick up decisively until the stock market corrects. However, even with average prices remaining subdued, traders may be able to buck the trend by looking to new and up-and-coming coins, with PEPENODE being one of the most promising new tokens around right now. It has now raised $2.1 million in its ongoing presale, providing a clear sign of how popular it could become once it launches. PEPENODE is building something special from the ground up. Buy Meme Nodes. Upgrade Facilities. Earn meme Coins. All on one platform https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/JUTG2F6eXG — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 11, 2025 The main reason for its early success is that it’s offering something no other token in the market is currently offering, which is a mine-to-earn platform. As this term suggests, the platform provides users with the opportunity to earn money from mining, yet in PEPENODE’s case, it doesn’t require the use of expensive mining equipment. Instead, users can build their own virtual mining rigs, using the PEPENODE token itself to acquire and run more mining nodes. The more mining nodes they own, the more they earn from mining. The protocol will pay out rewards in external tokens, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, with more coins coming at later dates. This means that there could be substantial demand for PEPENODE, so as to grow mining rigs. Also, multiplying demand will be the fact that holders can stake the token, with the current yield at 600% APY. How to Buy PEPENODE Early These features mean that PEPENODE is one of the most bullish new tokens in the market, making it arguably the best new meme coin to buy now, or at least one of the best. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with owners able to claim their tokens as soon as its presale ends. Investors can join this sale by going to the PEPENODE website, where the token is currently selling for $0.0011454. This price will rise again tomorrow, so traders wanting to lock in the biggest possible returns should act now. And given the coin’s growing popularity, it could climb well above this price once it launches, especially if it gains listings from big exchanges.

This monumental achievement represents a watershed moment for cryptocurrency adoption and investor confidence. What Does This BTC Price Milestone Mean for Investors? The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 signals several important developments. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major corporations and investment funds increase their Bitcoin exposure. Second, retail investor interest typically follows these landmark price movements. However, experienced traders recommend maintaining a balanced portfolio approach despite the excitement. Market analysts point to several factors driving this impressive BTC price performance: Increased institutional investment in Bitcoin ETFs Growing global adoption as a hedge against inflation Positive regulatory developments in key markets Limited supply meeting expanding demand How Sustainable Is This Current BTC Price Level? While the current BTC price achievement generates excitement, investors should consider market volatility. Cryptocurrency markets historically experience significant price swings. Therefore, proper risk management remains crucial for all market participants. The technical analysis perspective suggests strong support levels have formed around previous resistance zones. Moreover, trading volume has increased substantially during this upward movement, indicating genuine market participation rather than artificial price pumping. What Should New Investors Know About BTC Price Movements? For newcomers attracted by the impressive BTC price performance, understanding basic cryptocurrency principles proves essential. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls its value. The price reflects collective market sentiment and fundamental adoption metrics. Key considerations for new investors include: Understanding wallet security and storage options Researching reputable exchanges for trading Learning about dollar-cost averaging strategies Recognizing the difference between long-term holding and active trading Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of BTC Price The breakthrough of BTC price above $100,000 opens new psychological territory for market participants. Historical patterns suggest that after breaking major resistance levels, Bitcoin often experiences consolidation periods followed by either continued upward momentum or corrective phases. Market sentiment appears overwhelmingly positive, though seasoned investors caution against excessive euphoria. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, with adoption metrics continuing to show healthy growth across both institutional and retail segments. Frequently Asked Questions What caused BTC price to surge past $100,000? The price movement resulted from combined factors including institutional investment flows, positive regulatory developments, and increasing global adoption as a digital store of value. Should I invest in Bitcoin at current price levels? Investment decisions should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Canary Capital will be the first asset management firm to get an XRP spot ETF approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fund will trade under the ticker symbol XRPC. The official listing notice for $XRPC has arrived from Nasdaq. Looks like tomorrow is ON for the launch. pic.twitter.com/zvJ8q3SwpS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 12, 2025 A hybrid XRP ETF managed by REX-Osprey that partially invests in futures has attracted $131 million in assets just a few months after its launch. This reflects Wall Street’s growing appetite for the token. Just as it happened with the first Solana 100% spot ETF launched by Bitwise recently, Canary’s ETF could rapidly surpass its predecessor as this vehicle is 100% backed by XRP reserves. Could this ETF approval mark the beginning of XRP’s next leg up? XRP Price Prediction: Eyes Set at $5 as Institutions Embrace XRP XRP found support at $2.10 recently, following the hawkish comments made by the head of the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago. XRP has bounced off a key support just as the U.S. government shutdown ends, reigniting hopes for a stronger recovery across the crypto market. If the token breaks above the 200-day EMA, it could accelerate toward $3 — a move that would confirm a breakout from the current parabolic setup. With institutional adoption rising, XRP’s long-term outlook remains strong. A surge to $5 looks achievable in the months ahead. Some ultra-bullish projections still point to a $100 target eventually, which would imply a $6 trillion market cap. That’s a stretch for now, but the narrative is gaining steam among believers. Meanwhile, high-upside presales like Pepenode ($PEPENODE) are attracting early investors hoping to capture growth faster. This project reimagines mining by letting anyone earn meme coins through virtual rigs — no hardware required. Over $2 million has already poured into the presale, and the window to get in early is closing fast. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Gamifies Mining and Makes It Fun and Hassle-Free Pepenode ($PEPENODE) enables players to mine meme coins easily, without the need to invest thousands of dollars in hardware. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) transforms crypto mining into a virtual game where players compete to earn real meme coin rewards. Using $PEPENODE tokens, gamers can launch powerful virtual servers, deploy as many rigs as they like, and climb the leaderboard by mining more than their rivals. Top performers will score exclusive airdrops of trending tokens like Bonk ($BONK), along with other premium prizes. To drive value, the game burns up to 70% of the tokens spent on rig upgrades, creating constant deflation as gameplay scales. With $2.1 million raised in just weeks, many consider $PEPENODE as one of the most promising contenders in this meme coin cycle. To buy $PEPENODE before the next price increase, simply head to the official Pepenode website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can complete the transaction by swapping tokens like USDT or ETH, or simply using a bank card for instant access.

Merz’s announcement is the latest in a growing line of European countries dumping Chinese tech and cutting ties with manufacturers they evaluate to be risks. Germany’s digital sovereignty and national security concerns Merz, in a business conference in Berlin on Thursday, emphasized that Chinese components have no place in next-generation networks. “We won’t allow any components from China in the 6G network,” the German Chancellor said. Germany took a firm stance to exclude Huawei Technologies and other Chinese suppliers from its future communication networks due to concerns about potential security vulnerabilities linked to Huawei equipment. German authorities fear that the Chinese government’s influence over the tech manufacturer potentially creates an opening for espionage within critical telecoms infrastructure, a fear that has been echoed by other Western countries. By banning Huawei from 6G networks, Germany aims to eliminate future risks. Merz said he’d have a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron at an upcoming summit on digital sovereignty. “We’ll discuss with industry what we can do, not only to make ourselves independent from China, but also for example independent from the USA, independent from the big tech companies.” Major operators like Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, and Telefonica will need to adapt new strategies and find alternative suppliers, primarily European technology firms. Europe pushes out Chinese tech Germany’s decision to exclude Huawei from its 6G networks mirrors similar moves by other European countries as the bloc has been intensifying efforts to phase out Huawei and ZTE equipment from member state networks amid shared concerns about Chinese state influence and cybersecurity threats. Germany first made moves to remove Huawei equipment from core network components in 2024. Now, the country has made a stance to totally exclude Huawei and other Chinese suppliers from its future 6G network. Finland and other EU countries have recently announced plans or taken steps to ban Huawei for future network development. Beyond Europe, the US and several other countries have long restricted Huawei’s role in critical telecom projects, citing national security. Germany’s decision is expected to influence supply chains and investment decisions in the telecom market, potentially increasing costs and slowing deployment timelines during the transition away from Huawei. However, Merz notes that total independence from Chinese technology is not possible. “We can’t do that”. He also cautioned business executives to understand the risks of doing business with China, adding that Germany will not always be able to protect them.

After briefly dipping to around $100,700 on Wednesday, BTC remains down roughly 3.5% on the weekly candle. The move is part of a wider trend that has seen long-term holders unload more than 815,000 BTC over the past month. That level of selling has raised alarms among analysts who warn that lower liquidity pockets could drive Bitcoin toward the June 2025 lows near $98,000 if volatility accelerates. The broader market is now watching how Bitcoin behaves around the critical $100,000 region, which has repeatedly been tested throughout the year. Liquidity Mapping Shows Market Vulnerability Crypto analysts following liquidity flow patterns say that Bitcoin’s current range is showing clear pockets of weakness. Trader Daan Crypto noted that a “large cluster of liquidity sits below the local lows at $98,000–$100,000,” suggesting that if selling pressure increases, the market may gravitate toward that zone. He also pointed to upside liquidity targets near $108,000 and $112,000 but stressed that only the first target is currently within realistic reach. According to his assessment, whichever liquidity band breaks first could determine whether Bitcoin enters a sharp short squeeze or a capitulation-style flush. This view is backed by several futures traders who say BTC is increasingly likely to revisit the lower end of its range. Futures trader Byzantine General stated that Bitcoin “is likely to sweep the lows around $98,000,” citing repeated failures to break higher. Data from CoinGlass supports this bearish tilt, showing nearly $1.3 billion in cumulative long leveraged liquidity concentrated around $98,000. That figure has risen sharply since the beginning of the week, indicating that traders have layered bids just below current levels. Repeated Support Retests Signal Structural Weakness One of the more worrying indicators for market analysts is the consistent retesting of support between $102,000 and $100,000. Bitcoin has now returned to that region four separate times since May 2025. Each retest weakens buyers’ conviction and reduces the number of resting bids available to defend the support line. Analyst UBCrypto said the latest bounce resembled a failed breakout attempt and added that the region is “not a level worth buying into” until Bitcoin shows a confirmed shift in momentum. He argued that entering positions slightly higher is preferable if it means avoiding a potential breakdown. Despite this caution, long-heavy positioning remains dominant among retail traders. Hyblock Capital data shows that 68.9% of BTC orders on Binance still lean long, suggesting many believe the $100,000 level will hold. However, the daily and weekly charts both show softening structure at higher time frames. This has increased expectations that Bitcoin may eventually test the liquidity pool near $98,000 before the market finds a stronger footing. Deeper order book support appears to sit just above Bitcoin’s current price, but analysts warn that the market could still be pulled into lower liquidity areas if sentiment deteriorates. If selling from long-term holders continues and short-term traders remain overleveraged, Bitcoin may still face additional downside pressure before recovery attempts strengthen.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-13 23:39:57

At Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025, top VCs revealed they’re operating in what Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures calls a ‘funky time’ – where companies can leap from zero to $100 million in revenue within a single year. Why Traditional Venture Capital Rules No Longer Apply to AI Startups The unprecedented speed of AI innovation has forced venture capital firms to completely rethink their investment strategies. According to Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures, the old metrics and timelines have become obsolete. ‘It’s an algorithm with different variables and different coefficients,’ she explained during her keynote address. The rapid scaling capabilities of AI companies mean that investors must evaluate opportunities through an entirely new lens. The New Investment Strategy for AI Companies VCs are now prioritizing factors that were previously secondary considerations. Lee’s research reveals that Series A investors are measuring: Data generation capabilities and proprietary datasets Strength of competitive moats and technical barriers Founders’ track records and technical expertise Product depth and innovation velocity Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures emphasized that even startups achieving rapid growth to $5 million in revenue often struggle to secure follow-on funding, indicating how dramatically the investment game has changed. The Critical Importance of Go-to-Market Strategy One of the most significant shifts in venture capital thinking revolves around go-to-market execution. McNeill stated that ‘the breakout companies, in most cases, don’t have the best tech – they have the best go-to-market.’ This perspective highlights how investors are prioritizing customer acquisition and retention capabilities alongside technical innovation. Traditional VC Focus New AI Startup Focus Technology differentiation Go-to-market execution Long-term revenue projections Immediate revenue velocity Market size analysis Data generation capabilities Team experience Founder technical depth Unprecedented Revenue Growth Expectations The benchmark for success has been radically reset in the AI sector. Where previously startups might have celebrated reaching $10 million in annual revenue within five years, AI companies are now expected to achieve $100 million in revenue within twelve months. This accelerated timeline creates both enormous opportunity and intense pressure for founders and investors alike. Are We Witnessing the Dawn of a New Investment Era? Despite the high stakes and rapid pace, panelists agreed that the AI industry remains in its infancy. Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures noted that ‘there are no clear, outright winners, even in LLMs. There are competitors nipping at their heels.’ This suggests that the current investment frenzy represents just the beginning of a much larger transformation in how venture capital approaches technological disruption. FAQs What are the key factors VCs now consider for AI startup investments? VCs prioritize data generation, competitive moats, founder expertise, and go-to-market strategy over traditional metrics. How has revenue growth expectations changed for AI startups? Companies are now expected to reach $100 million in revenue within a year, compared to traditional timelines of 5+ years for similar milestones. What companies were mentioned in the Bitcoin World Disrupt discussion? The panel featured insights from Cowboy Ventures , DVx Ventures , and Kindred Ventures , with references to OpenAI and Anthropic as benchmarks for product development velocity. Who are the key investors driving this change? Aileen Lee of Cowboy Ventures, Jon McNeill of DVx Ventures, and Steve Jang of Kindred Ventures are among the thought leaders reshaping AI investment strategies. The venture capital industry’s radical transformation in response to AI startups represents more than just a temporary trend – it signals a fundamental restructuring of how innovation gets funded and scaled. As investors continue to adapt their strategies to this new reality, the companies that master both technological innovation and rapid market execution will define the next generation of industry leaders.

The updated buyback allocation forms part of a broader strategy to enhance value capture, staking yield, and governance participation, directly linking tokenholder incentives to platform performance. dYdX votes to approve proposal to triple token buyback rate. Source: Mintscan dYdX approves upgrade for buyback proposal The proposal , numbered #313, was passed by 59.38% of community voters on November 13, and it marks one of the most aggressive revenue-to-buyback ratios among major decentralized protocols. In the past, only 25% of net protocol fees were allocated to DYDX repurchases, with the remainder directed toward operational and treasury functions. The new move is expected to triple the buying pressure on the price. As part of the newly passed framework, the protocol committed three-quarters of its fee revenue directly to buying and staking DYDX , while 5% will be sent to the Treasury SubDAO and 5% to the MegaVault. “Starting today, 75% of protocol fees will be used to buy back DYDX on the open market,” the dYdX foundation confirmed on X. dYdX first launched its buyback mechanism in March 2025, coinciding with the v4 mainnet migration and a planned reduction in emissions by June 2025. The new buyback policy takes effect immediately, and what will naturally follow is a significant reduction in the token’s circulating supply, which could instantly push the DYDX price into an upside trajectory. dYdX prepares for its US debut The decision to update its revenue-to-buyback ratios follows dYdX’s rapid growth across its standalone Cosmos-based chain, where cumulative trading volume recently surpassed $1.5 trillion. It also comes as the exchange gets ready for its US market debut later this year and continues its campaign to remove maker and taker fees on select perpetual pairs to boost liquidity depth. The derivatives-focused exchange, which cuts out the middleman and allows users to transact directly on a blockchain network, was previously not available to American users. It recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, and Eddie Zhang, the company’s president, has revealed plans to expand its offerings by bringing spot trading on Solana and other linked cryptocurrencies to the US by the end of the year. “It’s very important for us as a platform to have something available in the United States, because I think it represents, hopefully, the direction we’re trying to move in,” Zhang said. The company’s decision to enter the US market may be linked to the friendly regulatory environment created by President Donald Trump’s embrace of the cryptocurrency sector this year. That embrace has led to the dismissal of several lawsuits against prominent crypto platforms and a shift by financial regulators to create specialized rules to accommodate digital assets. Upon entering the US, dYdX will slash its trading fees by as much as half “across the board,” to between 50 and 65 basis points, Zhang said. According to him, perpetual contracts will not be available in the US, but it is not entirely off the table and may become a possibility if US regulators eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to be able to offer those products. Already, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have indicated they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the US, so that possibility continues to grow by the day.

The round also included a mix of existing investors, such as Accel, and new backers, including Nvidia and Alphabet’s Google. Cursor’s surge in valuation comes after it raised $900 million in June at a $9.9 billion valuation . The June round saw participation from Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and Accel. Per Reuters, the company shared that it has now surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, with sales-led revenue growing 100-fold since the beginning of 2025. Cursor’s code-generation boom drives investor interest Cursor builds software that autonomously generates and completes code, allowing developers to write applications faster and with fewer errors, and the technology has been touted to replace traditional software development. The company’s tools are part of a growing segment of AI known as code generation. Investors see vast commercial potential in this space, as enterprises seek to automate routine programming tasks and accelerate the development of digital products, making tools like Cursor attractive. The new funding round positions Cursor as one of the highest-valued startups in the code-generation market, far outpacing peers such as Replit, which reached a $3 billion valuation in September after raising $250 million. It now joins a short list of AI companies with over $10 billion valuation. Rising valuations meet rising concerns The near-tripling of Cursor’s valuation in such a short period comes amid an increase in venture funding for AI companies. According to reports, global venture capital investment rose 38% year-on-year in the third quarter to $97 billion, with about half of that total flowing into AI-related businesses, according to data from Crunchbase. Investors have been particularly drawn to companies that can demonstrate tangible revenue growth, something Cursor seems to be doing well. By crossing the $1 billion annualized revenue threshold, it joins a small group of AI startups claiming to have achieved substantial commercial traction at scale. However, the frenetic pace of fundraising and valuations of AI companies has led to debates about its long-term market, with some experts, investors, and industry heavyweights like Jeff Bezos predicting that the fate that met the dot-com boom may befall it as well. However, Bezos reportedly stated that irrespective of what happens later in the sector, it’s certain that there will be winners as well as losers, and the society will still benefit from the inventions that will come out of the ‘AI bubble.’ Investors are also spreading their bets to ensure that they find themselves on the winning sides as much as possible. Concerns about overheating went up this week after Japan’s SoftBank Group sold its $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia, a move some analysts interpreted as a signal that even the sector’s most bullish investors are beginning to take profits. A defining moment for AI development Founded by a team of former MIT engineers under the umbrella of parent company Anysphere, Cursor has quickly become one of Silicon Valley’s breakout AI success stories. OpenAI was in talks with Cursor’s parent company to acquire the platform, but the deal fell through. The makers of ChatGPT also tried to acquire Windsurf, another code-generation startup, but also left the deal to launch its own platform called Codex. Windsurf itself was later acquired by AI startup Cognition. Anthropic’s Claude Code is also in the picture, and it has reportedly made about $500 million since it debuted this year. So, despite its rapid growth, Cursor faces formidable challenges. Apart from OpenAI and Anthropic, tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are heavily investing in similar AI-assisted development tools. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The guidance under development is expected to help banks and their partners understand how tokenized deposits fit into the existing insurance structure. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is preparing new guidance to help banks understand how deposit insurance should work when deposits are moved onto blockchain or other distributed-ledger systems. FDIC open to integrating blockchain into traditional banking Acting Chair Travis Hill confirmed the plan during an appearance at a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conference. He stated that the agency wants to give financial institutions clearer rules as they integrate digital asset technology into their systems. Hill strongly believes that deposits should not lose their legal status simply because they move from traditional banking platforms into a tokenized form. As he puts it, “a deposit is a deposit.” A tokenized deposit is usually a digital coin that acts as a claim on real funds held by a bank. This concept is different from stablecoins, which are digital tokens that are typically pegged to a fiat currency but are not automatically connected to federally insured deposit accounts. With banks and other financial firms experimenting with blockchain technology, regulators have been under pressure to clarify how existing customer protections like deposit insurance apply in these new environments. Many fintech companies are not banks, so they are not directly covered by FDIC insurance . To offer protection to their customers, they usually partner with FDIC-insured banks, which can make the accounts eligible for pass-through insurance. But this system can fail if the fintech goes out of business or if the way customer accounts are set up is unclear. This has raised concerns about who must cover customer losses when a third-party platform collapses. Rising consumer protection concerns The rise of fintech platforms has caused customers to assume that their digital wallets or app-based accounts are insured, even when the platform itself is not a bank. Pass-through insurance can apply only when certain conditions are met, and regulators have shared concerns about some fintechs that do not communicate these conditions clearly. This concern has grown as more fintech firms explore ways to offer tokenized financial products or integrate blockchain technology into their services. The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), a central pillar of the U.S. financial system, designed to protect depositors when banks fail, saw its reserve ratio fall below the level required by law after 2020. The fund is financed mainly by quarterly fees paid by insured banks, known as assessments. The reserve decline after 2020 was due to the surge in deposits across the banking system during the pandemic. To address this, the FDIC has been rebuilding the fund over the past few years. The agency projected earlier this year that the DIF would reach its legal target ratio by the end of 2025, about three years earlier than previously expected.

The ruling , made on Thursday, is a significant development in calculating what could be a substantial payout, potentially as much as £1.2 billion. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) refused Apple permission to appeal its ruling, which found that the tech giant charged “modest levels of commission” and stifled competition on its iOS App Store. However, the tech giant still has one final route of appeal: it can go to the Court of Appeal. The case is one of the largest legal challenges the iPhone maker faces in Europe, as scrutiny mounts worldwide over how the company operates its digital marketplace. Tribunal blocks Apple’s appeal attempt Last month, the CAT found that Apple had engaged in anticompetitive behaviour by creating a competitive advantage in the iOS app distribution market. The panel found it “excessive and unfair” because it refers to Apple charging its usual 30% cut on in-app transactions. The ruling concluded that the fare commission should have been only about 17.5%. Developers were overcharged for nearly nine years. The tribunal also found that developers had passed on half the cost of those inflated fees to consumers, thereby effectively charging millions of British users higher prices for apps and in-app services. On Thursday, the CAT refused Apple’s application to appeal the ruling, stating that Apple had not crossed the threshold required for reconsideration. Apple’s lawyers then requested a 21-day extension to file new papers with the Court of Appeal. The tribunal’s judgment that “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy” also disregarded the value Apple says it offers developers as well as consumers, the company said. The case was brought by Rachael Kent, a British academic, on behalf of approximately 20 million UK iPhone and iPad users. Her lawyers had calculated damages from October 2015 until February 2024, along with interest, at £1.2 billion. Kent said the case has been “a marathon, not a sprint,” but emphasized that last week’s ruling gets consumers “one step closer to seeing money rightfully put back into their pockets. That opens the way for the damages phase to proceed, with the CAT expected to plan additional hearings on how compensation is to be distributed. It is likely to be a process that will take months. Regulatory scrutiny of Apple increases around the world The UK case comes as the iPhone maker faces mounting pressure over its control of app distribution and in-app payments across Europe and the U.S. European regulators have also targeted the tech firm, utilizing new rules designed to curb the power of big tech platforms. In recent years, Apple has been forced to change App Store policies in the Netherlands, South Korea, and across the broader EU bloc. The UK judgment adds to a series of international rulings against the company, which have forced it to reduce fees or allow access for rival payment systems. Industry analysts say the CAT decision could bolster other lawsuits that are in progress against Apple, not only in Europe but also elsewhere. Apple now has a short period in which to request permission directly to appeal its case to the Court of Appeal.

54367116,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=853314,1763078423,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,SUI Silent Comeback: The Underdog Preparing For A $20 Charge,https://www.newsbtc.com/sui/sui-preparing-for-a-20-charge/,"In a latest update, BeLaunch posed the high-stakes question: Could SUI really reach $20 in the next bull cycle? After getting hit hard during the October 10 flash crash, SUI is starting to show strength again, and the charts are now painting a very interesting picture that could signal the beginning of a major turnaround. Potential Scenarios For SUI BeLaunch recently outlined two possible scenarios for SUI’s next move, each with distinct probabilities and implications. According to the analysis, the token is currently at a critical juncture, where its next few moves could determine the broader market‘s direction. Related Reading: SUI Eyes Key Retest As Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend – Rally To $3 Ahead? In the primary scenario, which carries an 8/10 probability, SUI is testing a crucial breakout above the red dashed resistance line. Wave (2) appears to have completed its cycle, setting the stage for Wave (3) — typically one of the most impulsive moves in the Elliott Wave structure. A confirmed breakout at this level could propel SUI toward new highs. The alternative scenario, rated at a 3/10 probability, suggests that the current price structure could remain corrective. In this case, SUI may form an alternative X wave near the $5.37 region before extending into another corrective phase (Alt Y). Although less likely, BeLaunch noted that traders should still monitor this possibility closely. Technical and On-Chain Alignment Suggests Market Bottom Nearing According to BeLaunch, on-chain fundamentals for SUI are showing early signs of recovery, despite broader market attention remaining elsewhere. The data reveals that Total Value Locked (TVL) has been holding firm around $1.4 billion, though the analyst notes that a move above the $2 billion threshold would mark a more decisive shift in momentum. At the same time, Daily Active Users (DAU) have been climbing gradually, now sitting near 900,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says SUI Price Could Be Heading To $9: 4 Reasons Why BeLaunch noted that despite this encouraging on-chain behavior, SUI’s price remains lagging, a common indicator of a classic accumulation phase. During such periods, investors often underestimate the asset’s underlying strength while long-term players quietly position themselves ahead of a potential breakout. Historically, SUI has shown a tendency to rally within two to four weeks after both TVL and DAU metrics begin trending upward. If this pattern repeats, it could signal that SUI is currently in a quiet accumulation window before a stronger move to the upside. This alignment between historical behavior and present data gives a subtle yet compelling bullish undertone. Overall, BeLaunch emphasized that the technical and on-chain setup appears robust. Fundamentals are stabilizing, momentum indicators are shifting, and WaveTrend signals are flashing a bottom below 40. If the current trend persists, SUI could soon emerge from consolidation and enter a new bullish phase.

The draft legislation would establish a clear regime for digital-asset spot markets and limit the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), offering significant implications for the broader crypto industry. Defining Digital Commodities and Oversight Led by Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), the proposed discussion draft aims to grant the CFTC authority over digital-commodity spot markets, while limiting the SEC’s oversight to securities. Under this model, what are currently labelled “major cryptocurrencies” could be explicitly classified as commodities. The draft outlines a framework for trading platforms and intermediaries to register with the CFTC, and introduces protections such as customer-fund segregation, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on affiliated trading. Implications for XRP and the Ripple Ecosystem If enacted, the legislation would have direct relevance to Ripple and its XRP token, which were central to the company’s regulatory dispute with the SEC. Classifying XRP as a commodity would anchor its legal treatment under the Commodity Exchange Act, rather than securities laws. This may ease listing decisions for U.S. exchanges, reduce regulatory uncertainty around institutional participation, and support products such as managed-account or prime-brokerage offerings. Furthermore, the draft’s provisions for self-custody and non-custodial infrastructure suggest that software developers and node operators would not automatically be regulated as financial institutions, a detail that provides clarity for those building on the XRPL ecosystem. The legislation arrives at a moment of important market dynamics. A recent report by CoinShares noted that investment products focused on digital assets recorded over $1 billion in outflows last week. In contrast, XRP was one of the few assets to register $28.2 million in inflows, bucking the broader trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, as trading venues prepare for the launch of spot XRP ETFs and regulatory agencies resume full operations following the U.S. government shutdown , the timing of legislative clarity could be pivotal. The bill, however, remains at the discussion-draft stage and will require negotiation, amendment, and passage before becoming law. Why This Development Matters For market participants, the draft bill signals a major step toward legally defining and stabilizing the regulatory environment for digital assets. By clarifying that tokens such as XRP may fall under commodity rather than securities classification, the legislation could reduce legal risk for issuers, exchanges, and institutional investors. This regulatory clarity can increase confidence in listing decisions, ease the creation of new investment products, and mark a shift toward more structured oversight. For Ripple and its token ecosystem, the draft presents a scenario in which its long-standing position becomes codified in federal law, a transition from legal dispute toward potential legislative alignment. Although the draft represents considerable progress, it is not yet final. The document is still labelled a “discussion draft,” meaning it is subject to change and requires additional stakeholder feedback, committee mark-ups, and eventual full-chamber votes. The pace of passage will depend on the broader legislative calendar, agency readiness, and political dynamics surrounding digital-asset regulation. Observers believe that if the bill advances, the combined effect of institutional inflows, ETF launches, and regulatory certainty could significantly alter the trajectory for XRP and similar assets.

54367344,627185,1763078458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54367344.jpeg,"If The Dogecoin Price Successfully Breaks This Zone, Then Prepare For A Strong Upward Push",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-upward-push/,"The Dogecoin price has spent the past few days attempting to recover from a decline that has affected the entire industry for weeks, shifting from a clear downtrend earlier in the month into a more constructive structure. After dipping below the $0.16 region, buyers began stepping back in to form a series of higher lows and nudging the price into a tighter range between $0.17 and $0.186. The latest candles show Dogecoin trading just beneath a resistance band around $0.186, which is the same zone that capped upside attempts throughout the week. This is where the discussion from BitGuru’s technical outlook comes in, supported by the chart he shared on the social media platform X. Dogecoin Price Trying To Rebound From Downtrend The Dogecoin price is starting to exhibit some sort of push off the early-month lows that saw it reach into the mid-$0.15 region. Between November 5 and 6, Dogecoin was consolidating around this region to create what looks like a bullish beauty, as shown in the price chart below. The chart further shows how the Dogecoin price eventually broke out of this descending structure on November 7 to push toward the mid-$0.18 region. This marked the first sign that momentum was shifting away from sellers, and this might set a sustained advance that changes the tone of Dogecoin’s price action. That transition from lower highs into a more aggressive upward slope set the foundation for the rebound now taking shape. However, Dogecoin is now pressing against an overhead resistance zone around $0.186 that first arose as a result of a downtrend order block on November 2. Technical analysis shows that this price level is now the most important barrier to break. The chart shows a tight cluster of candles forming just beneath this level, with small intraday rejections but no meaningful breakdowns. Price action in this region carries a clear message: bulls are attempting to reclaim control, and the structure is beginning to resemble a pre-breakout consolidation. Dogecoin Price Chart. Source: BitGuru On X A Break Above This Zone Could Set Off Strong Rally The critical question now for Dogecoin’s short-term technical outlook is whether it can push cleanly above the resistance at $0.186. BitGuru’s outlook frames this zone as the key decision point. A strong break above it would open the door for continuation, setting the Dogecoin price up for the next impulsive leg higher above $0.2. Failure to break through would not necessarily derail the developing bullish structure, but it could invite a short-lived pullback before another attempt at an upward move. Everything now depends on how Dogecoin behaves at this price resistance, as momentum is clearly building beneath it and a decisive breakout would shift the entire short-term outlook upward. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1764, up by 2.5% in the past 24 hours.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 00:00:58

Today marks a pivotal moment as Bitcoin options worth $4.1 billion are set to expire, potentially triggering significant price movements and opportunities for traders. What Are Bitcoin Options and Why Do They Matter? Bitcoin options are financial contracts giving holders the right to buy or sell BTC at a set price by a specific date. These Bitcoin options act as hedging tools or speculative instruments, influencing market sentiment. When large volumes expire, like today’s $4.1 billion, they can cause volatility as traders adjust positions. Data from Deribit shows a put/call ratio of 0.62, indicating more call options than puts. This suggests bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain price sits at $105,000, a level where most options would expire worthless, potentially stabilizing prices. How Could This Bitcoin Options Expiry Affect Prices? Major Bitcoin options expiries often lead to short-term price swings. Here’s what to watch for: Increased volatility as traders close or roll over positions Potential price pressure near the max pain level of $105,000 Liquidity shifts influencing Bitcoin’s immediate direction Moreover, Ethereum options worth $750 million expire simultaneously. Their put/call ratio of 0.64 and max pain at $3,500 could amplify overall market effects. Therefore, monitoring both assets is crucial. What Actionable Insights Can Traders Use? To navigate this event, consider these strategies. First, assess your risk tolerance, as Bitcoin options expiry often spikes volatility. Second, watch key support and resistance levels, like the $105,000 max pain point. Finally, diversify to mitigate sudden moves. Historical data shows that post-expiry, markets frequently stabilize. Thus, long-term investors might view dips as buying opportunities. However, always use stop-loss orders to protect gains. Conclusion: Seize the Moment in Crypto Markets In summary, today’s Bitcoin options expiry is a landmark event with $4.1 billion at stake. By understanding the mechanics and staying informed, you can turn potential chaos into calculated advantage. Embrace the volatility, but prioritize risk management to thrive. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin options expiry? It’s when options contracts mature, requiring holders to exercise or let them expire, often affecting prices. How does the put/call ratio influence markets? A ratio below 1, like 0.62, signals more calls, hinting at bullish expectations among traders. What is max pain price in options? It’s the price where most options expire worthless, potentially reducing volatility post-expiry. Should I trade during options expiry? Only if experienced, as high volatility can lead to quick gains or losses; beginners should observe. Do Ethereum options expiries impact Bitcoin? Yes, correlated markets mean large ETH events can influence BTC through overall sentiment shifts. Where can I track options data? Platforms like Deribit provide real-time updates on volumes, ratios, and expiry details. Found this guide helpful?

But that hasn’t stopped everyone from trying to piece together what the hell’s really going on. This new round is supposedly an add-on to the $10 billion raise previously reported back in September, when insiders said xAI was already sitting on a $200 billion valuation. If true, that would shove the AI startup right alongside other massive players like Anthropic and OpenAI, both of which have recently pulled in eye-watering sums in their quest to dominate the foundational model arms race. xAI struggles with Tesla connections, power struggles, and that Memphis mess CNBC’s report had claimed that the new cash was gonna be earmarked for the usual suspects: GPUs. A huge portion of that alleged $15 billion is said to be going straight into the pockets of chipmakers, to buy up the graphic processing units needed to fuel xAI’s data-thirsty algorithms, you know, just like every other nerd in this brutal AI race. That’s not all xAI has going on, as it isn’t just sipping the same Kool-Aid as Tesla, it’s basically drinking straight from the jug. The two are tangled up in more ways than one. Newer Tesla vehicles have xAI’s Grok chatbot baked right into their infotainment systems. Yeah, the same Grok that’s been slammed left and right for spewing inaccurate junk and even worse, pumping out antisemitic trash and other hate speech. And that’s not the end of it. xAI recently launched Grokipedia, an encyclopedia-style platform that was clearly aiming to take on Wikipedia. Instead, it turned into yet another magnet for misinformation and chaos, triggering backlash across the board. Behind the scenes, the financial relationship between Tesla and xAI goes deeper than just software, according to CNBC’s report , which also said that xAI has invested “tens of millions” on Tesla’s energy storage systems, particularly for use at those questionable data centers in Memphis; that’s the battery packs on one hand, and carbon-spewing turbines on the other. Bit of a confusing strategy if you ask anyone who thought Elon was still pushing a green revolution. Safe to say that boat sailed a long time ago. Elon’s side-hustle AI firm has already stirred plenty of controversy with its sudden, aggressive buildout of data centers in Memphis. The facilities, massive and power-hungry, are powered by natural gas turbines. You read that right. Fossil fuels. And researchers in the area have been sounding the alarm about emissions and their impact on the city’s already sketchy air quality. Proxy drama, rejected deals, and a $1 trillion question Last week’s Tesla shareholder meeting stirred the pot even more. As Cryptopolitan extensively reported, investors were asked to vote on two key issues: a proposed investment by Tesla into xAI, and Elon’s monster CEO pay plan, which could eventually net him close to $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares—if, and only if, the company hits some pretty intense milestones. The pay plan passed, obviously. But the xAI investment? Not so much. The board didn’t get enough support to go through with it. Now Tesla’s legal team is apparently weighing “next steps,” as Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, said during the meeting. Which really just means that this weird corporate entanglement between the car company and the AI startup is not ending any time soon. And just to throw more gasoline on the fire, remember: xAI acquired X (formerly known as Twitter) in March, in an all-stock deal valued at $33 billion. That decision locked all three of Elon’s worlds (social, automotive, and AI) into a tight, messy knot that no one’s entirely sure how to untangle. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

For Hedera, it’s the entrance of one of the most trusted digital assets in the world. For Bitcoin holders, it has opened up a way for them to ultimately interact with complex financial applications without having to give up the safety and value of BTC. Many in the industry view it as a significant step toward expanding Bitcoin’s presence in decentralized finance (DeFi). The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has been excluded from most of these systems due to limitations on its main blockchain related to smart contracts. Bringing WBTC onto Hedera flips that script and gives a new use case to Bitcoin. WBTC is, in fact, the most popular and largest 1:1 BTC tokenized representation on all regulated custodian storage. Any WBTC can also be redeemed at any time for regular Bitcoin. This can be somewhat comforting to those concerned with maintaining trust, as they know their wrapped asset isn’t a synthetic or algorithmic form of their native asset – it’s backed and fully redeemable at any time against real BTC reserves held by a regulated custodian. By enabling WBTC to utilize Hedera, BTC holders can now leverage smart contract capabilities without having to sell the asset or transfer it to more risky protocols. They can lend it, stake it, trade with it, and provide liquidity in a decentralized protocol, all while being exposed to Bitcoin’s underlying value. Hedera is also seeking to add liquidity to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. More liquidity means more activity, more developers, and more options for users. It is an extremely strong vote of confidence from the largest participants in the digital-asset markets that Hedera is going to be one of the leading places for decentralized finance. Hedera enhances DeFi capabilities with wrapped Bitcoin BitGo , the primary custodian underpinning WBTC and a member of the Hedera Council, supported the launch. BiT Global and LayerZero also participated, offering additional support for cross-chain interconnections. Hedera advertises itself as a quick, cost-effective network with predictable fees. Its consensus mechanism is also designed to prevent frontrunning and miner-extractable value (MEV), two issues that can harm users on other blockchains. With WBTC going live on Hedera, Bitcoin holders can wrap their BTC and utilize it across the smart-contracting platforms of Hedera. This facilitates lending and borrowing, trading, liquidity provision, and many other DeFi tricks. Hedera has been gaining traction in DeFi over the past year. Its total value locked (TVL) has increased, and the network has attracted more developers, as well as institutional partners. It is still perceived as one of the larger digital currencies by market cap, even based on the market value of its native token, HBAR. DeFi Bitcoin gains foothold around the world The addition of WBTC on Hedera is also indicative of a broader trend in the space. Bitcoin is no longer viewed solely as a long-term store of value; it’s also increasingly being considered an asset that can support its own financial ecosystem. Supporters of the industry builders argue that they are foolish to sit on all that money. Rather, they envision a system in which BTC can be deployed as a productive asset to lend against, stake with, and trade through – without sacrificing its bedrock identity. At several industry events, it was emphasized that Bitcoin DeFi aims to establish a trustless and permissionless financial layer beyond the scope of Bitcoin. This vision views BTC as collateral and capital, the foundation of a global open finance system. Major exchanges have even flagged “BTCFi” as a trend to watch heading into the medium- and long-term, asserting that this could boost Bitcoin adoption. The listing of WBTC on Hedera could boost the network’s DeFi activity by introducing new users and increasing liquidity. It may incentivize the creation of more tools and financial products that focus on Bitcoin on Hedera as well.

The Altcoin Season Index has climbed to 29, marking a significant step toward what could become a full-blown altcoin season. This upward movement signals growing strength among alternative cryptocurrencies compared to Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial market indicator that measures whether Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies are performing better. Created by CoinMarketCap, this index provides valuable insights into market dynamics. When the index approaches 100, it indicates a strong altcoin season where most major alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Currently sitting at 29 points, the index has gained one point since yesterday. This gradual increase suggests that altcoins are slowly gaining ground against the crypto giant. However, we’re still far from the official altcoin season threshold of 75. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? The calculation methodology for the Altcoin Season Index follows specific rules that ensure accurate market representation. The index analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding: Stablecoins Wrapped coins Other pegged assets For an official altcoin season declaration, 75% of these qualifying assets must outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 29 indicates we’re approximately one-third of the way toward this benchmark. Why Should Investors Care About This Movement? The rising Altcoin Season Index matters because it often precedes significant market shifts. Historical data shows that when the index begins climbing steadily, it frequently leads to increased altcoin dominance. This pattern presents potential opportunities for investors looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin. However, caution remains essential. The current Altcoin Season Index level suggests we’re in early stages rather than full altcoin season. Market conditions can change rapidly, so thorough research remains crucial before making investment decisions. What Does the Future Hold for Altcoin Markets? While the Altcoin Season Index increase to 29 shows positive momentum, several factors could influence future movements. Market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological advancements all play roles in determining whether this trend will continue. Investors should monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly alongside other market indicators. This comprehensive approach provides better context for understanding overall market health and potential investment opportunities. Key Takeaways from the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading The recent Altcoin Season Index movement to 29 points offers valuable insights for crypto market participants. The gradual upward trend suggests growing altcoin strength, though we remain below the official season threshold. This period represents a crucial observation window for investors monitoring market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. It tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies excluding stablecoins and wrapped assets. What does an index score of 29 mean? A score of 29 indicates that altcoins are gaining momentum but haven’t reached official altcoin season status, which requires a score of 75 or higher. How often does the index update? The index updates regularly, with the recent change showing a one-point increase from the previous day’s reading. What triggers an altcoin season? Altcoin season occurs when 75% of top altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days, signaling broader market rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Should I invest based on the index alone? No, the index should be one of many factors considered alongside fundamental analysis, market conditions, and personal investment strategy. How reliable is this indicator? While useful for market sentiment, the index works best when combined with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. Found this analysis helpful?

According to a blog posted on Thursday, the company detected the campaign in mid-September 2025, after observing abnormal behavior tied to its Claude Code tool. Anthropic is convinced without the shadow of a doubt that the espionage operation was run by a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group and involved infiltrating around thirty high-value targets, including major tech companies, banks, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies across several countries. A few of those attacks succeeded. What made this different from past cyber campaigns wasn’t just who was behind it, but how it was executed. Roughly 80 to 90 percent of the entire attack was run by AI, with human operators stepping in only for a handful of key decisions, says Anthropic. Hackers jailbroke Claude and made it think it was doing legit work The attackers started by building an automated attack framework around Claude Code, Anthropic’s own AI model, and tricked it into thinking it was employed by a cybersecurity company conducting internal testing. They broke Claude’s safety filters through jailbreaking, a tactic that let them bypass built-in protections by feeding the AI small, context-free tasks that looked harmless on their own. Claude didn’t know it was being used for offensive operations because it wasn’t given the full picture at any point. Once the model was in use, the operation moved fast. Claude scanned each target’s network, identified the most sensitive parts of the infrastructure, and summarized the layout for the human operators. Then, it began hunting for vulnerabilities in those systems. Using its built-in coding capabilities, Claude wrote custom exploit code, identified weak points, and retrieved login credentials. It then pulled large volumes of internal data, organized it based on how valuable it might be, and flagged high-access accounts. After the AI gained admin-level control, it created backdoors that gave ongoing access to the compromised systems. And when it was done, Claude wrote up detailed reports of everything it had done (listing usernames, breached systems, and credentials) so the attack framework could use that info for future operations. Although Claude was extremely efficient, it wasn’t flawless. Sometimes it made up passwords or misidentified public data as sensitive. But those glitches were rare, and they didn’t slow down the overall mission. The sheer speed of the AI’s execution, processing thousands of requests per second, put it far ahead of anything a human team could pull off. AI agents now do the work of elite hacker squads—with almost no people involved This campaign is a turning point because it shows how much AI has advanced in just one year. Claude was literally out here running loops, making decisions, and chaining together complex sequences without direct orders. This AI model used tools from the Model Context Protocol, giving it access to external software like password crackers, network mappers, and data retrievers that used to be controlled only by human hands. The Claude system now understands complex instructions, writes exploit code on its own, and manages sophisticated cybersecurity operations with very little guidance. These AI agents aren’t just assisting hackers, they are the hackers. And they’re getting more capable by the day. After discovering the breach, Anthropic immediately began a ten-day investigation, banning the malicious accounts one by one. They alerted the affected organizations, worked with authorities to pass on intel, and expanded their detection systems to catch similar operations moving forward. But the company isn’t pretending this is a one-time problem. The team says these attacks will only become more common, and easier to pull off. That’s because the skills needed to run them are no longer restricted to elite hackers. If someone can jailbreak a model and plug it into the right toolset, they could carry out a massive campaign without needing a team or even deep technical knowledge. Anthropic warns of escalating threats as AI models evolve beyond human oversight The implications are massive, because if teams without deep funding or technical skills can launch nation-scale attacks using automated AI systems, the dystopia is certainly upon us. Anthropic’s Threat Intelligence team warns that while they only tracked the activity through Claude, it’s likely that similar abuse is happening on other frontier AI models. They say this is the beginning of a new standard in cyberwarfare. So why keep releasing models with these capabilities, you wonder? Well Anthropic argues that these same tools are essential for defense, saying that “the AI that carried out the attack was also the same kind used by Anthropic’s analysts to dig through the wreckage, find patterns, and understand the operation’s full scale.” They did promise to improve their models’ internal safety layers though, as well as refine their classifiers for attack detection, and openly publish case studies like this so others in the industry can prepare. Still, Anthropic says it’s not enough to rely on them alone. They’re urging all devs working on large models to invest heavily in safety. And they’re calling on cybersecurity teams to start integrating AI into threat detection, incident response, vulnerability scans, and Security Operations Center automation, because traditional methods aren’t fast enough anymore.

The release lands as a bundle of 11 updates and more than 150 refinements across banking, Bitcoin, commerce and peer-to-peer features. The update focuses on making money movement faster, cheaper and more intuitive in the app. For Bitcoin, Cash App now lets eligible users pay over the Lightning Network in seconds and with no fee, using either BTC or a USD balance after scanning a Lightning QR code. That routing choice means people can tap Lightning speed without needing to hold Bitcoin. Cash App Adds Bitcoin Map and Prepares Stablecoin Transfers for Everyday Use The app also introduces Bitcoin Map, an in-app directory that helps customers find nearby Square merchants and other businesses that accept Bitcoin. Users can locate a store, get directions, and pay directly over Lightning at checkout. Stablecoins are coming next. Cash App said eligible customers will soon be able to send and receive dollar-linked tokens inside the app, giving users a low-friction rail for moving digital dollars alongside BTC. We’ve been busy making some updates at Cash App, all with you in mind Cash App Green – Turn everyday spending into status Borrow – Bridge the gap between payday and bill pay for a flat fee Moneybot – Intuitive, personalized AI money management Afterpay on Cash… — Cash App (@CashApp) November 13, 2025 These steps align with Jack Dorsey’s long-standing Bitcoin thesis, that open protocols should power everyday payments. Cash App already made BTC buying mainstream for millions, and Lightning support pushes that view deeper into point-of-sale and peer-to-peer flows. Cash App Taps AI and Crypto to Build Faster, Smarter and More Open Payment Rails Under the hood, the company also refreshed navigation with AI-driven prompts and rolled out a more flexible benefits program for banking features. The most significant change for crypto users is faster, more flexible transfers via Bitcoin and stablecoins. The timing follows strong crypto engagement in Block’s results. Last week, the company reported nearly $2b in Bitcoin revenue during the third quarter, part of $6.11b in total revenue, with net income of $461.5m and double-digit gross profit growth led by Cash App. For merchants, Lightning acceptance through Square and discovery through Bitcoin Map could bring incremental foot traffic, while stablecoins add a treasury-friendly settlement choice for those who prefer dollars. For consumers, the mix of Lightning and stablecoins offers two clear benefits, near-instant payments and predictable value. Paying with BTC becomes faster and cheaper, while sending a stablecoin avoids price swings when moving funds. With President Trump’s administration leaning into a friendlier posture on digital assets, the policy backdrop adds momentum. If volumes follow, Cash App’s new rails could widen the gap between crypto-curious wallets and truly crypto-native money apps.

Shareholders are citing a quick pace in its pre-sale and a roadmap that appears to be prepared to go live. Most of the bigger coins are entangled in lateral designs, however, this new-found initiative is gaining traction among the inventors, and the opportunity may not be more fortuitous than now to identify the next big crypto. Presale Acceleration and Community Growth The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has witnessed an increase in popularity as a rather silent beginning in early 2025, becoming one of the most discussed activities among cryptocurrency traders. The token was introduced at a price of $0.01 and has gone up to reach the current Phase 6 level of $0.035. It is an increase of 2.5x, clean of what it started being. The presale has shifted to the next level and this has increased the demand. The allocation of phase 6 has now gone beyond 86% and indicators suggest that it might end up closing way ahead than projected. Behind the presale, there is good activity that is projected by the numbers. Mutuum Finance has already collected 18.6M and has 17,900 holders. Accessibility is another factor that is driving demand. Recently Mutuum Finance allowed making direct card payments without any purchase limits. This has ensured that large buyers can come in fast without any hustle which has ensured Phase 6 is even further accelerated and more visible. What Mutuum Finance Is Assembling Mutuum Finance is creating a dual lending framework that will cater to the needs of borrowers and lenders in an automated and clean platform. The system is based on the use of mtTokens which update in real time to indicate interest earned on assets provided. This provides the visual understanding of what their yield is, and avoids the manual claiming or complex interfaces. It also has a revenue-based demand loop on the token. Part of the proceeds of the lending activity is spent on buying MUTM on the open market. Open market buying of MUTM is recapitalized to users that place their mtTokens as guarantees on the safety module. This process directly connects usage to token demand and establishes long-term incentive correspondence. Security is addressed early. Mutuum Finance underwent a CertiK audit with 90/100 score on Token Scan. There is a $50k bug bounty that can be raised to report a vulnerability in the code and it indicates that the team takes the issue of security building before the protocol is launched seriously. Long-Term Vision This is one of the biggest aspects of the roadmap of Mutuum Finance that comprises their own stablecoin. The interest charged on borrowing would go to the treasury, which would establish a permanent flow of revenue of the platform. A lending ecosystem is anchored by stablecoins, and they should be present to result in more use in volatile market situations. This may appeal to the users that want a more certain borrowing and lending process. According to the argument of analysts who have reviewed the roadmap of MUTM, the possibility of the stablecoin integration could be one of the factors that will push the token up after the platform becomes available. There are models that indicate that the current presale price may move 3x-5x in the event of adoption building and the demand of the stablecoins increases as high as activity. Price support will be facilitated by Oracles over supported assets. The Chainlink-style data feeds used by Mutuum Finance will ensure that collateral is safely valued in the event of fallback sources and aggregated pricing systems. A strong oracle environment eliminates errors in liquidation and secures the end user in times of huge fragmentation. Whale Interest and Fast Allocation The turning point is nearing. The official X channel of the Mutuum Finance assured that the V1 will be deployed to the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This version will consist of the Liquidity Pool, the mtTokens, Debt Tokens and the Liquidator Bot, initially supported with the ETH and the USDT. A proper launch window would provide investors with a tangible roadmap to follow. The rising excitement is highlighted by the speed of Phase 6. Big allocations, commonly termed as whale allocations have been realized, a good indicator in any presale. Large buyers will come to the projects where some credible progress is evident and there is an actual utility. Their involvement usually attracts additional interest from small investors. The leaderboard with 24-hour interaction also makes the engagement high. It gives the highest contributor per day an incentive of $500 in MUTM, which enhances competition and constant activity. Together with rapid distribution, security and public release environment, these elements mark Mutuum Finance as one of the most suitable crypto opportunities to the end of Q4 2025. Final Outlook The development of MUTM, as it came out of $0.01 to $0.035 has brought about heads. The key element of its increasing traction is a well-operating lending protocol, a stablecoin program, well-designed oracle architecture, audited software and high presale volumes. With whale interest attaining unprecedented levels and Phase 6 set to become a reality in the near future, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself to become the project that many expect to become the next project to break out in the DeFi space.

The recent announcement of SHIB’s integration with Unity Nodes has sparked a wave of excitement across the crypto sector as the project takes a major step toward real-world applicability. This move strengthens Shiba Inu’s position in decentralized infrastructure and demonstrates that community-driven tokens can evolve into sophisticated ecosystems with real utility. The Unity Nodes partnership allows SHIB to tap into distributed computing solutions and real-world data operations, expanding the token’s reach far beyond its meme origins. According to project contributors, the integration enables new forms of network participation, data processing and on-chain automation that could open the door to entirely new sectors. Investors have praised the move as SHIB’s clearest sign yet that the project intends to build functional use cases that go beyond hype and speculation. But while SHIB expands into real-world utility, another project is climbing the ranks and capturing the attention of long-term investors. RentStac , a platform focused on tokenized real estate and real-world yield, has emerged as one of the most promising players in the rapidly growing RWA (Real World Assets) ecosystem. As markets mature, many investors are beginning to complement speculative holdings like SHIB with more grounded, revenue-generating assets. RentStac is benefiting heavily from this shift, becoming a recurring name in conversations around the future of sustainable crypto income. The parallel rise of SHIB’s technological expansion and RentStac’s RWA positioning highlights how diverse the crypto market has become. On one side, innovative utility projects are proving that blockchain can power real infrastructure. On the other, real-world asset platforms like RentStac are proving that blockchain can create stable, income-driven opportunities tied to physical value. Together, they show how the market is moving toward a more balanced, mature ecosystem. SHIB’s integration with Unity Nodes marks a critical point in its evolution. By tapping into a network that supports decentralized computing, Shiba Inu moves closer to enabling applications in data processing, IoT integration and on-chain automation. These capabilities give SHIB developers new tools to build services that interact with the physical world, from data verification to distributed applications requiring real-time connectivity. Community members see this as the strongest utility step since the creation of Shibarium. The announcement fits into a broader demand for projects that connect blockchain networks with real-world systems. As more industries experiment with decentralized computing and Web3 infrastructure, tokens that support or benefit from these networks see rising relevance. SHIB’s ability to expand in this direction shows that it is entering a phase of functional development rather than remaining purely symbolic or speculative. Yet, even with strong developmental moves, SHIB still operates primarily as a growth-oriented asset. Its value cycles depend heavily on adoption, sentiment and user participation. This has naturally led many investors to seek balance in their portfolios, often looking for additional opportunities that offer stability and predictable performance. RentStac stands out as one of the leading options in this category. RentStac’s appeal stems from its simple but powerful model: connecting digital tokens to real estate income. Instead of relying on speculative market demand, RentStac generates yield from rental properties acquired through structured legal entities. These properties produce real cash flow, and the resulting income is distributed to token holders transparently through blockchain technology. For investors who want predictable returns without losing exposure to the crypto economy, RentStac offers an attractive blend of tradition and innovation. What sets RentStac apart is the emphasis on transparency and real-world verification. While many crypto projects talk about utility, RentStac directly anchors its token to real economic activity. Every part of the system, from property acquisition to revenue distribution, is documented, tracked and recorded on-chain. This lets users see where value comes from instead of relying on complex tokenomics or promises of future development. The rise of real-world asset projects has been one of the defining themes of 2025. Traditional institutions are exploring tokenized bonds, commodities and real estate as blockchain infrastructure becomes more efficient. RentStac has benefited from this trend by positioning itself as a clear, accessible entry point for everyday users to participate in real-estate yield without requiring large capital or complicated management. As a result, it has become one of the most talked-about RWA projects of the year. The contrast between SHIB and RentStac is not a conflict but a reflection of how nuanced crypto investing has become. SHIB’s evolving infrastructure demonstrates innovation, community energy and technological ambition. RentStac embodies stability, real-world grounding and consistent income. Together they represent the two sides of the modern crypto economy: high-growth potential and dependable yield. Investors are seeing the advantage of combining these worlds. As SHIB expands deeper into utility networks like Unity Nodes, it strengthens its long-term relevance. But unpredictable cycles still affect its market behavior. RentStac, meanwhile, focuses on providing stable rental income tied to a tangible asset class that traditionally performs well across economic conditions. This combination is proving appealing to investors who want to embrace the upside of innovation without exposing their entire portfolios to volatility. The Unity Nodes partnership marks a major point of progress for Shiba Inu, but it also highlights a broader shift happening across the market. Utility alone no longer defines success in crypto. Investors want value that can be measured, verified and trusted. That is why RentStac’s traction continues to grow as it delivers something crypto has historically lacked: predictable, real-world-backed returns. What makes RentStac particularly compelling is how well it fits into the narrative of tokenization becoming the next major crypto trend. As more industries bring assets on-chain, platforms that started early and built strong legal structures will likely become leaders. RentStac’s approach, which prioritizes compliance, transparency and property-backed yield, positions it as a serious contender in this expanding sector. As SHIB moves into real-world integration and RentStac strengthens its RWA foundation, the crypto market is showing signs of a long-term transformation. Speculation is no longer the primary driver of adoption. Practicality, proof of value and sustainable income are becoming major themes. SHIB’s Unity Nodes expansion demonstrates how tokens can influence real infrastructure systems. RentStac shows how blockchain can improve traditional investment models. Both represent the next era of crypto development, where usefulness and stability coexist rather than compete. Whether the market is seeking innovation, stability or a balance of both, SHIB and RentStac stand out as central players in the next phase of the industry. As crypto continues to evolve, the combination of real-world integration and real-world yield could define the portfolios of the future.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-14 01:00:00

Despite a sharp rally over the past year, some analysts argue that XRP remains undervalued compared to its expanding use in cross-border settlements and digital asset liquidity. One such commentator, known as Pumpius, recently outlined a detailed analysis exploring several possible valuation paths for XRP, depending on adoption milestones. His argument rests on the idea that XRP should not be viewed purely as a speculative asset, but as a functional component of international liquidity systems. He maintains that the token’s long-term price trajectory will be determined by transactional demand rather than investor sentiment. Ripple’s Banking License and Regulatory Expansion Pumpius’ first scenario centers on Ripple’s pursuit of a national trust bank charter in the United States, a process initiated in mid-2025. The proposed entity, based in New York, would serve as a limited-purpose trust bank specializing in custody and blockchain infrastructure services. HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED? What’s the true price potential of XRP if adoption goes all the way? From banks to central banks, from corporations to capital markets and beyond into genomic identity. Here’s the ladder pic.twitter.com/TDWECRNRtB — Pumpius (@pumpius) September 6, 2025 If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) approves, Ripple could expand into regulated financial services, including stablecoin management, digital asset custody, and the tokenization of traditional instruments such as treasuries and bonds. According to the analysis, such approval could allow Ripple to handle settlement flows exceeding $500 billion annually, positioning XRP as a key liquidity vehicle within its ecosystem. Under these conditions, Pumpius projects that XRP could reach approximately $50 per token. The Corporate Treasury Integration Scenario A second projection focuses on large-scale corporate adoption. Pumpius suggests that if multinational corporations, such as Apple, Tesla, or Amazon, migrate portions of their treasury operations and supplier payments to the XRP Ledger, it could represent up to $5 trillion in annual transaction volume. While major corporations have not yet made such transitions, smaller firms have begun integrating XRP-related services into their operations. For instance, in 2025, VivoPower allocated $19 million of its capital raise to XRP staking through the Flare Network, and Trident Digital committed $500 million toward an XRP reserve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other firms, including Nature’s Miracle and Hyperscale Data, have followed suit, with total institutional commitments surpassing $1 billion by mid-year. Pumpius argues that if large-scale corporations adopt similar strategies, the token could potentially rise to $100, given its efficiency as a cross-currency settlement asset. Global Market Tokenization and Long-Term Outlook The final projection addresses XRP’s possible role in tokenizing traditional financial markets. Pumpius estimates that if assets such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds, worth over $100 trillion, were to migrate onto blockchain platforms like the XRP Ledger, liquidity demand would surge significantly. He asserts that such integration could drive XRP’s value above $100,000 per token, assuming it becomes the primary asset facilitating settlement across global capital markets. However, these figures are highly speculative. The analysis assumes extensive institutional and regulatory adoption that has yet to materialize. While the projections offer insight into the potential scale of blockchain-based finance, they remain theoretical. For now, XRP continues to operate as a bridge asset with expanding but still limited real-world usage, and any future valuation will depend on verifiable market adoption rather than projections.

Related Reading: Could Shiba Inu Triple? Analyst Sees 200% Move Coming According to on-chain data, a Satoshi-era wallet that had not moved funds for 13 years transferred roughly 12,000 BTC — about $1.4 billion at current prices — in a set of transactions that landed on an exchange ledger. Whale Moves Stir Markets Reports have disclosed that the transfers came as Bitcoin hovered near a key price band. The coin fell about 2% after the activity, a quick reaction as traders guessed the funds might be put up for sale. 🚨 BREAKING SATOSHI ERA WHALE JUST SOLD 12,000 $BTC AFTER 13 YEARS OF HODLING.

Others said the market’s mood was more nervous than panicked; large transfers often spark anxiety even when no immediate sale follows. Technical Pressure Around Resistance Prominent analyst Ted commented that Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance around $104,000–$105,000. According to his view, holding above $105,000 could encourage renewed buying and push prices toward $107,000. If that fails, he warned that the next clear support sits near $100,000. Traders will watch order books and exchange flows closely in coming sessions to see whether the transferred coins are converted to fiat or simply shifted between wallets. Long-Term Holders Take Profits Based on reports from Chris Kuiper, CFA, the broader selling pressure appears driven more by long-term holders than by panicked sellers. Kuiper pointed to the share of Bitcoin that has remained inactive for one year or longer. That metric usually climbs in slow markets and drops sharply during fast rallies. This time, the decline has been gradual. The pattern suggests steady profit-taking over time rather than a sudden exodus. “Who is selling?” Is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding #bitcoin‘s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying (by ETPs, corporations etc.) I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers). But one data point that gives… pic.twitter.com/9PVoolrtwm — Chris Kuiper, CFA (@ChrisJKuiper) November 12, 2025 Market observers say gradual sales fit a maturing market where older holders lock in gains without trying to time a perfect top. Where past cycles saw abrupt moves from large dormant wallets, the current trend looks more measured. That does not rule out short-term volatility, but it changes how traders interpret big transfers.

The scheme, uncovered by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and its Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), highlights how scammers are weaponizing legitimate systems to deceive victims with alarming precision. Scammers Fake Police Identity Using ReportCyber Data According to the AFP, fraudsters are submitting false reports through ReportCyber, Australia’s official cybercrime reporting tool , using stolen personal details such as phone numbers and email addresses. They then contact victims while posing as AFP officers, claiming the individual has been linked to a crypto-related investigation or data breach. Detective Superintendent Marie Andersson stated that the scheme is highly convincing because scammers use genuine-looking case numbers generated from the fraudulent submissions. “They verify personal information in ways that match common expectations and act quickly to create a sense of urgency,” she noted. In one case, scammers filed a fake report, then called the victim with a matching reference number and alleged that the individual’s name appeared in a cryptocurrency breach. A second caller, impersonating a crypto exchange representative, reinforced the deception and urged the victim to move funds into a “secure cold wallet.” Fortunately, the targeted user hung up before transferring any money. Police also warned that the criminals often spoof official AFP phone numbers to increase credibility. Authorities Urge Vigilance as Scam Activity Surges The AFP stressed that genuine officers will never ask for access to crypto wallets, seed phrases, account passwords, or banking details. Anyone contacted about a ReportCyber submission they did not file is urged to hang up immediately and call 1300 CYBER1. Despite the exploitation of third-party reporting features, officials emphasized that ReportCyber remains secure and continues to be a critical tool in tracking cybercriminals. Every legitimate report, they said, contributes to intelligence gathering and helps prevent future victims from being targeted. Authorities also highlighted that individuals aged 50–70 are disproportionately affected, especially when scams involve crypto ATMs, investment schemes, and social-engineering tactics. Australia Tightens Oversight as Crypto Scams Grow More Sophisticated The warning comes as Australia ramps up enforcement against crypto-related crime. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke recently announced sweeping powers to regulate crypto ATMs, labeling them “high-risk products” associated with money laundering and exploitation. Meanwhile, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has taken down more than 14,000 scam and phishing websites since 2023, including over 3,000 linked to crypto schemes. Regulators report that scammers are increasingly using AI-powered ads, fake exchanges, and impersonation attacks to lure victims. As cybercriminals refine their social-engineering tactics, authorities say vigilance is the strongest defense. “Australians should check for warning signs and protect themselves,” Andersson said. “If something feels off, it probably is.” Cover image from ChatGPT, ETHUSD chart from Tradingview",Crypto News|crypto|ETH|ETH Price|Ethereum|ethereum price|ethusd,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 01:00:59

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is taking a significant step toward establishing clear crypto transfer accounting standards. This potential move could revolutionize how companies report cryptocurrency transactions and bring much-needed clarity to the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. What Does FASB’s Crypto Transfer Accounting Review Mean for Businesses? The FASB’s upcoming discussion marks a pivotal moment for corporate cryptocurrency adoption. Currently, many companies struggle with inconsistent reporting methods for crypto transfers. The board will evaluate whether to add comprehensive crypto transfer accounting standards to its formal technical agenda. This review represents a crucial advancement beyond their 2023 accounting rule, specifically addressing when and how companies should remove crypto assets from their books after transfers. Why Is Standardized Crypto Transfer Accounting So Important? Clear crypto transfer accounting rules provide numerous benefits for businesses and investors alike: Consistent financial reporting across all companies Improved transparency for investors and stakeholders Reduced compliance risks and audit challenges Enhanced comparability between organizations Increased confidence in corporate cryptocurrency adoption Without standardized crypto transfer accounting practices, companies face significant challenges in properly valuing and reporting digital asset movements. This lack of clarity can lead to inconsistent financial statements and potential regulatory issues. How Will This Impact Current Crypto Accounting Practices? The FASB’s potential new crypto transfer accounting standards would build upon existing frameworks while addressing specific gaps in digital asset reporting. The review will particularly focus on derecognition criteria – determining exactly when a company should remove crypto assets from its balance sheet following transfers. This clarity is essential for proper financial reporting and audit compliance. Moreover, this initiative follows the recent addition of stablecoin accounting classification to the FASB’s agenda. Together, these projects demonstrate the board’s commitment to creating comprehensive digital asset accounting standards that keep pace with technological innovation. What Challenges Might Companies Face During Implementation? While standardized crypto transfer accounting brings numerous benefits, businesses should prepare for some implementation hurdles: Training accounting staff on new procedures Updating internal control systems Ensuring compliance across multiple jurisdictions Managing transition periods effectively Addressing technical complexities of blockchain transactions However, these challenges are manageable with proper planning and the long-term benefits of clear crypto transfer accounting standards far outweigh the temporary implementation difficulties. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Accounting Standards The FASB’s proactive approach to crypto transfer accounting signals a maturing regulatory landscape for digital assets. As cryptocurrency continues gaining mainstream acceptance, standardized accounting practices become increasingly crucial. This move could accelerate corporate cryptocurrency adoption by providing the financial reporting clarity that businesses and investors demand. Companies currently engaged in cryptocurrency transactions should monitor these developments closely. Early adoption of emerging crypto transfer accounting best practices can provide competitive advantages and demonstrate commitment to transparent financial reporting. Frequently Asked Questions What is the FASB’s role in cryptocurrency accounting? The Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for public companies in the United States. Their work on crypto transfer accounting aims to create standardized reporting methods for digital asset transactions. When will these new accounting standards take effect? The timeline depends on whether the project gets added to the formal agenda and subsequent development phases. Typically, new accounting standards undergo several rounds of review and public comment before final implementation. How will crypto transfer accounting differ from traditional asset accounting? Crypto transfer accounting must address unique aspects of digital assets, including blockchain verification, wallet transfers, and the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions that differ from traditional financial instruments. What should companies do to prepare for these changes? Businesses should document current crypto accounting practices, train accounting staff on blockchain basics, and establish robust internal controls for digital asset management while monitoring FASB developments. Will these standards apply to all types of cryptocurrencies? The initial focus will likely cover major cryptocurrencies with established markets, but the framework may evolve to include various digital assets as the standards develop and the market matures. How will this affect companies’ financial statements? Standardized crypto transfer accounting will provide clearer guidelines for balance sheet presentation, revenue recognition, and disclosure requirements related to cryptocurrency holdings and transactions.

Data shows that more than 149 million XRP, worth roughly $336 million, exited exchanges within a 24-hour window. The movement comes at a time when market conditions are somewhat choppy , yet accumulation trends appear to be strengthening as investors are likely adjusting positions ahead of a potential new source of demand. This potential new source of demand is the possible launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US this week. Massive XRP Outflows From Crypto Exchanges The latest exchange-reserve data captures a significant decline of millions of XRP on crypto exchanges in the past few days, placing total reserves across tracked platforms at approximately $6.63 billion as of November 13. Such sudden outflows can only be interpreted as a sign that investors are moving tokens into private storage rather than preparing to sell. The size of the withdrawal in recent days, more than two percent of available exchange supply, marks one of the more notable single-day reductions seen in recent months and has raised questions about where the liquidity is going. The reserve contraction is coincidental with rising anticipation around a possible Spot XRP ETF debuting this week. Canary Capital’s Form 8-A filing gives Nasdaq the framework to list the fund as early as November 13 once regulatory procedures are finalized. The prospect of an ETF has already become a focal point for traders, largely because similar developments for Bitcoin and Ethereum led to major inflows and surges in demand following approval. Even without a final green light, the setup alone appears to be influencing behavior on-chain, as whales and long-term holders position early in case a fresh wave of institutional interest begins to form. Can The Price React Positively? A drop in exchange reserves this large reduces the amount of XRP immediately available for trading and creates the conditions needed to increase buying pressure. Investors who move tokens off exchanges tend to have a longer time horizon, which naturally limits short-term sell pressure. If the ETF goes live on schedule and draws meaningful capital, the reduced supply on exchanges may intensify price reactions. Whether this translates into a sustained price uptrend depends on how much demand the ETF launch ultimately generates. Recent examples in the market include the steady inflows into the two Spot Solana ETFs in the US, which have attracted consistent demand since their launch. Even so, there is a growing belief among market watchers that a Spot XRP ETF could draw far deeper liquidity than its Solana counterparts, given the asset’s larger global footprint and institutional investors. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.50, up by 3.8% in the past twenty-four hours.",XRP|bitcoin|Canary Capital|Ethereum|Nasdaq|ripple|Spot Solana ETFs|Spot XRP ETF|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 02:00:04

Market participants are closely monitoring this condensed timeline, which could have significant implications for XRP adoption and liquidity. Upcoming ETF Review Schedule Key dates in the approval cycle include Canary Capital on November 13, Franklin Templeton from November 14 to 18, and Bitwise on November 19 and 20. CoinShares and 21Shares are scheduled between November 20 and 22, while Grayscale and WisdomTree are expected toward the end of the month. This sequence represents a concentrated review period for some of the largest names in the ETF industry. These firms collectively manage assets exceeding $1.5 trillion. Even modest allocations to XRP-focused products could materially affect the market, enhancing both liquidity and institutional credibility. Approval would signal regulatory acceptance and provide portfolio managers access to XRP in a fully compliant, brokerage-ready format. Implications for Market Accessibility and Liquidity ETF approval would expand XRP’s accessibility to institutional investors previously limited by mandate restrictions. Regulated inflows from these products would establish a more systematic approach to price discovery, reducing reliance on speculative market movements. Such inflows would also strengthen liquidity, supporting more efficient trading and settlement on the XRP Ledger. Moreover, integrating XRP into regulated investment frameworks mirrors the trajectory Bitcoin experienced following its spot ETF approvals. It would mark an important step in legitimizing the asset, positioning it as an allocation-ready instrument within traditional investment portfolios. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Influence on XRP Price Dynamics XRP’s price has faced downward pressure from declining moving averages and broader corrective trends. The introduction of institutional inflows through ETFs could shift this dynamic by creating predictable demand cycles. Payment volume on the XRP Ledger recently exceeded the billion-dollar mark, indicating robust network activity capable of supporting larger capital flows. Market observers suggest that even a single early ETF approval could change perceptions, potentially initiating a period of sustained institutional engagement. With multiple reviews occurring almost consecutively, November presents a significant opportunity for XRP to experience its first coordinated wave of regulated demand in years. While approvals are not guaranteed, the current schedule reflects the growing interest of institutional investors in XRP. If these ETFs are sanctioned, it would represent a notable development in the token’s integration into mainstream finance, increasing both visibility and credibility among portfolio managers and investors.

Fidelity Research Boss Breaks It Down,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whos-selling-bitcoin-fidelity-research-boss/,"Visible buying from spot bitcoin ETPs and corporates has not translated into decisive upside, leaving traders to ask a blunt question: who is supplying the market? For Chris Kuiper, CFA, vice president of research at Fidelity Digital Assets, the answer is clear. “ ‘Who is selling?’ is the number one question I’ve been getting regarding bitcoin’s continued price pressure against a backdrop of visible buying,” he wrote on X on November 12. “I’m not unique in suggesting it’s the long-term holders (or HODLers).” Kuiper points to a simple but powerful on-chain gauge: the percentage of outstanding bitcoin that has not moved for at least one year. Glassnode’s “Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years Ago” rises in bear markets as coins age in place and investors sit on unrealized losses, then typically falls sharply when bull markets let those same investors exit into strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Is Coming: Don’t Be Fooled By The Name “As you can see in the chart below, this line goes up during bear markets … and then usually a dramatic decline as these longer-term holders sell into the strength of a bull market,” Kuiper explained. What stands out to him today is that “with this cycle” the drawdown is “a relatively gentle slope down.” When bitcoin hit new highs earlier this year, the long-term-holder line “didn’t plunge,” he said. Instead, the market has been experiencing “a consistent slow bleed as the market has slowly moved sideways and up.” That slow bleed aligns with what Kuiper says he hears from the client side. “Bitcoin’s performance has recently lagged gold’s, even the S&P, and people are getting tired,” he wrote. Many investors, in his view, had been positioned for a textbook four-year cycle blow-off and were “waiting to sell into the historically strong seasonality of October and now November.” When October’s typical strength did not materialize and year-end approached, “long-term holders are looking to make year-end tax and positional changes, calling it a day with the gains they already have.” Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why The Glassnode chart shows how different this looks from past cycles. In the 2017–2018 run-up and subsequent reversal, the share of coins last active more than a year ago rolled over violently as price spiked and then collapsed. In the current cycle, the curve that represents long-term-holder supply has been trending lower since 2023, but without the vertical collapse normally associated with euphoric distribution. On-chain analyst Julio Moreno of CryptoQuant added another layer by reframing the same dynamic as “1-year inactive supply drawdown” in percentage points of total supply. “Here’s another way to visualize this,” he replied to Kuiper, “by looking at the 1-year inactive supply drawdown in terms of % of total Bitcoin supply.” Moreno quantified the last three major cycles. In 2017–2018, 1-year inactive supply declined by about 20 percentage points of total supply. In the 2021 cycle, the drawdown was around 10 percentage points. In the 2024–2025 period so far, the decline is again roughly 10 percentage points. The CryptoQuant chart, which uses an inverted scale, renders that as a purple wave that rises as more long-dormant coins are spent or reallocated. This means that long-term holders have already released a volume of supply comparable to the 2021 cycle, even if it is still well below the 2017–2018 peak. What differs is the tempo. Rather than a short burst of profit-taking at the top, the market has absorbed roughly a 10-percentage-point reduction in inactive supply over a longer, choppier price path. Kuiper welcomed the alternative visualization, replying simply: “Great chart!” He also made clear what he will be monitoring from here. “I will be watching this slope along with some other metrics to gauge seller exhaustion,” he said. For now, he argues that “the positive fundamental developments and lackluster price action continue to diverge.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,609.

A federal judge in Texas has ordered Apple and OpenAI to respond to allegations that the two companies conspired to reduce competition in emerging markets for artificial intelligence. U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman of the Northern District of Texas denied Apple and OpenAI’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit . In the written order, Pittman did not disclose his reasoning but ordered both sides to file additional filings explaining themselves. The ruling does not decide whether Musk’s companies will ultimately succeed. Instead, it allows the system of justice to do its job. This procedural victory enables XCorp to initiate the process of collecting evidence, taking witness depositions, and advancing to trial. Apple and OpenAI defend themselves XCorp and xAI argue that Apple’s decision to build OpenAI technology into iPhones and iPads is a move to lock them and other rivals out of major consumer distribution points for AI. The lawsuit argues that Apple’s moves leave OpenAI as the dominant player in mobile AI with a limited product offering, making it difficult for other companies to compete or attract customers. Musk’s companies argue that this agreement is a disaster for consumers, as it limits choice and restricts the development of new AI tools. They also argue that the partnership between Apple and OpenAI represents another unfair consolidation of power in a nascent industry, which could constrain global competition. In court papers, Apple rejected the claims as false and misleading. Its lawyers emphasised that an exclusive agreement with OpenAI did not bind the company, and that the company’s plans still included working with other developers in AI. They say that the iPhone has always been a multi-application platform, so consumers are not trapped into OpenAI’s choices; competition has always been free to coexist alongside it. OpenAI also responded in kind, calling the lawsuit a mere “instrument of Musk’s campaign of lawfare.” In a statement, the group mentioned Musk’s personal friendship and business ties to the outfit’s CEO, Sam Altman — they were co-banished from OpenAI over 10 years ago. OpenAI’s lawyers described the litigation as a meritless effort to settle old scores, rather than address any legitimate competitive concerns. OpenAI is independent, and any Apple product integration occurred as part of a legal business activity — once more, not the tentacles of a plot to suffocate the competition. Legal experts say both companies are involved in a broader fear of competition in the world of artificial intelligence, where market shares and strategic partnerships (and animosities among menageries of brainy people who work there) can often rub up against each other in ways that confound differences between competition and innovation, not to mention corporate behaviour at the digital technology’s bleeding edge. Court sets stage for next moves Now, both sides must file additional paperwork with the court. They will flesh them out more. If the case goes to trial, it could be months or even years before a final judgment is rendered. The case, XCorp. v.. Apple, 25-cv-00914, is being heard in the Fort Worth division of the Northern District of Texas. If Musk’s companies prevail, the ruling could alter the way Apple and OpenAI conduct business in the AI space. Competitors may be able to access markets more easily, and consumers may face a greater number of choices in AI products. The case highlights the growing tensions in the AI industry, and more broadly, as large tech companies strive to integrate their technologies into consumer products at an unprecedented pace. Cases like this one could help determine who sets the rules for AI in smartphones and beyond. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On-chain data showed that the project has initiated $2 million to $3 million daily buybacks since October 28th. Aster DEX has also repurchased more than 143.38 million ASTER tokens since the launch of its buyback initiative. Those tokens account for 7.11% of the network’s supply. Aster DEX funds its buyback program via protocol revenue and treasury . @Aster_DEX has executed $214.03M in total buybacks, with $2M-$3M daily buyback since Oct 28th. • 143.38M $ASTER tokens repurchased • 7.11% of circulating supply offset • Funded through protocol revenue and treasury continuous value return to holders pic.twitter.com/wg00hpBNxY — Tokenomist (@Tokenomist_ai) November 13, 2025 Aster’s current buyback lasted for 35 days until November 9, which allowed for the S3 airdrop to begin after the complete buyback. The tokens from the initiative will be prioritized for distribution, while any shortfall will be unblocked from the airdrop allocation pool to ensure full distribution. The decentralized exchange has funded its buyback program via its protocol revenue and treasury to ensure continuous value return to holders. It allocated 70-80% of its Season 3 (S3) trading fees to fund the buyback initiative and reward community participants through activities like trading volume and holding duration. The results of the program were released by the team after the conclusion of the S3 phase, with subsequent airdrops and buybacks coming in future seasons. The record buyback comes as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) purchased over $2 million ASTER tokens, triggering speculative demand. He also revealed that he’s not a trader but buys digital assets and holds. At the time of publication, ASTER’s price had dropped more than 4.6% in the past 24 hours to $1.09. The digital asset has surged by approximately 6.3% over the past 7 days but is down by about 21.33% over the past 30 days. ASTER had dropped by 11% during the October 10 market crash, with its total value locked also plummeting by nearly 25%. Crypto expert Peters predicted that the token could rise to $10 in response to the buyback initiative. Aster surged by 15% in response to CZ’s recent presidential pardon. Crypto analyst, Crypto Patel, compared ASTER’s growth potential to BNB. He argued that the token could become the next BNB within four to five years if its adoption continues climbing at the current pace. The analyst’s projections suggest that the token‘s current buyback program could ignite its next rally. On-chain data revealed that Aster’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped from its record $2.44 billion on October 10 to around $1.5 billion at the time of publication. On-chain data showed that the exchange’s average daily fee reached $1.75 million over the past seven days. Aster’s fees in the last 30 days reached $60 million, with its total fees amounting to $732.4 million. Aster DEX integrates new trading pairs Aster DEX has also integrated new trading pairs and boosts for tokens like HEMI and AT. The initiative was aimed at enhancing the exchange’s fee-generating activity during Stage 3. Aster DEX is also doubling down on buybacks in response to support token stability amid uncertain market conditions. Aster’s buyback amount surged by 50%, burning $7,500 every minute. Aster’s previous buyback campaign distributed $200,000 in ASTER tokens as rewards within days after launch. On-chain data shows that the project has also become a leader in DEX trading volume. The recent repurchase program incentivized the project’s users to reach particular trading volume and balance goals for both Spot and Perpetual accounts. The project had encountered problems after DeFiLlama delisted its trading volume data on October 5, prompting the launch of the buyback program. The analytics platform detected suspicious trading volumes that closely mirrored Binance’s. Co-founder Oxngmi noted that Aster’s data correlated almost perfectly with Binance’s perpetual pairs, including ETH/USDT and XRP/USDT. Aster’s removal resulted in short-term selling pressure, which caused a 10% drop in a single day. The exchange’s trading volume was relisted after weeks, reigniting concerns over transparency in decentralized markets and the growing influence of data platforms. Get seen where it counts.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.93 Market Cap $3.22B Trading Volume $415.13M Circulating Supply 540.62M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $6.61 24-h Low $5.70 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 40.96% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 59.47 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.28 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 15 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $5.15 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is stabilizing with an interim base forming around $5.80 as momentum cools. A break above $6.00 could trigger a recovery toward $6.40. If ICP loses support at $5.75 to the bears, traders can anticipate a further dip closer to $5. ICP 1-day price analysis As of November 14, ICP is trading around $5.909 after several days of steady retracement from $8.90. Today’s slight green candle hints at early stabilization, but the broader structure still reflects cooling momentum. The Bollinger Bands remain wide, showing that volatility from last week’s explosive move is still being absorbed. The price is currently sitting above the mid-band at $5.183, a long-standing support level that has not been broken in the past days. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in positive territory, though the histogram continues to shrink, which suggests the correction is still controlled and not indicative of a trend reversal. The Chaikin Money Flow at 0.07 indicates marginal inflows, enough to suggest that buyers are present but not aggressive. If ICP maintains close above $5.80–$5.90, it may begin forming a base for another attempt toward $6.50 and later $7.20. A drop below $5.50, however, would weaken this outlook and expose the mid-band support at $5.18, which becomes critical for preserving the recent uptrend. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP is trading around $5.887 after a consistent decline over the past sessions. The Alligator lines are all trending downward, indicating that the broader intraday structure remains bearish. However, the appearance of the recent green candles suggests market stabilization. The MACD remains in bearish territory, though the histogram is noticeably lighter, indicating weakening downward momentum. This fading bearish pressure supports the possibility that ICP could be building a short-term bottom around $5.75–$5.85. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A decisive break above $6.00 would mark the first meaningful sign of a rebound, opening the path toward $6.21 and eventually $6.40, where the blue Alligator jaw sits as strong resistance. If price loses $5.75 again, the structure becomes vulnerable, risking a deeper pullback toward $5.60 or even lower. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.87 BUY SMA 5 $6.53 SELL SMA 10 $6.64 SELL SMA 21 $4.89 BUY SMA 50 $4.28 BUY SMA 100 $4.65 BUY SMA 200 $5.15 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.99 BUY EMA 5 $4.67 BUY EMA 10 $4.60 BUY EMA 21 $4.78 BUY EMA 50 $5.04 BUY EMA 100 $5.23 BUY EMA 200 $5.80 BUY What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is stabilizing across both timeframes, with the daily chart showing a controlled pullback and the 4-hour chart forming a tentative base around $5.80. A break above $6.00–$6.06 could align both trends toward a recovery targeting $6.21–$6.40. On the other hand, a drop below $5.75 risks extending the correction closer to $5. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies. Please note that before you make an investment decision, seek independent professional consultation. Will Internet Computer reach $25?

Binance has made an important announcement that affects GAL token holders. The exchange will temporarily suspend Binance GAL deposits through the Ethereum ERC-20 network starting 3:00 a.m. UTC on the 19th. This development requires immediate attention from anyone using Binance for GAL transactions. What Does This Binance GAL Deposits Suspension Mean for You? When Binance suspends GAL deposits via ERC-20, it means you cannot send GAL tokens to your Binance wallet using the Ethereum network during this period. However, this only affects deposits – withdrawals and trading will continue normally. The suspension specifically targets the ERC-20 version of GAL tokens, so other deposit methods remain available. Why Would Binance Suspend GAL Deposits? Exchange maintenance and upgrades often prompt temporary suspensions. Common reasons include: Network security enhancements Wallet system updates Technical optimizations Compliance requirements These measures ensure your assets remain secure while improving platform functionality. The Binance GAL deposits suspension follows industry best practices for maintaining robust exchange infrastructure. How to Continue Your GAL Transactions During This Period While ERC-20 deposits pause, consider these alternatives for your Binance GAL deposits: Use other supported networks for GAL transfers Check Binance announcements for specific network alternatives Monitor official channels for restoration updates Plan transactions around the maintenance window What Every Crypto Trader Should Know About Network Suspensions Network suspensions are common in cryptocurrency exchanges. They demonstrate proactive platform management rather than indicating problems. The temporary nature of this Binance GAL deposits suspension means normal operations will resume after maintenance completion. Protecting Your Assets During Exchange Maintenance Always verify official announcements before making deposits. Double-check network compatibility and maintain backups of your transaction details. The Binance GAL deposits suspension serves as a reminder to stay informed about exchange updates. Looking Ahead: What to Expect After the Suspension Once Binance completes the maintenance, GAL deposits via ERC-20 will resume with potentially improved security and efficiency. The exchange typically provides clear communication about restoration timing through official channels. In summary, the temporary Binance GAL deposits suspension represents routine maintenance rather than cause for concern. By understanding the reasons and alternatives, traders can navigate this period smoothly while anticipating enhanced platform performance afterward. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the GAL deposit suspension last? Binance hasn’t specified an end date, but such suspensions typically last from a few hours to several days. Monitor official announcements for exact restoration timing. Can I still withdraw GAL tokens during this period? Yes, withdrawals remain operational. Only deposits via ERC-20 network are affected by this temporary suspension. Will this affect GAL token trading? No, GAL trading pairs will continue normally. The suspension only impacts deposits through the specified network. Are my existing GAL tokens safe on Binance? Absolutely. Your stored GAL tokens remain secure in your Binance wallet. The suspension only affects new deposits. What alternative networks can I use for GAL deposits? Check Binance’s deposit page for available network options.

This yield-bearing stablecoin offers multiple advantages for crypto enthusiasts. First, it provides a safe haven during market fluctuations, as the peg ensures stability. Second, the built-in yield mechanism means your assets work for you without active management. Additionally, integration into Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem allows for seamless use in lending, borrowing, and trading. Are There Any Challenges to Consider? While promising, this yield-bearing stablecoin faces hurdles. Regulatory scrutiny on real-world assets could impact growth.

54372266,https://cryptonews.com/?p=451851,1763088792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54372266.jpeg,OCC Urged to Reject Sony Bank’s Effort to Join the Crypto Banking Sector,https://cryptonews.com/news/sony-bank-crypto-plan-challenged-us-banking-lobby/,"A leading US banking group has urged regulators to stop Sony Bank’s crypto venture, warning against its plan for a national trust that would issue a dollar-pegged stablecoin . Sony stunned markets last month when its banking arm filed to form Connectia Trust , a federally chartered institution that would issue a $1-backed stablecoin, manage the reserves behind it, and provide digital asset custody and management. If approved, Sony would join a short list of major firms seeking national digital bank status, alongside Coinbase, Circle, Paxos, Stripe and Ripple. In a Nov. 6 letter to the OCC, the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) said it “strongly opposes” Sony Bank’s application and argued the proposal leans on an impermissible reading of trust bank powers. Group Accuses Sony Of Seeking Bank Benefits Without Obligations Further, the group warned that customers could confuse a stablecoin with a bank deposit, even though national trust banks are barred by statute from taking deposits. Sony has filed with the @USOCC to create Connectia Trust, a national crypto bank set to issue a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin #Sony #Stablecoin #OCC https://t.co/6vGJud8E7W — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 ICBA said trust charters exist for fiduciary work like estate planning and investment management, not for deposit-style products. It asked the OCC to reject the plan, warning it could mislead customers and create risks in a failure. The group said Connectia would “engage in the business of banking” without FDIC insurance or Community Reinvestment Act obligations, a structure it called an end run that captures the benefits of a bank charter without the full rulebook. ICBA added that Connectia would not have to reinvest in low and moderate-income communities, even as it could gather funds from them. Critics Say Sony’s Application Lacks Key Details On Reserves And Redemption On payments, ICBA pointed to the deposit-like functionality of stablecoins, which can move electronically, be spent at the point of sale, and be redeemed one-for-one for dollars, features it said mirror checking accounts that trust banks are not allowed to offer. The filing also raises Bank Holding Company Act issues, ICBA said, because national trust banks can escape holding-company supervision only if they meet strict conditions. The letter questioned whether Connectia’s non-fiduciary custody plans and potential payment features would satisfy those tests, a failure that could pull Sony’s corporate parents into bank holding company regulation. Transparency became a second front. The public version of Sony’s application omits key details, ICBA said, including reserve composition, redemption mechanics in stress, the projected issuance scale, and contingency plans for runs or cyber events. It asked the OCC to demand a fuller business plan before any decision, arguing that approving under a veil of secrecy would set a poor precedent. Group Warns OCC Lacks Tools To Resolve Large Stablecoin Collapse ICBA also questioned whether the OCC could safely resolve Connectia if it failed. The agency has not appointed a receiver for an uninsured national bank since 1933, and its rules were written for traditional trust companies, not a large stablecoin issuer connected to volatile crypto markets and complex blockchain infrastructure. A run on a Connectia token could force rapid sales of Treasuries and spark broader stress, the letter said. Handing off crypto custody during a receivership would require coordinating key shards and signing systems, a process the OCC has never performed, and any failure could permanently strand customer assets. ICBA’s bottom line was blunt, the OCC should deny the application because Connectia’s model exceeds the traditional scope of trust banks, mimics demand deposits, and fails the trust exemption under the Bank Holding Company Act. It added that approval would weaken the historical separation of banking and commerce and tilt the field against community banks.

What began as a retail-driven movement powered by early adopters and crypto enthusiasts has evolved into a market increasingly shaped by institutional capital, from BTC ETFs absorbing billions in inflows to corporations and hedge funds adding BTC to their balance sheets. Why Institutional Accumulation Has Changed Bitcoin Volatility The narrative around Bitcoin has undergone a fundamental transaction. According to the Arch Network post on X, the institutional participant in Bitcoin is no longer emerging; it’s already established. Spot Bitcoin ETF now holds over 1 million BTC, which is roughly 5% of the total supply. Daily inflows through mid-2025 have averaged between $300 and $500 million, with a cumulative asset close to $60 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Recovers Past $105K as Shutdown Relief and Whale Buying Fuel Bullish Reversal Furthermore, the reach of this integration is global, with more than half of the world’s top asset managers now having indirect exposure to BTC through these accessible ETF structures. However, while this level of adoption is bullish, a significant challenge is that most of this BTC remains idle in cold storage. This model secures exposure but fundamentally does not generate return. Presently, for the institutions managing trillions in assets, the model is losing relevance. A productive BTC stack that combines robust security with consistent yield generation is becoming the natural next step for capital markets. An ambassador at NEARProtocol and Somnia_Network, Trader Onur, has highlighted that Bitcoin ETF recorded $524 million daily inflows on Tuesday, marking the biggest since the crash. The derivatives market is flashing similar signals that smart money just stacked $8.5 million in BTC longs. This shows retailers are still nervous, but institutions are quietly positioning. If the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) print is favorable, it could set the tone for the year-end momentum. How Flows Can Confirm Or Contradict Market Mood The selling momentum in Bitcoin spot ETF flows has stalled for now. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that the BTC price has held the $100,000 region for now, as a lot of outflows and bad sentiment have taken place. However, the BTC price is also failing to push higher on the back of it. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Battleground — This Price Range Will Decide the Next Cycle Phase As Daan noted, ETF flow data is a lagging indicator and useful mostly in hindsight. Nonetheless, when large outflows occur and the price refuses to drop further, it could be considered as short-term bullish absorption. Additionally, when heavy inflows fail to lift the price higher, it can signal local tops. These patterns have played out multiple times in this cycle, and they often occur at the key pivot zones where market direction shifts. Daan believes that it’s still valuable to watch how the price behaves around major ETF in- and outflow days.

According to reports, the SHIB ecosystem is now expanding into the telecommunications sector through its alliance with Unity Nodes, signaling a significant shift from speculative trading and investments toward real-world functionality. This development positions the popular memes coin at the forefront of a multi-trillion-dollar industry that powers global connectivity and digital infrastructure. Shiba Inu Enters $2 Trillion Market With Unity Nodes A publication released on Tuesday, November 11, reveals that Shiba Inu has officially partnered with Unity Nodes, a decentralized telecommunications network. This alliance marks a pivotal moment for SHIB as it transitions from a community-driven meme coin to a technology-integrated digital asset with practical use cases. More importantly, through this collaboration, Shiba Inu has entered a telecom quality assurance market estimated to be worth around $2 trillion annually. The partnership introduces direct utility to SHIB while offering new earning opportunities for its holders. Moreover, the move strengthens the meme coin’s position in a sector that relies on continuous innovation and large-scale infrastructure. Notably, the report indicates that Unity Nodes operates a blockchain-based mobile edge network that spans multiple countries and carriers. Its system enables everyday users to participate in verifying and improving telecom infrastructure through decentralized participation. Additionally, the network operates within a structured framework, where users can install the Unity application on their mobile devices to make verification calls that pass through specific nodes. Switch Nodes handle call routing, Validation Nodes ensure each device functions properly, and finally, Earth Nodes log any performance issues. This data is then stored on-chain to create a transparent Proof-of-Service record that telecom operators can access through an API. In return, users earn crypto rewards for helping test and maintain the network. New Utility And Rewards For The SHIB Community According to the publication, Shiba Inu’s partnership with Unity Nodes comes with a series of exclusive benefits designed for token holders . Notably, SHIB is now accepted as a payment method within Unity Nodes through a decentralized gateway built in accordance with the official brand standards. Users will also be able to purchase Nodes using Shiba Inu and receive SHIB-branded NFT licenses that can be freely traded on secondary markets. This provides greater visibility and expands the cryptocurrency’s presence across blockchain platforms. Unity Node payments completed with Shiba Inu also come with additional advantages. Rather than receiving 200 Unity Licenses per node, users who pay with SHIB tokens can earn more at no extra cost, including a 5% license bonus, which further encourages token use within the telecom network. Alongside this, rewards for Unity Node operators can be distributed directly in SHIB. What’s more, the Shiba Inu team automatically earns referral rewards when purchases are made using its official referral code, granting them Unity Licenses that can be used, leased, or traded.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-14 03:00:58

GAIB, an innovative crypto AI startup focused on GPU tokenization, just dropped its highly anticipated tokenomics structure. This groundbreaking announcement reveals how the project plans to distribute its 1 billion tokens, with a remarkable 40% dedicated to community growth and engagement. What Makes GAIB Tokenomics So Revolutionary? The GAIB tokenomics model represents a significant shift toward community-centric distribution. Unlike many projects that prioritize investors and insiders, GAIB’s approach demonstrates genuine commitment to building a strong, engaged community. The total supply of 1 billion GAIB tokens follows this allocation breakdown: 40% to community – The largest share for ecosystem growth 20.7% to core contributors – Rewarding the development team 19.8% to early contributors – Recognizing initial supporters 19.5% to ecosystem – Fueling platform development Why Does Community Allocation Matter in GAIB Tokenomics? Community-focused GAIB tokenomics creates a powerful incentive structure that benefits everyone involved. When 40% of tokens go to the community, it ensures widespread distribution and reduces centralization risks. This approach aligns perfectly with blockchain’s core principles of decentralization and community governance. Moreover, the GAIB tokenomics model encourages active participation. Community members who contribute to network growth, provide liquidity, or participate in governance can earn rewards. This creates a virtuous cycle where engaged community members help the project succeed while being fairly compensated. How Will GAIB Tokenomics Impact GPU Tokenization? GAIB’s innovative approach to GPU tokenization combined with its community-first GAIB tokenomics could set new standards for AI crypto projects. By allocating nearly half of all tokens to community development, the project ensures that: Network effects accelerate through broad distribution Governance becomes truly decentralized Long-term sustainability improves through community ownership Innovation thrives with diverse participation What Challenges Might GAIB Tokenomics Face? While the GAIB tokenomics structure appears promising, successful implementation requires careful execution. The project must ensure transparent distribution mechanisms and prevent token concentration. Additionally, maintaining community engagement over time presents an ongoing challenge that the team must address through continuous innovation and clear communication. The remaining allocations in GAIB tokenomics also serve crucial purposes. Core contributors need adequate compensation to continue development, while early contributors deserve recognition for their risk-taking. The ecosystem fund ensures resources for future growth and partnerships. Conclusion: A New Era for Community-Driven Projects GAIB tokenomics represents a bold step toward truly community-owned AI infrastructure. With 40% of tokens dedicated to community growth, this model could inspire similar approaches across the crypto space. The success of GAIB tokenomics will depend on execution, but the vision sets a compelling precedent for future projects. Frequently Asked Questions What is the total supply of GAIB tokens? The total supply is 1 billion GAIB tokens, distributed across four main categories according to the published GAIB tokenomics. How can community members earn GAIB tokens? Community members can earn tokens through various activities including providing liquidity, participating in governance, contributing to ecosystem growth, and engaging in community programs. When will GAIB tokens be distributed? Specific distribution timelines will be announced by the project team, following their roadmap and token release schedule. What makes GAIB tokenomics different from other projects? The 40% community allocation is significantly higher than many comparable projects, demonstrating strong commitment to decentralized ownership and community governance. Can the tokenomics model change in the future? While the initial GAIB tokenomics is set, future adjustments may occur through community governance proposals and voting mechanisms. What is GPU tokenization? GPU tokenization involves creating digital tokens that represent access to or ownership of GPU computing resources, enabling decentralized AI and computing services.

On November 13, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs witnessed a staggering $867.35 million net outflow, marking the second-largest single-day withdrawal in history. This dramatic movement signals potential shifts in investor sentiment and market dynamics that could impact your cryptocurrency investments. What Caused This Massive Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflow? The recent $867.4 million outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs represents a significant market event. According to Trader T, this marks the second-largest single-day withdrawal after August 1. Several factors contributed to this substantial movement, including market volatility and changing investor strategies. The scale of this outflow suggests institutional players might be repositioning their portfolios amid current market conditions. Which Bitcoin Spot ETFs Were Most Affected? The outflow distribution reveals crucial insights about market leadership. Grayscale Mini BTC led with $318.20 million in outflows, followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT at $257.18 million . Other significant withdrawals included: Fidelity’s FBTC: $119.93 million Grayscale’s GBTC: $64.50 million Bitwise’s BITB: $47.03 million This pattern indicates widespread caution across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs providers rather than isolated concerns. How Do Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflows Impact the Market? Large-scale outflows from Bitcoin spot ETFs can create substantial market pressure. When investors withdraw funds, providers often need to sell underlying Bitcoin holdings to meet redemption requests. This selling pressure can potentially drive Bitcoin prices lower and increase market volatility. However, it’s crucial to remember that these movements represent short-term sentiment rather than long-term fundamental changes. What Does This Mean for Future Bitcoin Spot ETFs Performance? While the $867.4 million outflow seems alarming, historical data shows that Bitcoin spot ETFs often experience cyclical patterns. Previous large outflows were typically followed by periods of stabilization or renewed inflows. Investors should monitor whether this represents a temporary adjustment or the beginning of a longer-term trend. The resilience of Bitcoin spot ETFs will be tested in the coming weeks as market conditions evolve. Should You Be Concerned About Bitcoin Spot ETFs Stability? The current situation with Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows requires careful consideration rather than panic. These investment vehicles have demonstrated robustness through various market cycles. The diversity among Bitcoin spot ETFs providers means that risk is distributed across multiple institutions. However, investors should maintain diversified portfolios and stay informed about market developments affecting Bitcoin spot ETFs performance. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. Why do Bitcoin spot ETFs experience outflows? Outflows occur when investors sell their ETF shares, which can happen due to profit-taking, risk management, or shifting market sentiment. How does this outflow compare to historical data? The $867.4 million outflow is the second-largest single-day withdrawal on record, following only the August 1 outflow. Will this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large outflows can create selling pressure, but Bitcoin’s price is influenced by multiple factors beyond ETF flows. Should I sell my Bitcoin spot ETFs? Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market research rather than reacting to single events. How can I track Bitcoin spot ETFs performance? Most financial platforms provide real-time ETF data, and specialized cryptocurrency news sources offer regular updates and analysis. Found this analysis of Bitcoin spot ETFs outflows helpful?

This massive sell-off primarily punished optimistic investors who bet on prices rising, creating one of the most significant liquidation events in recent months. What Triggered This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation? Market volatility struck with unexpected force, catching many traders off guard. The crypto futures liquidation cascade began when key support levels broke across major cryptocurrencies. This triggered automatic closing of positions that couldn’t meet margin requirements. The domino effect amplified losses throughout the derivatives market. Several factors contributed to this dramatic crypto futures liquidation event: Sudden price drops across major cryptocurrencies Leveraged positions becoming unsustainable Automatic margin calls activating simultaneously Market sentiment shifting rapidly Bitcoin Bears the Brunt of Futures Carnage Bitcoin experienced the heaviest damage in this crypto futures liquidation storm. The flagship cryptocurrency saw $273 million in forced position closures. More importantly, a staggering 82.54% of these liquidations came from long positions. This indicates most traders were betting on price increases when the market turned against them. The scale of Bitcoin’s crypto futures liquidation demonstrates how leveraged trading amplifies market movements. When prices move against highly leveraged positions, the results can be devastating for traders. Ethereum and Solana Join the Liquidation Party Ethereum wasn’t spared from the crypto futures liquidation frenzy either. The second-largest cryptocurrency witnessed $228 million in forced closures. Long positions accounted for 71.49% of ETH liquidations, showing similar optimism among Ethereum traders. Solana experienced the most lopsided crypto futures liquidation ratio. With $52.02 million in closed positions, an overwhelming 90.72% came from long contracts. This suggests Solana traders were particularly bullish before the market reversal. Why Were Long Positions Hit So Hard? The disproportionate impact on long positions reveals crucial market psychology. Most traders entered the market expecting prices to rise. This collective optimism created vulnerability when the trend reversed. The crypto futures liquidation event serves as a stark reminder that markets can move against majority sentiment. Key reasons long positions dominated the crypto futures liquidation statistics: Prevailing bullish market sentiment Overconfidence in continuing uptrends Excessive leverage on long positions Underestimation of downside risks How Can Traders Protect Against Future Liquidations? This crypto futures liquidation event provides valuable lessons for risk management. Traders can implement several strategies to avoid similar situations. Proper position sizing becomes crucial during volatile periods. Additionally, using stop-loss orders can prevent catastrophic losses. Effective protection against crypto futures liquidation includes: Using lower leverage ratios Setting appropriate stop-loss levels Diversifying trading strategies Monitoring market conditions closely What Does This Mean for Crypto Markets? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events often signal market inflection points. While painful for affected traders, these corrections can create healthier market conditions. They flush out excessive leverage and reset sentiment to more realistic levels. The aftermath of this crypto futures liquidation may present buying opportunities for patient investors. However, traders should remain cautious until volatility subsides and new trends establish. Key Takeaways from the $553M Liquidation Event This significant crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder about market risks. The dominance of long position closures highlights the danger of herd mentality. Successful trading requires balancing optimism with prudent risk management. Remember that crypto futures liquidation events are inherent to leveraged trading. They represent the market’s mechanism for removing unsustainable positions. While devastating for some, they contribute to overall market efficiency. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when traders can’t meet margin requirements for their leveraged positions. This typically happens during rapid price movements against their trades. Why were long positions hit harder than shorts? Most traders held long positions expecting price increases. When the market reversed suddenly, these optimistic bets became unsustainable, triggering massive liquidations. How can I avoid futures liquidation? Use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, maintain adequate margin, and avoid overconcentration in single positions to reduce liquidation risk. Will this liquidation affect spot prices? Yes, large futures liquidations can impact spot prices due to forced selling pressure and changed market sentiment, though the effect is usually temporary. Is this the largest liquidation ever? While significant at $553 million, larger liquidation events have occurred during major market crashes, particularly in 2021 and 2022. Should I avoid futures trading after this? Futures trading carries inherent risks. This event highlights the importance of proper risk management rather than suggesting complete avoidance. Found this analysis helpful?

This dramatic movement raises crucial questions about investor confidence in these relatively new financial products. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Seeing Massive Outflows? The data from TraderT reveals a concerning trend for spot Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s fund alone accounted for $137.37 million in outflows, representing the largest single withdrawal among all providers. This substantial movement from such a major financial institution signals potential shifting sentiment toward Ethereum-based investment products. Several factors could explain this trend: Market volatility concerns Profit-taking strategies Broader cryptocurrency market conditions Regulatory uncertainty How Did Other Major Players Perform? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) followed BlackRock with significant outflows of $67.91 million. Meanwhile, their Mini Ethereum Trust (ETH) saw $35.82 million exit. The most alarming aspect? Not a single spot Ethereum ETF recorded net inflows for the day. This uniform pattern across all providers suggests this isn’t an isolated incident but rather a broader market movement affecting the entire spot Ethereum ETFs ecosystem. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? For current Ethereum investors, these spot Ethereum ETFs outflows present both challenges and opportunities. While large-scale withdrawals can create short-term price pressure, they also may indicate market corrections that savvy investors can leverage. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor institutional behavior – Large players often signal market shifts Diversify your portfolio – Don’t rely solely on spot Ethereum ETFs Watch for patterns – Single-day movements may not indicate long-term trends Will Spot Ethereum ETFs Recover From This Setback? The future of spot Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain but not necessarily bleak. Historical data shows that cryptocurrency investment products often experience volatility in their early stages. However, the sheer scale of this outflow, particularly from established players like BlackRock, warrants close attention from anyone involved in spot Ethereum ETFs. Market analysts suggest watching for: Follow-up trading patterns over the next week Institutional commentary on Ethereum’s prospects Broader cryptocurrency market performance Regulatory developments affecting spot Ethereum ETFs Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH price movements without owning the actual digital asset. Why is BlackRock’s outflow significant? BlackRock is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and their substantial outflow from spot Ethereum ETFs may indicate changing institutional sentiment toward Ethereum investments. Should I be worried about my Ethereum investments? While concerning, single-day outflows don’t necessarily predict long-term trends. Monitor the situation and consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. How often do ETF outflows of this magnitude occur? Large outflows are relatively uncommon for established ETFs but can occur during market uncertainty or when major investors rebalance their portfolios. Can spot Ethereum ETFs affect Ethereum’s price? Yes, significant movements in spot Ethereum ETFs can influence Ethereum’s market price due to the large volumes involved and their impact on market sentiment. Where can I track spot Ethereum ETF flows? Platforms like TraderT, Bloomberg, and financial data providers regularly update ETF flow information for spot Ethereum ETFs and other cryptocurrency products. Found this analysis helpful?

The Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner revealed plans to completely exit BTC mining operations within two years, marking one of the most significant strategic shifts in the crypto mining industry. Why Did Bitfarms Stock Crash So Suddenly? The market reaction was swift and severe. When Bitfarms disclosed its intention to convert all mining facilities into AI and high-performance computing data centers, investors responded with immediate selling pressure. This Bitfarms stock decline reflects investor concerns about several key factors: Abandoning proven Bitcoin mining revenue streams Uncertainty about AI market competition Significant capital expenditure requirements for conversion Timeline risks during the two-year transition period What Does the Bitfarms Transition Timeline Look Like? Bitfarms has outlined a phased approach to this massive operational overhaul. The company’s 18-megawatt facility in Washington will lead the transformation, with completion targeted for December 2025. This initial conversion serves as a critical test case for the broader strategy. The success or failure of this first facility will likely determine the pace of subsequent conversions and could significantly impact Bitfarms stock performance throughout the transition. Is This the Beginning of a Mining Industry Trend? The Bitfarms decision raises important questions about the future of Bitcoin mining. While AI and high-performance computing represent growing markets, the move away from Bitcoin mining comes at a time when the industry faces several challenges: Increasing energy costs affecting mining profitability Growing regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions Bitcoin halving events reducing mining rewards over time Intense competition from larger mining operations This strategic pivot suggests that Bitfarms stock performance may now be tied more to tech sector trends than cryptocurrency markets. What Are the Potential Benefits for Bitfarms Stock Long-Term? Despite the immediate negative market reaction, the transition could offer substantial long-term advantages. The AI and high-performance computing markets are experiencing explosive growth, potentially providing: More stable revenue streams compared to volatile crypto mining Access to government incentives for technology infrastructure Partnership opportunities with major tech companies Diversification away from single-asset dependence However, the success of this strategy depends on execution and market timing, factors that will continue to influence Bitfarms stock valuation. How Should Investors Approach Bitfarms Stock Now? For current and potential investors, the situation requires careful analysis. The dramatic Bitfarms stock drop presents both risk and opportunity. Key considerations include: Monitoring the Washington facility conversion progress Assessing management’s ability to execute complex operational changes Evaluating the competitive landscape in AI data services Considering the company’s financial position during transition Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitfarms stock drop 18%? Bitfarms stock fell sharply because investors reacted negatively to the company’s announcement that it will exit Bitcoin mining entirely and convert to AI data centers over the next two years. When will Bitfarms complete the transition to AI? The company plans to complete the first facility conversion in Washington by December 2025, with the full transition expected to take approximately two years. Will Bitfarms continue mining Bitcoin during the transition? Yes, Bitfarms will gradually phase out Bitcoin mining operations while simultaneously converting facilities to AI data centers over the two-year timeline. How will this affect Bitfarms stock long-term? The long-term impact on Bitfarms stock depends on the success of the AI transition, market conditions, and whether the company can establish itself in the competitive AI infrastructure space. Are other Bitcoin miners making similar moves? While some mining companies are exploring diversification, Bitfarms represents one of the first major public miners to announce a complete exit from Bitcoin mining for AI. What happens to existing Bitcoin mining equipment? Bitfarms will likely sell or repurpose existing mining hardware as it converts facilities to support AI and high-performance computing workloads.

Whale Alert reported a staggering 202,107,199 USDT moved from an unknown wallet to OKX exchange, valued at approximately $202 million. This enormous transaction represents one of the largest single transfers we’ve seen this month, potentially signaling significant market movements ahead. What Does This Massive USDT Whale Transfer Mean? When we see a USDT whale transfer of this magnitude, it typically indicates one of several scenarios. Large investors might be preparing to make substantial purchases of other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, institutional players could be moving funds between wallets for security or operational reasons. The destination – OKX exchange – suggests this capital might soon enter active trading markets. Understanding whale movements helps traders anticipate potential price swings. However, remember that correlation doesn’t always equal causation. While large transfers often precede market movements, they don’t guarantee specific outcomes. Why Should You Care About Whale Transactions? Tracking USDT whale transfer activity provides valuable insights because: Large movements can indicate institutional interest They often precede significant price volatility Whale behavior influences market sentiment They reveal accumulation or distribution patterns This particular transaction stands out due to its sheer size and the unknown nature of the sending wallet. The mystery adds an intriguing layer to market analysis. How Do Whale Transfers Impact Crypto Prices? The recent USDT whale transfer to OKX could influence markets in several ways. First, having $202 million worth of stablecoins on an exchange means this capital is positioned for immediate deployment. If the whale decides to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other major cryptocurrencies, we could see substantial price appreciation in those assets. Conversely, if this represents profit-taking or position unwinding, it might signal upcoming selling pressure. The key is monitoring subsequent trading activity from the receiving wallet address. What Makes This USDT Whale Transfer Different? Several factors make this USDT whale transfer particularly noteworthy. The timing coincides with ongoing market consolidation, suggesting potential accumulation. The unknown origin wallet adds mystery, while the OKX destination indicates possible Asian market involvement given the exchange’s strong presence in that region. Market analysts will be watching closely for: Follow-up transactions from the same wallet Large buy orders on OKX Price movements in major cryptocurrencies Similar whale activity on other exchanges Key Takeaways From This Whale Movement This substantial USDT whale transfer reminds us that major players continue operating behind the scenes. While retail investors focus on daily price charts, institutional and whale activity often drives longer-term trends. The movement of $202 million demonstrates significant confidence in cryptocurrency markets despite recent volatility. Successful traders monitor these signals while maintaining balanced portfolios. Remember that whale watching should complement, not replace, fundamental and technical analysis. Frequently Asked Questions What is a whale transfer in cryptocurrency? A whale transfer refers to large cryptocurrency movements by wealthy investors or institutions. These transactions often influence market prices and sentiment due to their substantial size. Why do whales move USDT to exchanges? Whales typically transfer USDT to exchanges when they plan to trade for other cryptocurrencies, withdraw fiat currency, or reposition their portfolios for market opportunities. How can I track whale transactions? You can monitor whale activity using blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens or through specialized services like Whale Alert that report large transactions. Should I follow whale trading patterns? While whale movements provide valuable insights, they shouldn’t be your sole trading strategy. Consider them as one factor among many in your market analysis. What risks come with following whale activity? The main risk involves timing – by the time whale transactions are public, prices may have already moved. Also, whales sometimes make misleading moves to influence markets. How often do large USDT transfers occur? Significant USDT transfers happen regularly, but $200 million+ transactions remain relatively rare and typically indicate major institutional activity. Found this analysis helpful?

According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, institutional investors have been actively accumulating Bitcoin during recent price corrections. Over a nine-hour period, we witnessed 4,094 BTC transferred from prominent exchanges including Coinbase, Cumberland, Galaxy Digital, and Wintermute to Anchorage Digital addresses. This institutional Bitcoin buying pattern typically indicates: Long-term investment strategies rather than short-term trading Confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value Strategic accumulation during perceived market opportunities Why Are Institutions Buying Bitcoin Now? The timing of this institutional Bitcoin buying spree reveals much about market sentiment. When prices dip, sophisticated investors often see opportunity rather than risk. This recent activity suggests institutions believe current levels represent attractive entry points. Moreover, the scale of this institutional Bitcoin buying – $405 million in a single day – demonstrates substantial conviction. How Does Institutional Bitcoin Buying Impact Markets? When major players engage in significant institutional Bitcoin buying, it creates several market effects. First, it reduces available supply on exchanges, which can lead to price appreciation when demand increases. Second, it validates Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. Third, this institutional Bitcoin buying often encourages retail investors to follow suit, creating positive momentum. Key Players in Recent Institutional Bitcoin Buying The entities involved in this institutional Bitcoin buying represent some of the most respected names in digital assets.

Their collective action suggests they see fundamental strength in Bitcoin that outweighs short-term price concerns. This institutional Bitcoin buying behavior often precedes broader market recoveries. Conclusion: Institutional Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future The recent $405 million institutional Bitcoin buying spree sends a clear message: sophisticated investors remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. While retail investors might panic during dips, institutions see these moments as accumulation opportunities. This institutional Bitcoin buying pattern reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class and suggests continued institutional adoption ahead. Frequently Asked Questions What is institutional Bitcoin buying? Institutional Bitcoin buying refers to large-scale purchases of Bitcoin by corporations, investment firms, hedge funds, and other professional investment entities rather than individual retail investors. Why do institutions buy Bitcoin during dips? Institutions typically have long-term investment strategies and view price dips as opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices, believing in the fundamental value proposition. How does institutional buying affect Bitcoin prices? Large institutional purchases can reduce exchange supply, increase demand, and create positive market sentiment, often leading to price appreciation over time. Which institutions are most active in Bitcoin buying? Major players include cryptocurrency exchanges, trading firms, asset management companies, and corporations adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. Should retail investors follow institutional buying patterns? While institutional activity provides valuable market signals, retail investors should conduct their own research and invest according to their risk tolerance and investment goals. How can I track institutional Bitcoin buying activity? You can monitor blockchain analytics platforms, exchange flow data, and institutional custody movements to track large-scale Bitcoin purchases.

54374321,627100,1763092811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54374321.jpeg,Early Bitcoin Whale Sells Over $600M in BTC After 13 Years of Holding,https://bitcoinist.com/early-bitcoin-whale-sells-600m-btc-after-13-years/,"Bitcoin continues to face strong resistance as it struggles to reclaim higher supply levels, with price action stalling below the $105,000 mark. The market remains caught between cautious optimism and lingering fear, as selling pressure persists but downside momentum appears to be fading. According to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence, whales have continued to offload significant portions of their holdings in recent days, contributing to the ongoing headwinds in the market. However, despite this selling activity, analysts note growing signs of buyer absorption around the $100,000 zone, where strong demand has repeatedly prevented further declines. This balance between distribution and accumulation has split analyst opinions — some expect Bitcoin to dip further before stabilizing, while others see this phase as a reaccumulation zone that could precede a move toward new all-time highs. As the market navigates this critical stage, liquidity concentration and whale behavior remain key indicators to watch. If selling pressure continues to ease and demand sustains near current levels, Bitcoin could be setting the foundation for its next major impulse. OG Whale Sells $600 Million in Bitcoin Amid Market Uncertainty According to data from Arkham Intelligence, one of Bitcoin’s earliest and most prominent holders, Owen Gunden, has recently offloaded a significant portion of his holdings — a move that has caught the attention of market analysts. Gunden, who has held Bitcoin since late 2011, was sitting on approximately 11,450 BTC valued at $1.4 billion just a month ago. However, recent on-chain activity shows that he has sold around 6,100 BTC, worth roughly $616 million, reducing his holdings to $542 million. This large-scale selloff comes at a critical time for Bitcoin, as the asset consolidates near the $100,000–$105,000 range amid mounting selling pressure from whales. Gunden’s decision to take profit after over a decade of holding suggests a combination of profit realization and market caution, particularly as macro uncertainty and liquidity stress weigh on risk assets. While some view this as a bearish signal, others argue that such sales often mark the late stages of a distribution phase, where long-term holders transfer coins to new investors during consolidation. If Bitcoin maintains strong support near $100K despite this heavy selling, it could indicate deep market demand and the potential for a renewed accumulation phase. Bitcoin Consolidates as Bulls Defend the $100K Level The daily Bitcoin chart shows that BTC remains in a consolidation phase, trading around $103,000 after multiple attempts to rebound from the $100,000 psychological support zone. Despite persistent selling pressure and fading momentum, buyers continue to absorb liquidity near this level, keeping the structure relatively stable. Price action shows a series of lower highs since mid-September, reflecting ongoing market hesitation and the dominance of short-term sellers. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages (blue and green lines) are currently acting as dynamic resistance levels, with BTC repeatedly failing to close above them. Meanwhile, the 200-day moving average (red line) provides a long-term anchor, currently positioned near $98,000, which remains the next major support level to watch. Until then, the market is likely to remain range-bound, consolidating within the $100K–$105K corridor. A breakdown below $100K could trigger further downside pressure, while a successful defense may set the stage for a recovery toward the $110K–$115K range in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Investors Are Extremely Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that’s present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Chainlink’s Next Major Move Comes After This Range, Analyst Says The index uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social sentiment, and Google Trends. It then represents the sentiment using a scale running from 0 to 100. All values above 53 correspond to a net sentiment of greed, while those below 47 imply fear in the market. The indicator being between these two cutoffs naturally suggests a neutral mentality among the investors. Besides these three main zones, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme fear and extreme greed. The former takes place below 25 and the latter above 75. Currently, the Fear & Greed Index is in one of these zones. As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 15 at the moment, firmly inside the extreme fear territory. Sentiment among investors was already poor on Wednesday, but this latest value is even worse. The deterioration of sentiment is a result of Bitcoin retracing its recent recovery. While traders may be highly bearish toward the market right now, BTC and other assets don’t necessarily have to live up to expectations. In fact, if history is anything to go by, cryptocurrencies have often shown moves that directly go contrary to the crowd’s opinion. Many major tops and bottoms in the sector have formed alongside a sentiment of extreme greed and extreme fear, respectively. Given this, it’s possible that the latest foray into extreme fear could also lead to a bottom for Bitcoin and others. When that might happen, however, is anyone’s guess. The latest extreme fear sentiment is the strongest since early March, but the low back then didn’t coincide with BTC’s real bottom. That said, Bitcoin did find a temporary turnaround just a few days after, which lasted until the end of the month. In April, the market crashed again, and the Fear & Greed Index declined to a low of 18. This time, the extreme fear sentiment was enough to reignite real bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin “Arguably Undervalued,” Says Analytics Firm: Here’s Why It now remains to be seen whether the current low in the indicator will be enough for the market to reach a bottom, or if sentiment will worsen still.

Across Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.77%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.35% and New Zealand’s benchmark fell 1.58%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng opened lower, while China’s Shanghai Composite slipped 0.16% after fresh data showed retail sales and industrial output slowed in October, dampening hopes for a recovery. Bitcoin’s drop erased recent gains fueled by optimism around institutional inflows. The token traded below $100K for the first time this month, as liquidity thinned and momentum faded. Traders said renewed institutional conviction will be key for the next leg higher. Maja Vujinovic, who leads digital assets at FG Nexus, said markets are currently under multiple layers of strain, with macro and tech-related risks combining with selling by long-term holders and a slowdown in institutional demand. Bitcoin ETF's have seen a net flow of -$963.7M over the past 9 trading days, with the trend turning right as $BTC rebounded to $115K back on October 28th.

The Euro Stoxx 50 also lost 0.83% as inflation jitters and weak corporate earnings weighed on sentiment. Fed Officials Signal Caution, Dimming Hopes For Near-Term Policy Easing Treasury yields climbed as traders dialed back bets on a December rate cut, with CME FedWatch data showing odds for easing dropping to about 46% from over 60% a day earlier. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said rates should remain restrictive to curb inflation , while St. Louis Fed chief Alberto Musalem noted limited room to ease without fueling price pressures. Their remarks reinforced market expectations that the Fed may stay on hold longer. The White House added to the gloom, saying October’s unemployment data may not be released following a record 43-day government shutdown that had already delayed key reports and clouded visibility on the economy. The pullback came as traders shifted from rate-cut euphoria to a more sober outlook on inflation, pushing risk assets lower and prompting a flight to safety.

Market data indicates a sharp rebound in both sectors, prompting many investors to seek the next breakout token and reassess their top altcoin picks. As confidence builds, Bitcoin attempts to stabilize after recent pressure, while Ethereum shows signs of steady recovery. Additionally, new entrants are rushing into emerging projects, such as Apeing ($APEING), a meme coin that is garnering notable interest around its whitelist. Many now view whitelist access as an opportunity to build stronger ROI potential during the early phases. With volatility returning, the demand for top altcoin picks continues to grow across the market. Apeing Captures Whitelist Attention As Risk Appetite Returns Apeing ($APEING) enters the scene during one of the most active periods for memecoins this season. Rising market interest supports a stronger push toward its growing whitelist, which has attracted an impressive wave of early supporters. Traders looking for top altcoin picks often focus on community strength, energy, and identity. Apeing fits that trend with a brand built around degen culture and a commitment to fun, clear communication, and community involvement. As memecoins rise again, FOMO spreads much faster. Early whitelist access often gives supporters a psychological boost, especially when the market expands rapidly. This scenario frequently appears in fast-moving cycles where new meme projects outperform larger assets for short periods. Many traders recall past cycles where early whitelist entries yielded strong returns, prompting them to act sooner. With traders hunting for top altcoin picks during renewed volatility, Apeing stands out as one of the emerging names catching attention. Joining The Apeing Whitelist During Growing FOMO Waves Many traders now rush to secure a spot on the Apeing whitelist as excitement builds across the memecoin market. Access remains simple and direct, which increases participation during periods of rising FOMO. You start by visiting the official Apeing website , where the whitelist portal sits clearly displayed for early users. After that, you add your email address to the whitelist section to register your interest. Once you complete the signup, a confirmation message arrives by email. This confirmation signals your whitelist position and keeps you updated as the project moves through its audit phase. Traders often act quickly at this stage since early access can help position them for stronger ROI when market energy increases. Ethereum Gains Strength As Traders React To Market Rebound Ethereum reacts to the NFT and memecoin rebound as traders rotate funds back into large-cap assets. Its price reclaimed the $3,583 level after reaching a monthly low of $3,250. Weekly performance shows more than 6% growth, which attracts traders searching for top altcoin picks with more stability. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,526 after hitting an intraday low of $3,380, indicating steady interest despite minor fluctuations. Rising optimism also connects to macroeconomic movement. The United States prepares to vote on a bill that could end the federal shutdown. Market history shows that renewed government stability often brings fresh liquidity into risk-on assets. Traders remember past events where easing macro pressure allowed large-cap coins to recover quickly. If the shutdown ends, Ethereum may gain more traction as capital flows back into major networks. Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure While Market Energy Shifts Bitcoin continues to struggle despite rising activity in the market. Its price sits around $103,922 after failing twice to break above the $105,000 level. Traders point to a two-and-a-half-week downtrend that still controls short-term movement. Consolidation now occurs above the $101,477 support level, which typically serves as a base during uncertain periods. Even with pressure, BTC can still shift momentum if buyers regain control. A push above $105,000 could open a path toward $108,000. Past cases show Bitcoin often takes longer to recover compared to faster-moving assets. If Bitcoin breaks resistance, broader market sentiment could improve. Many traders now monitor Bitcoin but also explore alternative assets, such as Apeing, for faster potential returns. Conclusion Crypto momentum grows stronger as memecoins return to the spotlight. Traders move back into risk assets, fueling demand for top altcoin picks that can thrive in fast conditions. Ethereum builds steady strength, Bitcoin watches for a breakout, and Apeing ($APEING) continues to pull attention through its active whitelist. Rising FOMO pushes more participants to act early as the market heats up. With fresh energy and new opportunities forming each week, smart investors should join the Apeing whitelist to secure their spot before the presale kicks off. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQ on the Top Altcoin Picks in 2025 Why is Apeing gaining so much whitelist attention? Growing interest in high-volatility assets and renewed risk appetite push traders to seek early positions. Apeing benefits from this momentum, especially as FOMO increases. How does the rebound in NFTs and memecoins impact top altcoin picks? Rising activity signals stronger market confidence and encourages traders to search for high-potential assets. Many use this period to identify new opportunities. Is Ethereum or Bitcoin better positioned during this market phase? Ethereum moves with stronger momentum due to its role in DeFi and network activity, while Bitcoin faces resistance. Both remain important but respond differently to market conditions. Summary Apeing ($APEING) attracts early attention through its growing whitelist as traders react to rising FOMO and hunt for new opportunities. Ethereum shows signs of recovery as macro stability improves, while Bitcoin struggles to break resistance. Market behavior mirrors past cycles where traders rotate into high-potential assets during rebounds. With volatility on the rise, interest in whitelist entries and breakout tokens remains high.

Related Reading: Winklevoss Twins Back Zcash (ZEC) Treasury Company With $58M Investment First Spot XRP ETF Begins Trading On Thursday, the first single-token XRP spot ETF began trading on Nasdaq, smashing the initial performance expectations of multiple experts after clearing the last regulatory hurdles this week. Following the launch of Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF (XRPC), the investment management firm asserted its conviction that “XRP Ledger represents a leading framework for global payments — purpose-built for interoperability and real-world settlement.” Notably, Canary Capital recently completed its 8-A filing for its XRPC ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and received the stock exchange’s green light on Wednesday afternoon. The Thursday launch comes amid the end of the US Government shutdown, which officially lasted 43 days and was forecasted to delay the long-awaited Altcoin ETFs until its conclusion. For context, the SEC was expected to approve multiple crypto-based investment products between early October and November, after the regulatory agency postponed the decision deadline in Q3 and released new generic listing standards for the products. However, the second wave of crypto-based investment products arrived despite the government setback, with the first set of ETFs launching over two weeks ago. On October 28, Canary Capital’s spot Litecoin and Hedera ETFs and Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) began trading after filing 8-A forms with the SEC. As crypto journalist Eleanor Terret explained, the launch was possible because an open government wasn’t required to continue the process, and the 8-A filings are “just as important” as the S-1 forms, since they register ETF shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Canary’s XRPC To Challenge BSOL’s Debut Ahead of the launch, multiple experts predicted that Canary’s spot XRP ETF could see strong demand and reach between $15 million and $35 million in volume on its first day. Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, initially suggested that the investment product could hit $17 million in volume. Following the first half-hour, the XRP ETF saw $26 million in volume, the analyst noted, breaking past his original expectations. As a result, Balchunas suggested that the XRPC had a “good shot” at surpassing BSOL’s first-day volume and becoming the biggest ETF launch of 2025. As reported by NewsBTC, Bitwise’s SOL Staking ETF recorded an impressive volume of $10 million in the first 30 minutes of trading, which surged to $33 million by the half-day mark. The investment product closed its first day with around $57 million in volume, beating all other launches of this year.

In the afternoon, analyst James Seyffart noted that Canary’s XRP ETF had recorded around $46 million in volume by the half-day mark, with a few more hours of trading ahead. The analyst initially suggested that XRPC could see around $34 million in volume on day one. “This is almost guaranteed to be near the top of the list for 2025 launches and still has a shot at beating $BSOL for the top spot,” Seyffart concluded.

Related Reading: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect ETH price is currently hovering above the $3,400 support zone after a volatile week marked by ETF outflows, declining volume, and intense bearish sentiment. Shutdown Resolution Lifts Market Sentiment as ETH Reclaims Stability The broader crypto market reacted positively to news of the shutdown’s resolution, helping Ethereum climb 3.18% on the day and outperform Bitcoin with a 3% gain. Analysts now expect ETH to rise toward $3,814 by November 18, representing a potential 10.37% short-term upside. Despite the improved macro backdrop, Ethereum remains in a challenging technical position. Key support lies at $3,333 and $3,300, while resistance at $3,590 and $3,666 will determine whether ETH can break its current downtrend. ETF products continue to show weakness, with all nine Ethereum ETFs recording zero inflows and a combined $107 million in outflows, suggesting institutions remain cautious. Vitalik Buterin Unveils Scaling Outlook as DeFi Matures Globally Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added optimism to the week by outlining a refreshed scaling roadmap and highlighting DeFi’s evolution into a viable global savings tool. He emphasized that the DeFi ecosystem is now “night and day” safer compared to 2020, citing better security audits, stronger protocols, and improved user-fund recovery mechanisms through innovations like the “walkaway test.” Central to Buterin’s roadmap is Ethereum’s ongoing Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling strategy. With rollups, data availability upgrades, and new high-throughput solutions, such as systems already achieving over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin believes Ethereum is on track to support the next wave of DeFi adoption. He urged developers to maintain Ethereum’s core values: openness, censorship resistance, and interoperability. Buterin warned that abandoning these principles risks turning Ethereum into a “walled garden,” undermining the ecosystem’s global mission. Institutional RWA Demand Surges as ETH Eyes Breakout Above $3,700 A growing bright spot for Ethereum is the explosive expansion of tokenised real-world assets (RWAs). More than $200 billion worth of RWAs now sit on-chain, driven by major institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The BUIDL fund’s tokenised Treasury products, built natively on Ethereum, showcase the network’s rising importance in traditional finance. Institutional RWA assets have surged nearly 2,000% since January 2024, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals even as short-term volatility persists. Related Reading: European Banking Regulator Says EU Crypto Framework Addresses ECB’s Stablecoin Concerns Technically, Ethereum remains in a descending channel from its failed August rally toward $5,000. Analysts note that a decisive breakout above $3,700 could flip market structure bullish and reopen paths toward $4,700, especially if macro stability continues after the shutdown settlement.

In a recent video, he voiced a strong belief that the token is nearing a pivotal moment. His message was direct and urgent, emphasizing that those waiting on the sidelines may regret not taking action while the price remains low. Belief in XRP’s Value and Utility Time Traveler argued that XRP’s price has been held back compared to other major digital assets that have recently gained substantial value. He pointed to examples, such as Chainlink and Solana, referencing how their prices have surged over time. “Just one of those is like $20 now,” he said, using their performance to illustrate what he believes could be XRP’s next stage of growth. He rejected any notion that XRP is less valuable or less capable than its competitors, saying that the opposite is true. “It’s the best asset,” he insisted, citing XRP’s established role as a utility token designed for efficient global transfers. His remarks align with the view held by many long-term holders that XRP’s strength lies in its function as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. I'm running out of opportunities to tell you this. Time is accelerating. pic.twitter.com/xo8a0OpIYy — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) November 11, 2025 A Sense of Urgency Among Supporters The tone of his message sounded urgent. “If you don’t start buying XRP right now, you’ll never see these prices again,” he warned, stressing that investors who hesitate may miss a crucial opportunity. He compared the situation to previous moments in cryptocurrency history when early-stage assets later became highly valuable, urging followers not to overlook what he considers a similar setup for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 His appeal also carried a personal note, emphasizing his frustration with skeptics who remain unconvinced despite what he sees as clear signs of appreciation to come . “I don’t want you to see that later and then find out the hard way,” he said. He noted that even modest investments, he added, could become significant over time. Why His Message Resonates with the XRP Community Many XRP supporters share Time Traveler’s belief that the token is positioned for a major breakout . They argue that its regulatory clarity, technological infrastructure, and integration with payment systems could create sustained demand once broader market conditions align. By calling XRP “the best utility crypto for transfers,” Time Traveler reaffirmed a central point of confidence within the community: XRP’s core purpose of facilitating real-world financial activity distinguishes it from purely speculative assets.

According to Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb, the current crypto downturn might be much less concerning than it appears. In a recent social media analysis, he provided compelling historical context that could change your perspective on market conditions. Why This Crypto Downturn Feels Different Haseeb’s assessment comes from deep industry experience. He suggests that many investors have forgotten the true severity of past market collapses. The current crypto downturn, while noticeable, lacks the systemic risks that characterized previous crises. When we examine market fundamentals rather than just price movements, the picture becomes clearer. The underlying technology continues to advance, institutional adoption grows steadily, and regulatory frameworks are becoming more defined. These factors create a much more stable foundation than during previous market stress periods. Remembering the 2022 Market Collapse To understand why the current crypto downturn seems manageable, we need to recall what real market stress looks like. Haseeb vividly described the 2022 sequence of events that created genuine panic: Terra-LUNA ecosystem collapse Three Arrows Capital failure FTX exchange implosion Genesis and BlockFi bankruptcies NFT market valuation crash This period represented what Haseeb called a house of cards scenario . Multiple interconnected failures created domino effects that threatened the entire digital asset ecosystem. Banks faced liquidity crises, stablecoins lost their pegs, and regulatory pressure intensified dramatically. What Makes the Current Situation Different? The current crypto downturn primarily involves price corrections rather than fundamental breakdowns. Unlike 2022, we’re not seeing: Major exchange collapses Systemic stablecoin failures Widespread institutional bankruptcies Regulatory emergency interventions Market infrastructure has matured significantly. Exchange reserves are more transparent, lending practices have improved, and risk management across the industry has evolved. This crypto downturn reflects normal market cycles rather than structural weaknesses. Key Indicators Showing Market Strength Despite the current crypto downturn, several positive indicators suggest underlying strength: Developer activity continues growing Institutional investment pipelines remain active Network usage metrics show steady adoption Regulatory clarity is improving globally These fundamentals matter more than short-term price movements. They represent the real value being built in the cryptocurrency space, regardless of market sentiment fluctuations. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility How should investors approach this crypto downturn? Consider these strategies: Focus on long-term fundamentals rather than daily price action Diversify across different blockchain projects and use cases Maintain appropriate risk management and position sizing Use volatility as an opportunity for strategic accumulation The current environment may actually present better entry points for long-term investors. Historical patterns suggest that buying during fear periods often yields better returns than buying during euphoria phases. Conclusion: Perspective Matters in Market Cycles Haseeb’s analysis provides valuable context for understanding market cycles. The current crypto downturn, while uncomfortable, lacks the systemic risks that made previous corrections truly dangerous. Market infrastructure has matured, regulatory frameworks are developing, and fundamental adoption continues. This perspective doesn’t mean ignoring risks, but rather understanding their relative severity. The crypto downturn we’re experiencing represents normal market behavior rather than ecosystem collapse. For informed investors, this distinction makes all the difference in navigation strategy. Frequently Asked Questions How long might this crypto downturn last? Market cycles vary in duration, but current indicators suggest this could be a shorter correction phase. Most analysts expect stabilization within several months based on fundamental strength. Should I sell during this crypto downturn? Panic selling rarely produces good outcomes. Consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Many experienced investors use downturns to accumulate positions at better valuations. What signs should I watch for recovery? Key recovery indicators include increasing trading volumes, positive regulatory developments, institutional investment flows, and improving market sentiment metrics. How does this compare to previous bear markets? This downturn appears less severe than 2018 or 2022 bear markets. The absence of major exchange failures or stablecoin collapses suggests better underlying ecosystem health. Are cryptocurrency fundamentals still strong? Yes, core fundamentals remain robust. Developer activity, network usage, and institutional adoption continue growing despite price volatility. What protection exists against another FTX-style collapse? Significant improvements include better exchange transparency, proof-of-reserves requirements, enhanced regulatory oversight, and improved industry risk management practices.

This massive market move has sent shockwaves through trading communities worldwide, highlighting the extreme volatility and risks inherent in leveraged cryptocurrency trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation happens when traders using leverage get their positions forcibly closed by exchanges. This occurs when their collateral can no longer cover potential losses. The recent $310 million crypto futures liquidation represents one of the largest hourly wipeouts we’ve seen this year, demonstrating how quickly markets can turn against leveraged positions. Why Did This Massive Liquidation Occur? Several factors converged to trigger this dramatic crypto futures liquidation event. First, unexpected market volatility caught many traders off guard. Second, over-leveraged positions amplified the impact of price movements. Third, cascading liquidations created a domino effect that accelerated the process. Sudden price drops triggered margin calls High leverage ratios magnified losses Automated systems executed forced closures Market sentiment shift accelerated selling pressure How Can Traders Avoid Future Liquidation Events? Protecting yourself from crypto futures liquidation requires careful risk management. Always use proper position sizing and avoid excessive leverage. Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels and maintain adequate margin buffers. Remember, the $310 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder that markets can move violently against even the most confident traders. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? This significant crypto futures liquidation event has several implications for the broader market. It may lead to reduced leverage offerings from exchanges and increased caution among traders. However, it also presents buying opportunities for those with available capital. The $1.02 billion in 24-hour liquidations suggests we’re seeing a major market reset. Essential Risk Management Strategies To survive future crypto futures liquidation waves, implement these proven strategies. Use maximum 5x leverage for most trades. Diversify your portfolio across different assets. Monitor markets closely during high volatility periods. Most importantly, never risk more than you can afford to lose in any crypto futures liquidation scenario. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when your position’s maintenance margin falls below required levels, forcing automatic closure by the exchange. How can I calculate my liquidation price? Most exchanges provide liquidation calculators. Generally, higher leverage means your liquidation price moves closer to your entry price. Can I prevent forced liquidation? Yes, by adding more collateral, reducing position size, or using lower leverage ratios before reaching critical levels. What happens to my funds after liquidation? The exchange uses your remaining collateral to cover losses, and any leftover funds return to your account balance. Are all exchanges’ liquidation mechanisms the same? No, different exchanges use varying methods like partial liquidation, auto-deleveraging, or insurance funds to handle liquidations. How often do large liquidation events occur? Major crypto futures liquidation events typically happen during periods of extreme volatility or unexpected news developments.

Ripple dropped for four consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since November 10. It dropped even as the spot XRP ETF launched in the United States. Canary XRP ETF had a strong debut The XRP price remains in a deep bear market after plunging by almost 40% from its highest level this year. This decline happened even as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Canary XRP ETF (XRPC). The XRPC ETF had a strong debut, with the first-day volume of over $58 million. It also attracted millions of dollars in inflows as Wall Street placed a bet in the fourth-biggest coin in the crypto industry. Most importantly, more XRP ETFs will be launched in the coming weeks now that many of them have been listed on the DTCC platform. This includes ETFs by companies like Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and 21Shares. Why XRP price dropped after the ETF launch The XRP price remained on edge for a few reasons. First, the decline was in line with the performance of the crypto market crash that saw Bitcoin and most altcoins plunge. Bitcoin price plunged to $97,200, while Ethereum plunged by 10% in the last 24 hours to $3,125. Other top tokens like Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA). The total market cap of all coins dropped by over 5.4% in the last 24 hours to $3.26 trillion, meaning that investors have lost over $1 trillion this year. The XRP price is crashing as a sense of fear prevails in the market. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has moved downwards to the fear zone of 22. The state of fear is demonstrated in the performance in the futures market. Data shows that XRP’s futures open interest dropped to $3.65 billion, down from the year-to-date high of over $10 billion. Falling open interest is a sign that investors are using less leverage to bet on the coin. Historically, cryptocurrencies do well when the open interest is rising. Another sign is the performance of the futures funding rate, which has remained flat in the past few weeks. It even moved downwards below zero on Friday. A falling funding rate is normally a sign that investors in the futures market expect the token future price to be lower than the spot one. All this is happening because of the giant liquidation that happened on October 11 when tokens worth over $610 million were wiped out. Ripple price death cross pattern XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals have contributed to the ongoing XRP price crash that has pushed it from a high of $3.66 in July to the current $2.29. It has continued to form a series of lower lows and lower highs as the downtrend continued. Ripple price has now formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages have crossed each other. The token remains below the Supertrend indicator and the Ichimoku cloud. Therefore, technicals suggest that the XRP price will continue falling as sellers target the next key support level at $2, which is much lower than the current level. A move above the resistance at $2.5 will invalidate the bearish outlook.

This stunning Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most significant achievements in cryptocurrency history, with BTC trading at $98,032 on the Binance USDT market according to Bitcoin World market monitoring. What’s Driving This Massive Bitcoin Price Surge? The current Bitcoin price surge didn’t happen overnight. Several key factors have contributed to this impressive upward movement. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major corporations and investment firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Moreover, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions has boosted investor confidence significantly. Market analysts point to multiple catalysts behind this Bitcoin price surge. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event creates natural supply constraints, while global economic uncertainty drives demand for decentralized assets. Additionally, technological improvements in the Bitcoin network have enhanced its utility and security features. How Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Compare to Previous Highs? This current Bitcoin price surge represents a substantial breakthrough compared to previous market cycles. The $98,000 level marks a crucial psychological barrier that many traders had been watching closely. Historical data shows that when Bitcoin breaks through major resistance levels, it often creates momentum for further gains. Consider these key comparisons: Previous all-time high: $69,000 in November 2021 Current trading level: $98,032 represents 42% increase Trading volume: Significantly higher than previous peaks Market sentiment: More institutional participation What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This Bitcoin price surge presents both opportunities and considerations for cryptocurrency investors. For long-term holders, the breakthrough validates their investment strategy and demonstrates Bitcoin’s growing store of value proposition. However, new investors should approach with careful research and risk management. Key considerations for investors: Diversification remains crucial despite the impressive Bitcoin price surge Volatility management through proper position sizing Long-term perspective rather than short-term speculation Security measures for digital asset storage Will the Bitcoin Price Surge Continue? Market experts remain cautiously optimistic about the sustainability of this Bitcoin price surge. Technical analysis suggests strong support levels have formed, while fundamental factors like increasing adoption and limited supply continue to provide tailwinds. However, investors should always prepare for potential corrections in volatile markets. The current Bitcoin price surge reflects growing mainstream acceptance and technological maturity. As more traditional financial institutions integrate Bitcoin services and more countries establish clear regulatory frameworks, the foundation for continued growth appears solid. Nevertheless, responsible investing practices remain essential. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $98,000? The Bitcoin price surge resulted from combined factors including institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, supply constraints from the upcoming halving, and increased global demand for alternative assets. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin after this price surge? While timing markets is challenging, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, investors should only allocate funds they can afford to lose and maintain a diversified portfolio. How high could Bitcoin price go from here? Predictions vary widely among analysts, with some projecting six-figure prices within the next year. However, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. What risks should I consider during a Bitcoin price surge? Key risks include market volatility, regulatory changes, technological risks, security concerns, and potential market corrections after rapid price increases. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price surge? This depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Some investors take profits during surges, while others maintain long-term positions. How can I safely buy Bitcoin during a price surge? Use reputable exchanges, enable security features like two-factor authentication, store assets in secure wallets, and only invest through regulated platforms when possible.

Banks claim stablecoin perks amount to “indirect interest,” while Coinbase insists the law applies only to stablecoin issuers and warned that banks are trying to control how consumers use their own money. Despite the pressure, Coinbase’s policy chief Faryar Shirzad says he is still confident that regulators will rely on the law’s plain text rather than expand its scope. Coinbase Clashes With Banks Crypto exchange Coinbase sharply criticized a coalition of US banking groups for urging regulators to ban merchant rewards, cashbacks and discounts tied to stablecoin payments, calling the proposal “unamerican” and an overreach that goes beyond what the law requires. The dispute centers on the GENIUS Act, which bars stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield to token holders. Banking lobbyists argue this prohibition should extend indirectly to crypto exchanges and affiliated businesses, as they claim rewards offered by third parties amount to “indirect interest” if those entities have financial ties to the stablecoin issuer. Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad rejected that interpretation in a post on X , and called on regulators to “stick to the statutory text.” He also warned that bank lobbyists are trying to dictate how Americans use their own money after a stablecoin is issued. He argued that the banking sector’s stance is rooted in fear that stablecoins could disrupt the traditional financial system, where banks rely heavily on customer deposits to support lending. That concern isn’t unfounded. In fact, a US Treasury estimate from April suggested widespread stablecoin usage could pull more than $6.6 trillion in deposits out of banks. Coinbase also claims stablecoins could meaningfully reduce merchant payment costs, including the more than $180 billion in card fees paid by US retailers in 2024. If third-party rewards programs are shut down, Coinbase argues, merchants and consumers would be pushed back toward traditional card networks that benefit from high fees. Banking groups, however, seem determined to block any stablecoin-based payment model that could erode bank deposits or challenge entrenched payments infrastructure. Crypto exchanges have clear incentives to defend stablecoin usage , as higher stablecoin payment and trading activity generates additional revenue. Many exchanges issue branded credit cards offering crypto rewards or cashbacks, a model Coinbase now worries could be jeopardized if regulators adopt the banks’ interpretation. Even so, Shirzad said he is still hopeful that “common sense will prevail” and that regulators won’t expand the GENIUS Act’s restrictions beyond what Congress intended.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-14 05:30:00

This Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal represents a strategic shift that could signal important market trends for the popular decentralized exchange token. What Does This Galaxy Digital UNI Withdrawal Really Mean? When institutional players like Galaxy Digital move assets off exchanges, it typically indicates a long-term holding strategy. The recent Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal involved 324,000 UNI tokens removed from Binance and Bybit, suggesting the company sees value in accumulating this asset rather than trading it actively. This type of movement often precedes price appreciation because it reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. Moreover, institutional Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal actions frequently influence retail investor behavior and market sentiment. Why Are Exchange Withdrawals So Important? Understanding the significance of exchange movements helps decode market psychology. Here’s why this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal matters: Reduced selling pressure – Tokens moved to cold storage cannot be immediately sold Long-term confidence – Institutions typically hold assets they believe will appreciate Market sentiment indicator – Large withdrawals often precede bullish movements Supply dynamics – Less circulating supply can lead to price increases The timing of this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal comes as the broader crypto market shows signs of recovery, making the move particularly noteworthy for UNI token holders and potential investors. How Does This Impact UNI Token Investors? For current UNI token holders, this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal could be interpreted as a positive signal. When respected institutions demonstrate confidence in an asset through accumulation rather than distribution, it often validates the investment thesis for retail participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that while the Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal suggests optimism, it doesn’t guarantee price appreciation. Market conditions, broader crypto trends, and UNI-specific developments will ultimately determine the token’s performance. What Can We Learn From Institutional Moves? Tracking institutional activity like this Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal provides valuable insights into market sentiment. Institutions typically conduct extensive research before making significant moves, making their actions worth monitoring for retail investors. The pattern of withdrawing assets from exchanges for long-term holding has historically preceded major bull runs in individual tokens and the broader market. This particular Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal fits that pattern, suggesting potential accumulation phase beginning. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Market Movements The recent Galaxy Digital UNI withdrawal represents more than just a transaction – it’s a statement of confidence in UNI’s long-term value proposition. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, institutional moves like this deserve attention from anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets and investment strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is the significance of withdrawing tokens from exchanges? Withdrawing tokens from exchanges typically indicates a long-term holding strategy since assets moved to private wallets are less likely to be sold immediately. How much UNI did Galaxy Digital withdraw? Galaxy Digital withdrew 324,000 UNI tokens worth approximately $2.4 million from Binance and Bybit exchanges. Does this mean UNI price will increase? While large withdrawals often precede price increases due to reduced selling pressure, many factors influence cryptocurrency prices beyond single institutional moves. Why is Galaxy Digital’s move important? As a respected institutional player, Galaxy Digital’s actions often influence market sentiment and can signal confidence in specific assets. Should I buy UNI because of this withdrawal? Investment decisions should be based on comprehensive research and personal risk tolerance, not just single institutional movements. How can I track similar institutional moves? Various blockchain analytics platforms and crypto news services track large wallet movements and exchange flows for major cryptocurrencies.

Tether dominance refers to USDT’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Currently sitting at $184 billion, this stablecoin has become the go-to safe haven during market turbulence. When investors get nervous about volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they often flock to Tether as a digital dollar alternative. This flight to safety creates the Tether dominance patterns we’re seeing today. Why Should You Care About Tether’s Market Position? The current Tether dominance level matters because it coincides with significant market pressure. Bitcoin has dropped 11% this month alone, while other major cryptocurrencies follow similar downward trajectories. Historical data reveals that rapid increases in Tether dominance frequently occur at the beginning of bear markets. Moreover, this shift often aligns with technical indicators like the MACD crossing above the zero line. Consider these key implications of rising Tether dominance: Increased market uncertainty and risk aversion Potential prolonged cryptocurrency price declines Higher trading volume in stablecoins versus volatile assets Reduced liquidity across altcoin markets How Can Investors Navigate This Tether Dominance Environment? Understanding Tether dominance patterns provides valuable insights for portfolio management. During periods of high Tether dominance, consider rebalancing your holdings toward more stable assets. Many experienced traders use these signals to adjust their risk exposure and protect their capital. However, remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results – always conduct your own research. What’s Next for Cryptocurrency Markets? While current Tether dominance levels suggest caution, they don’t necessarily predict long-term market direction. Cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and can shift rapidly. The increasing Tether dominance does highlight growing investor preference for stability during uncertain times. Monitoring these trends helps you make informed decisions about when to enter or exit positions. To summarize, the rising Tether dominance serves as an important market indicator that demands attention. While it suggests potential bearish conditions ahead, smart investors use this information to strategize rather than panic. By understanding what drives Tether dominance changes, you can better position yourself for whatever market conditions emerge. Frequently Asked Questions What is Tether dominance? Tether dominance measures USDT’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market value. It indicates how much of the market’s value is held in this particular stablecoin. Why does rising Tether dominance signal a bear market? When Tether dominance increases, it typically means investors are selling volatile cryptocurrencies and moving into stablecoins. This risk-off behavior often precedes or accompanies market downturns. How high has Tether dominance reached? Tether dominance has climbed to its highest level since April, with USDT’s market cap reaching $184 billion amid broader cryptocurrency market declines. Should I sell my cryptocurrencies when Tether dominance rises? Not necessarily. While rising Tether dominance suggests caution, it should be one of many factors in your decision-making process. Consider your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and market analysis before making changes. What other indicators should I watch with Tether dominance? Monitor Bitcoin dominance, trading volumes, MACD indicators, and broader market sentiment alongside Tether dominance for a comprehensive market view. Can Tether dominance predict market bottoms? Historically, extremely high Tether dominance has sometimes coincided with market bottoms, as it indicates maximum fear and potential buying opportunities, though this isn’t guaranteed.

Here's Why and the Latest Data!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-drop-sharply-heres-why-and-the-latest-data/,"The cryptocurrency market has seen a sharp sell-off in recent hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has fallen below $97,000, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. The downtrend wasn't limited to Bitcoin and spread to altcoins as well. Ethereum (ETH) fell 9.1% to $3,180, Ripple (XRP) fell 6.6% to $2.30, Solana (SOL) fell 8% to around $142, Binance Coin (BNB) fell 5%, Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 6.3%, and Cardano (ADA) fell 7.4%. The decline is attributed to the prolonged shutdown of the US federal government, which prevented the Fed from reaching key economic indicators. The decline is driven by the growing likelihood that the Fed will hold interest rates steady in December. As investor confidence eroded, Bitcoin fell back below $100,000, and riskier assets experienced a major correction. Liquidation pressure in the futures market also increased simultaneously, amplifying losses. According to Coinglass data, the majority of the liquidations over the past 24 hours came from long positions. A total of $891 million in long positions were liquidated, while $132 million in short positions were liquidated. The data predicts that if Bitcoin falls below $95,000, long liquidity on major centralized exchanges (CEX) could reach $723 million. Conversely, if Bitcoin rises above $99,000, short liquidity is estimated to be around $718 million. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Drop Sharply!

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is down 4% this week as the market remains bearish. The price continues to hold above the $3,000 support, but buyers appear absent, which may extend the downtrend. With sellers in control since the start of November, momentum indicators such as the MACD and RSI are starting to look oversold on lower timeframes, including the 4-hour. A bullish divergence is also appearing, which gives hope for a relief rally soon. Looking ahead, Ethereum may bounce to recover some of the recent losses, but the resistance at $3,800 could stop any attempts at a significant reversal. Source: TradingView Ripple (XRP) Surprisingly, XRP is up 3% compared to the same period last week. Despite this brief bounce, the momentum remains bearish, and the price is struggling to stay above the $ 2.30 support. The current performance is largely tied to the launch of the first spot XRP ETF this week. One positive aspect is that the sell volume has been declining since October, which could signal that bears are becoming exhausted. That could allow buyers to return. The key resistance is found at $2.43. Looking ahead, XRP remains in a challenging position, but there is a real chance that buyers can reverse this trend if the support at $ 2.30 is defended effectively. Source: TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA remains close to 50 cents despite several attempts to move higher. The bias is bearish, and the price closed the week with a 3% loss. There is simply no force to push the price higher at this time. While the momentum indicators show some exhaustion on the sellers’ side, this downtrend can continue for some time until buyers return. Key support levels are found at 50 and 45 cents. Looking ahead, ADA needs to break away from this downtrend. That starts by moving above 60 cents. However, this seems like a challenging task now. Source: TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin lost its sparkle in the past few weeks as its price continues to make lower lows. The price is down 5% this week and has also lost the support at $1,000, which has now become resistance. This is bearish. The next significant support is found at $900. Should that fail as well, buyers could then retreat to the $800 level. With momentum favouring bears right now, it is unlikely for any recovery to happen any time soon. Looking ahead, best to let BNB correct and find a key support that can hold before considering any exposure. Source: TradingView Hyperliquid (HYPE) If we zoom out, HYPE has been making lower highs since September. This puts the price action in a bearish trend with strong support around $36. However, repeated tests of this level could lead to a breakdown with lower lows. At the time of this post, the momentum is bearish and the price closed the week with a 4% loss. The optimism and hype that once characterised this cryptocurrency seems to have vanished. But this could also present an opportunity to accumulate at a discount. Looking ahead, HYPE needs to hold above $36 to stop the downtrend. Any failure there will see sellers encouraged to continue their pressure.

In a surprising revelation, Kraken CEO Arjun Sethi has made it clear that the company’s Kraken US listing isn’t happening anytime soon. This strategic decision comes despite growing anticipation in the crypto community about when one of the world’s largest exchanges would make its market debut. Why Isn’t Kraken Rushing Its US Listing? During a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Sethi explained the company’s thoughtful approach. Kraken maintains strong financial health as a private entity, eliminating any urgent need for public funding. The company effectively manages its risks and operates from a position of strength rather than necessity. This calculated delay in the Kraken US listing reflects several key advantages: Financial independence without shareholder pressure Greater operational flexibility in a volatile market Ability to focus on long-term strategy over quarterly results Reduced regulatory complexity during market uncertainty What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The delayed Kraken US listing actually signals positive news for the broader crypto ecosystem. When a company of Kraken’s stature can afford to wait, it demonstrates the maturity and resilience of the cryptocurrency industry. Private companies maintaining strong financial positions without public markets indicate healthy industry fundamentals. Moreover, this approach allows Kraken to: Continue innovating without public market scrutiny Weather regulatory changes more effectively Maintain strategic focus on user experience and security Build stronger foundations before public exposure How Does This Compare to Other Crypto Exchanges? Kraken’s stance on its US listing timeline differs significantly from some competitors who rushed to public markets. This patience reflects Sethi’s confidence in the company’s current trajectory and financial management. The decision suggests that Kraken values strategic timing over being first to market. The company’s approach highlights several benefits of remaining private: Avoiding short-term market pressures Maintaining control over company direction Reducing compliance costs and complexity Focusing on core business operations What’s Next for Kraken’s Growth Strategy? While the Kraken US listing remains on the distant horizon, the company continues to expand its services and global presence. Sethi emphasized that being private doesn’t limit their ambition—it actually enhances their ability to execute long-term plans without quarterly performance pressures. The company’s current priorities include: Enhancing platform security and features Expanding into new markets and services Building stronger regulatory relationships Developing innovative crypto products Conclusion: Strategic Patience in a Rapid Market Kraken’s deliberate approach to its US listing demonstrates remarkable confidence in an industry known for rapid moves. This calculated patience suggests that when Kraken eventually does go public, it will be from a position of undeniable strength rather than financial necessity. The delay ultimately benefits users and the broader crypto ecosystem by allowing continued focus on innovation and security. Frequently Asked Questions Why is Kraken delaying its US listing? Kraken’s CEO states the company is financially strong and doesn’t need immediate public funding, allowing them to focus on long-term strategy without quarterly pressure. When does Kraken plan to go public? No specific timeline has been announced. The company considers going public a future possibility rather than an immediate priority. How does this affect Kraken users? Users benefit from continued focus on platform improvements and security without the distractions of public market requirements. Is Kraken financially stable without going public? Yes, according to CEO Arjun Sethi, the company maintains strong financial health and effective risk management as a private entity. Will Kraken consider listing outside the US? The current discussion focuses specifically on US listing plans, though the company operates globally and could consider other markets. How does this compare to Coinbase’s approach? Kraken is taking a more patient approach compared to Coinbase’s earlier public listing, reflecting different strategic priorities.

Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Booking Profits In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the supply of the Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs). These are referred to as the investors holding their coins for a period longer than 155 days, without selling or involving them in a transaction on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Most Fearful Since March: Is A Bottom Near? Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their long holding times are usually considered to be resolute entities. Despite their resilience, however, there are times when even these diamond hands can decide to part with their holdings. One such time happens to be right now. As the below chart shared by Glassnode shows, the Bitcoin LTHs have been reducing their supply recently. This latest wave of selling from the LTHs isn’t their first for the cycle. As is apparent in the graph, these HODLers sold into both the 2024 rallies as well. In between these selloffs, their supply was rising with significant speed. Something to note is that while LTH selling is instantly registered in the chart, the same isn’t true for buying. When the LTH supply grows, it doesn’t mean any accumulation is happening in the present. Rather, what it implies is that some coins were bought five months ago, which have now been held long enough to clear the LTH threshold. The last wave of coin maturation into the LTH cohort peaked in mid-2025. Since then, the group has been shedding coins at a variable rate. The latest trend has clearly been that of acceleration, as the below chart visualizes. The accelerating wave of distribution from the LTHs has arrived as Bitcoin has been suffering from bearish momentum. It’s possible that some of the HODLers are thinking this could be their last chance to take profits, so they have decided to exit.

Historically, bull markets have sustained so long as fresh demand has kept coming in to absorb the selling from the diamond hands, so it remains to be seen whether the price plunge will be met with an injection of demand, or if this selling will lead into an extended bearish phase for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $98,500, down 3% over the last 24 hours.

In his words, “The math behind XRP is simple because it’s built to bridge every major asset class.” He linked to a YouTube video , featuring remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. At the Ripple Swell 2025 conference , Garlinghouse explored XRP’s structure supporting its role as a global liquidity bridge that connects markets for bonds, foreign exchange, commodities, and tokenized assets. In the video, Aljarrah explained that most people view XRP merely as a cryptocurrency to trade. Whereas, in reality, it was engineered to serve as a foundational mechanism for global value transfer . He argued that its design enables it to efficiently move trillions in liquidity, positioning it as a settlement instrument for both institutional and cross-border payments. This, according to him, makes the asset’s high valuation a matter of utility and necessity rather than speculation. The math behind $XRP is simple because it’s built to bridge every major asset class, bonds, FX, commodities, and tokenized debt. As global liquidity consolidates through drops, price becomes a function of utility. That’s how $10,000+ per XRP is achieved. https://t.co/58xzv1KvUv — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 10, 2025 Fractionalization and Liquidity Efficiency A key component of Aljarrah’s reasoning centered on XRP’s fractional divisibility. Each token can be divided into 1 million smaller units known as drops. He explained that this allows transactions of any size, from micro to institutional scale, without friction. For example, at $10,000 per XRP, a single drop would equal one cent , maintaining usability for small payments and improving efficiency. “A $1 billion cross-border payment at $1 per XRP requires $1 billion XRP,” he said. “At $10,000 per XRP, that same payment only requires $100,000 XRP.” He stated that this dynamic reduces slippage, stabilizes volatility, and accelerates settlement times, enhancing XRP’s role as an institutional-grade liquidity solution . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supply, Demand, and Global Financial Scale Aljarrah highlighted that XRP’s fixed 100 billion supply and global liquidity demand mathematically justify a higher valuation. The fundamental analyst referenced $7 trillion in daily FX trades and $700 trillion in derivatives. This explains that even small adoption levels could require XRP to represent significant value. Using cross-border payments as an example, he said that if 1% of $150 trillion in annual volume, or about $1.5 trillion, were bridged by $25 billion in circulating XRP, “each XRP would represent $60,000 in bridged value.” Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Vision Garlinghouse’s closing remarks at Swell 2025 highlighted Ripple’s growth and its integration with major financial institutions , payment providers, and ETF issuers. He described the moment as “the rewiring of financial infrastructure.” Aljarrah added that XRP’s finite supply, liquidity, and utility form a system where “the price is infinite if you really think about it.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

By 2028, NEAR is expected to rise to a maximum price of $8.99, driven by increasing adoption and ecosystem growth. Looking ahead to 2031, NEAR Protocol could experience a substantial surge, potentially reaching a maximum price of $20.88 or beyond. The rising bearish sentiment within NEAR Protocol’s community is bringing a cautious approach among traders. As NEAR continues to advance its technology and forge strategic partnerships, questions surrounding its current price potential persist, inviting further analysis and exploration of its prospects.

NEAR price dropped by 8.5% at the time of writing. NEAR Protocol has support and resistance at $2.3 and $2.85, respectively. Near Protocol price analysis for November 14 shows that NEAR current value has fallen back to $2.3 after failing to support itself above the $3.00 mark. NEAR Protocol price analysis 1-day chart: NEAR declines toward $2.3 The 1-day NEAR/USD price chart indicates that the NEAR Protocol price rose to $3.20 mark before finding significant resistance levels resulting in a sharp drop below $2.00. However, after a brief stay below the level, the price rose sharply to the $3.00 mark before finding resistance. The rejection at the level sent NEAR back to the $2.3 mark where it trades at press time. NEAR/USDT price chart: TradingView The technical indicators suggest declining bullish momentum as NEAR falls towards the $2.3 mark. The EMAs are below the mean position, and the latest data shows rising bearish pressure.

The bullish rally will be supported by NEAR’s vision of a scalable future and user and developer-friendly architecture that sets it apart from other blockchains. Will NEAR reach $50? The chance of NEAR protocol price reaching the $50 mark depends on various circumstances, such as future network development, market regulations, and the broader cryptocurrency market growth.

Recent data reveals a startling trend: long-term Ethereum holders selling their assets at the fastest pace since December 2021. As ETH prices declined from their late August peak, investors who held the cryptocurrency for 3 to 10 years are now liquidating approximately 45,000 ETH daily based on a 90-day moving average. Why Are Ethereum Holders Selling Now? According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, this represents the highest level of selling activity from this particular cohort in nearly two years. These aren’t day traders or short-term speculators – these are the investors who weathered previous market cycles and believed in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Their decision to sell now raises important questions about market sentiment and future price direction. Understanding the 45,000 ETH Daily Exodus The scale of this selling pressure is significant. Consider these key points: 45,000 ETH represents approximately $70 million in daily selling pressure This selling comes from holders with 3-10 year investment horizons The 90-day moving average smooths out temporary fluctuations This marks the highest selling level since the 2021 market peak What Does This Mean for Ethereum’s Future? When long-term Ethereum holders selling accelerates, it typically signals several market dynamics. First, it indicates profit-taking after significant price appreciation. Second, it may reflect concerns about upcoming market conditions or regulatory developments. However, it’s crucial to remember that market bottoms often form when weak hands capitulate and strong hands accumulate. Historical Context of Ethereum Holder Behavior The current selling pattern mirrors December 2021 activity, which preceded a substantial market correction. However, market conditions today differ significantly. Ethereum’s ecosystem has matured, with growing institutional adoption and technological improvements. The fundamental value proposition remains strong despite short-term price pressure from Ethereum holders selling their positions. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For current investors, this data provides valuable signals: Monitor on-chain metrics for early trend detection Diversify your portfolio across different time horizons Consider dollar-cost averaging during volatility Focus on Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements Market Impact of Sustained Selling Pressure The consistent selling by long-term Ethereum holders creates immediate price headwinds. However, this redistribution of assets can lead to healthier market structure over time. New buyers entering at lower prices may establish stronger support levels. The key question remains whether this represents a temporary adjustment or a fundamental shift in investor sentiment toward Ethereum. The trend of Ethereum holders selling at current levels provides crucial market intelligence. While concerning in the short term, it’s essential to view this within the broader context of Ethereum’s development trajectory and growing adoption. Market cycles typically see ownership transfer from weak to strong hands during periods of uncertainty. Frequently Asked Questions How significant is 45,000 ETH in daily selling? 45,000 ETH represents substantial selling pressure, equivalent to approximately $70 million daily at current prices. This level of activity from long-term holders is particularly noteworthy. Why are long-term holders selling now? Long-term holders may be taking profits after price appreciation, rebalancing portfolios, or responding to changing market conditions and regulatory concerns. Does this signal a market top for Ethereum? While increased selling from long-term holders often precedes price corrections, it doesn’t necessarily indicate a permanent top. Market dynamics are complex and influenced by multiple factors. How reliable is Glassnode’s data? Glassnode is a respected on-chain analytics provider with reliable tracking methodologies. Their 90-day moving average provides a smoothed view of trends. Should I sell my Ethereum because holders are selling? Investment decisions should be based on your individual strategy, risk tolerance, and research rather than following crowd behavior. What happens after this selling wave ends? Historically, when long-term holder selling subsides, it often marks a potential accumulation phase and can precede price recovery. Found this analysis insightful?

The crypto world just witnessed a staggering XRP transfer of 92,634,593 tokens to Coinbase, worth approximately $214 million. This monumental transaction, reported by Whale Alert, has sent ripples through the entire digital asset space. What Does This Massive XRP Transfer Mean? When an unknown wallet moves nearly 93 million XRP to a major exchange like Coinbase, it typically signals one of several possibilities. The sender might be preparing to sell, which could temporarily impact XRP’s price. Alternatively, they could be moving funds for security reasons or institutional purposes. This particular XRP transfer represents one of the largest single movements we’ve seen this year. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Large Transfers? Large cryptocurrency movements often serve as market indicators that savvy investors monitor closely. Here’s why this matters: Price volatility potential – Large sell orders can temporarily depress prices Market sentiment indicator – Whale movements often precede market shifts Liquidity changes – Exchange transfers affect available trading supply Institutional interest – Massive moves may signal larger market players entering or exiting How Do Whale Alerts Help Crypto Traders? Platforms like Whale Alert provide real-time tracking of significant blockchain transactions. This XRP transfer detection gives traders valuable insights. However, remember that not every large movement means immediate selling. Sometimes whales transfer between their own wallets or move funds for custody purposes. What’s the Real Impact of This XRP Movement? While the numbers seem dramatic, the actual market impact depends on several factors. If the whale sells gradually, the price effect might be minimal. If they dump all at once, we could see temporary price pressure. The key is understanding that one XRP transfer doesn’t necessarily dictate long-term market direction. Smart Strategies for Reacting to Large Crypto Transfers When you see news about significant cryptocurrency movements, consider these approaches: Don’t panic sell based on single transactions Monitor trading volume and price patterns Research broader market context Consider your own investment timeline and strategy This massive XRP transfer reminds us that cryptocurrency markets remain dynamic and occasionally unpredictable. While whale movements capture attention, successful investing requires looking beyond individual transactions to understand broader market trends and fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions What is a whale in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds large amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market prices through their trading activities. Why do whales transfer to exchanges? Whales typically transfer to exchanges when they plan to sell, trade, or sometimes for enhanced security measures and institutional management. Should I sell when I see large transfers? Not necessarily. Large transfers don’t always mean immediate selling. Consider your investment strategy and market context before making decisions. How reliable is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is generally reliable for tracking large blockchain transactions, but always verify information through multiple sources. Can whale movements predict price changes? While whale movements can indicate potential price volatility, they’re not perfect predictors. Many factors influence cryptocurrency prices. What’s the largest XRP transfer ever recorded? While this 92 million XRP transfer is substantial, larger transfers have occurred, including several over 100 million XRP in past years. Found this analysis helpful?
