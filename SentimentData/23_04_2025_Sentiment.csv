With the increasing number of new blockchain initiatives launching, it’s becoming harder to keep track of those that will make waves in the market. Whether you’re looking for quick wins or long-term potential, one thing’s for sure: the blockchain space is packed with competition, and only the best will rise to the top. Today, we’ll dive into three standout projects—Qubetics, SUI, and Astra—and help you figure out which one might be the most imaginative play for your next crypto move. When it comes to choosing a crypto to invest in, it’s crucial to focus on those with strong, tangible use cases, backing from the right partners, and an innovative vision that can address real-world problems. Qubetics, SUI, and Astra all bring something unique to the table, and each one is making waves with its technological advancements. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these projects stand out and why they could be the top crypto to invest in for short-term gains. So, what’s the deal with Qubetics? How does it compare to the competition, such as SUI and Astra? And why should you be keeping an eye on the $TICS token presale? Let’s break it down and find out why the future of blockchain could be in the hands of these rising stars. Qubetics’ Unique Edge in Interoperability and Digital Finance Qubetics is dedicated to bridging the gaps between different blockchain networks, enabling seamless transactions, collaboration, and interaction for businesses, professionals, and everyday users across multiple platforms. The Qubetics network’s primary strength lies in its interoperability, enabling various blockchain ecosystems to connect in ways that were previously impossible. This opens up countless opportunities for decentralized applications (dApps), cross-border payments, and asset tokenization, with Qubetics playing the central role as the connecting hub. How Qubetics Solves Real-World Problems What sets Qubetics apart from other blockchain projects? While many of its predecessors have struggled with scalability, security, and user adoption, Qubetics is designed to address these issues head-on. The platform’s unique approach ensures seamless communication between blockchain systems, a feature that many projects have overlooked. By offering a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) and advanced wallet features, Qubetics is well-positioned to cater to future demands in digital finance, particularly in cross-border payments —a growing pain point in today’s financial landscape. Additionally, the Qubetics ecosystem enables the tokenization of real-world assets, which will revolutionize the way businesses interact with blockchain technology, particularly in industries such as banking, real estate, and beyond. As companies seek more efficient ways to manage payments, investments, and assets, Qubetics provides the right framework to do so securely and effectively. Qubetics Presale – A Red-Hot Opportunity Currently in Stage 31 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has sold over 509 million tokens to more than 25,100 holders, raising more than $16.3 million. The presale is still ongoing, with the $TICS token priced at $0.1902. Analysts are predicting massive potential with a return on investment (ROI) of 425% at $1, 2527% at $5, and an incredible 7783% ROI at $15 after the mainnet launch. Analysts’ Predictions for Qubetics’ Future: Current $TICS Price : $0.1902 per token $TICS at $1 After the Presale : 425% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale : 2527% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch : 7783% ROI Analysts predict that $TICS will be valued between $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. This makes Qubetics one of the most exciting projects in the market today, with strong growth potential in the short term. Sui (SUI) Cryptocurrency: Stepping into the Spotlight with Game-Changing Updates Sui (SUI) is making significant strides in the crypto world, gaining attention from both mainstream media and investors alike. Recently, Canary Capital Group filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will track Sui’s spot price. This marks a significant step for the cryptocurrency, as it continues to demonstrate strong potential for adoption in traditional financial markets. Additionally, Sui is working on simplifying blockchain access by introducing Zero Knowledge Login and Sponsored Transactions, which will enable users to access the network seamlessly. These innovations are poised to make Sui a more user-friendly platform, helping it attract a broader base of users and solidify its place in the growing blockchain ecosystem. Astra Space’s Strategic Expansion: Rocket 4 Program Gets Boost from New Leadership and Defense Contracts Astra Space is positioning itself for future growth with significant developments in its Rocket 4 program. The company recently appointed Dr. Alan Weston, a renowned missile defense expert, to lead the development of Rocket 4. This is a crucial move as Astra aims to strengthen its capabilities for providing responsive space access. In addition to the leadership change, Astra secured a multi-million-dollar contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to support the development of its Rocket 4 program, including the expansion of its production facilities. This contract, valued at up to $44 million, signifies the government’s confidence in Astra’s ability to provide reliable and cost-effective launch services. Furthermore, Astra has now transitioned into a private company, completing its privatization process, which could offer the company more flexibility in its operations and long-term growth strategy. Interoperability – The Key to Blockchain’s Future The concept of interoperability is central to the success of blockchain technology. It refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and collaborate, enabling users to transfer assets and data seamlessly across various platforms. Interoperability enables the creation of decentralized applications that are not limited to a single blockchain, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and broadening the scope of blockchain’s potential use cases. Benefits of Interoperability in Blockchain: Cross-Chain Transactions : Users can transfer assets between different blockchains, enabling smoother transactions and reducing the need for intermediaries. Increased Scalability : Interoperability allows blockchain networks to scale more efficiently, handling larger transaction volumes without sacrificing speed or security. Enhanced User Experience : With interoperable systems, users can interact with various decentralized platforms using a single wallet or interface, streamlining their experience. In a world where blockchain is becoming an increasingly critical part of the financial ecosystem, interoperability is the key to unlocking its full potential. Projects like Qubetics are at the forefront of this trend, offering solutions that facilitate cross-chain communication and enable users to benefit from a connected, decentralized future. Conclusion: Which Crypto to Choose for Short-Term Gains? With numerous options available, selecting the right crypto project can be a daunting task. However, when it comes to short-term investments, Qubetics, SUI, and Astra each present compelling cases. Qubetics , with its focus on interoperability and innovative blockchain solutions, is well-positioned for significant growth, especially as its presale continues to gain traction. SUI’s speed and scalability, along with its decentralized infrastructure, make it a strong contender in the blockchain space, while Astra’s focus on tokenized assets ensures it will be a key player in the digital finance revolution. Ultimately, the decision on which project to back comes down to your goals and risk tolerance. For those seeking a project with massive upside potential, Qubetics ($TICS) presents one of the most exciting opportunities in the market today.

SUI was last trading around $2.70, up around 20% on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump appeared to signal taking an easier approach to the trade war with China. JUST IN: President Trump says Chinese tariffs will come down substantially and he will go easy on China. pic.twitter.com/mVVzRwPjem — BRICS News (@BRICSinfo) April 22, 2025 That was the trigger for a major risk asset rally, as fears of tariff-induced economic weakness subsided. As traders piled back into risk assets, the Sui price snapped a downtrend going all the way back to the start of 2025. It also mustered its first major breakouts above its 21 and 50 DMAs since early 2025. Technically speaking, the door has now been opened to a substantial rally in the near term. Bulls will be focused on a possible near-term retest of the 200DMA just above $3.0. A break above here could open the door to a rapid surge all the way back to the record highs printed in early 2025 above $5.0. So Sui could feasibly be looking at 2x gains in the near future. Sui Price Might 2x, But Altcoin Season Isn’t Back Yet That said, traders would do well not to get overly enthusiastic about the start of a new “ altcoin season”.

SEND $ETH TO $10,000 NOW!!! pic.twitter.com/qhAlWeR9uR — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 22, 2025 If Trump is backing off from the trade war, that’s a major relief for the market that paves the way for further near-term upside. But macro risks remain elevated. Trade war uncertainty plus austerity by the US government remain major downside risks to the US economy, with recession risks still elevated. And, given an elevated risk of sticky inflation thanks to tariffs, the Fed under Chairman Jerome Powell will be reluctant to “save the markets/economy” with aggressive easing should the economy roll over. Evidence of an impending recession could yet trigger a reversal in sentiment. With the economy not yet “out of the woods”, traders should remain suspicious of the longevity of altcoin rallies. Traders should remember that the real “rocket fuel” behind past altcoin seasons have been massive floods of liquidity from central banks. Yes, global M2 is rising as central banks around the world ease. Global Liquidity (M2) x Bitcoin Price Send it. pic.twitter.com/fk6d9CMQ80 — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) April 22, 2025 But altcoins won’t really pop until the Fed follows, and massive Fed easing remains some way off. There is a chance that the Sui price could retest record highs in the near future, but the chances of a meaningful breakout remain low, unless the US economy remains remarkably resilient to a slowdown and inflation. Stack Sui Macro conditions remain unfavorable for a renewed altcoin season. Savvy long-term investors will view this as an opportunity to continue stacking high-quality altcoins like Sui at discount prices. And Sui is certainly an altcoin worth stacking. The blockchain’s rapid late-2024 ascent positions it as a frontrunner for the next altcoin market surge. Boasting over 25 million active accounts and $1.36 billion in TVL by late 2024, Sui is already demonstrating robust on-chain adoption, much more than can be said for the vast majority of altcoins out there. Projects like Cetus, a leading DEX with $105 million TVL, and NAVI Protocol, a lending platform surpassing $135 million TVL, underscore its thriving DeFi ecosystem. Sui’s roadmap, leveraging the Move programming language and parallel transaction processing, ensures scalability and speed, rivaling Solana and Ethereum. And Innovations like the SuiPlay0X1 gaming console and USDC integration further cement Sui’s potential to lead blockchain innovation. Sui is the best network on which to build games.

But crypto traders are likely to look back on Trump’s second term as a “glory age” for crypto. The Trump administration is ardently pro-crypto and seeks to foster growth in the industry. Over the coming years, it seems highly unlikely that leading coins like Sui won’t perform very well. Traders shouldn’t rule out a potential Sui price of $10 or even $20 per token by the end of Trump’s term.

The survey was conducted by the Korea Financial Consumer Protection Foundation (KFCPF), the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on April 22.

(Source: CoinGecko) The survey also found that 52% of respondents said they had “made a profit” through their crypto investments. And while over three-quarters of the respondents said they had traded or currently hold Bitcoin (BTC) , the survey showed that South Koreans are also altcoin-keen. On average, respondents said they hold or have traded more than three types of coin. Bitcoin took first place in the popularity stakes with 76%. Following behind were Ethereum (ETH) with 52.8%, XRP with 32.2%, Dogecoin (DOGE) with 24.6%, and Solana (SOL) with 14.7%. Most of the respondents said their crypto buys were a form of investment. However, a large minority said they were also motivated by “curiosity about cryptoassets.” A much smaller minority still said they had bought crypto to access “specific services” or “use in transactions in place of fiat.” Most people said they had made profits under the 10 million won ($7,000) mark, with the majority also saying they had sold their coins less than a year after buying them. The news agency remarked that “short-term, small-sum investments” accounted for the majority of retail activity in the South Korean crypto market.

This achievement underscores the increasing prominence and acceptance of digital currencies in the global financial arena. For anyone following the digital asset space, this is a moment that highlights the remarkable journey of Bitcoin from a niche technology to a major financial force. Understanding Bitcoin’s Ranking Among Global Assets According to data compiled by 8marketcap, which tracks the market capitalization of various global assets, companies, and commodities, Bitcoin’s market cap has reached a level that places it firmly within the top echelon. As of the latest figures, Bitcoin boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.792 trillion. This valuation is derived from its current trading price of around $90,256, reflecting a positive movement of 2.36% over the past 24 hours. What does it mean to be the 8th largest asset globally? It means Bitcoin is now valued higher than numerous established multinational corporations and even some traditional commodities. While the list of assets above it includes giants like gold, major tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Saudi Aramco, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent is a testament to its growing adoption and perceived value. This new Bitcoin ranking isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal about the shifting landscape of global finance. What Drives Bitcoin Market Cap and Price? The impressive rise in Bitcoin’s market cap is fundamentally driven by its price and circulating supply. However, the price itself is influenced by a complex interplay of factors: Increasing Adoption: Both institutional and retail investors are showing growing interest. Large corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offering crypto services significantly boost demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Concerns about inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty often drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value or ‘digital gold’. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap (21 million coins) and events like the halving (which reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created) create scarcity, potentially driving up demand relative to supply. Technological Development: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network and surrounding infrastructure (like scaling solutions and improved security) can increase confidence and utility. Market Sentiment: News, regulatory developments, and overall market psychology play a significant role in short-term price movements. The current positive momentum contributes to the high BTC price we are seeing. The Ripple Effect on the Crypto Market Cap Bitcoin’s performance is often a bellwether for the entire digital asset space. As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, its movements significantly impact the overall crypto market cap . When Bitcoin shows strength and reaches new milestones like the 8th global ranking, it typically boosts confidence across the altcoin market, leading to broader gains. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s success story benefits the wider ecosystem, attracting more attention and capital to digital assets as a whole. The increasing size and legitimacy of Bitcoin as demonstrated by its ranking among the largest assets by market cap also pave the way for greater integration with traditional financial systems. We are seeing more financial products, regulatory discussions, and corporate strategies incorporating Bitcoin, which further solidifies its position and contributes to the growth of the entire crypto market cap . Implications of Bitcoin’s High Ranking Achieving the 8th position is more than just bragging rights. It carries significant implications: Increased Legitimacy: Being ranked alongside world-renowned companies and assets lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Institutional Attraction: Higher ranking and larger market cap make Bitcoin a more viable and attractive option for large institutional investors who require liquidity and market depth. Mainstream Awareness: Such milestones capture headlines and bring Bitcoin into mainstream financial conversations, increasing public awareness and understanding. Store of Value Narrative: Reaching this scale reinforces the argument that Bitcoin can serve as a significant store of value in the digital age. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, this new Bitcoin ranking is a clear indicator of the asset’s maturation and its growing importance in the global financial system. The journey of Bitcoin’s market cap from zero to nearly $1.8 trillion and the 8th position globally is a remarkable story of innovation and market evolution. For investors and enthusiasts, this milestone serves as a powerful validation of the potential of digital assets. It underscores the importance of staying informed about developments in the space, understanding the factors influencing the BTC price , and recognizing the increasing significance of the overall crypto market cap .

He reveals that the action at this support signals renewed buyer confidence and indicates that BCH could be positioning itself for a sustained upward push. With price structure aligning with historical trends, this rebound may be the early sign of a broader bullish continuation forming on the charts. UniChartz also highlighted that Bitcoin Cash remains structurally sound within a descending wedge pattern. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall pattern is holding steady, and the strong defense at the $309 support level is keeping bullish hopes alive. As long as BCH stays above this zone, the technical outlook favors buyers, suggesting that momentum could gradually build in their favor. The analyst suggests that BCH could target the $480 and $500 resistance zone. A move above these levels might trigger a broader rally, with potential mid-term gains stretching toward the $600 and $1,200 range, signaling a strong recovery. Is The Bitcoin Cash Rally Sustainable? While BCH is showing encouraging signs of recovery, the key question now is whether this rally has the strength to hold. Sustained momentum will largely depend on continued buying pressure, strong volume confirmation, and broader market support. Technically, the price remains above the crucial $309 level, and as long as it holds, bulls retain control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Jumps 15%: Is This Just the Beginning of More Gains? However, if this setup fails and the price slips below the crucial $309 support level, it could signal a weakening bullish structure. Such a breakdown would invalidate the current reversal pattern and shift the focus back to lower support zones. In that case, BCH may revisit the next key levels around $211 and potentially $85, where buyers would need to step in to prevent a deeper correction.

Recently, the crypto market witnessed one such significant event: an Ethereum whale offloaded a substantial amount of Ether following a notable price increase. This action immediately caught the attention of the community and on-chain analysts alike. Who Are These Ethereum Whales and Why Do They Matter? In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular digital asset. For Ethereum, this means controlling a significant supply of ETH. These large holders wield considerable influence due to the sheer volume of their holdings. When a whale decides to buy or sell, their actions can potentially impact market liquidity and price dynamics. Their movements are closely watched because they can sometimes signal shifts in sentiment or provide insights into potential future price movements. While not every whale transaction dictates the market, a large, sudden move can certainly create ripples, especially if the market is already sensitive. A Closer Look at the Recent ETH Price Action and Whale Sale According to details shared by pseudonymous on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), a specific anonymous wallet, identified as a whale, executed a significant sale shortly after the Ethereum price experienced a rapid uptick. The report indicates that within a mere 15 minutes, this whale sold 15,000 ETH. The timing is particularly noteworthy. The sale occurred immediately after Ether’s unit price had risen by approximately 4.2% over the preceding hour. This suggests the whale was capitalizing on the recent price momentum to exit a portion of their position. Here are the key transaction details: Amount Sold: 15,000 ETH Asset Received: 24.905 million USDT (Tether) Average Selling Price: Approximately $1,660 per ETH Context: Sale happened within 15 minutes of report, after a 4.2% ETH price rise in the hour prior This transaction size, valued at nearly $25 million, is substantial and highlights the significant capital controlled by such market participants. What Does This On-Chain Analysis Reveal? On-chain analysis is the examination of public blockchain data to gain insights into market activity, sentiment, and potential trends. Analysts like @EmberCN track large transactions, wallet movements, and other on-chain metrics to understand what is happening beneath the surface of exchange order books. In this instance, the on-chain data provided immediate visibility into a major market participant’s actions. It revealed: Profit-Taking Behavior: Selling a large amount of ETH right after a quick price rise strongly suggests the whale was taking profits from their holdings. Liquidity Absorption: The market was liquid enough to absorb a $25 million sale relatively quickly, indicating underlying demand or efficient market mechanisms. Wallet Activity: Tracking this wallet allows analysts to potentially monitor future large movements from the same entity. On-chain analysis offers transparency that isn’t available in traditional markets, allowing anyone to verify transactions and study the flow of assets, albeit without necessarily knowing the real-world identity behind the wallet address. Why Did the Whale Choose to Sell ETH Now? Pinpointing the exact reasons behind a whale’s decision is speculative without direct information, but several possibilities are commonly considered in the world of crypto trading : Profit Realization: The most straightforward reason. The price rose, presenting an opportunity to lock in gains on a significant portion of their investment. Portfolio Rebalancing: The whale might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting capital from ETH into stablecoins (like USDT) or other assets. Anticipating a Pullback: Perhaps the whale believes the recent price surge is temporary and is selling now with the intention of buying back at a lower price later. Funding Other Ventures: The funds could be needed for investments outside of crypto, operational costs, or other financial obligations. Risk Management: Reducing exposure to ETH amidst market volatility or uncertainty. Given the immediate sale following a quick price pump, profit realization or anticipating a short-term pullback are highly probable motivations. How Does This Impact the ETH Price and Broader Crypto Market? A sale of 15,000 ETH, while large, needs to be put into perspective against the total trading volume and market capitalization of Ethereum. Ethereum is a massive network with billions of dollars traded daily across numerous exchanges. The immediate impact on the ETH price from this specific sale appears to have been absorbed by the market without causing a dramatic price collapse. The average selling price of $1,660 indicates the market was buying at that level. However, repeated large sales from whales, or a cluster of whales selling simultaneously, could exert significant downward pressure. Conversely, if whales are accumulating, it can signal confidence and potentially support prices. For the broader crypto market , whale activity in a major asset like ETH is a data point that traders and analysts consider. It contributes to the overall narrative around market sentiment and liquidity. It serves as a reminder that large players are actively managing their positions. Navigating the Crypto Market: What Can You Learn from Whale Activity? For individual investors and traders, observing whale movements through on-chain analysis platforms can be informative, but it’s crucial not to base decisions solely on one or two large transactions. Here are some actionable insights: Whale moves are signals, not guarantees: A whale selling doesn’t automatically mean the price will crash. Understand the context – was it after a pump (profit-taking)? Is there news? Look for patterns: Is this a one-off sale, or is a specific whale or group of whales consistently selling or accumulating? Consider market depth: How easily was the large order absorbed? This tells you about market liquidity. Combine with other analysis: Use on-chain data alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market news for a more complete picture. Manage your own risk: Don’t blindly follow whales. Have your own investment strategy and risk management plan. Understanding whale activity is a valuable tool in the crypto trading toolkit, offering a glimpse into the actions of major players, but it should be used as part of a broader analytical approach. Conclusion: Whale Activity is a Key Data Point The recent sale of 15,000 ETH by an Ethereum whale after a price surge is a clear example of how large holders actively manage their positions in response to market movements. This instance, identified through on-chain analysis , likely represents profit-taking or portfolio adjustment rather than a bearish signal intended to crash the market, especially since the sale was absorbed around the $1,660 mark. While individual whale transactions can influence short-term dynamics, the long-term trajectory of the ETH price and the overall health of the crypto market depend on a confluence of factors, including adoption, development, regulatory news, and broader economic conditions. Keeping an eye on significant on-chain movements provides valuable context for anyone participating in the digital asset space.

43686723,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=162901,1745366418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/43686723.jpeg,"Dragoin’s Presale at $0.0000292 Outpaces PEPE’s 12% Rally and ETH’s Recovery Attempt With a 6,750% ROI Roadmap",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dragoins-presale-at-0-0000292-outpaces-pepes-12-rally-and-eths-recovery-attempt-with-a-6750-roi-roadmap/,"Momentum across crypto is shifting, but not always in the ways expected. While tokens like PEPE and Ethereum (ETH) present familiar narratives of technical bounces and potential chart breakouts, Dragoin $DDGN is proving that building out a functioning product early can be a more effective strategy. Ethereum may have found short-term stability, and PEPE could trigger its next wave with a golden cross formation, but Dragoin is working on long-term engagement through user interaction and real-time rewards. As speculative energy gives way to informed accumulation, Dragoin stands out for what it’s already offering, not just what might come next. Here’s what to look out for. PEPE: Eyeing the Golden Cross PEPE is gaining technical attention as it approaches a golden cross—where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day. This pattern is considered bullish and often signals the beginning of an upward trend. Traders have noted increasing volume alongside this setup, which could support further upside if momentum holds. Currently trading around the $0.000007 range, PEPE is still reacting to the wider meme coin narrative. A breakout past resistance near $0.0000077 could see the price test levels closer to $0.0000090. However, its movement remains highly sensitive to external sentiment, particularly from social media influence and market-wide news. For short-term traders, these signals present opportunity—but for long-term holders, PEPE’s reliance on momentum without additional utility remains a critical factor. Ethereum: Searching for a Floor After weeks of decline, Ethereum is attempting to stabilize. Analysts now believe that ETH may have found a temporary bottom, supported by technical strength forming near the $3,200 mark. While not yet in confirmed recovery mode, the coin’s recent pause in downward momentum has raised expectations of a potential rebound. Market watchers note that Ethereum is still a pillar for decentralized applications and token standards, but current price action is reflecting fatigue. The token’s short-term trajectory is less about innovation and more about volume, trendlines, and overall market recovery. There is optimism for a shift back above $3,500, though upcoming economic indicators and altcoin movement could influence that outcome. While ETH remains a major player, its near-term upside is dependent on factors outside of its core ecosystem. Dragoin: Engaging Users Before Launch Unlike many of its counterparts, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building a community by offering something usable right now. The presale is ongoing in Stage 1, with each token priced at $0.0000292 and a launch price set at $0.002. This pricing path suggests up to 6,750% ROI for early participants. But Dragoin isn’t relying on speculation alone—the tokenomics are clearly outlined, with 50% of the total supply allocated for presale, 30% reserved for ecosystem development, 15% for liquidity, and 5% for the team, which is locked for two years. What makes Dragoin more attractive is its transparent structure. The smart contract will be renounced after launch, and all unsold tokens will be permanently burned—reducing supply and strengthening long-term value. Unlike projects that rely on hype spikes, Dragoin is steadily growing through community referrals, staking plans, and real-time utility. It’s not a placeholder token waiting for functionality; it’s already delivering it. To Sum it Up… PEPE and ETH may attract volume based on historical performance and chart patterns, but Dragoin’s progress is built on consistent delivery. Its game integration, fixed pricing model, and fully mapped token distribution offer clarity in a market often driven by guesswork. Dragoin’s approach doesn’t rely on external triggers—it thrives on continued user engagement and transparent goals. For anyone considering the best crypto for future potential, Dragoin presents a blend of entertainment, structure, and community access. Its early success shows that crypto projects don’t have to wait for a bull cycle to start delivering. Instead of promising future value, Dragoin is creating it now—making it credible among today’s top crypto gainers.

Stellar (XLM) is drawing attention with its ascending triangle setup, suggesting a possible push toward $0.29. Ethereum (ETH) is also gaining interest as it tests major resistance levels, with traders watching for a breakout. While these price formations fuel speculation, BlockDAG is pushing past guesswork. Its Beta Testnet is live and fully operational, supporting smart contracts, staking, and NFT minting. In an industry where delays are common, BlockDAG’s functioning infrastructure stands out. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout With Strong Backing Stellar (XLM) has formed an ascending triangle on the 4-hour chart, signaling a potential breakout. Analysts are watching for a move toward the $0.29 mark. A clean break above the current descending channel could trigger an 18% jump to this resistance zone. Beyond technical indicators, Stellar’s fundamentals offer strong support. The network’s foray into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, in collaboration with Franklin Templeton and Ondo Finance, aims to bring $3 billion in tokenized assets to its blockchain. This development not only boosts Stellar’s utility but also makes it more attractive to institutional investors. Although momentum appears somewhat muted in the short term, the alignment of chart patterns and these real-world initiatives suggests Stellar could be ready to move. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on the $0.29 level for confirmation. Ethereum (ETH) Charts Hint at Upside Despite Exchange Flows Ethereum (ETH) is also showing signs of strength, currently forming an ascending triangle pattern on the weekly chart—a setup that often precedes upward price action. According to Titan of Crypto, ETH could test the top of this formation, possibly reaching $3,600. In the near term, ETH has moved past the $1,550–$1,600 support zone and is nearing resistance at $1,670. A close above this level could open a path toward $2,000. However, caution is needed. On-chain data reveals that over 368,000 ETH have been transferred to exchanges this month, which might create selling pressure. Despite this, the general technical outlook for Ethereum remains positive. Traders are keeping a close watch on these critical levels to gauge where the price might head next. BlockDAG Unlocks Real Utility With Beta Testnet Milestone BlockDAG has reached a significant milestone with its Beta Testnet now fully supporting EVM-based smart contracts, MetaMask connectivity, token burns, staking, and NFT minting. Unlike many projects that rely on future promises, BlockDAG is offering hands-on functionality right now. The latest AMA highlighted these features in action. Users are already creating ERC-20 tokens, staking BDAG, and minting NFTs on-chain. Additionally, a Smart Contract Wizard is coming soon, which will enable even non-developers to launch their own decentralized apps. Meanwhile, the presale continues to accelerate. BlockDAG has now raised $216 million, with its current batch (27) priced at $0.0248. Holders who joined in batch 1 have already seen returns of 2,380%, and more than 19.3 billion BDAG tokens have been sold. While other projects hold back features for later marketing cycles, BlockDAG is delivering now. Its focus on immediate, usable tech is setting it apart as a serious contender among Layer-1 chains. Summing Up! While Stellar and Ethereum attract attention through chart setups and speculative potential, the value of these moves depends heavily on follow-through. Stellar’s tokenization initiatives and Ethereum’s resistance testing are promising, but still speculative. BlockDAG, by contrast, is offering tangible progress. With live smart contracts, staking, and NFTs already active, it is delivering what many others still claim to be developing. Rather than waiting for future milestones, users can interact with its ecosystem right now. As the market continues to seek clarity, BlockDAG is emerging as a chain backed not just by speculation but by real results. In a landscape filled with predictions, BlockDAG is offering performance.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 231,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the native asset of the layer-2 scaling solution Mantle ( MNT ). According to Inmortal, MNT appears to be mirroring Chainlink’s consolidation from 2019 to 2020, which preceded LINK’s ascent from a low of $1.36 to a high of $53 – a whopping 3,797% explosion. “MNT gives me early LINK vibes. Many people think the bull market is over, but there are coins like Mantle that haven’t even started it yet. Conviction play for me.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that MNT could soar to as high as $6 by next year. At time of writing, MNT is worth $0.66. Turning to Bitcoin, Inmortal says BTC’s reaction at one crucial price area will determine whether the crypto king will see new lows this cycle. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BTC may mirror its 2022 price action when it briefly soared above $45,000 before plunging to a bear market low at $16,000. But Inmortal highlights that the bearish outlook will be invalidated if Bitcoin flips a key price level as support. “$95,000 is where we find out if this bounce is a: a) Last exit before new lows b) Local bottom BTC.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $87,355.

With ETF talks, fresh utility updates, and network upgrades, altcoins are pulling ahead of slower-moving layer-1s and offering stronger ROI setups for 2025. Some names have already started gaining traction, while others are flying under the radar. That’s exactly where the best upside lies right now. If you’re looking for top altcoins to buy now, the timing couldn’t be better. Projects with active development, growing ecosystems, and major presale offers are lining up for serious upside. Whether you’re into utility, tech, or early-stage price advantages, this list gives you all three. Let’s start with the one that’s turning a $1 buy into $7 — BlockDAG. 1. BlockDAG – 600% Bonus and 2,380% ROI Setup BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about opportunities right now, thanks to its active presale and massive bonus offers. With over $216 million raised, the presale has moved into Batch 27 at a price of $0.0248, and the coin will launch at $0.05. That’s a 2,380% ROI since the first batch. But what’s really driving momentum is the return of the Golden Ticket code — BDAG1200 — which gives a 600% bonus on all new purchases. That’s turning every $100 buy into $700 worth of tokens, making BlockDAG one of the most rewarding picks among the top altcoins to buy now. Beyond the numbers, the tech is already in action. BlockDAG uses a hybrid consensus model combining DAG scalability with PoW security, launching with 2,000 TPS and aiming for 15,000 TPS in future upgrades. The team has shipped 10,000 mining devices, onboarded 1.2M+ mobile miners, and rolled out tools like a no-code token builder and NFT creator. With 10 CEX listings lined up and its testnet already live, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale — it’s a fast-moving ecosystem with actual traction. All of this makes it one of the strongest contenders for anyone eyeing the top altcoins to buy now. 2. XRP – ETF Hype and Market Rank Boost XRP has bounced back to $2.07 after dipping to $1.60 earlier this April. One major catalyst is that the long-standing SEC lawsuit is reaching a resolution. The SEC is set to settle for $50 million and drop the permanent injunction, which clears a huge hurdle for Ripple’s business. This regulatory clarity is pushing XRP closer to ETF approval, with Polymarket giving it a 77% probability for a spot ETF in 2025. On top of that, XRP just surpassed Ethereum in fully diluted market cap—now standing at $208.4 billion. XRP is also starting to build a stronger DeFi footprint. Its AI-based DEX, XploraDEX, is in its final presale stages, and that’s attracting DeFi-focused communities back to the ecosystem. Analysts have set future targets at $11 and even $57, with some bullish long-term forecasts aiming at $101. The combination of real legal progress, ETF speculation, and DeFi expansion makes XRP one of the top altcoins to buy now if you’re betting on institutional demand coming in later this year. 3. Litecoin – Chart Patterns Hint at a Potential Comeback Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $76.59 and holding strong even after a slight decline from earlier in the year. What’s keeping traders interested right now is the bullish engulfing pattern forming on the weekly charts. While short-term projections point toward a possible dip to $72.75, there’s also upside potential to $126 if momentum holds. With lower volatility and a long history of resilience during BTC corrections, LTC is being eyed as a hedge for altcoin-heavy portfolios. The April outlook shows price ranges between $75 and $126, with the average monthly estimate hovering near $115. That kind of setup—clear support, upside potential, and a proven history—keeps Litecoin on the list of top altcoins to buy now. It’s not the flashiest coin, but for traders looking at predictable returns and stability within alt exposure, LTC continues to hold its ground. 4. Avalanche – Trying to Break Resistance Above $20 Avalanche (AVAX) has moved up to $19.63 after sliding below $15 in Q1. It’s now testing the $20 resistance zone, and a solid breakout could flip its structure bullish for the first time in months. Technicals show room for a push higher if it confirms above $20, and RSI indicators point toward a reversal as it comes off oversold levels. With the token’s strong ecosystem and DeFi presence, this current range is drawing in renewed buyer interest. Price projections for April range between $16.17 and $19.91, but long-term models suggest it could hit $36.60 by December 2025. That would be a 93% gain from current levels. As the Avalanche network continues to improve throughput and scale its subnet architecture, the fundamentals are aligning with the technical rebound. For mid-term growth and a potential breakout setup, AVAX is one of the smarter picks among top altcoins to buy now. 5. Sui – Transaction Volume Surges Past Ethereum SUI has shot past the 500 million transaction mark, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in activity this April. It’s currently priced at $2.14 and showing strong signs of accumulation. A falling wedge pattern is forming on the daily chart, a setup that often triggers bullish reversals. Analysts are pointing to upside targets around $5 in the coming months. Predictions for April range from $2.14 to $7.24, with the average outlook sitting near $4.22. Beyond price action, Sui’s network activity is exploding. Total value locked (TVL) is now at $1.22 billion, and daily DEX volume has crossed $250 million, showing deep on-chain engagement. This isn’t just hype—it’s real usage. With this level of traction, the coin is catching the attention of analysts and traders as one of the top altcoins to buy now for both utility and momentum. It’s shaping up to be a serious contender heading into the second half of the year. Summing Up Sui’s network activity, Avalanche’s breakout setup, Litecoin’s stability, and XRP’s legal clarity all highlight why these are among the top altcoins to buy now. Each offers a unique mix of growth potential, whether through strong fundamentals, technical reversals, or upcoming catalysts like ETF approval. But BlockDAG clearly takes the lead with its unmatched presale momentum, real testnet progress, and the powerful 600% Golden Ticket bonus still live. The ability to secure up to 2,380% returns before launch is a rare opportunity, especially with 10 exchange listings and 15,000 TPS scalability on the roadmap. For anyone scouting serious upside right now, BlockDAG offers the most compelling setup across both new and established altcoins. It’s the one to watch first.

This action underscores the commitment of international law enforcement agencies to dismantle platforms facilitating criminal enterprises, particularly those involving dangerous substances and money laundering. What Exactly Was the Nemesis Market? At the heart of this recent legal action lies the Nemesis Market , a darknet platform that operated outside the reach of standard web browsers, accessible only through specialized software like Tor. Active for a period spanning from 2021 until its eventual seizure in March 2024, Nemesis Market carved out a notorious space for facilitating the trade of illegal goods and services. The sheer scale of its operations is staggering: Transactions: The platform processed over 400,000 illegal transactions. Sales Value: These transactions amounted to nearly $30 million in illicit sales. User Base: Nemesis Market boasted a substantial user base, with over 150,000 registered users. While a wide range of illegal items were likely traded, the DOJ specifically highlighted the sale of dangerous drugs, including fentanyl, a potent opioid contributing significantly to public health crises worldwide. This focus on fentanyl underscores the severe real-world consequences stemming from such online marketplaces. Who is Behrouz Parsarad and What Are the Charges? The focus of the DOJ’s indictment is Behrouz Parsarad , an Iranian national alleged to be the mastermind behind the Nemesis Market’s operations. According to the indictment, Parsarad was not merely a user or vendor but the individual responsible for running the entire illicit enterprise. Parsarad faces serious federal charges, reflecting the gravity of the crimes facilitated by the platform he allegedly controlled: The primary charges against him are: Drug Distribution Conspiracy: This charge relates to his alleged role in facilitating the widespread sale of illegal narcotics through the Nemesis Market. Given the volume and the dangerous nature of the drugs involved (like fentanyl), this carries severe penalties. Money Laundering Conspiracy: Operating an illegal marketplace generating millions requires sophisticated methods to conceal the origin of the funds. This charge alleges that Parsarad engaged in activities designed to launder the nearly $30 million in proceeds from the illicit sales. Darknet markets often utilize cryptocurrencies for transactions, and money laundering in this context typically involves techniques to obfuscate the flow of these digital assets, such as using mixers, tumblers, or multiple wallets. If convicted on these charges, Behrouz Parsarad faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in federal prison, with the potential for a maximum sentence of up to life imprisonment. This potential sentence reflects the significant harm caused by the operation of such a market. The Scope of the DOJ Indictment and International Effort The DOJ Indictment against Behrouz Parsarad is a testament to the persistent efforts of U.S. law enforcement to pursue cybercriminals regardless of their location. However, tackling platforms operating across international borders requires significant collaboration. This case highlights the critical role of international cooperation in dismantling darknet infrastructure. The successful seizure of the Nemesis Market in March 2024 was not solely a U.S. operation. It involved crucial assistance from law enforcement authorities in both Germany and Lithuania. This joint effort demonstrates how countries are pooling resources and intelligence to track down and disrupt complex cybercriminal networks that exploit the internet for illegal purposes. The indictment details how Parsarad allegedly managed the technical infrastructure and financial operations of the market, facilitating transactions that often relied on cryptocurrencies for their pseudonymous nature. The investigation likely involved tracing digital footprints, analyzing blockchain data (where possible), and traditional investigative techniques combined with cyber expertise. Understanding the Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Crime While the core crime here is drug trafficking and money laundering, the operation of darknet markets is intrinsically linked to Cryptocurrency Crime . These platforms overwhelmingly favor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others because they offer a degree of anonymity or pseudonymity compared to traditional financial systems. This makes tracing funds more challenging for law enforcement. However, this case, like many others before it, demonstrates that cryptocurrency transactions are not untraceable. Blockchain analysis firms and law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly sophisticated at following the flow of illicit funds, identifying patterns, and linking digital wallets to real-world identities. The indictment of a darknet market operator sends a clear message: Operating illegal marketplaces online carries severe consequences. International borders offer little protection against determined law enforcement collaboration. The perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency is not absolute and can be overcome by skilled investigators. The fight against Cryptocurrency Crime is multifaceted, involving not just prosecuting market operators but also targeting vendors, buyers, and the infrastructure that supports these illicit economies. This Nemesis Market case is a significant victory in that ongoing battle. Challenges in Policing the Darknet Despite successes like the Nemesis Market seizure, policing the darknet remains incredibly challenging. Operators and users employ various techniques to evade detection: Encryption and Anonymity Networks: Using Tor and other anonymity networks makes it difficult to determine the physical location of servers and users. Cryptocurrency Mixers/Tumblers: Services designed to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency transactions add layers of complexity to financial investigations. Decentralized Structures: Some newer darknet models attempt to use decentralized technologies to make takedowns harder. International Jurisdictions: Coordinating investigations and prosecutions across different countries with varying laws and capabilities is complex and time-consuming. This case highlights that overcoming these challenges requires sustained international partnerships, technological expertise, and long-term investigative commitment. Conclusion: A Blow Against Online Illicit Trade The indictment of Behrouz Parsarad and the seizure of the Nemesis Market represent a substantial blow against the darknet ecosystem that facilitates drug trafficking and other severe crimes. It serves as a stark reminder that operating or participating in such illicit online ventures carries significant legal risks, culminating in severe penalties like lengthy prison sentences. The successful collaboration between the U.S. DOJ and authorities in Germany and Lithuania is a powerful example of how global cooperation is essential in tackling cybercrime that transcends national boundaries. As technology evolves, so too must the methods employed by law enforcement to ensure that the dark corners of the internet do not become safe havens for criminals preying on vulnerable populations. This case reinforces the message that while the digital world offers new frontiers, it does not offer immunity from justice for those who choose to engage in illegal activities.

ASIC argued that the features of the Earner product made it a financial product under Australian law that required a license. However, the Court found the product could not meet the legal definitions required to deem it as such. ASIC said in a brief public note it is “considering this decision.” The regulator has yet to venture the matter by the High Court. The ruling is a setback for ASIC, which has ramped up its oversight of cryptocurrency products and platforms in Australia. Court declares Block Earner offered loans, not investments ASIC commenced proceedings against Block Earner on the first of November 2022 — the start of the legal saga. Central to the case was whether the Earner product operated as a conventional investment scheme — which would need to be tightly regulated — or whether it was just a loan agreement between Block Earner and its customers. The Court reasoned that the product was structured as a plain loan. Customers signed agreements to lend their crypto assets to Block Earner for a fixed return. Crucially, there was no pooling of customer assets. The agreement for each customer was separate. Customers also had no interest in Block Earner’s broader business operations or performance aside from earning the agreed interest. The court also held that the structure was not a managed investment scheme. The ruling stated that the product details were clear and that the customers’ rights were fixed and contractual, not dependent on the performance of a pooled investment. This distinction was central to exonerating Block Earner of any wrongdoing. Block Earner celebrates court ruling but rules out reviving product In response to the win, the leadership at Block Earner celebrated the decision as a win for innovation and regulatory clarity. Block Earner’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Karaboga, said, “From the outset, we sought to ensure that our modern product suite could fit into a less-modern regulatory environment.” Block Earner’s chief commercial officer, James Coombes, agreed that clearer treatment of crypto assets would allow companies to build new financial products responsibly. Coombes said that the more crypto assets were treated like existing asset classes, the easier it would be for businesses to innovate. Even though the ruling was in its favor, Block Earner said it has no intention of bringing the Earner product back to market. A spokesman for Block Earner said they were focused on the future and that the ruling freed them to continue building compliant, innovative solutions for Australians seeking safe and secure access to digital finance. The case has wider implications for Australia’s burgeoning crypto economy. According to Block Earner, an estimated four million Australians have been exposed to cryptocurrencies, whether directly or via investment platforms. Legal experts say the ruling could shape how other crypto companies structure and promote products to comply with Australia’s financial regulations . It also indicates that courts might take a more nuanced approach when looking at traditional finance laws used for blockchain-real services until new, digital asset-oriented regulations come on stream.

DeFi Development, a company focusing on AI for commercial real estate, has just made a significant move by adding a substantial amount of Solana (SOL) to its balance sheet. This latest acquisition highlights a growing trend among companies exploring digital asset strategy as part of their financial planning. DeFi Development’s Growing SOL Investment According to recent reports, DeFi Development completed another major SOL investment , purchasing an additional 88,164 SOL tokens. This buy is valued at approximately $11.5 million based on recent market prices. This isn’t their first foray into the Solana ecosystem; the company previously known as Janover, rebranded to DeFi Development and announced its intention to hold SOL as a strategic reserve asset earlier this month. This recent purchase significantly increases their total exposure to the Solana network. The company’s total crypto holdings in SOL now stand at an impressive 251,842 tokens. This makes them a notable player among corporate entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Why a Digital Asset Strategy? It’s fascinating to see companies like DeFi Development, rooted in traditional sectors like real estate and AI, pivot towards integrating digital assets into their financial framework. What drives such a decision? A Digital Asset Strategy can serve multiple purposes: Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like cryptocurrencies can help diversify a traditional portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Potential Growth: Companies may see digital assets as a way to participate in the growth of emerging technologies and potentially outperform traditional investments. Inflation Hedge: Some view cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies or strong network effects, as a potential hedge against inflation, although this is a debated topic. Alignment with Future Trends: For a company like DeFi Development, which leverages AI and technology, holding digital assets might align with its forward-thinking brand identity and potential future business models that could interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies. Market fluctuations can be extreme, potentially impacting the company’s balance sheet value significantly. Analyzing DeFi Development’s Solana Holdings Let’s take a closer look at the numbers behind DeFi Development’s SOL Holdings . The company started accumulating SOL recently and has quickly built up a substantial position. Action Amount Purchased (SOL) Approx. Value (USD) Total SOL Holdings Initial Accumulation (Estimate) ~163,678 ~$21.3 million ~163,678 Latest Purchase 88,164 ~$11.5 million 251,842 (Note: Initial accumulation numbers are estimates based on the reported total holdings minus the latest purchase. Values are approximate based on the $11.5M value of the latest purchase.) This table clearly illustrates the rapid increase in their Solana reserves. It signals strong conviction from the company’s leadership regarding Solana’s future prospects. What Does This Mean for Solana? Large purchases by publicly known entities, even if they are relatively new to the space like DeFi Development, can sometimes have a positive impact on market sentiment for Solana . While an $11.5 million purchase isn’t massive in the context of Solana’s multi-billion dollar market cap, it represents: Institutional/Corporate Interest: It shows that companies outside the traditional crypto industry are looking at Solana as a viable asset for their treasury. Validation: It provides some level of validation for Solana’s technology and ecosystem from external players. Increased Demand: Direct buying pressure, however small relative to total volume, contributes to overall demand for the asset. This continued accumulation as part of their Digital Asset Strategy could inspire confidence among other potential corporate or individual investors watching the space. Key Takeaways from DeFi Development’s Move DeFi Development’s significant SOL Investment offers several insights: The line between traditional corporate finance and the crypto world continues to blur. Solana remains a popular choice for investors and companies looking for high-throughput blockchain platforms. Adopting a Digital Asset Strategy is becoming a more mainstream consideration for businesses. Building substantial Crypto Holdings is a deliberate strategic choice, not just speculative trading, for some companies. It will be interesting to follow DeFi Development’s journey and see how their Solana holdings evolve over time and how this strategy impacts their overall business and financial performance. Conclusion DeFi Development’s latest $11.5 million purchase of Solana underscores a clear strategic shift towards incorporating digital assets into their corporate reserves. With total SOL Holdings now exceeding 250,000, the company is making a notable statement about its belief in the potential of the Solana ecosystem. This move, part of a broader Digital Asset Strategy , highlights the increasing intersection of traditional business sectors with the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As companies continue to explore and adopt digital assets, the landscape of corporate finance is undeniably changing.

43687223,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151608,1745367637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive BANKEX Lawsuit Targets Matter Labs Over ZKSync Tech,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bankex-lawsuit-matter-labs/,"In a development that has sent ripples through the blockchain community, the now-defunct cryptocurrency banking platform, BANKEX, has filed a significant BANKEX lawsuit against Matter Labs, the company behind the popular Ethereum scaling solution, ZKSync. The core of the dispute centers on serious allegations of intellectual property (IP) infringement, claiming that ZKSync’s foundational technology was improperly acquired. What is the Core Claim in the BANKEX Lawsuit? According to reports, including one by CoinDesk, the BANKEX lawsuit alleges that two former employees of BANKEX stole proprietary technology from the company and used it to build ZKSync. This isn’t just a simple disagreement; it’s a direct accusation of theft of intellectual property, a critical asset in the fast-paced world of tech and blockchain development. Key points of the BANKEX claim include: Allegations of technology theft by former BANKEX employees. The claim that this stolen technology was foundational to the development of ZKSync. The naming of specific individuals involved. Matter Labs and ZKSync: The Defendants Respond At the heart of this legal battle is Matter Labs , the developer of ZKSync. ZKSync is a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilizing zk-rollup technology to enable faster and cheaper transactions. Its role in the Ethereum ecosystem is significant, making this lawsuit particularly noteworthy for many users and developers. Matter Labs has not remained silent. The company has publicly denied the claims made by BANKEX. Their stance is that ZKSync is built upon unique technology developed internally. This sets the stage for a potentially complex legal battle where the origin and nature of ZKSync’s technology will be heavily scrutinized. Who Are the Individuals Implicated in the Crypto IP Infringement Claims? The BANKEX lawsuit names specific individuals, tying them directly to the alleged theft and the subsequent development of ZKSync. The individuals named are: Alexandr Vlasov: Currently holds the position of R&D Director at Matter Labs. Petr Korolev: Identified as the founder of blockchain security firm Oxorio. Chris Burniske: A former co-director at Matter Labs is also implicated in the lawsuit. The involvement of these individuals, particularly those currently or formerly holding key positions, adds another layer of complexity and public interest to the case. Their roles and actions during and after their time at BANKEX will likely be central to the legal proceedings. Why Does This Blockchain Lawsuit Matter? This case highlights a growing challenge within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space: crypto IP infringement . As the industry matures and projects become more complex and valuable, disputes over intellectual property are becoming more common. This blockchain lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that innovation in this space, while often collaborative and open-source, still involves proprietary technology and potential legal conflicts. Challenges in such cases often include: Defining and proving ownership of intangible digital assets and code. Tracing the origin and evolution of technology across different entities and individuals. Navigating varying international laws regarding intellectual property. The outcome of the BANKEX lawsuit could potentially set precedents for how IP disputes are handled in the crypto world, influencing future development and collaboration models. What Happens Next? The Path Forward for Matter Labs and BANKEX With Matter Labs firmly denying the allegations, the case is expected to proceed through the legal system. This will likely involve discovery phases, where evidence is gathered, and potentially a trial if a settlement is not reached. The process could be lengthy and complex. For users and investors interested in ZKSync , this lawsuit introduces an element of uncertainty, although Matter Labs continues to operate and develop the network. The focus will be on how the legal proceedings unfold and whether any evidence emerges that could substantiate or refute BANKEX’s claims. This blockchain lawsuit is a developing story, and the crypto community will be watching closely to see how these significant allegations of crypto IP infringement are resolved and what implications they hold for the future of blockchain technology development.

Right now, a significant point of tension is brewing between Europe and the United States over the rapid expansion of Stablecoins . These digital assets, pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, are seeing explosive US Stablecoin Growth , and it’s got European authorities worried. The ECB (European Central Bank) has sounded a clear warning: the European Union’s landmark crypto rulebook, known as the MiCA Regulation , might not be enough to handle the potential risks emanating from across the Atlantic. What Are Stablecoins and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the regulatory clash, let’s quickly recap what Stablecoins are. Think of them as the bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the relative stability of traditional fiat currencies. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose prices fluctuate wildly, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, typically 1:1 with a currency like the US Dollar ($) or the Euro (€). They achieve this stability through various mechanisms, most commonly by holding reserves of the underlying asset (like dollars in a bank account or short-term government bonds). This stability makes them crucial for several reasons: Trading: They allow crypto traders to move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to traditional currency, which can be slow and costly. Payments: They offer a potentially faster and cheaper way to send value globally compared to traditional banking rails. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): They are the backbone of many decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. The market for Stablecoins has grown exponentially, particularly those pegged to the US Dollar, making them a significant force in the global digital economy. Europe’s Answer: The MiCA Regulation Recognizing the growing importance and potential risks of crypto assets, including stablecoins, the European Union developed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA Regulation ). This comprehensive framework aims to provide legal certainty for crypto assets not covered by existing financial services legislation. It sets out rules for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and addresses issues like market integrity, investor protection, and financial stability. For stablecoins, MiCA introduces specific categories: Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs): Stablecoins backed by more than one fiat currency or one or more assets. Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs): Stablecoins backed by a single fiat currency (like USD or EUR). These are treated similarly to traditional electronic money. MiCA imposes strict requirements on issuers of ARTs and EMTs, including reserve requirements, redemption rights, and governance rules. It grants supervisory powers to national competent authorities and, for larger stablecoins deemed ‘significant’, to the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the ECB . Why is the ECB Concerned About US Stablecoin Growth? Despite the existence of the MiCA Regulation , the ECB remains apprehensive, specifically citing the accelerating pace of US Stablecoin Growth . Their concerns stem from several interconnected risks: 1. Financial Stability Risks: If a large, widely used stablecoin were to fail (e.g., due to insufficient reserves or a run), it could trigger contagion across the digital asset ecosystem and potentially spill over into traditional financial markets. Given the dominance of US dollar-pegged stablecoins, a failure could have significant global repercussions, including in Europe. 2. Undermining Monetary Sovereignty: The widespread use of stablecoins pegged to a foreign currency (primarily USD) within the Eurozone could challenge the primacy of the Euro. If people and businesses increasingly conduct transactions in dollar-denominated stablecoins, it could weaken the ECB’s control over monetary policy and potentially fragment the European payment landscape. 3. Capital Flight: If stablecoins become a preferred store of value or medium of exchange, capital could potentially flow out of Euro-denominated assets into dollar-denominated stablecoins, impacting European banks and financial institutions. 4. Dependence on Foreign Infrastructure: Relying heavily on stablecoins issued and managed by entities primarily regulated (or potentially less regulated from the ECB’s perspective) under US jurisdiction creates dependence on foreign infrastructure and regulatory oversight, which the ECB sees as a risk to European strategic autonomy. The ECB’s fears are amplified by the political climate in the US, where figures like President Trump have expressed support for the stablecoin industry, potentially paving the way for further rapid expansion and adoption across borders. Could MiCA Regulation Really Fall Short? The European Commission contends that MiCA Regulation is robust and provides the necessary tools, including powers for the ECB to intervene if significant stablecoins pose risks. However, the ECB’s perspective suggests potential gaps or challenges: Pace of Innovation: The stablecoin market evolves rapidly. Will MiCA be able to keep pace with new models or technologies? Cross-Border Reach: While MiCA regulates issuers operating in the EU, the usage of stablecoins issued elsewhere is harder to control. Can the EU effectively mitigate risks from a globally dominant, non-EU stablecoin? Enforcement Challenges: Ensuring full compliance and effective supervision across multiple member states and with entities whose primary operations are outside the EU is complex. Defining ‘Significant’: The threshold for a stablecoin to be deemed ‘significant’ and thus subject to stricter ECB/EBA oversight might be too high, allowing risks to build up in smaller but numerous stablecoins. The ECB’s concern isn’t necessarily that MiCA is flawed in its design for EU-based issuers, but rather whether it provides sufficient defense against the systemic risks posed by the sheer scale and accelerating momentum of US Stablecoin Growth operating globally. Europe’s Strategic Response: The Digital Euro In light of these concerns and the broader trend towards digital currencies, the ECB has been actively exploring and advocating for a Digital Euro . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s envisioned as a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – digital cash issued directly by the central bank. The push for a Digital Euro is seen as a strategic necessity to safeguard Europe’s monetary sovereignty and offer a public alternative in the face of increasing dominance by foreign-issued stablecoins and private digital payment systems. A Digital Euro would aim to provide: Monetary Sovereignty: Ensure the Euro remains the anchor of the European financial system in the digital age. Financial Stability: Offer a safe, risk-free digital form of central bank money. Innovation: Provide a platform for innovation in payments and financial services within a European framework. Inclusion: Ensure access to digital payments for all citizens. The ECB views the Digital Euro not just as a technological upgrade, but as a crucial tool to counter the influence of non-Euro stablecoins and maintain control over its monetary and payment systems. EU vs. US: A Regulatory and Market Showdown? The current situation highlights a potential divergence in approaches between the EU and the US regarding Stablecoins . While Europe has moved forward with a comprehensive framework under MiCA Regulation , the US approach has been more fragmented, though efforts towards federal legislation are underway. The rapid US Stablecoin Growth , partly fueled by this environment and political endorsements, presents a challenge to the EU’s carefully constructed regulatory perimeter. This isn’t just a regulatory debate; it’s a competition for influence in the future of finance. Will the global digital economy primarily transact in stablecoins anchored to the US dollar, or will other currencies, like the Euro (potentially in digital form), maintain significant ground? Here’s a simplified look at the comparison: Aspect European Union (EU) United States (US) Primary Regulation MiCA Regulation (Comprehensive) Fragmented (State/Federal efforts ongoing) Stablecoin Market Size Smaller (Euro-pegged stablecoins) Larger (USD-pegged stablecoins dominate globally) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Digital Euro (Exploration/Preparation Phase) Digital Dollar (Research Phase, less immediate push) Strategic Goal Safeguard Monetary Sovereignty, Financial Stability via MiCA & Digital Euro Foster Innovation, Address Risks via potential future legislation What Does This Mean for You? (Actionable Insights) For users and businesses operating in or interacting with the European market, the ECB ‘s concerns and the ongoing regulatory developments are important: Stay Informed: Keep track of how MiCA is implemented and enforced, particularly regarding stablecoins. Understand Risks: Be aware that even widely used stablecoins carry risks, and regulatory frameworks like MiCA are designed to mitigate these, but global dynamics (like US Stablecoin Growth ) add complexity. Watch the Digital Euro: The progress of the Digital Euro project could significantly impact the future of payments and digital assets in the Eurozone. Consider Jurisdiction: Understand where the stablecoins you use are issued and regulated, as this impacts your protections and the risks involved. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Digital Finance The ECB ‘s warning about the potential shortcomings of the MiCA Regulation in the face of accelerating US Stablecoin Growth underscores a critical challenge for Europe. It’s a balancing act between embracing digital innovation and protecting financial stability and monetary sovereignty. While MiCA provides a foundational framework, the global nature of Stablecoins , particularly the dominance of dollar-pegged assets, presents ongoing complexities. The push for a Digital Euro is a clear signal that Europe is preparing to defend its economic territory in the digital realm. The coming years will reveal whether MiCA proves sufficient, whether the Digital Euro gains traction, and how the competitive landscape between Euro and dollar-anchored digital currencies evolves. One thing is certain: the future of money is being shaped right now, and the regulatory and strategic decisions made today will have lasting impacts.

43688006,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151619,1745369427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Miners Face Alarming Allegations of Tariff Evasion on ASIC Equipment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-miners-tariff-evasion/,"Recent reports have surfaced regarding alleged practices by some Bitcoin miners importing specialized hardware into the United States. According to CoinDesk, citing industry sources, certain miners are reportedly under-reporting the true value of their ASIC mining equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). What’s Behind the Allegations Against Bitcoin Miners ? The core of the issue revolves around the valuation of high-cost hardware used for cryptocurrency mining. ASIC mining equipment , or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are powerful machines designed specifically for the complex computations required to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These machines can be incredibly expensive, often costing thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per unit. When importing goods into the U States, businesses are typically required to pay customs duties and import tariffs based on the declared value of the goods. These duties and tariffs contribute to government revenue and can influence trade dynamics. The allegation is that some Bitcoin miners are deliberately declaring a lower price for their imported ASICs than what they actually paid. This practice, if true, would allow them to pay significantly less in customs duties and import tariffs, reducing their operational costs. How Does Under-reporting ASIC Mining Equipment Values Work? Import procedures require detailed declarations about the nature, quantity, and value of goods entering the country. Importers must submit documentation, such as commercial invoices, that reflect the transaction’s details. Customs authorities review these documents and may inspect shipments to verify the declarations. Sources cited in the CoinDesk report suggest that some companies might be understating the price on invoices submitted to CBP. Jill Ford, founder of mining equipment procurement specialist BitFord Digital, described this practice as fraudulent and illegal. Ford indicated that while some miners might attempt to under-declare equipment prices by 20-30%, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to get away with it. This suggests that customs authorities may be enhancing scrutiny or that the paper trail for expensive ASIC mining equipment makes it harder to falsify values without detection. Why Evade Customs Duties and Import Tariffs ? The primary motivation behind under-reporting is simple economics: cost reduction. ASIC mining equipment represents a significant capital expenditure for mining operations. Reducing the cost of acquisition, even through potentially illegal means, can directly impact a miner’s profitability, especially in competitive markets or during periods of lower Bitcoin prices. Lower Initial Investment: Paying less in tariffs means a lower upfront cost to deploy mining rigs. Improved Profit Margins: Reduced import costs can translate into higher profit margins per mined Bitcoin over time. Competitive Edge: Companies that illegally reduce costs might gain an unfair advantage over competitors who comply with import regulations and pay full customs duties and import tariffs. However, the short-term financial gain is juxtaposed with significant legal and financial risks. The Risks of Cryptocurrency Import Duty Evasion Engaging in fraudulent activities like under-reporting import values carries severe consequences under U.S. law. These risks extend far beyond simply having to pay the correct amount of duty later. Potential repercussions include: Fines and Penalties: Customs authorities can impose substantial fines, often multiples of the evaded duty amount. Seizure of Goods: The imported ASIC mining equipment can be seized by customs, resulting in a total loss of the hardware investment. Legal Prosecution: Intentional fraud can lead to criminal charges against the individuals and companies involved. Reputational Damage: Being associated with illegal activities can severely harm a company’s reputation within the cryptocurrency industry and with financial partners. Increased Scrutiny: Once flagged, a company may face intense scrutiny on all future imports, causing delays and additional costs. As Jill Ford noted, it is becoming more difficult for companies to successfully under-declare values, suggesting that CBP may be increasing its monitoring of high-value cryptocurrency import shipments, particularly those containing specialized hardware like ASICs. What’s Next for Bitcoin Miners and ASIC Mining Equipment Imports? This report highlights the ongoing challenges and regulatory complexities faced by the global Bitcoin mining industry. As mining operations scale and rely heavily on the import of expensive ASIC mining equipment , navigating international trade regulations and paying appropriate customs duties and import tariffs legally is crucial for sustainable business practices. The increased difficulty in under-reporting suggests that regulatory bodies are becoming more aware of the value and volume of cryptocurrency import activities. Companies involved in importing ASIC mining equipment must ensure strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations to avoid significant legal and financial pitfalls. Legitimate businesses operating in the space will likely welcome stricter enforcement, as it levels the playing field and prevents those engaging in illegal practices from gaining an unfair cost advantage. Summary: The Cost of Cutting Corners Allegations of some Bitcoin miners under-reporting the value of imported ASIC mining equipment to evade customs duties and import tariffs underscore the pressures within the competitive mining industry. While the motive is likely cost reduction, the risks associated with such fraudulent activities, including hefty fines, seizure of assets, and legal consequences, are substantial and illegal. Industry experts note that successfully under-declaring values is becoming harder, indicating increased vigilance from customs authorities regarding cryptocurrency import hardware. For sustainable growth and credibility, compliance with international trade laws remains paramount for all players in the sector.

The appointment comes a little over five months after US President Donald Trump nominated Clayton to take on the role. He replaces Damian Williams, who played a major role in the conviction of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other high-profile crypto cases. Clayton said on April 22 his top priorities would be to protect public safety, ensure the integrity of the US financial system, defend national security interests and combat fraud, particularly against the elderly and most vulnerable. The temporary nature of Clayton’s appointment resulted from Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s use of a blue slip to block Clayton’s confirmation on April 16, effectively preventing a Senate vote and official confirmation of his position. Blue slips can be used by senators to block US attorney or district court judicial nominees in their home states. Clayton is allowed to serve as interim US attorney for up to 120 days without Senate confirmation. After that, he will need to be approved in a Senate vote or receive a temporary extension of his interim status from Manhattan’s federal court. Trump criticized Schumer’s move in an April 17 Truth Social post, pointing out that Clayton received bipartisan support in the Senate and that Clayton complied with all requests asked of him. Source: Donald Trump The interim status of Clayton’s position will last until around Aug. 20. The role will see him as the top law enforcement officer for New York’s Southern District, encompassing the counties of New York, Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess and Sullivan. The Southern District of New York is the oldest federal court district in the US, and its location in the country’s financial epicenter means it often handles high-profile cases involving white-collar crime.

DeepSeek AI Sees It Hitting $5 in 4 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-025-crypto-outperform-solana-sol-in-2025-deepseek-ai-sees-it-hitting-5-in-4-months/,"Mutuum Finance stands at its fourth presale stage where it has collected $7 million while giving away 417 million tokens to 8,400 holders. DeepSeek AI predicts a price escalation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to $5 during the upcoming four months despite its initial price being $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes a brash market forecast against Solana (SOL) which currently fails to overcome $150 resistance barriers. The declining network interest surrounding Solana allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to gain crypto market attention by delivering its unique lending solution. Will MUTM overtake Solana for top performance during 2025? A thrilling competition is about to unfold between these two entities. Solana’s Stumbling Momentum The crucial moment finds Solana (SOL) in a difficult position. The token currently remains between $135 while it fails to surpass the significant $150 resistance zone which historic trading data indicates as a crucial point of resistance. Houston-files indicate network demand has weakened by 21% since the start of the year through current data. Solana’s short-term meme coin boost could not mask its declining core stability. Since the Relative Strength Index reveals brief signs of bullishness followed by bearish indications the momentum appears short-lived. The failure to maintain positions above the 21-day exponential moving average signals potential SOL price movement to $100 thus undermining its market potential for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has established itself through its innovative approach in the market. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale (MUTM) features tokens available for purchase at $0.025. The project has earned $7 million through its fundraising efforts due to strong purchasing behavior from 8,400 individuals. The current phase 4 sales rate is rapid while phase 5 will start at $0.03 which presents profit opportunities for existing investors. The tokenomics provide investors with a 140% return beginning from the $0.06 listing price and experts anticipate the price will rise to $3.50 after launch for a total return of 13,900%. To bolster trust, the team is undergoing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social channels. This presale’s velocity underscores Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) allure. Innovative Lending Model The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) decentralized finance project has established itself through its combined lending approach. Mutuum Finance operates through a unique integration of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer networks to support users doing asset loans for income and loans backed by collateral. The team launched a dashboard displaying positions of the top 50 token holders who obtain bonus tokens for keeping their rankings under surveillance to enter a competitive investment environment. The structured nature of the ecosystem stands apart from Solana’s wider but unfocused blockchain structure. The emphasis on useful functionality has led Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to gather yield-seeking investors who want reliable return-on-investment rewards. Mutuum Finance operates its buying and distributing mechanism to maintain consistent demand that will propel its growth through 2025. Outpacing Solana in 2025 The $5 price projection from DeepSeek AI regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives the crypto market a shock by anticipating four-month performance. Solana (SOL) encounters significant challenges because declining transaction volumes combined with resistance barriers stand as major hurdles for attaining its former 2021 success. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents unique investment potential to market participants because it has both affordable start-up costs and well-designed tokenomic system. The 140% gain during listing represents only the starting level investors can anticipate because the $3.50 future price will deliver substantial growth potential. Phase 4’s fleeting availability heightens urgency. The presale is currently available for MUTM tokens on Mutuum finance’s website until the pricing increases so users should visit now. The upcoming 2025 year will potentially transform DeFi through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which projects to surpass Solana’s future success.

43688296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151636,1745370025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ukraine War: Putin’s Stunning Peace Deal Offer to Trump and its Potential Geopolitical Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ukraine-war-peace-deal-trump/,"In the ever-turbulent world of geopolitics, whispers of potential shifts can send ripples across global markets, including the volatile crypto market . A recent report from Solid Intel on X has ignited significant discussion, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed halting the Ukraine war to pursue a peace deal specifically with former U.S. President Donald Trump . Understanding the Alleged Trump Putin Proposal The core of the report is a striking claim: Vladimir Putin is allegedly willing to freeze the current conflict lines in Ukraine and enter into peace negotiations, but only if his counterpart is Donald Trump. This isn’t just a procedural offer; it’s framed as a highly personalized proposal, bypassing the current Biden administration. Key aspects of this alleged offer: Direct Appeal to Trump: The offer is reportedly contingent on Trump being the U.S. President. Immediate Ceasefire Proposal: The starting point would be a halt to current military actions along existing front lines. Negotiated Peace Agreement: The goal is a comprehensive deal, though details are sparse. Source: The information originates from Solid Intel on X, a source that requires careful verification and context. While this report is unverified and should be treated with caution, the mere suggestion of such a high-stakes negotiation involving two of the world’s most prominent and often unpredictable leaders is enough to capture global attention and fuel speculation about the future of the Ukraine war . Why This Peace Deal Report Matters (Even If Unverified) Reports like this, even from non-official sources, matter because they enter the information ecosystem and can influence perceptions, strategies, and market sentiment. Here’s why this particular claim is noteworthy: 1. The Trump Factor: Donald Trump has historically expressed a desire to quickly resolve the Ukraine conflict and has a complex, often debated, relationship with Vladimir Putin. The idea of Putin seeking a deal specifically with Trump aligns, in theory, with Trump’s past rhetoric about his ability to negotiate directly with world leaders. 2. Potential Shift in Strategy: If true, it could signal a Russian calculation that a future Trump presidency might be more amenable to terms favorable to Moscow than the current administration or other potential Western leaders. 3. Geopolitical Uncertainty: The report adds another layer of uncertainty to an already volatile geopolitical landscape. Will this influence political discourse in the U.S.? How will allies react? What does it mean for ongoing support for Ukraine? 4. Market Reaction Potential: Geopolitical stability (or instability) is a major driver for global markets. A credible path towards ending the Ukraine war could have significant economic implications, potentially impacting everything from energy prices to investor confidence, and yes, even the crypto market . Navigating the Challenges and Skepticism It’s crucial to approach this report with a healthy dose of skepticism. Several significant challenges and questions arise: Source Credibility: Solid Intel on X is a social media account. While some accounts can break news, they lack the institutional verification processes of major news organizations. The report needs independent confirmation from multiple reliable sources. Ukraine’s Position: Any peace deal fundamentally involves Ukraine. It is highly unlikely that Ukraine would agree to freeze the conflict along current lines, especially as it would legitimize Russian territorial gains. Ukraine’s stated position is the full restoration of its territorial integrity. Western Allies’ Unity: The U.S. is part of a coalition supporting Ukraine. A unilateral deal sought by Russia with a specific U.S. president would likely face strong opposition from European allies and NATO members. Domestic Politics: Such a proposal would be intensely scrutinized within U.S. domestic politics, particularly during an election cycle. The terms of any potential deal would face immense debate. Given these factors, while the report is attention-grabbing, it remains speculative until verified by more robust sources or official statements. The Broader Geopolitical Impact and Market Connection Major geopolitical events and potential shifts have a profound impact on global financial markets. The initial invasion of Ukraine, for instance, caused significant volatility in stocks, commodities (especially energy and food), and also the crypto market . How might a potential Trump Putin peace initiative, however distant or unlikely, tie into market dynamics? Reduced Uncertainty: A credible path towards peace could reduce the geopolitical risk premium currently priced into various assets. This might lead to increased investor confidence in traditional markets. Commodity Price Shifts: An end to hostilities could impact oil and gas prices, agricultural commodities, and other resources affected by the conflict and sanctions. Investor Sentiment: Global stability generally fosters positive investor sentiment, encouraging investment in riskier assets. Conversely, uncertainty breeds caution. For the crypto market , the connection is often debated. Cryptocurrencies sometimes act as risk-on assets, moving in tandem with tech stocks. Other times, they are discussed as potential safe havens against inflation or geopolitical instability. The reality is complex and depends on the specific circumstances and investor psychology at the time. A significant reduction in global geopolitical tension, such as the resolution of the Ukraine war , could theoretically reduce the perceived need for ‘safe haven’ assets if crypto is seen in that light by some. Alternatively, increased global economic activity following peace could boost overall liquidity and investment appetite, potentially benefiting crypto. Conversely, the *process* of negotiating such a complex deal, filled with potential setbacks and disagreements, could introduce *more* volatility in the short to medium term. Markets dislike uncertainty, and a drawn-out, unpredictable negotiation would be a prime source of it. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given this speculative news and the broader geopolitical impact , what should market participants, including those in the crypto market , consider? 1. Verify Information: Treat reports from social media or unverified sources with extreme caution. Wait for confirmation from reputable news outlets or official government statements before making any investment decisions based on them. 2. Understand the Context: Recognize the political complexities involved. A peace deal is not solely in the hands of the U.S. and Russia; Ukraine and its allies are central players. 3. Monitor Geopolitical Developments: Keep an eye on official statements from Washington, Moscow, Kyiv, and European capitals. These will provide more reliable indicators of potential diplomatic shifts. 4. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that geopolitical events are significant drivers of market volatility. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in volatile markets like crypto. 5. Focus on Fundamentals: While macro events matter, don’t lose sight of the fundamentals of the assets you hold. For crypto, this means understanding the technology, adoption rates, and ecosystem developments. 6. Be Prepared for Volatility: Regardless of the outcome of this specific report, the geopolitical landscape remains uncertain. Be prepared for potential price swings in response to news developments. Conclusion: Watching Geopolitics and the Crypto Market The report suggesting Vladimir Putin has offered to halt the Ukraine war for a peace deal with Donald Trump is a fascinating, albeit unverified, development. It highlights the complex interplay between personal relationships, national interests, and the immense challenges of resolving international conflicts. While its immediate credibility is questionable, it serves as a powerful reminder of how geopolitical events, or even the rumour of them, can capture global attention and potentially influence the climate for markets worldwide. For those invested in the crypto market , this report underscores the need to stay informed about global affairs, understand the potential for geopolitical factors to drive volatility, and maintain a disciplined approach based on verified information and long-term strategy rather than reacting impulsively to unconfirmed reports. The path to peace in Ukraine remains uncertain, and navigating its potential impacts requires careful observation and critical thinking.

43688867,https://thecoinrise.com/dragoin-rises-to-become-the-best-crypto-under-1-as-tron-eyes-breakout-and-pengu-drops-26/,1745370056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43688867.jpeg,Dragoin Rises to Become the Best Crypto Under $1 as TRON Eyes Breakout and PENGU Drops 26%,https://thecoinrise.com/dragoin-rises-to-become-the-best-crypto-under-1-as-tron-eyes-breakout-and-pengu-drops-26/,"Investor attention is split as different crypto projects chart wildly different courses this week. Tron (TRX) is holding steady within a bullish triangle pattern, possibly priming for a breakout, while PENGU, the token tied to the Pudgy Penguins community, has plummeted by 26% over the past week. Amid both hesitation and hype, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building differently. It has gathered massive attraction within Stage 1 of its presale and offers more than promise—it has a live product and clear incentives in motion. For traders seeking movement backed by action rather than speculation, Dragoin continues to present a compelling case in an unpredictable environment. Tron: Setup Suggests Breakout Potential Tron (TRX) is drawing bullish interest this week as it continues to consolidate inside a symmetrical triangle formation. Technical analysts have flagged this pattern as a possible launchpad for upward movement. Currently trading above key moving averages and testing the upper boundary of its triangle, TRX is ready for a breakout if momentum holds. Despite broader market uncertainty, Tron has managed to hold its structure. Strong support levels are holding firm, and volume profiles indicate growing participation. Analysts suggest that if TRX breaks above the current formation, a move toward higher price levels could follow quickly. However, until the breakout occurs, traders remain cautious. For investors, Tron’s appeal still lies in its transaction speed and low fees, particularly for smart contract deployment. But short-term gains will depend heavily on whether the breakout materializes—and whether whales or institutions fuel the next wave. PENGU: Community Power Meets Weak Price Action PENGU, the meme coin associated with the Pudgy Penguins community, has dropped more than 26% in just one week. Despite its strong branding and loyal holder base, the token has failed to maintain upward momentum. As of now, its technical outlook shows little recovery, with support zones under pressure and little buyer strength to halt further losses. The decline has raised questions about sustainability in meme coins that lean heavily on community branding but offer little functional interaction or roadmap detail. While PENGU’s association with a well-loved NFT brand brings visibility, its visibility alone hasn’t been enough to stop the price drop. Analysts warn that without fresh developments or utility-based catalysts, PENGU could remain under pressure. It may still find support among loyal users, but investors seeking tangible growth are beginning to shift focus elsewhere. Dragoin: Transparency and Utility from Day One Unlike PENGU’s stalled momentum and Tron’s technical waiting game, Dragoin is executing a very different strategy—one rooted in real-time delivery. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin is currently in Stage 1 of its presale. With massive attention gained already, tokens are available at $0.0000292. The target launch price is set at $0.002, giving early backers the opportunity for a 6,750% ROI if price targets are met. Dragoin’s edge isn’t just in its pricing structure—it’s in the fact that its core product is already functional. The Telegram-based play-to-earn game lets players control dragons, complete challenges, and earn $DDGN tokens. This isn’t a roadmap promise—it’s a live experience already gaining attention. Token allocation reinforces long-term viability: 50% of the 200 billion total supply goes to presale, 30% is reserved for ecosystem and gameplay development, 15% is set aside for liquidity, and 5% is locked for the team over a two-year period. Dragoin has also committed to permanently burning any unsold presale tokens, and ownership of the smart contract will be renounced at launch to ensure decentralization. Unlike other meme projects riding sentiment, Dragoin builds value through user engagement and transparent mechanics. Referral bonuses, staking rewards, and open community updates create a feedback loop where participants are both users and stakeholders. Ending Note Tron and PENGU are on two very different paths—one approaching a possible breakout, the other reeling from a sharp correction. But in both cases, investors are waiting: for price action, for news, for confirmation. Dragoin offers an alternative—a project where progress is already being made. With a live game, a popular presale, and a fixed token strategy, Dragoin isn’t speculating on future adoption—it’s building it. For those seeking exposure to a meme coin with real-time usability and structured opportunity, Dragoin continues to separate itself in a crowded 2025 market.

This question is particularly relevant for those navigating the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market, as global economic shifts often have ripple effects on digital assets. Recent comments from high-level U.S. officials suggest a potential pivot, hinting at a less confrontational approach to the ongoing US China trade relationship. Why is the Tariff Conflict Likely to Ease? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently offered a significant perspective on the state of the tariff conflict with China. According to reports from Bloomberg, Secretary Bessent stated that the current level of tariff-based conflict is simply “unsustainable” and is therefore “likely to ease.” This assessment from a key economic official signals a potential shift in strategy or at least a recognition of the economic realities imposed by prolonged trade friction. Bessent also clarified that the U.S. is not actively pursuing a policy of “decoupling” from the Chinese economy. Decoupling implies a complete separation of economic ties, which is a far more drastic measure than the targeted tariffs and trade restrictions seen in recent years. The distinction is important, suggesting that while strategic competition remains, a total economic divorce is not the goal. This nuance provides a potentially more optimistic economic outlook regarding future interactions. Progress in Trade Negotiations: What Did the White House Say? Adding to the narrative of potential de-escalation, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also commented on the administration’s trade discussions. Earlier today, she indicated that President Trump is observing “good progress” in trade negotiations, not only with China but also with other countries. While specific details of these negotiations were not disclosed, the mention of progress aligns with Secretary Bessent’s view that the intense trade war dynamics may be softening. The lack of specific details is typical in sensitive trade talks, but the public acknowledgment of positive movement from the White House is notable. It suggests that behind-the-scenes discussions may be paving the way for a reduction in trade barriers or a more stable trade framework between the two economic superpowers. How Do Global Markets React to Trade Tensions? Understanding the potential easing of the US China trade dispute is crucial because trade tensions have a significant impact on global markets . Uncertainty surrounding tariffs, trade balances, and potential restrictions on technology or investment can lead to volatility in stock markets, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. When tensions are high, investors often become risk-averse, potentially pulling back from more speculative assets. Conversely, signs of easing tensions or progress in negotiations can boost investor confidence. A more stable and predictable trade environment reduces economic uncertainty, which can be positive for market sentiment. While the link isn’t always direct, positive sentiment in traditional finance markets can sometimes spill over into the cryptocurrency space, which is often viewed as a risk asset. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? While the news about trade negotiations might seem distant from Bitcoin or Ethereum, developments in global markets and the broader economic outlook are highly relevant to crypto investors. Here’s why: Risk Appetite: Reduced trade tensions can increase overall market risk appetite. When traditional markets are confident and performing well, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Economic Stability: Easing trade friction contributes to greater global economic stability. A more stable macro environment is generally considered more favorable for the growth and adoption of emerging technologies and asset classes like crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Trade dynamics can influence supply chains and the cost of goods, indirectly affecting inflation and central bank monetary policy decisions. These factors are significant drivers of cryptocurrency market movements. Capital Flows: Changes in international trade and investment flows can impact where capital is deployed globally, potentially influencing liquidity in various markets, including crypto. Therefore, monitoring the progress of the trade war and the evolving US China trade relationship provides valuable context for understanding potential shifts in market sentiment and liquidity that could affect your crypto portfolio. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the positive comments, it’s important to acknowledge that resolving the tariff conflict is a complex process with potential challenges. Negotiations can be protracted, and unexpected developments can arise. The underlying strategic competition between the U.S. and China on issues like technology, intellectual property, and geopolitical influence remains. However, the statements from Secretary Bessent and Press Secretary Leavitt offer a hopeful sign that both sides may be looking for ways to de-escalate the most economically damaging aspects of the conflict. A measured approach that seeks to ease the trade war without pursuing complete decoupling could pave the way for a more predictable international trade landscape, which would be a welcome development for global markets and contribute positively to the overall economic outlook . Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Global Economics The indication from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the tariff conflict with China is unsustainable and likely to ease, supported by White House comments on negotiation progress, is a potentially significant development. For participants in the cryptocurrency market, this news underscores the interconnectedness of digital assets with traditional finance and global markets . While the direct impact is not always immediate or obvious, a positive shift in the US China trade relationship could contribute to improved investor sentiment and a more favorable economic outlook globally, influencing capital flows and risk appetite that are vital for the crypto space.

43689074,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=736323,1745371859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43689074.jpeg,"Is The Bitcoin Price Top In At $109,000 Already? What The MVRV Z-Score Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/what-bitcoin-mvrv-z-score-says/,"After months of bullish momentum that pushed the Bitcoin price to an all-time high of over $109,000 earlier this year, analysts are now debating whether that surge marked the official market top. Strengthening this argument, a confluence of technical indicators suggests the market cycle may have already peaked—most notably, the behavior of the Market Value to Real Value (MVRV) Z-Score reinforces this view. MVRV Z-Score Shows Bitcoin Price Has Topped A new technical analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, which combines MVRV Z-Score and monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI), is flashing warning signs that Bitcoin‘s market top may already be in. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bullish Confirmation: What Needs To Happen For Next Leg Up To $130,000 Looking at the logarithmic price chart, Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score has broken below a long-standing uptrend support line. This pattern is significant, as the Z-Score has always respected the uptrend support lines during bull markets, with similar breaks only emerging after Bitcoin reaches an official market top. Notably, this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has displayed such a trend behavior. Similar support line breaks occurred before BTC’s market peaks during the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles. The bearish argument that Bitcoin may have already reached a price peak is further strengthened by the visual correlation between the Z-Score and Bitcoin’s monthly RSI, which is shown by a black line on the chart. In past cycles, Bitcoin’s RSI fell below 70 twice, indicating fading momentum and weakening price action. Historically, such moves below the 70 level occur shortly after price tops, not before. Even more compelling, the RSI-based Moving Average (MA), highlighted by the orange line on the chart, is now curling downwards. This subtle but strong signal has only appeared in past cycles after the market has already topped, serving as a confirmation rather than a prediction. Taken together, these technical indicators and historical trends strongly suggest that Bitcoin’s $109,000 peak may have marked the top of this market cycle. In line with previous post-top bull market behavior, Bitcoin could now be on the verge of entering a prolonged bear market. This bearish outlook is reinforced by recent steep price corrections, reduced investor confidence, and a clear shift in market sentiment toward caution and uncertainty. Bulls Attempt To Reverse Bitcoin Bearish Outlook In another of his most recent analyses of Bitcoin, Severino revealed that bulls appear to be pushing for a price recovery. The analyst acknowledged that his previously dominant bearish narrative of Bitcoin may soon see a significant shift if bulls can sustain momentum into April’s monthly close. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Open Interest Too High Or Can The BTC Price Still Rally? According to the presented chart, Bitcoin is now testing a key area of interest while simultaneously showing early bullish signs of reversing the bearish crossover on the monthly long-term Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Adding to the intrigue, the possible formation of a Morning Star candlestick pattern reinforces the possibility of a bullish reversal for Bitcoin. Notably, similar chart setups occurred in 2022 and mid-2023, both of which marked major turning points for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. If the cryptocurrency manages to close April with a complete Morning Star pattern, it could force a reevaluation of bearish expectations.

Here’s What the Latest Price Action Signals,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-breaking-free-from-wall-street-heres-what-the-latest-price-action-signals/,"Bitcoin surged past $93,000 on Tuesday, brushing off mounting political tensions and marking a fresh four-week high of $93,988. The move came after former President Donald Trump reignited criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, dubbing him “Mr. Too Late” and demanding immediate interest rate cuts to mitigate inflation stemming from sweeping new tariffs on over 180 countries. Trump’s comments sent a jolt through traditional markets—Wall Street fell sharply, while Bitcoin rallied over 6% in a classic risk-off rotation. Mr. Too Late needs to step it up. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #MrTooLate #LowerRates pic.twitter.com/DgSmvtPFcd — Mark (@sierraranchhome) April 22, 2025 On Truth Social, Trump doubled down on his rhetoric, saying the Fed’s policy missteps had allowed inflation to spiral during the pandemic. His fiery remarks appeared to dent confidence in the Fed’s independence, but they reinforced Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against institutional risk and monetary uncertainty. Crypto Market Reacts: Bitcoin Leads, Altcoins Diverge Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is once again in the spotlight. Analysts suggest BTC’s recent breakout isn’t just a technical move—it’s part of a larger macro trend. “When trust in institutions erodes, investors turn to alternatives like Bitcoin and gold,” said Juan Leon, Senior Analyst at Bitwise. Supporting this thesis, gold also hit a new record at $3,442 per ounce. Swan Bitcoin’s Steven Lubka added, “Bitcoin’s strength compared to equities suggests it’s already diverging from traditional risk assets.” Elsewhere in crypto, the market response was bullish: Total Crypto Market Cap: Holding steady at $2.9 trillion Solana (SOL): Up 6% to $147 Dogecoin (DOGE): Up 12% XRP: 5% Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch After peaking at $93,988, Bitcoin has pulled back slightly and is now trading around $93,119. The rally, which began at $88,682, has formed a steep ascending channel on the 4-hour chart. However, the MACD histogram is showing signs of fading momentum, suggesting a possible short-term cooldown. Trade Setup: Buy on Dip: $91,269 or $88,682 Breakout Entry: Above $93,988 with volume Targets: $96,973 and $99,692 Stop Loss: Below $88,682 This is a textbook “wait-for-confirmation” moment. If BTC sustains above $91,269 and reclaims $93,988 on strong volume, it could push toward $97K and beyond. But without confirmation, a dip to the lower trendline or support levels is likely. Best Wallet ($BEST): Presale Surges Past $11.8 M as Launch Nears Best Wallet ($BEST) is quickly emerging as one of the most promising crypto apps of 2025—offering users a secure, streamlined platform to manage digital assets with ease.

Cold Wallet’s 50x Potential Beats MetaMask, Trust Wallet, & Coinbase Wallet Combined",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-invest-in-cold-wallets-50x-potential-beats-metamask-trust-wallet-coinbase-wallet-combined/,"Looking for the top crypto to invest in right now? The crypto wallet sector is heating up, and it’s not just about storing your assets anymore. Today’s wallets offer staking, governance, DeFi integration, and more. But one new player is taking things even further, aiming to dethrone MetaMask and rewrite what a wallet can be. Here are five wallet-linked crypto projects that stand out, starting with a presale opportunity that could redefine user ownership. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT) – Builders, Not Buzzwords Too many crypto projects are powered by marketing. Cold Wallet is powered by people who’ve actually built the infrastructure of Web3. Its team includes blockchain engineers who’ve audited top DeFi protocols, cryptographers with expertise in zk-SNARKs, and product veterans who know how to ship tools for millions. Their mission is clear: take the tools institutions trust, and make them accessible to everyone. This isn’t their first bear market. They’ve seen hype come and go, and know that utility, timing, and trust are what drive real adoption. This credibility is backed by a roadmap that’s already underway, with MVP features launching in Q3 and the Cold Wallet Launchpad following in 2026. For those looking to align early with the project, the $CWT token is now in presale stage 1 at $0.007, set to launch at $0.35. This is more than a team of dreamers, it’s a team of doers, builders, and privacy-maximalists. When you back a Cold Wallet, you’re not just buying a token, you’re betting on execution. And this team has the track record to deliver. 2. MetaMask – The Original DeFi Access Point MetaMask is still the go-to Ethereum wallet for millions, and for good reason. Its browser extension and mobile app provide straightforward access to dApps, NFT platforms, and DeFi tools. MetaMask helped define the self-custody movement, and its recent token rumors and growing integration with Layer-2 networks show that it’s not standing still. While MetaMask doesn’t currently offer a public token, it remains a major player in the wallet space. Any future airdrop or native token launch could make it a target for speculation, keeping it relevant on any list of the top crypto to invest in, even if just by association or potential upside. That said, its lack of DAO governance and minimal built-in staking options leaves room for challengers like Cold Wallet to step into a leadership role for community-first wallet platforms. 3. Trust Wallet – A Mobile-First Giant With Staking and Multi-Chain Support Owned by Binance but operating as a decentralized product, Trust Wallet is a heavyweight in the mobile crypto space. It supports hundreds of tokens across dozens of blockchains, with built-in staking for coins like BNB, TRON, and Cosmos. Users can also connect directly to dApps through the in-app browser. Trust Wallet Token (TWT) gives holders a small degree of influence over development and offers occasional rewards or fee discounts. While this utility is limited compared to Cold Wallet’s deep integration of CWT into governance, staking, and rewards, Trust Wallet still makes the list of top crypto to invest in thanks to its massive user base and token accessibility. Its strength lies in convenience, but long-term holders may want a project that ties ownership more closely to platform growth. 4. Coinbase Wallet – Clean UX, Backed by a Giant Coinbase Wallet benefits from its connection to one of the most well-known crypto exchanges in the world. It’s easy to use, integrates seamlessly with the Coinbase app, and supports Ethereum, EVM chains, and NFTs. While it’s non-custodial in practice, its branding and integration with centralized services make it a hybrid solution. Unlike Cold Wallet or Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet doesn’t have a dedicated utility token for governance or staking. This limits its appeal for users seeking tokens that reward them directly for participating in the ecosystem. Still, as an easy onboarding gateway for new users and a stepping stone into full DeFi participation, Coinbase Wallet earns its place among the top crypto to invest in adjacent tools, especially if rumors of tokenization or Web3 expansion plans solidify. 5. MyEtherWallet (MEW) – The Veteran Ethereum Companion MyEtherWallet, or MEW, has been around since 2015 and remains a respected name in Ethereum self-custody. While it lacks a mobile-first design or tokenized governance structure, it’s still widely used by advanced users for interacting with Ethereum directly, including signing transactions, managing ENS names, or accessing complex dApps. MEW doesn’t currently offer a governance token or staking layer, which may make it less attractive for investors looking for upside tied to usage. However, for users prioritizing legacy support and control over Ethereum-native assets, it’s a tool that continues to hold relevance. That said, compared to Cold Wallet, which combines Ethereum support with DAO control, staking incentives, and real-time platform upgrades, MEW feels more like a legacy utility than a growth play. Still, it rounds out the list as a functional option with potential future relevance. Final Thoughts As non-custodial wallets become the new standard for digital asset management, investors are seeking platforms that go beyond storage. Governance rights, staking layers, and ecosystem participation are fast becoming must-haves. That’s why Cold Wallet, with its DAO-first model, deep CWT utility, and 50x presale growth window, currently ranks highest among the top crypto to invest in this sector. For those who want to do more than just store, and actually shape the future of the tools they use, the next wave of wallet tokens is already here. The post Top Crypto to Invest In?

What really matters is timing, tech, and utility. With the 2025 cycle heating up, some projects are showing serious momentum — not just in price charts but in real product delivery and adoption. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, the right mix includes strong infrastructure coins, undervalued platforms, and presales tied to actual working tools. This list breaks down four tokens that tick those boxes. Unstaked is leading with AI-driven automation for Telegram and X. Solana is speeding ahead with low-cost transactions and DeFi growth. TRON continues to dominate stablecoin transfers and smart contracts.Here’s everything you need to know about why these four should be on your radar. 1. Unstaked – Real AI Agents for On-Chain Growth Unstaked is flipping the script on Web3 engagement. Instead of community managers running X and Telegram, users can now deploy their own AI agents — fully autonomous bots that grow, engage, and even moderate communities 24/7. What sets Unstaked apart is its on-chain structure: these agents generate trackable Proof of Intelligence, meaning activity can be verified and rewarded. Each bot costs just $10–$25/month to run, replacing full teams at a fraction of the cost. The token behind it — $UNSD — powers everything. It’s required for agent creation, upgrades, and use across the ecosystem. The tokenomics are tight: 6B total supply, 60% in presale, and no private sales. The price is currently at $0.0065 , aiming for a public listing around $0.1819 — a projected ROI of ~2,700%. With features like Instagram and Discord integration, a marketplace for AI agent modules, and NFT-based upgrades on the roadmap, Unstaked is more than hype — it’s product-first. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, this is where real-world utility meets token traction. 2. Solana – Still the Fastest Lane in DeFi Solana (SOL) keeps proving it can handle scale. With fees under a cent and throughput north of 65,000 transactions per second, it’s a favorite for developers building DEXs, NFTs, and real-time apps. As of mid-April 2025, SOL is trading around $178, recovering well from its March lows and holding strong support levels. Major protocols like Jupiter, MarginFi, and Tensor continue to push traffic to the chain, helping it dominate DEX volume this year. The upcoming Firedancer validator client is expected to increase reliability and speed even further, adding more stability to the network. Institutional players are also starting to revisit SOL after seeing sustained usage and consistent developer activity. That’s the kind of groundwork that builds staying power. For long-term believers or anyone hunting for the best crypto to buy now, Solana still stands as one of the few chains that works under pressure — and works fast. 3. TRON – The Quiet Powerhouse of Stablecoin Transfers TRON (TRX) has carved a niche in the world of stablecoins and smart contracts. It processes the most USDT transfers of any chain — over $40B monthly — with a focus on cost efficiency and transaction speed. TRX is priced around $0.124 as of April 2025 and has maintained a tight trading range, showing resilience in a market filled with volatility. While it doesn’t make a lot of noise, its dominance in on-chain finance tells the real story. With the TRON DAO Reserve actively supporting DeFi projects and ecosystem growth, TRX continues to find utility in payments, remittances, and staking. It’s also becoming a preferred chain for token issuance, especially in Asian markets. The energy fees model, paired with high network uptime, makes it ideal for both users and developers. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, TRON offers a functional, high-volume chain that’s already running at scale. Best Cryptos To Watch Now With crypto, the timing of entry matters — but so does the actual product. A good long-term play should offer both utility and upside, not just speculative hype. That’s what connects the four projects on this list. Unstaked brings automation to the frontlines of community building, with real AI agents and an ROI-focused presale. Solana is showing continued growth in DeFi, NFT, and payment applications. TRON powers massive stablecoin volumes and offers low-cost, high-efficiency transfers. If you’re narrowing down the best crypto to buy now, use this guide as your shortlist. From enterprise-grade blockchains to AI-backed presales, these projects cover multiple use cases and stages of growth. Just remember — the projects that survive and grow are the ones with real users, working products, and solid economics. All four of these check those boxes.

However, it still shows a bearish Death Cross on the daily chart, keeping the outlook mixed. While DOGE gained 6% to reach $0.166, its inability to hold momentum beyond that has left traders watching closely. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows signs of potential rebound with growing on-chain activity. Yet, SHIB also faces tough resistance ahead. Both remain well-known digital assets, but a new name is now drawing stronger interest. BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting attention with fast growth and a compelling offer. Its presale has crossed the $216 million mark, and large-scale buyers are moving in fast. A special code—BDAG1200—unlocks a 600% bonus for early participants. This limited-time offer is expected to end once BlockDAG’s beta testnet reaches capacity, creating urgency among those tracking emerging projects. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Setup Sends Mixed Signals Recent Dogecoin (DOGE) activity showed a short-lived Golden Cross after prices rose 6% to $0.166. This setup, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day, often signals upward potential. However, the presence of a Death Cross on the daily chart still casts doubt. This contradiction is splitting short- and long-term sentiment. DOGE volume hit 71 million in just 24 hours, showing strong interest. Still, technical levels are critical. The current resistance stands at $0.181. If DOGE breaks through, it could rise to $0.257. But failure to hold support may send prices down to $0.142 or even $0.129. These mixed signals make the next move unclear. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Analysis Hints at Bounce Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently hit $0.00001175, marking an 11% rise over the past week. Its RSI is around 35, indicating oversold territory and potential for a short-term bounce. However, SHIB faces resistance at $0.00001222, while support remains near $0.00001066. A bullish engulfing candle on the weekly chart is drawing attention, but many are waiting for confirmation. Meanwhile, activity on Shibarium is rising, and whale inflows are up 315%. These signs support SHIB’s ongoing use case. Still, trader sentiment remains mixed, with just 24% feeling optimistic. Targets range from $0.00001414 to as high as $0.00002644 if momentum picks up. Whales Are Rushing to BlockDAG’s 600% Bonus Before It Ends BlockDAG’s presale is breaking records, with over $216 million raised and 19.3 billion coins sold so far. But it’s not just the numbers turning heads—whales are entering fast, drawn in by a limited-time 600% bonus using the BDAG1200 code. This exclusive offer won’t last long. Once BlockDAG’s beta testnet hits full capacity, the bonus ends. Right now, BlockDAG is in Batch 27, and each coin is priced at $0.0248—a sharp rise from just $0.001 in Batch 1. That’s a 2,380% surge in value for early participants. The testnet is already live, and users are earning 10,000 testnet coins and competing for $2,000 BDAG rewards. BlockDAG isn’t all hype—it’s delivering. The beta testnet includes a real-time explorer, a no-code token creator, decentralized apps (dApps), and weekly airdrops. So far, over $6.9 million worth of miners have been sold, and more than 17,000 units are already in users’ hands. The project has also locked in 10 CEX listings for 2025, positioning itself for a strong market debut. With this kind of momentum and product delivery, BlockDAG is moving beyond early hype—it’s proving it can scale. Between the rising presale ROI and the countdown on the 600% bonus, BlockDAG is being seen as one of the top crypto coins to watch heading into 2025. Key Points Dogecoin (DOGE) shows short-term promise, but its conflicting signals make the long-term picture unclear. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is nearing a possible bounce zone, but its progress depends on stronger confirmation and ongoing on-chain strength. The bigger momentum appears to be with BlockDAG. It’s $216 million presale, a 600% bonus using BDAG1200, and an active testnet have set it apart.

Big moves aren’t holding. Rallies stall halfway. Charts flash green, then turn grey before anything plays out. According to the latest Bittensor price analysis, $TAO jumped 55% after rebounding off $205, slicing through its wedge formation—but momentum paused just under a long-standing resistance. Algorand crypto news is leaking confidence—301 million tokens pulled from staking, and its price is now dragging near yearly lows. When the market starts feeling unstable, scammers show up. They know uncertainty makes people reckless. They know how to look real until it’s too late. Web3 ai ($WAI) was built for this exact moment. It tracks smart contracts, scans sentiment shifts, and flags hidden risks before they surface. That level of insight is exactly why the project is seeing real traction. In Stage 1 of its presale, the $WAI token has already attracted serious investors. TAO Price Analysis: Rally Pauses at Key Resistance After bouncing off the $205 support level, Bittensor (TAO) surged over 55%, cutting through a short-term wedge and landing just below a 134-day descending resistance. However, according to the latest TAO price analysis, weekly indicators like RSI and MACD still flash neutral-to-bearish. The daily chart offers more clarity: bullish divergences suggest TAO is in wave A of an A-B-C corrective structure, with room to climb toward the $350–$385 range. For now, this Bittensor price analysis shows momentum is building, but without a clean break above trendline resistance, the breakout story remains unfinished. Algorand Crypto News: Staking Exodus Weighs Heavily on ALGO Price The latest Algorand crypto news paints a cautious picture, with ALGO hovering near yearly lows around $0.1865. Staking outflows have surged—over 301 million tokens exited the network in the past month, despite a reward rate above 7%. This signals growing hesitation among long-term holders. ALGO’s charts aren’t offering relief either. A death cross has formed, and the price has broken key Fibonacci support. As bearish pressure builds, this Algorand crypto news reinforces what the charts already suggest: without a shift in sentiment or on-chain strength, deeper lows remain on the table. Scam Risk in Crypto Is Real – Web3 ai Is Built to Catch It Scams in crypto rarely announce themselves. They blend in, play the part, and vanish with funds before most investors realize something was off. That’s the risk that Web3 ai decided to face head-on by building a system that sees past the surface. The platform’s Crypto Scam Detector doesn’t rely on red flags alone. It analyzes smart contracts, traces team credibility, tracks suspicious social sentiment patterns, and compares behavior against a historical fraud database. It’s not watching one data point – it’s watching everything. And when something doesn’t line up, it acts. The same goes for risk. Web3 ai uses statistical models like Monte Carlo simulations and GARCH to forecast where exposure could lead, not just where it’s been. That level of insight gives users a chance to adjust before the fallout. And that foundation is already drawing serious traction. Web3 ai’s crypto presale has attracted serious attention, and it’s still only in Stage 1, priced at just $0.0003 per $WAI. With a projected launch value of $0.005242, the math points to a 1747% ROI for those getting in early. But what really separates Web3 ai is that it’s not asking users to trust blindly. It’s giving them the tools to verify, detect, and protect without needing to become experts themselves. That kind of security, baked into every decision, is rare in crypto. Which is the Best Crypto for 2025? To sum up the latest Bittensor price analysis: TAO is up 55%, but without a breakout above that 134-day resistance, it’s just potential on pause. ALGO? It’s sitting at its lows. Over 301 million tokens have been pulled, and a 7% reward rate isn’t enough to keep people in. Both projects carry long-term potential, but right now, that potential is weighed down by hesitation and risk. Web3 ai approaches the equation differently. Its current Stage 1 price of $0.0003 paired with a projected launch value of $0.005242 puts early ROI at 1747%. But it’s not just the math that makes it the best crypto for 2025 —it’s the structure. From scam detection to risk modeling, Web3 ai isn’t just promising profit. It’s creating the perfect conditions for it!

If you remember watching it go from a few bucks to hundreds, then you already know how brutal that feeling of missing out can be. You scroll through charts, see the growth, and think, “Why didn’t I just jump in sooner?” That’s the thing with crypto—those who act early, eat early. But if you’re still on the hunt for the next popular crypto coin to buy that hasn’t blown up yet, you’re about to find one that’s still under $0.20 and moving fast. Qubetics ($TICS) is that second-chance moment you’ve been waiting for. While most people are distracted by coins that have already done their run, Qubetics is still in presale and already heating up. With over 509 million tokens sold, it’s clear that early buyers are getting in before the price floor shifts again. The Qubetics presale offers not just a low entry point, but also real-world use cases, which are honestly rare in the space. This isn’t just a hype play. Its tokenization marketplace brings real-world utility, and the fact that each stage lasts only seven days—with a 10% price hike at every new level—is creating serious FOMO across the board. If you’re still on the fence, this might be your final nudge. Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy—And You Still Have a Shot Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024, and you’ve already missed a ton of those low-entry stages. But here’s the deal—it’s not too late yet. Qubetics is currently in its 31st presale stage, priced at just $0.1902. Over 509 million tokens have already been sold, with more than $16.3 million raised and a growing holder base of 25,100+. That tells you one thing—people aren’t sleeping on this. They’re making moves. If you’re someone who missed out on Litecoin, this is a clear do-over. Let’s talk numbers. With the current Qubetics presale price, an investment of $1,000 gives you about 5,256 $TICS. Now, if the token hits just $1 post-presale, that’s already a $5,255.90 bag. But it gets wilder—at $5, you’re looking at over $25,000. And if it reaches $10 after the mainnet launch? That same $1K becomes over $51,553.02. Yeah, let that sink in. A shot at 5,155% ROI for those who move now. This isn’t just potential—it’s math. What makes Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy isn’t just hype, it’s real application. Its flagship product is a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that gives everyone—from small business owners to art collectors—a way to digitize and fractionalize their physical assets. Think of a landlord turning their apartment into tradable digital tokens, or a company in logistics tokenizing its fleet assets to gain liquidity without selling them outright. That’s the kind of utility that makes institutions and individuals both take notice. And with tokenized ownership, people can trade, sell, or invest in chunks—breaking the traditional barriers of capital and control. This is exactly why Qubetics is quickly rising among the popular crypto coin to buy picks. It isn’t another meme. It’s a tech-driven platform tapping into trillion-dollar traditional industries. And the kicker? Its mainnet launch is scheduled for Q2 2025. Once that hits and the utility becomes fully active, don’t be shocked if the price rockets well beyond $10. For now, the Qubetics presale still offers a 10% discount before the next stage hits, but every hour that passes is one step closer to missing it again. This isn’t just a good entry—it’s the best crypto presale in motion right now. Litecoin Already Ran—You Blinked, It Passed You Litecoin was that coin everyone heard about but few truly believed in until it already did a 100x. Launched in 2011 at just a few cents, it quietly crept up in value while Bitcoin took the spotlight. Then boom—its all-time high in the last bull cycle pushed above $400. The community watched a coin once seen as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” hit center stage, offering speedier transactions and lower fees that helped define its unique edge. But by the time the headlines caught up, the price had already soared, leaving thousands watching from the sidelines again. Those early Litecoin moments taught the entire crypto community a hard lesson—sleeping on innovation costs you big. Since its launch, Litecoin has stayed consistent in performance and maintained a firm spot in the top 30 cryptos globally. But the biggest gains? They already happened. Litecoin now serves more as a digital asset of stability than the explosive opportunity it once was. If you’re hunting for that ground-floor moment again, you’re going to have to shift your eyes toward newer projects with bold use cases and serious scalability. And that brings us back to Qubetics. Just like Litecoin had a mission and stuck to it, Qubetics is going after tokenized real-world assets in a way that’s practical and scalable. While Litecoin filled the need for faster payments back in the day, Qubetics is about to fill the trillion-dollar gap between physical ownership and decentralized digital access. For anyone still chasing a story like Litecoin’s but at the very beginning, Qubetics is sitting right in front of you. Don’t make it another “I should’ve bought it at $0.20” story. Conclusion: Don’t Regret This One Too—Qubetics Is Still the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy There’s a reason early adopters keep raving about Qubetics—it’s got that rare mix of affordability, application, and clear upside. Unlike Litecoin, which already had its breakout, Qubetics is still letting you in before the explosion. It’s the popular crypto coin to buy right now if you’re looking for something real, underpriced, and packed with ROI potential. And let’s not ignore the numbers—over half a billion tokens gone, over $16 million raised, and thousands already backing it while it’s still under $0.20? That’s not just hype, that’s traction. Crypto doesn’t give second chances often. If you’re serious about not missing another run like Litecoin’s, then join this crypto presale now. Qubetics is still in reach, but it won’t be for long. The clock’s ticking on this one, and every day you wait is another presale stage closer to higher prices. Don’t just read about the next big thing—this time, be part of it.

Bitcoin Surges 10%+ in Sudden Upside Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/crypto-comeback-bitcoin-surges-92k/,"Bitcoin price is moving higher above the $92,500 zone. BTC is gaining pace and might continue higher above the $94,000 zone in the near term. Bitcoin found support at $88,000 and started a decent upward move. The price is trading above $90,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $90,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $94,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Gains Over 10% Bitcoin price remained stable above the $85,000 level and started a fresh increase . BTC was able to climb above the $88,000 and $90,000 resistance levels. The bulls were able to pump the price above the $92,000 resistance. It even spiked and tested the $94,000 resistance zone. A high is formed near $93,888 and the price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $86,400 swing low to the $93,888 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $91,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $90,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $93,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $94,000 level. The next key resistance could be $95,000. A close above the $96,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $97,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $98,000 level. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $94,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $92,000 level. The first major support is near the $91,500 level.

Discovered on April 21, the compromised NPM packages had a hidden backdoor. The XRPL Foundation confirmed the breach and released version 4.2.5, urging all developers to upgrade immediately. The vulnerability doesn’t affect XRPL’s core codebase. Several projects like XRPScan and OpulenceX confirmed they’re unaffected.

April 23, 2025 03:30:02 UTC Bitcoin Dominance Today Hits 63.3% Bitcoin dominance is currently at 64.38%, it’s near its highest since February but has been stuck below the key 64.34% weekly candle top for over 10 weeks. A breakout above 66% could trigger a massive altcoin flush, intensifying BTC’s lead. However, if dominance fails here, it might mark the beginning of altseason , with capital rotating into smaller-cap tokens. Altcoin Season Index remains low at 16/100, reinforcing the current “Bitcoin Season” narrative. Meanwhile, BTC trades at $92,007 with a $1.75T market cap. April 23, 2025 03:21:50 UTC Elon Musk Shakes Up the Crypto World Again pic.twitter.com/hZxcOuTOan — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 22, 2025 Elon Musk recently shared a meme on X, warning people about crypto scams, joking that if a “hot girl” texts you about crypto, it’s likely a scam. His post, seen over 10.7 million times, highlights a common trick used by scammers—using fake profiles to lure victims. In 2023, crypto scams led to $3.9 billion in losses. Scammers often promise big profits and use fake websites or endorsements. Musk’s post is a reminder to stay alert and avoid shady crypto offers. April 23, 2025 03:10:57 UTC Elon Musk Tesla Earnings Tesla reported a 71% drop in Q1 2025 profits, earning $409 million as revenue fell 9% to $19.3 billion. The company blamed weak demand on political backlash and global trade uncertainty. It pulled back its 2025 forecast and warned of near-term challenges. Despite this, Tesla confirmed plans to launch new, affordable models and a robotaxi by June. Analysts said the stale vehicle lineup and Musk’s political role have hurt the brand, with calls growing for him to refocus on Tesla.

The Fed has kept rates steady in 2025, prioritizing inflation control amid tariff-driven economic uncertainty.

Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, or a managed investment scheme, and is not a derivative under the Corporations Act, Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button said in an April 22 judgment. The trio said Block Earner’s yield product couldn’t be classed as an investment or financial product because users loaned crypto under fixed terms for interest payments and didn’t pool contributions to generate further benefits. The terms and conditions framed it as a loan, and users had no exposure to the firm’s business outside of the agreed interest rate, they added. A court has dismissed the legal proceedings against Block Earner and ordered Australia's financial regulator to pay costs. Source: ASIC The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), which first brought the case, has been ordered by the court to pay costs for the proceedings, including appeals. The regulator said in an April 22 press release that it is currently “considering this decision.” Block Earner’s chief commercial officer, James Coombes, told Cointelegraph the court decision brings clarity that crypto assets shouldn’t be treated differently from other asset classes when applying existing laws. “Our product was simply defined as one where customers would lend their assets to us for a fixed return, there was no share in the upside of the pool of assets and as such no Managed Investment Scheme existed,” he said. “The fact that it included crypto assets should not alter that simple definition, and I believe this case forms a bedrock for ambitious brands around Australia to build from.” An ASIC spokesperson declined further comment. Earner product won’t make a return Despite the win in court, Block Earner will not be reviving its Earner product after axing it when legal proceedings began, but Coombes said that “crypto-backed loans products remain the core focus of the company.” “Regulation going forward is not an easy task, and we empathise with the regulators on this point,” Coombes added. “We hope a collaborative process can bring about positive change.” Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debanking ASIC launched civil legal proceedings in November 2022 , arguing that Block Earner needed an Australian Financial Services License to offer its three crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products. In February 2024, an Australian court initially found the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products. Another June 2024 ruling released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had “acted honestly” and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed.

After climbing steadily, XRP is now facing a critical test near the $2.10–$2.20 resistance zone — a level that could determine the asset’s next major move. Despite this hurdle, recent data points to strong underlying network activity that supports the bullish case. Related Reading: Solana Short-Term Indicator Signals Potential Risk – Reversal Or Pause? According to Glassnode, XRP network activity surged 67.50% in recent days, with the number of active addresses jumping from 27,352 to 40,366. This spike in activity suggests growing interest and participation on-chain, a key indicator often associated with sustained momentum. As investors closely monitor the broader market’s reaction to macroeconomic events, XRP stands out as a token that continues to draw attention based on both price performance and blockchain engagement. With bulls attempting to break through resistance, the coming days will be crucial for XRP’s trajectory. A successful breakout could ignite a fresh rally, while a rejection may invite short-term consolidation. Either way, XRP’s rising on-chain metrics indicate the asset remains firmly on investors’ radar. XRP Market Eyes Breakout As Active Addresses Surge XRP bulls are holding strong as the market braces for its next major move. After staying consistently above the $1.80 level, XRP now appears well-positioned to continue its upward momentum. Analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic, especially as the broader macroeconomic environment hints at eventual easing. Once tensions between global superpowers begin to cool and markets gain clarity, many believe a large surge across crypto assets, led by XRP, could follow. While sentiment grows more positive, some analysts warn of another leg down before a true breakout occurs. They suggest the market may need to establish a stronger demand base by dipping below current lows to shake out weak hands. This view contrasts with the more bullish narrative, but both sides agree: a major move is brewing. Adding to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared key data from Glassnode showing a significant uptick in XRP network activity. Over the past few days, active addresses on the XRP Ledger jumped 67.50%, rising from 27,352 to 40,366. This spike signals heightened user engagement and increasing on-chain demand — often a precursor to notable price movement. With network activity accelerating and price structure holding firm, XRP may be nearing a critical inflection point. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,000 Target As Price Action Signals Momentum – Details Price Faces Key Technical Test: Can Bulls Defend $2 Level? XRP is currently trading at $2.10, showing resilience near a critical support zone. However, a technical warning is flashing on the chart. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is on the verge of crossing below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a pattern that often signals weakening bullish momentum or potential market fatigue. This development places added pressure on bulls to defend the $1.95 support level. A breakdown below this point could lead to further downside and reset market sentiment. For now, holding above this zone remains crucial to maintain short-term bullish structure and avoid a larger retracement. On the upside, a decisive breakout above the $2.25 level would confirm renewed buying interest and mark the beginning of a recovery rally. Such a move could take XRP toward the upper boundary of its current range and reignite momentum across the broader altcoin market.

That one comment from the White House kicked off an after-hours rally across stocks and crypto, reversing earlier tension that had been building after Trump spent the last week trashing Powell and calling for his removal. The president’s sudden but typical 180, after days of calling Powell a “major loser,” came hours after he’d demanded interest rates be cut and posted that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 444 points, or 1.1%. S&P 500 futures climbed 1.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved up 1.6%. That was just hours after the Dow had already finished the day up over 1,000 points, cutting short a four-day losing streak. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed Tuesday with gains above 2%, sending a clear signal that investors were reacting directly to Trump’s remarks on Powell. Dollar, Bitcoin and crypto push higher after Trump talks Powell Bitcoin rose about 3% overnight, trading at $92,727 on Wednesday, right after Trump’s press comments hit. Smaller tokens joined the move: Ether, XRP, and Solana were all up in the hours after Trump gave Powell a pass. Source: TradingView The US dollar also surged by approximately 0.9% against the Japanese yen after a period of significant weakness, with the greenback having hit a three-year low against a basket of major currencies on April 21, as measured by the ICE Dollar Index, which fell to 97.92. Trump’s decision not to remove Powell came right after Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, told investors in a private meeting Tuesday that the tariff war with China couldn’t be maintained by either side. He said both governments would need to find a way to de-escalate and avoid permanent damage to their economies. More fuel landed on the crypto fire when a late-night report revealed that Cantor Fitzgerald LP, Tether Holdings Ltd., and SoftBank Group were in talks to build a $3 billion special purpose acquisition company that would be designed to absorb billions in crypto holdings. Traders expect a short-term pullback while gold keeps rising Despite the spike, some traders warned the move might not hold. Stefan von Haenisch, who leads over-the-counter trading in Asia-Pacific for Bitgo, said the crypto market had run too far, too fast. “The market has rallied relentlessly and feels a bit overbought here,” Stefan said . He added that a drop to $88,000 for Bitcoin would “not be unexpected” before the week is over. While Bitcoin and stocks were climbing, some investors weren’t buying it. They’ve been shifting into gold for weeks, and that trend hasn’t stopped. Gold futures have surged over 8% this month, and on Tuesday they hit a record high of $3,509.90. People are keeping their cash in gold while they watch the political noise play out. Jamie Cox, the managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said that move is temporary. “There is a ton of money hiding out in gold at the moment, so there’s plenty of unproductive money that will find its way back into the market at some point,” Jamie said. “The money is there, it’s just yellow at the moment.” The big takeaway from all of this: one sentence from the President of the United States can still move every corner of global finance. Stocks, Bitcoin, gold, everything—it all reacts to Trump’s mood, especially when it’s about the Federal Reserve. On Monday he was ready to fire Powell. On Tuesday he changed his mind. By Wednesday morning, markets had added trillions in value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The SEC said on April 22 that it had charged Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, claiming he misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds gained through his company, PGI Global, between January 2020 and October 2021. The regulator alleged Palafox used a multilevel marketing model to execute a “Ponzi-like” scam until the company’s collapse in 2021. The SEC said he lured investors through “false claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform.” The SEC claimed Palafox hosted lavish events in Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new members who were offered referral bonuses to recruit others and used investor funds to pay other investors to further promote the scheme, as well as to line his own pockets. Excerpt from the SEC’s complaint against Ramil Palafox. Source: SEC “Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,” said Scott Thompson, associate director of the SEC’s Philadelphia office. The SEC is charging Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and is seeking a permanent injunction to ban him from the future sale of securities and crypto assets, repayment of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. Justice Department files twin action The SEC’s complaint is running parallel to action brought by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which arraigned Ramil Palafox on criminal charges. According to an indictment filed under seal on March 13, federal prosecutors charged Palafox with wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions. Prosecutors alleged Palafox misled investors with false promises of daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3% from Bitcoin trading and hid information about PGI’s profitability, licenses, and business activity. The indictment said Palafox told investors that substantial returns were being generated via the company’s crypto exchanges and that “his traders were able to make money regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin was going up or down.” However, the Justice Department alleged that, in reality, most investors' money was never used to buy or trade Bitcoin, and many lost some or all of their funds. Property listed in the indictment that would be forfeited by Palafox if convicted includes over $1 million in cash, 17 vehicles, including two Teslas, a Ferrari 458 Special, two Lamborghinis, and two Porsches, plus a variety of designer bags, wallets, shoes, jewellery and watches. Related: Crypto crime goes industrial as gangs launch coins, launder billions — UN Various linked companies were included in the scheme, including the Praetorian Group International Trading Inc., the website for which was seized by the Department of Justice in 2021, leading to its UK-based operations being shut down by the UK’s High Court. It’s the agency’s first crypto-related case under its crypto-friendly SEC chair, Paul Atkins, who was sworn in on April 22. The SEC had brought a case against Nova Labs in January, accusing it of selling unregistered securities by offering devices that mined the Helium ( HNT ) token. The SEC reached a settlement with Nova Labs in April that resulted in the lawsuit being dismissed and a $200,000 civil penalty.

The funds are expected to go live later in 2025, subject to regulatory approval. Trump Media plans to invest some of its cash reserves into the ETFs, which will be launched alongside a number of Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts. The US law firm Davis Polk will be advising on the development and launch of the products. The initiative is part of the firm’s financial services and fintech strategy, using up to $250 million custodied by Charles Schwab following a partnership agreement with the bank in January. The finalization of the agreement follows Trump Media and Crypto.com signing a non-binding deal in March . It's set to be the latest crypto-related venture involving Trump and his family. The Trumps helped launch a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, in October, which has a linked token and plans for a stablecoin. President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., have also gone in on a crypto mining venture called American Bitcoin.

Meanwhile, Crypto.com’s native token, Cronos ( CRO ), has surged 12% after the company inked the deal with Trump Media, reaching $0.09.

The sell-off also sparked a broader debate about the role of ‘safe-haven’ assets in the wake of global and economic uncertainty. Trump called Powell a “major loser” and warned that the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately. He wrote on Truth Social that “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many.” Financial market drops amid Trump’s attack on Powell US stocks and dollar sink as Trump renews attacks on Fed chair Powell Currency sell-off intensifies after president steps up criticism of central bank head for not cutting rates — Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) April 22, 2025 The President argued that there is currently “virtually No Inflation” in the U.S. and that costs for energy and “most other things” are on the decline. Trump also added that, with costs trending downward just like he predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, “but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest remarks raised questions in his administration about whether they can legally fire the Fed Chair before his term expires in May 2026. Risk-off investments, including long-term bonds and the U.S. dollar, which are considered historical hedges against volatility, aggressively sold off yesterday, parallel to the sharp drop in the stock market. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) plummeted to its lowest since 2022, while the 10-year yield (^TNX) rose back above 4.4%. The 10-year yield continued to trade around 4.4% on Tuesday while the U.S. dollar index dropped below the 100 level, which is a key psychological and technical level. The markets showed unusual developments because they appeared to pull back instead of investors moving to safe havens like bonds or U.S. currencies. Wall Street warns of a ‘sell America’ trade A rare “SELL AMERICA” moment is unfolding. For the first time since 1981, the US dollar index is down over 5%, the S&P 500 is off more than 5%, and 10-year Treasury yields have climbed 10bps—all in just a month. That combo hasn’t hit since the double-dip recession days. pic.twitter.com/tkB07G4o8T — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) April 21, 2025 The unusual market development depicts a rare dislocation Wall Street strategists have dubbed the “sell America” trade. The chaotic market dynamics have raised concerns over stagflation, where growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, keeping Wall Street on edge that shifting trade dynamics could induce a self-inflicted recession. Wall Street saw investors move into commodities like gold, which rallied to yet another record on Tuesday, reaching $3,500 per ounce of gold. Investors also rushed to speculative positions such as Bitcoin, which traded near $91,000 for the first time since February. Fears of political interference in monetary policy might have triggered Monday’s sharp decline, but the exact catalyst remains unclear amid pressure from tariffs, slowing growth, and escalating geopolitical tensions. “This is not a good spot to be in in terms of narrative. No one’s betting against America, but no one’s saying, ‘Oh, we should be going all in over there right now, either.” -Ann Berry, founder of Threadneedle Ventures. JPMorgan also noted that U.S. equity ETFs realized net outflows of $3.6 billion last week, while developed international markets saw above-average inflows totaling $3 billion. The financial institution acknowledged that it was a notable shift given how heavily U.S. markets rely on foreign capital. Chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, Callie Cox, maintained that foreign investors own nearly a third of U.S. equities and more than a quarter of U.S. government debt. Cox noted that “Wall Street is America’s secret weapon of global dominance.” She also argued that it’s because the U.S. has innovative companies, strong institutions, and a stable rule of law. “Every one of those factors has been called into question lately,” Cox added. Micheal Goosay, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Principal Asset Management, believes that international investors who are supporters of the U.S. Treasury market “are getting a little nervous.” He argued that, whether it’s related to government uncertainty and policy uncertainty or growth and inflation uncertainty, it was undermining some of the confidence they have. In the wake of economic uncertainty, some argue about the long-term prospects of safe havens. Kevin Khang, senior economist at Vanguard, puts it “At the minimum, this reminds all of us that the world is watching whether the U.S. is going to continue its role as a provider [of] stability.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he had “no intention of firing” Powell . He also suggested that the steep tariffs his administration imposed on China could be reduced, saying they “will come down substantially,” although he added they “won’t be zero.” Bitcoin Breakout Follows Trump’s Retreat from Fed Showdown The remarks marked a sharp shift in tone from earlier this week, when Trump labelled Powell a “major loser” and hinted at firing him. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough, despite nominating Powell to lead the central bank in 2017. . @POTUS on Fed Chair Jerome Powell: ""I have no intention of firing him. I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates … but, no, I have no intention to fire him."" pic.twitter.com/PoWuuCqUwT — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) April 22, 2025 Markets responded swiftly. Bitcoin rose to $93,055, extending its gains to over 11% for the week. US stock futures also jumped, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures climbing in after-hours trading. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin tend to rally during times of perceived policy uncertainty or weakening confidence in traditional financial systems. Trump’s recent attacks on the Fed, paired with signs of political interference, have likely fuelled demand for decentralised assets that operate outside of central bank control. Trump Retreats on Powell Threat After Market Jitters Trump’s comments followed reports that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had raised the legal question of whether the president could remove Powell , a move that spooked markets and drew concern from economists about undermining the Fed’s autonomy. The Fed has maintained a cautious stance on further rate cuts, citing inflation that remains above its 2% target. Last week, Powell warned that the White House’s escalating tariffs could drive prices even higher. Trump responded by criticizing Powell’s stance and escalating threats to remove him. On Tuesday, however, Trump walked back those statements, telling reporters: “The press runs away with things. No, I have no intention of firing him.” The post Bitcoin Rips 6% Higher Above $93K After Trump Ditches Powell Firing Plans appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-23 03:39:44

The transaction, tracked by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, comes after four years of patient staking, with the deep-pocketed investor originally accumulating 991,079 SOL at an average price of $27. Whale Moves With Solana trading around $140, the realized and unrealized gains from the original allocation now exceed $153 million. Despite the sell-off, the whale still holds 1.19 million SOL that remains staked, with the stash valued at about $166.37 million, suggesting this could be more of a strategic rebalancing than a full exit. In typical crypto fashion, the responses on X have been a mix of insight, anxiety, and meme-driven skepticism. One user was quick to suggest the move could signal a SOL-to-ETH rotation in reference to Galaxy Digital’s recent flows, which saw it deposit $105 million worth of ETH to Binance while pulling nearly $100 million in SOL from the exchange. Last week, the firm transferred ETH valued at $80 million to Coinbase and Binance, with other large holders selling off another 143,000 ETH worth roughly $230 million. Interestingly, in a show of contrasting strategies among big investors, Lookonchain also reported a newly created wallet withdrawing 44,116 SOL from Binance, with an estimated value of $6.15 million, which was promptly staked. While some are cashing out, others are doubling down. Reversal and Bullish Signals On the chart, Solana is showing a delicate blend of strength and volatility. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $140.29, having gained a modest 0.8% in the last day. Despite inching higher, SOL has stayed within a tight 24-hour range of $134.72 and $140.35, indicating consolidation rather than breakout behavior. Additionally, it registered a 6% jump on the week, outpacing both the broader crypto market, which is up 5%, and its Coinbase Index peers, which are flat. Across 14 days, the asset has pumped nearly 29%, but its monthly gain is a more modest 5.9%, hinting at recent turbulence following a euphoric breakout earlier in the month. That rally, which saw SOL shoot up 38% in 10 days, was not without technical merit. Analysts noted that the cryptocurrency had formed a bullish falling wedge as well as a textbook cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. This convergence of bullish signals coincided with high investor engagement near the $129–$130 price level, now widely viewed as critical support.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has climbed 5.62% over the past 24 hours and surpassed $93,000 on April 22 for the first time since March 3, continuing a 12% price rally its seen over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin traders eye “craziest one-minute candle” Bitcoin quickly jumped from just below $91,500 to $93,000 in minutes, leaving traders guessing where the rally could go next. “This is the craziest one-minute candle I’ve ever seen on the Bitcoin chart,” Bitcoin commentator Michael Sullivan said in an April 22 X post. Edit the caption here or remove the text Pseudonymous crypto trader Crypto General said Bitcoin “is going as planned, as stated in the last post, a breakout was eyes and today we witnessed our breakout.” Just hours before Bitcoin’s upside swing, crypto commentator “Ted” told his 158,200 X followers that Bitcoin is “going to catch up” with gold and the $100,000 price level, which it hasn’t seen since Feb. 3, is “loading.” It comes amid an improvement in crypto market sentiment, more money flowing into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and US President Donald Trump’s softer tone on the trade war. On the same day, Trump said he had “no intention of firing” US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after previously criticizing him for not cutting interest rates . It comes only days after Trump called for his termination again in an April 17 Truth Social post , which led to speculation that he would follow through on threats and find a way to remove Powell. Trump just ticked “bullish boxes,” says trader Alongside this, Trump said tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” though they “won’t be zero,” which led to an uptick in positive sentiment among crypto analysts. Related: Bitcoin-to-gold ratio risks 35% decline following Wall Street’s $13T wipeout In an April 22 X post, economist and crypto trader Alex Kruger said , “Trump just ticked most de-escalation/bullish boxes.” Investing with Brandon said the news was “bullish” too.

Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is seeing gains as Bitcoin price surge above $93,000 , triggering a wave of excitement across investors. The sudden surge has many asking — why is the crypto market up today? The answer lies in a powerful mix of political optimism, institutional inflows, and renewed risk appetite. Trade Optimism and Institutional Inflows Drive Rally U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made market-moving remarks hinting at potential relief in the U.S.-China trade war. Bessent called the current 145% tariffs “unsustainable” and suggested a de-escalation could be near. That was enough to boost investor confidence, not just in equities but also in risk-on assets like crypto . Backing the momentum, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw $381 million in net inflows on Monday , the highest since January. The return of institutional money is a bullish signal, especially as MicroStrategy added another 6,500 BTC to its holdings — reinforcing long-term belief in Bitcoin. SEC Shakeup, Altcoin Surge, But Caution Remains Adding to the bullish sentiment, newly appointed SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has already dismissed several crypto enforcement cases. His pro-crypto stance is giving the industry fresh hope for a more innovation-friendly regulatory climate. Meanwhile, Ethereum jumped above $1,700 , Dogecoin surged 8.6% , and SUI spiked nearly 12% . Traditional markets also bounced back, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovering from recent losses. However,the liquidity and new demand remain weak compared to past bull runs, according to CryptoQuant . Resistance zones could still trigger pullbacks, but for now, the rally has reignited crypto market momentum .",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 04:02:29

The initiative comes at a moment when Bitcoin continues to trade near historic highs and investors seek exposure to the next phase of the cryptocurrency cycle. The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the deal would see the creation of a new entity called 21 Capital, backed by $3b worth of Bitcoin contributed by the crypto firms. Tether would contribute $1.5b in Bitcoin, while SoftBank would add $900m and Bitfinex would provide $600m, FT said. The structure is designed to mirror the strategy used by MicroStrategy , which transformed itself from a modest software company into a Bitcoin powerhouse with tens of billions in digital assets. Cantor didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. *CANTOR NEARS $3B CRYPTO VENTURE WITH SOFTBANK AND TETHER: FT Brandon Lutnick is partnering with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex to create a multibillion-dollar bitcoin acquisition vehicle, according to three people briefed on the matter. The vehicle raised $200M in January and… — db (@tier10k) April 22, 2025 Cantor’s Bitcoin Push Led By Lutnick Heir as Firm Deepens Crypto Ties Brandon Lutnick, who took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald after his father Howard Lutnick joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary, is leading the effort. Under his leadership, the firm has increased its involvement in digital assets, advising on high-profile deals such as Tether’s $775m investment in video platform Rumble. The vehicle will operate through Cantor Equity Partners, a special purpose acquisition company that raised $200m earlier this year. It will also issue a $350m convertible bond and raise an additional $200m through a private equity placement to expand its Bitcoin holdings. The strategy involves converting the Bitcoin contributions into shares of 21 Capital at a price of $10 each, with an internal valuation of $85,000 per Bitcoin. While the parties are aiming to announce the deal in the coming weeks, the details are still subject to change. The final agreement could shift or fall through altogether. Crypto Resurgence, Policy Tailwinds Draw Wall Street Deeper Into Bitcoin The timing reflects a broader resurgence in institutional crypto investment. Bitcoin’s price soared to over $108,000 following Trump’s electoral victory in November and has since fluctuated, now sitting around $92,000. Despite volatility, the broader trend has attracted interest from firms seeking to replicate the gains of early adopters. MicroStrategy, whose pivot to Bitcoin began in 2020, now carries a market capitalisation of more than $9b. Its model of raising equity and debt to accumulate Bitcoin has become a template for firms seeking to position themselves as crypto-native entities within public markets. The new venture also comes with a degree of reputational risk. Tether and Bitfinex, both of which are owned by the same parent company, settled major investigations with US regulators in 2021. However, the Trump administration has promised a lighter regulatory touch for crypto, which may create a more favourable environment for such initiatives.

Musk’s comment appears to have been the main catalyst behind Tesla’s (TSLA) 5.4% price jump in after-hours trading on April 22 to $250.80 after closing the trading day up 4.6%, according to Google Finance. It comes as the automaker’s Q1 results released the same day show revenues hit $19.34 billion, missing Wall Street estimates by 7.85% and marking a 9.2% fall from the same period last year. Tesla’s net income of $409 million also marked an 80.8% quarter-on-quarter drop and a 70.5% fall from Q1 2024. Source: Tesla Tesla’s digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1, alongside Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 11.56% price fall to $82,514 over the same time, according to CoinGecko data. A new rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board allows public companies to report their crypto holdings at market value. Before, only losses were recorded — unless the crypto was sold. Tesla’s 11,509 Bitcoin stash is now worth over $1.07 billion as a result of the market rebound over the last week, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings haven’t changed since June 30, 2022. Musk to ease up on DOGE duties In an April 22 earnings call , Musk promised that he would scale back his time working at the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to focus more on Tesla. “Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,” Musk said. “I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.” Musk said he’ll continue to spend “a day or two per week” on DOGE-related matters for as long as US President Donald Trump needs to ensure the “waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.” Related: Peirce signals SEC ‘reorientation’ under new chair Paul Atkins Tesla’s 5.4% rise in after-hours came on the back of a 4.6% increase to nearly $237 during the April 22 trading day as the broader market clawed back some losses from earlier in the week. Tesla shares are still down over 37% year-to-date, driven partially by declining sales, Musk’s increased political presence and economic uncertainty stemming from Trump’s tariffs.

Despite a small price uptick, concerns are mounting as more tokens are set to hit the market in the coming weeks. Today, approximately 5.8 million PI tokens are scheduled to unlock, with a much larger wave — 223 million tokens — expected to be released over the next 30 days. This influx of supply could intensify downward pressure on the price, especially in the absence of strong buying demand. At the time of writing, Pi is hovering around $0.66, a critical level for bullish sentiment. If the price can close above this level on the daily chart, analysts suggest it could open the door for a potential rally toward $1 or higher. However, failure to hold this support might see the price slide further, especially as token unlocks flood the market. Since being listed in February, Pi Coin has seen dramatic price swings — climbing as high as $3 at its peak before plunging to lows around $0.40. The decline has left many early adopters and miners, particularly those active since Pi’s early days in 2019 and 2020, disappointed. Several factors have contributed to Pi’s ongoing price struggles: Mass Selling After Token Releases : Like many airdropped tokens, Pi faces significant sell-offs after token generation events. A large portion of its user base, especially in regions like Africa and Asia, has been quick to liquidate holdings for cash, leading to increased supply pressure. High Circulating Supply : Currently, Pi has a circulating supply of over 6.9 billion tokens, with a total supply cap near 100 billion. Compared to Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million, the sheer volume of Pi tokens makes high price expectations — like $100 or even $10 — highly unlikely under current conditions. Limited Real-World Adoption : Although Pi’s vision includes becoming a widely-used medium of exchange, real-world usage remains minimal. While a few businesses accept Pi, broader adoption is still lacking, which limits utility-driven demand for the token.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 04:38:09

The former BitMEX CEO dropped the entire theory in his new essay “Ski Cut,” where he explained how a liquidity trick buried inside the bond market is going to melt faces. Arthur explained the Treasury Department started the buyback program years ago. Now it’s back, bigger, and more aggressive. The setup is simple. The Treasury sells a new bond. Then it takes that cash and buys old, inactive bonds—so-called off-the-run bonds—which barely trade. When that happens, prices of those dusty bonds go up because the Treasury becomes the only buyer that matters. That price jump helps RV funds—hedge funds running relative value strategies—lock in fast profits. They unload the overpriced bonds, shut down their short futures positions, and grab the gains. Bessent needs leverage junkies to buy more bonds The US bond market is currently being greased by this buyback loop. And Arthur believes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent knows exactly what he’s doing, so he can push as many buybacks as he wants. Congress doesn’t need to approve this, because technically it’s just the Treasury replacing one type of debt with another. “The trade is cash flow neutral,” Arthur said. The Treasury doesn’t borrow new money—it just swaps the old bonds for fresh ones of the same size with a primary dealer. Arthur warned this is only happening because Elon Musk, who’s running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), couldn’t hit his promised savings. Elon projected $1 trillion in cuts per year. That crashed to just $150 billion. Arthur said the government will keep spending like a degenerate gambler, and someone needs to buy the debt. Right now, that’s the leveraged traders. By March, the FY25 deficit was already 22% higher than FY24 at the same time. Arthur said falling stock prices, tariffs, and shaky businesses mean tax revenue will drop. That’s a problem. If the government spends the same but collects less, the deficit gets wider. Bessent will have no choice but to issue more debt. And to avoid a meltdown, RV funds have to load up. Buybacks are the only way to make that happen. Arthur pointed out that the same trick happened back in Q3 2022. That was when Sam Bankman-Fried crashed, the Fed kept hiking, and former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had to stop the bleeding. Powell wouldn’t help, so Yellen used T-bills to suck cash out of RRP accounts, which added $2.5 trillion of liquidity, and Bitcoin shot up almost 6x. Arthur said it’s happening again. People are waiting for Powell to ease rates. Arthur said, “He won’t. He can’t. He’ll sit there and stew.” RRP balances (white) vs. Bitcoin (gold). Source: Arthur Hayes substack Even though some traders think Bitcoin is headed back below $60,000, Arthur thinks they’re clueless. “They don’t understand the buybacks are flooding the market with dollar leverage,” he said. The last time traders missed it, they got caught off guard and were forced to chase the rally. May will confirm everything. On May 1, the Treasury’s QRA will drop, showing how much more debt Bessent plans to issue. Then mid-May, the April tax receipts will come in. If the deficit keeps widening, Arthur said the buybacks will go full throttle. If that’s not enough to calm things down, Arthur said the Fed could still help indirectly. One option is to exempt Treasuries from the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR), which would let banks buy bonds with no cap. Another is a QT Twist, where cash from expiring mortgage bonds gets reinvested into fresh treasuries. That would push $35 billion a month into the market for years. Arthur said Bitcoin will separate from tech stocks and sit next to gold as the digital hedge. And once Bitcoin clears $110K, Arthur expects a blowoff. “Maybe it just misses $200K.” After that, altcoins run. But he warned only a few tokens actually earn revenue and reward holders. Until then? “Back up the truck, and buy everything,” said Arthur. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The court had previously dismissed the SEC’s original complaint on Feb. 28 as Judge Amon said the regulator failed to establish that it had jurisdiction over Heart’s activities, which she said were not specifically targeted at US investors. She granted leave for the SEC to file an amended complaint by March 20, later extending the deadline to April 21.

Source: PACER Heart added that the SEC walked away from some of its other cryptocurrency cases voluntarily, but claimed his was the only case where “the SEC lost and crypto won across the board, with a dismissal in court of every single claim the SEC brought.” Heart said it was a victory for open-source software, cryptocurrency and free speech because the SEC “actually sued software code itself in this case.” SEC hunted Heart in Finland The SEC sued Heart in July 2023 for alleged unregistered securities offerings of three tokens, HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX), claiming he made more than $1 billion by touting the tokens as a “pathway to grandiose wealth for investors.” In April 2024, Heart tried to have the suit tossed, claiming the regulator “has no sway over him,” because he didn’t reside in the United States.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied for a second consecutive day, supported by macroeconomic headwinds and increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon pivot to rate cuts. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has slipped to a three-year low, increasing Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation. The situation mirrors recent gains in gold, which, like BTC, is often viewed as a store of value during uncertain economic conditions. Altcoins Join the Rally The bullish momentum wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) jumped by 13%, while XRP and Solana (SOL) each gained 7%. Dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 14% surge, riding the wave of renewed retail interest and risk-on sentiment. XRP: Holding Strong, Waiting for Breakout XRP has been holding firm within a well-established range, currently trading above key support between $1.21 and $1.55. Analysts highlight that, despite minor wicks and volatility, this zone remains structurally intact. A rally in wave five, as suggested by some Elliott Wave analysts, may still be in play. For a bullish breakout confirmation, XRP would need to clear $2.25, the recent local high from April 13. A successful push beyond that level could open the door for a move toward $3.30, and potentially extend to targets between $5.00 and $5.65, depending on broader market momentum. At the time of writing, XRP has gained more than 7% and is trading at $2.25. However, the path higher isn’t guaranteed. A break below $1.82 could shift focus to a deeper correction. While microstructure analysis shows no clear five-wave decline — which would imply a deeper correction — the market has yet to confirm a strong reversal.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 05:07:33

The price is now consolidating gains above $600 and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover above the $615 resistance zone. The price is now trading above $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $611 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $618 level. The next resistance sits near the $620 level. A clear move above the $620 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $635 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $620 resistance, it could start another decline.

At the time of writing, the price is sitting close to $89k, indicating a strong bullish trend.

Cantor Equity Partners raised $200 million in January for the new firm called 21 Capital. At the same time, stablecoin issuer Tether will fork out $1.5 billion in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Japanese investment holding firm Softbank Group will contribute $900 million, and the crypto exchange Bitfinex will add $600 million.

The figure, disclosed in its earnings release on Tuesday, is down from $1.076b at the close of December, reflecting the dip in Bitcoin’s price during the quarter. Tesla did not sell any of its holdings, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence . Tesla continues to hold 11,509 Bitcoin, a position it began accumulating in early 2021 when it became the first major automaker to add the digital asset to its balance sheet. Image Source: Arkham FASB Rule Change Lifts the Lid on Unrealized Bitcoin Gains This isn’t the first time Tesla’s financials have reflected the impact of new accounting standards for digital assets. The latest figure comes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s updated rule requiring companies to mark crypto holdings to market each quarter. Previously, companies had to record the lowest value of the asset during the reporting period, often obscuring unrealised gains. The change now allows firms like Tesla to present a more accurate view of their digital asset positions. It also comes at a time when institutional confidence in Bitcoin is strengthening, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Q1 Earnings Fall Short as Tesla Battles Cost Pressures and Slowing Demand Total revenue declined 9% to $19.3b, down from $21.3 billion a year ago. Automotive revenue fell 20%, dropping to $14b from $17.4b in the same quarter last year. Net income plunged to $409m, or 12 cents per share, down sharply from $1.39b, or 41 cents, a year earlier. The company did not issue new growth guidance for the year and said it would revisit its 2025 outlook in the next quarter. CEO Elon Musk has been spending significant time in Washington, working with the Trump administration on a broad plan to reduce the size of the federal government. The White House’s sweeping tariff policy has raised concerns for EV manufacturers, as higher import costs for key inputs such as battery components, circuit boards and specialty glass threaten to erode margins.

Speaking during Tesla’s earnings call, Elon confirmed that his work at President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will drop “significantly” by next month. The company’s stock shot up nearly 5% in after-hours trading once the words left his mouth. Elon told investors that while he’s stepping back, he’ll still help out with DOGE “to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.” He also said he’ll continue spending “a day or two per week” on government work “for as long as the president would like me to do so.” The comment came just minutes after Tesla reported a 20% drop in automotive revenue and a 71% collapse in net income for the first quarter. Elon Musk’s political influence is dwindling after he spent nearly $300 million to elect Trump According to the Associated Press, Elon created DOGE after putting nearly $300 million into Trump’s 2024 campaign, which helped return him to the White House and made Elon the country’s “First Buddy,” as he so calls it. Over the past three months, DOGE has hacked away at agencies that include the IRS, National Park Service, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs. DOGE also went after federal agencies responsible for keeping an eye on Elon’s businesses—namely, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These offices saw major job cuts under DOGE while Elon remained in government. The White House labeled Elon a “ special government employee ” back in February, a legal title that softens the ethics rules and lowers the bar for conflict-of-interest disclosures. The Justice Department says that category is for people working 130 days or fewer in a calendar year. By the end of May, the Trump administration will hit the 130-day mark, meaning Elon’s window for federal employment closes unless reappointed under a different label. Tesla’s market value has nosedived during the same time DOGE has been active. The company has lost roughly $600 billion in market cap so far. At the same time, DOGE’s website—last updated Sunday—claims it’s saved the government $160 billion. But not everyone’s buying those numbers. DOGE has already deleted some of its most extreme savings estimates from the site, after pushback. Tesla is still receiving backlash Elon also addressed protests targeting Tesla, which have broken out across both Europe and the United States. On the call, he blamed “very organized” protest groups for the backlash and claimed—without proof—that some people were showing up because they were “receiving fraudulent money” or were “recipients of wasteful largesse.” He didn’t explain further. The protests have added fuel to growing public anger over Elon’s political ties, including his open support of Germany’s far-right AfD party. Those affiliations have tanked brand trust in Tesla, especially overseas. Tesla is also struggling with an outdated lineup of electric vehicles and increasing competition from Chinese automakers. The company posted its worst quarterly performance since 2022, and its stock is down 41% in 2025 alone. Despite those numbers, the stock spiked after Trump said Tuesday he’s not planning to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that briefly boosted investor confidence. Inside government offices, DOGE staff have done more than trim jobs. In February, employees at the Department of Education said DOGE operatives physically pushed senior officials out of their offices, rearranged furniture, and installed white noise machines to block conversations. This chaos raised alarms on Capitol Hill. US senators warned that DOGE may have gained access to federal student loan data tied to tens of millions of borrowers. Every move Elon made inside government—every agency he touched—is under even more scrutiny now as he prepares to pull back. Whether the cuts from DOGE hold or not, one thing is clear: Wall Street thinks Tesla might have a better shot with Elon spending more time in the office and less time breaking furniture in D.C.

New research suggests that the cryptocurrency could climb as high as $200,000 per coin in 2025, driven by surging demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, and macroeconomic hedging strategies. At the same time, Bitcoin infrastructure firms like Bitdeer are doubling down on growth with multimillion-dollar investments in mining equipment and energy resources, signaling a broader shift toward the industrialization of the network. As financial markets continue to absorb Bitcoin into traditional portfolios, the asset’s dual role as both a hedge and a technological platform is coming into sharper focus. Bitdeer Secures $60M Loan to Scale ASIC Production as Bitcoin Mining Arms Race Heats Up Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer is charging full steam ahead in the face of intensifying global mining competition, securing a $60 million loan to accelerate its ASIC hardware manufacturing just as the Bitcoin network hits an all-time high in computational power. According to its recently published annual report , Bitdeer finalized a loan agreement in April with Matrixport, a crypto financial services firm founded by Bitdeer’s own chairman and industry heavyweight, Jihan Wu. The credit facility, which can scale up to $200 million, is collateralized by Bitdeer’s proprietary Sealminer hardware and features a floating interest rate of 9% plus market benchmarks. As of April 21, Bitdeer has tapped $43 million of the available funds. This latest funding comes on the heels of a broader capital strategy executed over the past year. In January, the company raised $17 million via an unsecured loan and added $572.5 million in 2024 through convertible notes. Bitdeer also boosted its equity base by issuing over six million new shares, raising nearly $119 million. Powering Up for a Mining Boom The company's funding spree is matched by major infrastructure investments. In February, Bitdeer acquired a fully permitted 101 megawatt (MW) gas-fired power project near Fox Creek, Alberta, for $21.7 million in cash. The Alberta site, already grid-connected with a 99 MW connection, is set to be developed with an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner and expected to come online by Q4 2026. With scalable potential up to 1 gigawatt, the site is positioned to become a core pillar of Bitdeer’s future operations. To complement this expansion, Bitdeer purchased 40 MW of liquid-cooled mining containers from Saiheat in March, signaling its continued pivot to more energy-efficient, high-performance mining infrastructure. Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at Bitdeer, confirmed a shift in the company’s strategy amid changing market dynamics. “Our plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,” LaBerge said, noting that cooling demand from external hardware customers had prompted the strategic realignment toward in-house operations. In a sign of confidence, Bitdeer launched a $20 million share repurchase program on Feb. 28, 2025. The program, active through February 2026, has already seen the firm buy back over 1 million Class A shares worth about $12 million. Bitdeer’s aggressive growth comes at a time when the Bitcoin network is experiencing unprecedented computational intensity. Earlier this month, the network’s total hashrate soared past 1 sextillion hashes per second — a level never before seen, according to data from BitInfoCharts. While a high hashrate is often viewed as a sign of robust network security and decentralized participation, it also means stiffer competition for block rewards. As more miners, or increasingly powerful machines, join the race, the rewards are divided among a growing pool of participants, squeezing margins and reducing the profitability per terahash. Adding to the pressure, transaction fees — a crucial secondary revenue stream for miners — remain historically low. The average Bitcoin transaction fee currently sits near $1, a stark drop from the $16 levels seen in April 2024, per YCharts . This double blow of rising costs and shrinking earnings has forced many public mining firms to liquidate significant portions of their Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin transaction fee chart (Source: YCharts) In March alone, more than 40% of BTC mined by public miners was sold to cover operational expenses — the highest ratio since late 2024. Companies like Hive, Bitfarms, and Ionic Digital reportedly went as far as selling over 100% of their monthly production. Mining Future Powered by Capital and Innovation Despite these challenges, Bitdeer’s actions suggest a strong belief in the long-term viability and profitability of Bitcoin mining — provided the right mix of capital access, energy efficiency, and operational scale. The company’s tight integration of financing, infrastructure acquisition, and strategic shifts in operational priorities could serve as a blueprint for other miners trying to survive and thrive in what is becoming an increasingly industrialized and capital-intensive sector. As Bitdeer looks to harness its growing fleet of Sealminer rigs and leverage its Alberta power project, the firm is setting itself up not just to weather the current storm — but to come out of it stronger and more dominant than ever. Bitcoin’s Institutional Boom: Analysts See Path to $200K in 2025 Amid ETF Inflows and Geopolitical Hedging In related news, Bitcoin could reach a staggering $200,000 per coin by the end of 2025, according to bullish forecasts from analysts at Standard Chartered and artificial intelligence-driven investment firm Intellectia AI. The reports suggest that a surge in institutional adoption — especially through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and macro-hedging strategies — could drive a dramatic appreciation in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The prediction more than doubles Bitcoin’s current trading price of around $93,000 and builds on mounting evidence that traditional finance (TradFi) players are embracing digital assets as part of broader portfolio strategies. The sentiment reflects a growing consensus that Bitcoin is no longer just a retail-driven phenomenon but a maturing financial asset being woven into the fabric of institutional portfolios. ETF Inflows Signal Growing Appetite Fueling this optimistic outlook is a wave of inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw their largest single-day net inflow since January on April 21. According to data from CoinGlass, over $380 million flowed into the 11 US spot BTC funds, marking a renewed vote of confidence from Wall Street and retail investors alike. The surge in ETF investments coincides with Bitcoin’s climb above $90,000 for the first time in six weeks, a rally driven by rising concerns over global trade tensions and geopolitical instability. Both Bitcoin and gold saw gains as investors hedged against a backdrop of uncertainty following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping import tariffs on April 2. ”While the forecast is optimistic, it's also conditional,” cautioned Fei Chen, chief investment strategist at Intellectia AI. “Any black swan — from a major regulatory clampdown to a geopolitical event — can disrupt trajectories.” According to the research, institutional players are no longer dipping their toes — they’re diving in. Analysts pointed to growing treasuries held in Bitcoin by corporations, as well as steady activity on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which now cater to a rising tide of professional investors. Data from Bitcointreasuries.net shows that corporate treasuries collectively hold nearly $65 billion in BTC — a figure that has been climbing steadily in 2025. This shift in ownership is critical, say analysts, because it reflects a long-term strategic outlook rather than speculative trading. Corporate Bitcoin holdings (Bitcoin Treasuries) Bitcoin vs. Gold: Hedge or Hype? The conversation around Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge has resurfaced amid increasing global instability. Investment bank JP Morgan noted in a January 2025 research paper that both Bitcoin and gold are being more frequently positioned as inflation and risk hedges in investor portfolios. However, the data on correlation tells a more nuanced story. Binance Research reported earlier this month that Bitcoin’s correlation with gold remains low, particularly after President Trump’s tariff announcement. Instead, Bitcoin has continued to track more closely with equities, raising questions about its real value as a geopolitical hedge. This tension has sparked debate among analysts and market participants. “Paradoxically, sustained ETF inflows could weaken Bitcoin’s role as a hedge,” said Spencer Yang, a core contributor to the Fractal Bitcoin infrastructure project. “Institutions holding BTC for balance sheet exposure are different from users who transact, build, or innovate on the network.” While ETF-driven inflows and treasury holdings can supercharge demand, some warn that Bitcoin’s long-term resilience will depend on more than institutional interest. Yang emphasized that true strength lies in actual usage, not just speculation. “Despite growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s long-term resilience won’t be secured by balance sheet optics alone — it depends on real usage,” he said. “That means people actually transacting, building, and experimenting on the network — not just holding BTC as a speculative asset.” The tension between financialization and functional utility shows the dual nature of Bitcoin in 2025. It’s at once a digital gold, a hedge, a speculative vehicle, and a permissionless network — and how it balances these identities may define whether or not it reaches that six-figure milestone. A $200K Dream — or Mirage? With Bitcoin’s trajectory increasingly tied to institutional flows and macroeconomic currents, the road to $200,000 is far from guaranteed. But the convergence of financial adoption, geopolitical hedging, and the evolution of crypto infrastructure suggests that such a target is no longer a fringe prediction — it’s a plausible scenario.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 05:30:00

The move extends BTC’s surge over the past two days, making it a 7.6% rallye since Sunday’s low. The rise unfolds amid the dollar plumbing three‑year lows, developments traders widely link to renewed trade‑war brinkmanship in Washington. The macro backdrop is unusually binary. On one side, Wall Street benchmarks are off roughly 16% from their February highs as investors digest President Donald Trump’s decision to impose—and then partially suspend—“reciprocal” tariffs on allies while ratcheting levies on Chinese goods to 145 %. Two weeks into the 90‑day pause, negotiators from Seoul, Tokyo, Brussels and Beijing still have no agreements in hand, and fresh talks convene in Washington later this week. “The consultation process may not be easy,” South Korea’s acting president Han Duck‑soo conceded ahead of his delegation’s departure. Why Is Bitcoin Up? Capital continues to migrate toward classic safe havens. Spot gold blasted through $3,400 an ounce on Monday—its fourth record in as many weeks—lifting the metal’s market value above $20 trillion for the first time. The yellow metal has added roughly $6 trillion in market cap year‑to‑date, three times Bitcoin’s value at its own January peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Above $87,000 In Sudden Move — Here’s The Catalyst Bitcoin’s latest leg higher has been greased by a burst of institutional demand. US spot‑Bitcoin ETFs absorbed a net $381 million on Monday, the largest single‑day haul since February and a sharp reversal from the net outflows that dogged the complex in March and early April. A lively debate is raging on X over what, exactly, is powering Bitcoin’s outperformance versus risk assets. Hedge‑fund manager Benn Eifert argues the answer is largely arithmetic: “Bitcoin is NASDAQ denominated in a basket of global currencies, not USD, and USD is collapsing.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Several Bullish Signals But Short-Term Holders Still Struggle Macro commentator TXMC contests the popular narrative that an upswing in global money supply is the dominant driver. In a thread rebutting “Global M2” overlays, he agreed with Eifert: “This is quite an accurate way of thinking about BTC’s performance. And it’s the same reason people’s Global M2 models have appeared to be skyrocketing even though the M2 data is 1-2 months old- because they’re overreacting to currency moves and don’t understand their models.” Where Is BTC Headed Next? Short‑term traders are fixated on a narrow resistance shelf that has capped every rally since late February. Analyst Jelle calls the area the “main event,” adding: “Reclaim $92,000 and #Bitcoin sends higher. A lot higher.” On‑chain metrics paint a similar picture. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, notes that Bitcoin is pressing into the Traders’ Realised Price band at roughly $91k–$92k. “The trader’s Realized Price acts as support when market conditions are bullish (green area, bull score >= 60), and as resistance when market conditions are bearish (red area, bull score <= 40). We are currently still in the second scenario,” he cautions. Momentum gauges have begun to thaw. Cold Blooded Shiller flagged a “first RSI 50 crossover on BTC in 3 months,” adding “if we’ve got counter-trend juice, this is where it ramps up.” That optimism is tempered by structural hurdles. Daan Crypto Trades reminds followers that Bitcoin is “closing in on the big $90k–$91k horizontal area which acted as the previous range low… This is also where the Daily 200MA is located.” A decisive push a “few percent” higher would, in his view, leave the chart “pretty great. Bulls know what to do.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,394.

He took a softer approach, reiterating that now is the “perfect time” to lower rates and hopes that Powell will “be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.” Trump just ticked most de-escalation/bullish boxes.

This move coincides with a shift in SEC leadership under new Chair Paul Atkins, which could signal a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Meanwhile, former SEC Chair Jay Clayton has been appointed interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Chiliz Meets SEC to Pave Way for American Reentry The fan token sports betting company Chiliz is preparing to reenter the United States crypto market ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The company recently met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss a big investment ranging from $50 million to $100 million, along with plans to relaunch operations in the US market. This move was made in a much more crypto-friendly environment under the current White House administration and a growing push for clearer digital asset regulations. According to public SEC records , Chiliz used the meeting to advocate for a new fan token framework, and argued that such tokens should not be classified as securities. The classification of digital assets has been a contentious issue in the US, and a favorable regulatory stance could greatly impact the growth of crypto-related ventures. Chiliz’s CEO Alexandre Dreyfus also posted a photo with Bo Hines, the executive director of Trump’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, which also implies that the company plans to engage with government officials. The company’s strategic timing aligns with the upcoming World Cup, which is set to be hosted by the United States in June of 2026, with Canada and Mexico also participating as co-hosts. Chiliz is banking on renewed regulatory clarity and increased public interest in global sporting events to fuel its reentry. Discussions are reportedly ongoing with National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Football League (NFL) teams about launching official fan tokens, provided there is a clear legal pathway. Despite these plans, Chiliz recently struggled to maintain its momentum. Data from DeFiLlama reveals that the total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem plummeted by 63.5% since December of 2024, falling from $17.8 million to $6.5 million by April 22, 2025. Chiliz TVL (Source: DeFiLlama ) Its native token, CHZ, also saw a steep 65% decline over the past year, according to CoinMarketCap . While Chiliz still has some strong partnerships with elite football clubs like FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and Manchester City, its US presence was previously scaled back because of the regulatory fallout from the FTX collapse in 2022. The company invested $80 million in the US in 2021 but withdrew the following year as the market environment became increasingly uncertain. With renewed efforts to define the legal boundaries of crypto assets and growing institutional interest in Web3 innovations, Chiliz is forging ahead to reengage with US sports leagues and fans just as global attention shifts toward the 2026 World Cup. SEC Transition Raises Expectations for Crypto Clarity Hester Peirce, a member of the SEC’s crypto task force, recently shared her thoughts on the direction of the SEC now that Paul Atkins has been sworn in as the agency’s new chairman. Peirce previously served as counsel to Atkins during his first term at the SEC from 2004 to 2008, and expressed confidence in his leadership due to his focus on economic growth and market support. She placed a lot of emphasis on Atkins’ integrity and is also excited for the opportunity to collaborate again, especially in efforts to recalibrate the agency's regulatory approach to better serve its broader mission. Atkins was officially sworn in on April 21, after his nomination by President Donald Trump to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler. His appointment was seen by many in the crypto community as a potential shift toward more supportive regulation. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Atkins faced questions about his past connections to the crypto industry, which some lawmakers suggested could present conflicts of interest. Peirce dismissed these concerns by pointing out his adherence to ethical standards and her respect for his character. The leadership transition at the SEC happened at a time of uncertainty in the crypto space. With Atkins now in place, the agency’s makeup includes four commissioners, though only three are currently active due to recent departures. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw is expected to leave before 2026, which could further tip the balance unless a Democrat is nominated to maintain bipartisan representation. Acting chair Mark Uyeda, who was appointed by Trump in January, indicated he will resume his regular commissioner role, leaving Atkins to take over full chair responsibilities. This period of change follows widespread criticism of the SEC’s enforcement-led approach to crypto under Gensler. During his time at the agency, it filed numerous high-profile lawsuits against major firms like Coinbase, Ripple, and Binance. Since the beginning of the year, however, many of these cases have been dropped, and industry stakeholders are hopeful for a regulatory reset. Peirce explained that there is now a shared desire for clear and constructive crypto regulations, and stated that the agency’s ultimate goal should be to create a transparent framework that supports innovation and compliance. Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Returns in Top Legal Post Jay Clayton, the former Chair of the SEC, also recently confirmed his appointment as the interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The role places him at the helm of one of the most influential legal jurisdictions in the country, and was granted after a procedural move by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blocked a Senate vote on Clayton’s confirmation. (Source: Truth Social ) Schumer used a “blue slip” , which is a Senate tradition that allows senators to reject nominees from their home state, to halt the process on April 16. As a result, Clayton can serve in the position for up to 120 days without official Senate confirmation, with his interim term set to expire around Aug. 20. (Source: US Attorney's Office ) Clayton replaces Damian Williams, who led several high-profile prosecutions. This includes the conviction of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other major crypto-related cases. Clayton said his priorities as interim attorney will include safeguarding public safety, preserving the integrity of the financial system, defending national security, and combating fraud, especially schemes targeting the elderly and vulnerable populations. President Donald Trump nominated Clayton over five months ago, and criticized Schumer’s maneuver as politically motivated as Clayton had bipartisan Senate support and complied fully with the nomination process. The Southern District of New York, the nation’s oldest federal judicial district, oversees a region that includes New York City and surrounding counties and often handles big cases involving financial crimes. Clayton served as SEC Chair from 2017 to 2020, and has a nuanced track record with cryptocurrency. While his administration filed 56 enforcement actions against crypto firms, he has since spoken a lot more positively about blockchain technology and tokenization. He even described them as transformative for financial systems. He is also positive about Bitcoin as a store of value, though he did not approve any Bitcoin ETFs during his time at the SEC.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 05:43:39

The softer tone arrived less than a week after Trump tweeted that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” On Tuesday, Trump downplayed outside speculation that the White House was actively studying a dismissal plan. He shrugged off earlier comments by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had said lawyers were looking into whether a president could fire a Fed chair. “This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,” Trump said. “If he doesn’t, is it the end? No. It’s not.” Behind the scenes, senior advisers cautioned the president that firing Powell would likely spark a market slide and an extended court battle, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was among those who warned of fallout, the people said, though the Treasury Department declined to comment. Under the Federal Reserve Act, governors — including the chair — may be removed only “for cause,” a standard courts have generally limited to serious misconduct or failure to perform basic duties. Powell has told associates he does not think the president can legally remove him and would contest any attempt to do so. Even so, Trump’s public attacks have been frequent. Last week, he told reporters, “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” and on Monday, he renewed his criticism online. Those comments have pumped fresh volatility into markets already unsettled by the trade dispute with Beijing. Trump may reduce tariffs on Chinese goods In Tuesday’s Oval Office exchange, Trump also addressed tariffs , calling the existing 145 percent rate on Chinese goods “very high.” He added, “It won’t be that high. It will come down substantially. But it won’t be zero. It used to be zero.” Analysts said any suggestion of softer trade terms and a steady hand at the Fed was enough to halt the previous day’s sell-off. U.S. equity futures rose in pre-market trading, the greenback firmed, and bullion prices retreated from their all-time highs. Still, economists cautioned that firing Powell would probably raise borrowing costs for households, companies, and the government if investors doubted the Fed’s freedom to set rates. “He got the hint. Firing Jay would be a catastrophic own goal,” said Mark Spindel, an investment manager who co-authored a history of Fed independence. He added that turning the Fed into a political captive carries “any number of bad outcomes, none of which helps the president or the country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The court has dismissed the financial regulator ASIC’s suit to impose penalties on the digital asset platform. Per a Tuesday judgment , the court found that the discontinued ‘Earner’ product was a loan, not a managed investment scheme. The Earner product was offered from March to November 2022, allowing customers to ‘loan’ specified crypto in return for interest paid at a fixed rate. Block Earner wins appeal against ASIC, with the Full Court of the Federal Court finding it did not require an AFSL for its Earn product. #CryptoLaw https://t.co/MXLAAl8N3S pic.twitter.com/Nu8BjdTqQ1 — Aaron Lane (@AMLane_au) April 22, 2025 ASIC Loses Block Earner Suit The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) initiated the case , alleging violations of corporation laws by both Block Earner’s ‘Access’ and ‘Earner’ products. Per the announcement , the “ASIC is seeking declarations, injunctions, and pecuniary penalties from the Court.” The Australian Federal Court issued a ruling in February 2024 , imposing penalties over the ‘Earner’ product. According to Judge Ian Jackson’s order at the time, the products were deemed to require an AFSL license. However, another ruling in June 2024 relieved Block Earner from paying a penalty in the local financial regulator’s legal action, as the crypto firm has “acted honestly and not carelessly when it offered the Earner product.” The regulator believed that Block Earner should pay a penalty of as much as $350,000, the Tuesday judgement read. Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button have dismissed the ASIC’s appeal made last year. Further, the trio had ordered ASIC to cover all legal costs from both the original trial and the appeal. Source: ASIC Per the regulator’s recent press release , ASIC noted that it is “considering this decision” of the Federal Court. No Plans to Re-Introduce ‘Earner’ Products Despite the legal victory, Block Earner noted that it has no plans to re-launch its ‘Earner’ products for Australian customers. Speaking to local media , Block Earner co-founder James Coombes said the Earner product was voluntarily closed in November 2022. Further, he stressed that there is no intention to reintroduce it. “This case highlights the importance of ensuring regulations evolve alongside technology,” he said. “Without modernised guidance, Australia risks losing fintech innovation to offshore markets more supportive of responsible crypto entrepreneurship.” Additionally, Block Earner co-founder Charlie Karaboga said that the ruling “brings closure to a long and difficult process.” The post Australian Federal Court Dismisses ASIC Appeal, Favoring Crypto Lender Block Earner appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Australia|Block Earner,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-23 05:46:36

The agency has charged the man behind PGI Global, Ramil Palafox, for running a massive $198 million scam through his company, PGI Global, which falsely claimed to be a crypto and forex trading platform. As per the SEC’s press release, from January 2020 through October 2021, Palafox promised investors massive returns through ‘membership packages’ and also offered them multi-level marketing-like referral incentives in order to encourage them to recruit new investors. Over $57 Million Investor Funds Misused Palafox misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds to fund his lavish lifestyle like buying Lamborghinis, items from luxury retailers and for other personal expenses. Further, he also used up the left investor money to pay other investors their returns and referral bonuses, like a classic Ponzi scheme, until it collapsed in 2021. “ As alleged in our complaint, Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds ,” said Scott Thompson, Associate Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office. Laura D’Allaird, Chief of the Commission’s new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit added that Palafox fooled investors by pretending to be a crypto expert with advanced AI trading technology. SEC Seeks Penalties and Recovery of Funds The SEC has charged Palafox with violating anti-fraud and securities laws, seeking permanent bans, the return of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. Palafox also faces criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. These actions show the SEC’s ongoing efforts to hold individuals and companies accountable for fraudulent activities in the crypto sector. Regulators are increasingly targeting deceptive practices, from Ponzi schemes to illegal staking services, indicating that the crypto space will be held to the same legal standards as traditional financial markets.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 05:49:59

Investors remain cautious amid fears of prolonged talks and potential recession risks, as finance leaders gather in Washington for IMF and World Bank spring meetings. Gold prices eased to around $3,340 per ounce on Wednesday, extending its retreat after briefly hitting a record high of $3,500 in the previous session. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded firmly above $93,000 on Wednesday after rallying about 10% over the previous two sessions Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.87% to around 34,980 while the broader Topix Index jumped 2.3% to 2,590 on Wednesday, with Japanese shares hitting a three-week-high. The Japanese yen traded around 142 per dollar on Wednesday after losing over 1% in the previous session, weighed down by a rebound in the dollar. In Japan, fresh data added a domestic boost, showing private sector activity returned to growth in April after a contraction in March . The recovery was led by a robust expansion in the services sector. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.17% to around 3,310 while the Shenzhen Component climbed 0.4% to 9,909 on Wednesday, extending recent gains amid hopes for de-escalation in the US-China trade war, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.30 per dollar on Wednesday amid signs of a potential easing in US-China trade tensions. President Trump signaled a softer stance on the U.S.-China trade war, saying the current 145% tariffs on Chinese imports will come down ""substantially"" after a deal is reached. ""It will come down substantially, but it won't be zero,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. His remarks came shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the current tariff standoff with China as “unsustainable,” fueling hopes for a de-escalation in trade tensions. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2025 GDP projections for China and Japan to 4% and 0.6%, respectively, down from its January forecasts of 4.6% and 1.1%. Investors are also closely watching the upcoming Politburo meeting for policy signals, with Citi expecting the session to take place later this week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 2.41% to a near 10-week peak of 21,904 in Wednesday morning trade, rising for a third straight session. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.13% to 79,805 in early deals on Wednesday, continuing their bullish momentum for the seventh consecutive session. Additionally, preliminary data showed that India's private sector grew in March at the fastest pace in eight months. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI rose to 58.4 in April 2025 from 58.1 in the previous month, according to preliminary estimates. However, the IMF's revised forecast for India's GDP growth capped gains, with the agency lowering its economic outlook for the country to 6.2% from 6.5% for FY2025- 26. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.48% to above 7,900 on Wednesday, reaching a three-week-high. The Australian dollar climbed to around $0.64 on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, as signs of easing US-China trade tensions lifted market sentiment. April figures showed Australia's private sector activity expanded for the seventh consecutive month , driven by strong gains in both manufacturing and services sectors. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher as hopes for a de-escalation in the US-China trade war lifted investor sentiment after a sharp selloff the previous day U.S. stock futures surged on Wednesday after President Donald Trump confirmed he has no plans to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell: Dow +1.12%; S&P 500 +1.47%; Nasdaq +1.71%.

Stablecoin absence may limit Bitcoin upside Thielen explained that a measured move from the falling wedge pattern, which traders perceive as a potential bullish reversal signal, shows that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may reclaim $99,000. He added, however, that “the absence of strong stablecoin inflows raises questions about follow-through.” Markus Thielen is watching the stablecoin minting indicator before confirming the Bitcoin uptrend is sustainable. Source: 10x Research Bitcoin was trading at $93,133 at the time of writing, up 11.42% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Thielen told Cointelegraph that stablecoin inflows “tend to correlate strongly with stickier money, while an increase in futures leverage could simply mean that fast traders are taking advantage of a quick move higher.” Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge, a true “demand-led rally” It comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US posted inflows of $912.7 million on April 22, the highest level since Jan. 17, according to Farside data. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that the inflows suggest “this is a true, demand-led rally. Not just a hot flash of excited futures traders moving price.” “If the news headlines finally quieten, we could break new highs sooner than everyone thinks. A fast track to $100,000 looks plausible, but things change quickly in a Trump presidency.” Thielen said if uncertainty continues to decline, “a further acceleration could provide the liquidity needed to support a more sustained rally.” Related: Bitcoin risks 10%-15% BTC price dip after key rejection near $89K The crypto market has experienced volatility and broader financial markets since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs in early February . However, Trump’s recent comments have traders speculating that he’s softening his stance on the trade war , with some seeing this as bullish for markets. Thielen said the $95,000 price level is a key resistance level for Bitcoin and a “potential trigger point for short-stop liquidations.” He said it could push Bitcoin’s price higher if market strength continues.

The figures reflect ongoing uncertainty among investors, with notable variations in sentiment both across regions and among individual crypto assets. Despite a relatively stable start to the week, broader macroeconomic data, particularly from the US, had a visible impact on fund flows. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Breakout From Multi-Month Downtrend, But Can ETH Hold $1,600? US Crypto Outflows Lead the Week, While European Sentiment Remains Positive CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that the release of “stronger-than-expected “US retail sales data mid-week coincided with a significant capital outflow. As a result, although there were early inflows, mid-week saw a pullback of $146 million, erasing much of the earlier gains. Regional trends were particularly mixed. The United States led the weekly outflows, with investment products domiciled in the country seeing a net withdrawal of $71 million. By contrast, European markets maintained a more positive outlook. Switzerland saw inflows of $43.7 million, Germany followed with $22.3 million, and Canada added $9.4 million, highlighting regional divergence in crypto investment behavior. Bitcoin remained the focal point of fund movement throughout the week. Intra-week flows signaled conflicting views among investors, ultimately concluding with minor outflows totaling $6 million. Short Bitcoin products also saw continued reductions, with $1.2 million in outflows last week. This marks the seventh consecutive week of outflows for short positions, bringing the cumulative withdrawal from these products to $36 million. According to CoinShares, this now accounts for approximately 40% of total assets under management (AUM) in short Bitcoin investment vehicles. Ethereum Sees Continued Pressure, While XRP Maintains Upward Trend Ethereum faced ongoing outflows, continuing an eight-week trend. The asset experienced a further $26.7 million in withdrawals last week, bringing total crypto outflows since the start of the recent streak to $772 million. Despite this consistent pressure, Ethereum still holds the second-highest position in year-to-date (YTD) fund flows, recording $215 million in net inflows so far in 2024. This indicates that while recent sentiment has cooled, longer-term interest remains comparatively strong. In contrast, XRP recorded notable weekly inflows of $37.7 million. This recent performance has elevated the token to third place in YTD fund flows, just behind Ethereum, with a total of $214 million in net inflows since the beginning of the year.

Earlier this month, ETH had fallen back to bear market prices and had seen its market share dwindle amid a wide market downturn marred by fears of a trade war. On April 22, analyst “Rekt Capital” said that ETH’s market dominance has fallen back to all-time lows but “managed to protect 2019 all-time lows as support.” ETH dominance fell to its September 2019 low of 7% on April 22, according to TradingView. However, its subsequent price pump has seen that share bounce off this critical support level and return above 7.5% on April 23. ETH dominance lows.

XRP, which is up by a more modest 7.5% daily, could see another 20% increase, which could drive it to $2.7. What’s In Store for XRP? $XRP appears to be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout toward $2.70. pic.twitter.com/LnhRA0zUqV — Ali (@ali_charts) April 23, 2025 Let’s begin the analyst’s prediction with the largest of the bunch. Ripple’s price slumped hard just two weeks ago during the tariff madness to $1.6. However, it quickly bounced off and reclaimed the crucial $2 support, which managed to defend the asset on several occasions. XRP then entered a consolidation period, but there were multiple signs , such as the squeezing Bollinger Bands, that a major breakout in either direction was just around the corner. That move transpired over the past 36 hours or so, as XRP jumped from under $2.1 to a multi-week peak of $2.25. According to Martinez, that’s just the beginning, and he doubled down on his $2.7 target for Ripple’s cross-border token. Aside from the inverse head and shoulders pattern suggesting further price increases for XRP, major positive news, such as the potential approval of a Ripple ETF, could also serve as a catalyst for more gains. In contrast, the asset can retrace if Ripple’s legal woes in the States worsen . Dogecoin, Cardano Chart Double-Digit Gains DOGE and ADA have outperformed XRP on a daily scale, registering massive 13% and 11.5% increases, respectively. Consequently, their prices have risen to $0.182 and almost $0.7. Dogecoin’s surge past the key resistance at $0.17 was particularly important as the asset risked dumping by 65% if it failed to do so. Now, Martinez updated that it is breaking out of an ascending triangle, which can send it to $0.195. #Dogecoin $DOGE appears to be breaking out of an ascending triangle, with a potential upside target of $0.195! pic.twitter.com/P7dkmIiQ9B — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 Dogecoin also awaits news on the US ETF front , but its chances for approval this year are lower than XRP’s, at least according to Polymarket (52% vs. 79%). Cardano’s odds on Polymarket to have its own exchange-traded fund are slightly higher than Dogecoin’s, sitting today at 57%. Its price has also surged impressively over the past few days and now aims at $0.77, Martinez noted. #Cardano $ADA is breaking out. $0.77 next! https://t.co/f8jr43lPOi pic.twitter.com/3FcMcR7ysT — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 The post XRP, ADA, DOGE Prices Breaking Out: Here Are The Next Targets appeared first on CryptoPotato .",ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Cardano (ADA) Price|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-23 06:10:57

That mountain of paper gives Warren a grip on 4.89% of the full T-bill pie, which hit $6.15 trillion at the end of March 2025. Warren controls nearly one in every twenty dollars floating around in the T-bill system. The full breakdown in the report shows that Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on $14.4 billion worth of Treasury bills categorized as cash equivalents—those with under three months left to maturity. On top of that, $286.47 billion more is tied up in short-term investments, all of them directly pegged to Treasury bills. That adds up to the $300.87 billion total. No stocks. No junk. No crypto. Just old-school government debt. This report comes from Berkshire Hathaway’s filings, and it shows how deep Warren is digging into safety and liquidity. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Monthly Statement of the Public Debt, the entire Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion by the end of March. That’s where the 4.89% number comes from. Warren Buffett with late best friend Charlie Munger, who was the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Source: Robyn Twomey/Redux/laif Berkshire piles higher than the Federal Reserve Warren now holds more Treasury bills than the Federal Reserve itself, which currently owns just over $195 billion. That puts Berkshire Hathaway in a bigger T-bill position than the most powerful central bank on Earth. It’s not a flex. It’s just the reality of sitting on more than $334 billion in cash, with 90% of that cash now stored in Treasury bills alone. The yields are the real draw. As of April 2025, T-bills are paying around 4.359%, and that kind of return, backed by the U.S. government, is better than what Warren sees in the stock market. He hasn’t made a major acquisition in over two years. His reason is simple: everything’s too expensive. Even with Berkshire owning chunks of businesses across insurance, energy, railroads, and consumer goods, Warren sees no good targets at current prices. He’s not buying because he doesn’t like overpaying. That’s it. Even tech giants like Apple are playing the T-bill game, though on a much smaller scale. Apple holds about $30 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Half of that—$15.5 billion—sits in Treasuries. But that’s nothing compared to the pile Warren has built. Buffett waits as the market tanks Everyone’s watching to see when Warren moves again. Stocks have bled trillions in value this year. Indexes are nowhere near their peaks. But while others panic, Warren is just chilling on his cash fortress, holding off for what he’s called the “fat pitch.” “He’s getting real-time information,” says Mead, referring to the way Warren receives constant updates through Berkshire’s massive group of businesses. But that doesn’t mean a crash is coming. It just means he’s not seeing any assets worth buying. “He knew when to sell,” Mead said. “Deciding when, and what, to buy has become much harder.” Alex Morris, the author of Buffett and Munger Unscripted , said Warren’s size limits his options. “His opportunity set is pretty small,” Morris said. Berkshire’s market value is over $1 trillion, which means even billion-dollar deals barely register. Back in 2009, Warren bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26 billion. It was the biggest deal he ever made. Today, that same number is just 2.5% of what Berkshire is worth. Morris threw out two possible moves: take the rest of Coca-Cola or American Express private. The cost? $280 billion or $130 billion. Still, it wouldn’t make a serious dent in Warren’s war chest. The kind of lifelines Warren extended to Goldman Sachs, Dow Chemical, and Bank of America during the last crash would have to be massively bigger today just to matter. “They’d have to be significantly larger to make a dent,” Morris said. So while the market begs for movement, Warren is just sitting in his pile of T-bills, letting it pay him to wait. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

BANKEX alleges that two former employees, Alexandr Vlasov and Petr Korolev, misappropriated company assets to form Matter Labs, according to a lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court on March 19. The lawsuit alleges that the two developers secretly transferred and built upon BANKEX’s blockchain technology and founded Matter Labs, a rival entity that has since raised more than $450 million in venture funding and established a prominent position in the blockchain space. The lawsuit names BANKEX CEO Igor Khmel and the BANKEX Foundation as plaintiffs. The lawsuit states that in 2017, BANKEX was approached by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to develop operational software for Plasma, an innovative solution aimed at reducing transaction costs on Ethereum. Vlasov and Korolev, both BANKEX employees at the time, were assigned to work on the project. Related News: BREAKING: US President Donald Trump Makes Statement on Cryptocurrencies However, the complaint alleges that the duo secretly diverted company resources to develop Matter Labs and maintained and used BANKEX’s codebase and infrastructure. Vlasov currently serves as head of R&D at Matter Labs, while Korolev is the founder of blockchain security firm OXORIO. In addition to Vlasov and Korolev, the lawsuit also names Matter Labs co-founder Alex Gluchowski, venture capital firm Dragonfly and investor Chris Burniske of Placeholder Capital, alleging that they were either complicit in or aware of the alleged intellectual property theft. In response, a Matter Labs spokesperson said: “We believe these allegations are completely without merit. The gist of the complaint is that Matter Labs built ZKsync on top of code originally developed at BANKEX. This claim is absolutely false. ZKsync is original technology that is not based on or derived from any code developed by BANKEX. We stand by the integrity of our work and look forward to addressing these baseless allegations in court once they are served on us.” *This is not investment advice.

Speaking to reporters , Trump labeled it now the “perfect time” for the Fed to act. While he attempted to squash rumors about Powell’s dismissal, he didn’t hold back his criticism. “I’m not firing Powell,” Trump said, blaming the media for fueling speculation. Still, he added that the Federal Reserve should move faster in cutting interest rates, pointing to global central banks already easing their policies. “He should act early or on time, not late.” — Trump on Powell Markets Stay Steady as Trump Ramps Up Pressure Despite Trump’s direct messaging, the markets stayed cool. Bitcoin surged past $90K , riding the optimism sparked not only by Trump’s comments but also by U.S. Treasury Secretary’s remarks labeling the trade war with China as “unsustainable.” Treasury yields saw only modest movement, with short-term rates edging up to 3.82% following weak demand at a bond auction. The U.S. dollar held steady , reflecting cautious investor optimism over easing trade tensions. Analysts suggest that Trump’s public push may be more about managing expectations — and assigning blame — than any real threat to Powell’s leadership. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K , FED in Holding Pattern as Pressure Mounts The Federal Reserve , meanwhile, remains cautious. While Powell’s job is safe for now, the central bank continues to assess the impact of Trump’s policies on trade, taxes, and immigration. With inflation stubbornly above the 2% target for the fourth year in a row, most Fed officials believe current interest rate levels are justified. Still, economists warn that the ripple effects of tariffs could weigh on growth later this year — possibly forcing the Fed to revisit its stance. “FED rate cuts may not be off the table — even if Powell resists political pressure for now.” With Wall Street bouncing back and Trump intensifying his calls for action, one thing is clear: The Trump vs. Powell rate debate isn’t going away anytime soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The renewed optimism across digital assets has prompted speculative buying in lower-market-cap tokens, with meme coins benefiting from the influx. Their performance reflects the heightened enthusiasm among retail traders following Bitcoin’s breakout and widespread gains across major altcoins. The increase of interest in meme coins bodes well for early-stage project CartelFi . CartelFi , the new cartel-themed yield farming protocol, has already raised over $1 million in its presale. Why the broader market is rallying The cryptocurrency market surged over 6% on Wednesday, buoyed by gains across major digital assets. Bitcoin rallied past the $93,000 mark for the first time since March 6, while Ethereum, XRP, and Solana advanced 13%, 8%, and 9%, respectively. The broader rally extended to niche segments, with meme coins jumping over 15% and other sectors such as AI and real-world assets also registering gains. The shift in market sentiment appears to have been driven by renewed optimism on the geopolitical front. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a possible easing of tensions in the US-China tariff dispute, calling the current trajectory of the trade conflict “unsustainable” and indicating a de-escalation may be on the horizon. President Donald Trump also told reporters that he intends to reach an agreement with China to reduce tariffs, describing the current 145% levy as excessively high and unlikely to persist. Why CartelFi is grabbing attention CartelFi is emerging as a transformative force at the intersection of meme culture and decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing a persistent dilemma in the cryptocurrency space: the conflict between the high-risk, high-reward potential of meme coins and the stability offered by yield-generating DeFi protocols. By introducing specialized liquidity pools tailored for meme coins, CartelFi is revolutionizing how typically idle speculative assets can be harnessed for productive capital. This innovative model allows investors to maintain exposure to the significant upside potential of meme coins while simultaneously earning yields traditionally associated with more stable DeFi assets, effectively bridging the gap between speculation and stability. A standout feature of CartelFi’s protocol is its automatic buyback and burn mechanism, which is funded by up to 100% of collected fees. This creates a deflationary pressure designed to support the token’s value while fostering long-term growth potential. By addressing the inefficiency of billions of dollars in meme tokens sitting dormant in wallets, CartelFi is positioning itself to unlock this untapped capital. With its forward-thinking approach, CartelFi is setting out to prove that meme coins can evolve beyond their speculative nature. CartelFi presale is running hot The CartelFi presale has already raised over $1 million from early participants, reflecting steady initial traction for the project. Structured across 30 stages with a 5% token price increase at each phase, the presale incentivizes early involvement while creating momentum through built-in pricing pressure. At its current level of $0.0352, the token is positioning early backers for notable gains ahead of CartelFi’s public market debut. The project’s pitch — converting idle meme coin holdings into productive, yield-bearing assets — marks a differentiated entry in the crowded DeFi space. Billed as the “first DeFi project turning memes into money printers,” CartelFi is targeting a long-ignored inefficiency in crypto’s speculative corners.

Judge Carol Bagley Amon noted that Heart’s activities were not clearly targeted at U.S. investors, CoinDesk previously reported , undermining the SEC’s case.

IMX price skyrockets 44% As Ethereum, XRP and Solana all eye key levels, IMX leads the top 100 by market with a parabolic spike to highs of $0.69, its highest level since March 28. The token’s market capitalization has climbed to $1.2 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $406.8 million.

Why did Immutable price go parabolic today? Several factors could be behind IMX’s parabolic rise. A major driver might be the anticipation amid a multi-billion-dollar partnership hinted to by Immutable’s co-founder, Robbie Ferguson.

Denis Beau, first deputy governor of the Banque de France , warned that the Donald Trump administration’s recent executive order promoting dollar-backed stablecoins poses “concrete adverse consequences” for Europe’s financial sovereignty and called for urgent progress on a digital euro . In a speech last week, Beau noted that the dxecutive order , signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in late January, prohibits all work related to the development of a new form of central bank digital currency, promotes the development of dollar-backed stablecoins, and encourages citizens and businesses to use public blockchains. He warned that “without a central bank money-based payment solution,” private, non-European alternatives could dominate tokenized finance. “If the tokenisation of financial assets were to gather pace, the lack of a central bank money payment solution in euro might therefore threaten the role of central bank money as the anchor of the euro area’s monetary architecture, with concrete adverse consequences.” Denis Beau You might also like: The United States is unfocused on CBDCs | Opinion The first deputy governor of the Banque de France linked this trend to an increase in counterparty and liquidity risks, increased fragmentation of settlement, and ultimately a “loss of sovereignty and a weakening of financial stability.” Beau added that Trump’s new political direction “reinforces the need for Europe to preserve its monetary sovereignty, which means developing its payment sovereignty.” He also noted that Apple Pay and Google Pay have already established a strong foothold in Europe, while European payment systems remain fragmented and are steadily losing market share.

In an Apr. 23 Substack article , Hayes pointed to the Treasury’s plan to issue new debt to repurchase older, less liquid bonds, commonly called off-the-run Treasuries. These bonds don’t trade as frequently, so buying them back could help smooth out the bond market while offering arbitrage opportunities for institutional investors. Hayes points out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will probably rely more on bond issuance and buybacks to maintain market stability, given the widening U.S. deficits and declining tax revenue. According to Hayes, this mechanism will function similarly to quantitative easing, which is a strategy used by central banks to boost the money supply and stimulate the economy. However, in this instance, liquidity conditions are being essentially eased by the U.S. Treasury rather than the Federal Reserve. He argues that by lowering the yields on older bonds, this buyback strategy will encourage investors to look for higher returns in riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Binance Research: U.S. Treasury issuance is a key macro area to watch At the same time, when bond markets become less volatile, investors will feel safer borrowing money to make bigger bets. This extra buying power can lead to larger price swings in riskier assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), pushing prices up faster when as markets rise. Hayes points out that this pattern is similar to what occurred in late 2022 when a strong Bitcoin rally was fueled by growing market liquidity. He believes most investors are too focused on when the Fed will cut interest rates, overlooking the fact that the central bank has already slowed its quantitative tightening, which means it’s easing conditions behind the scenes. If liquidity keeps flowing, Bitcoin could reach $110,000 and then surge toward $200,000, Hayes predicted. And once BTC breaks that level, altcoins may see an even bigger surge as investors rotate into higher-risk assets.

Here’s What’s Fueling the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Price today has soared nearly 11.7% over the past week and 5.9% in the last 24 hours , defying broader market turmoil. While U.S. stock prices have plummeted due to escalating tariff tensions and a weakening dollar, Bitcoin is rallying , alongside gold, sparking fresh debate about its role as a safe-haven asset . Bitcoin Price Surges as Stocks Sink: What’s Driving the Divergence? Since April 19 , Bitcoin has climbed over 10.7% , while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have fallen 5.25% and 4.27% , respectively. This sharp contrast points to a potential decoupling between crypto and equities. Bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 currently stands at 0.65 , indicating a partial break from traditional market trends. The rally was triggered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s recent statement suggesting that the ongoing tariff standoff with China is unsustainable , encouraging risk-on sentiment in the crypto market . Weakening US Dollar and Fed Pressure Fuel the Rally The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped by 4.81% this month, including a 0.77% fall on April 21 alone . This decline comes amid President Trump’s pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. A weaker dollar has historically boosted Bitcoin, and that’s exactly what the market is witnessing now.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exists in phase 4 of its presale stage at $0.025 per token which has sparked strong investor demand. The decentralized lending approach with strategic tokenomics technologies positions Mutuum Finance among the top choices in the cryptocurrency marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical uses from its platform which promises a remarkable 16,490% ROI return during six months while effectively surpassing Dogecoin’s anticipated profit rates. Smart investors become more urgent as phase 4 of the project speeds up because early entry windows become shorter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches Its Robust Lending Structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates its own space in decentralized finance through the peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer dual lending models. Bankers who invest into ETH liquidity pools gain mtTokens like mtETH which develop worth throughout time. The borrowing process requires users to present assets worth more than their loan value for security purposes. The process of acquiring $5,000 USDT necessitates a collateral amount of $7,000 ETH which protects the lender. A Certik audit on the smart contracts is nearly complete and the team plans to reveal the findings to their social media audience to enhance user trust. Dogecoin’s speculative characteristics stand in stark contrast to the secure and user-focused system of Mutuum Finance which calls for analyzing the Dogecoin outlook. Dogecoin’s Fading Rally Dogecoin currently exists at $0.15 price while its trading activity has plunged by 22% within a consolidation range. Recent whale activity involving 570 million DOGE shows a concept of optimistic behavior without a noticeable price surge. Market analysts predict Dogecoin will reach $1 by 2025 to generate a 566% increase yet the technical indicators display negative trends around $0.17 resistance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors structured expansion through its investment approach. The phase 4 tokens of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sell for $0.025 before providing investors with a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price and potential gains of $4.15 post-launch which generates a 16,490% return on investment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges from this comparison favorably when considering its market advantage ahead of performing its tokenomics evaluation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Tokenomics Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates substantial investor interest through token sales underway during phase 4 at the price of $0.025. Phase 5 expands the MUTM token value to $0.03 while providing current owners with a 20% increase in their investment. MUTM token purchases with platform earnings function as a distribution mechanism that provides buy pressure for mtToken holders by reallocating bought MUTM tokens. The platform displays top holding positions of 50 users while giving bonus tokens to those who defend their rank statuses thus stimulating continued competition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes sustainable token economics to protect its value structure while Dogecoin depends on market sentiments so Dogecoin fails to establish itself as the leading choice for potential growth. Final Thoughts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) spends its time as the sole under-$0.5 altcoin that could generate a 16,490% ROI in half a year surpassing Dogecoin’s foreseeable gains. The platform anticipates great growth due to its lending system integration with tokenomic features and near-finished audit by Certik. Phase 4 holds its price point at $0.025 before Phase 5 launches with a 20% price increase scheduled to happen soon. The initial value of tokens purchased by investors ensures a gain of 140% from the initial purchase with a projected future worth of $4.15.

Cantor chair Brandon Lutnick, the son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is aiming to replicate Strategy’s success as a public company investing heavily in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on April 23. The investment structure involves a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Cantor Equity Partners that raised $200 million in January and plans to go public. The Big Boys Betting on Bitcoin Tether would contribute $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, while SoftBank and Bitfinex would contribute $900 million and $600 million, respectively, reported the FT. Tether and Bitfinex are owned by the same parent company. 21 Capital will also raise a $350 million convertible bond and a separate $200 million private placement of equity to buy additional Bitcoin. Eventually, SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex would see their BTC investments converted into shares in 21 Capital at $10 per stock and value the asset at $85,000. The crypto consortium is the first in a “potential wave of SPAC deals led by Cantor Fitzgerald,” according to the FT, citing people familiar with the matter. “This time, it looks like the bet from one of big tech’s most infamous risk takers can’t be unwound so easily,” commented Van Eck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel.

What started as an ambitious vision is now an expanding reality. With a clear philosophy — transforming blockchain from a speculative tool into a real driver of change — LinkedNation has been delivering on its promise from day one: launching free educational initiatives, directly supporting public schools, and organizing high-level networking events. Early Actions, Early Impact In just a few weeks, LinkedNation has already provided free access to high-quality training for hundreds of people worldwide. Courses on blockchain, finance, entrepreneurship, and leadership are available at no cost, truly democratizing knowledge. Additionally, the project has begun actively investing in public schools — a tangible first step toward its goal of community impact. Purposeful Networking & Strategic Alliances LinkedNation’s exclusive events are already delivering results: private dinners and community gatherings have brought together politicians, entrepreneurs, and social leaders in environments where real collaborations are born. These connections not only strengthen the ecosystem but also lay the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth. Trusted Endorsements That Inspire Confidence Official endorsement from Alex Redano, State Deputy and President of the Legislative Assembly of Rondônia, has further reinforced the project’s legitimacy. And this is just the beginning: new endorsements from key figures in politics, business, and education are expected in the coming weeks — a reflection of the trust LinkedNation is building across sectors. $NATION Token Off to a Strong Start The launch of the $NATION token on the Solana network has been met with enthusiasm. The community is already actively participating in governance processes, staking, and supporting projects that deliver real-world impact. “From the very first moment, the response exceeded all our expectations,” said a LinkedNation spokesperson.“We’re showing that blockchain can be a powerful and measurable force for social good.” Join the Movement LinkedNation invites investors, educators, entrepreneurs, and changemakers to become part of this community — one that’s not just talking about impact but actively creating it.This is your opportunity to join an ecosystem where technology meets purpose, and the digital meets the real. 🔗 Learn More & Get Involved: 🌐 Website (English): linkednation.io 🌐 Website (Portuguese): linkednation.com.br 📄 Docs: docs.linkednation.io 📢 Telegram (Global): t.me/LinkedNation 🇧🇷 Telegram (Brazil): t.me/LinkedNationbr 📌 Linktree: linktr.ee/linkednation Press Contact: LinkedNation Communications 📧 Email: contact@linkednation.io Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC jumped 6.5%, with Solana’s SOL, XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB all adding 8%. Major memecoins dogecoin ( DOGE ) and shiba inu (SHIB) climbed more than 11%, with Sui Network’s SUI surging 30% to lead gains among midcaps. Overall market capitalization rose 4.4% to $3.03 trillion. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) advanced 5%, indicative of the average jump among majors. The gains came after President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will substantially reduce his tariffs on China while also clarifying that he would not attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While the tone shift gave investors much-needed relief, it also raised concern over the administration's ability to maintain consistency and reliability, which has fueled the recent increases in the price of gold and U.S. Treasury yields, traders said. “Bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' seems to be overtaking its correlation with US markets, as BTC pumped during both negative and positive news related to Trump's tariffs and Powell comments, showcasing its potential to reach new all-time highs,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. Bitcoin's resilience relative to U.S. equities has strengthened its store-of-value narrative among some market observers. “There is strong potential for bitcoin to lose its long-running correlation with US equities and may now turn to its digital gold narrative as the price of gold has reached an all-time high,” Jupiter Zheng, partner of research at HashKey Capital, said in an email. “We remain positive that investors will evaluate BTC as a long-term store of value.” Some market watchers said that gold's advance and the decoupling of bitcoin from equities seems to be concentrated in Asian morning hours. “Data shows that gold has been deriving most of its rally during the Asian hours, suggesting possible central bank and official flows getting out of USD into alternative safe havens,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “The USD decoupling does seem to be more pronounced than previous episodes. “One of the possible ramifications of the US decoupling is a revisit to the long-term BTC bull case as a store of value. While we have also been critiquing BTC as a levered Nasdaq proxy over the past year, it has finally started to show some signs of its own decoupling away from equity markets,” Fan said.",Markets|Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Equities|News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-23 07:32:38

Throughout the past few days, the token has managed to maintain its rising streak, having gone up by 41.4% in the past seven days. SUI crypto is currently trading hands at $2.94, nearing the $3 threshold. However, it is still 45% below its all-time high of $5.35 from early January this year.

SUI ranks in 13th place on the overall crypto leaderboard by market cap, falling just below Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Lido Staked Ether ( STETH ). Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has reached $2.3 billion, representing a 169% rise compared to the previous trading day ago and signaling a rise in market activity.

Altcoins are riding the wave too, with most of the top 10 recording strong gains. Sentiment across the crypto space is shifting, and a key development came on Tuesday, April 22, as SEC Chair Paul Atkins pledged to protect investors from fraud, keep politics out of financial regulation, and lay a solid foundation for digital asset oversight. Investors are now hopeful that Atkins will help bring an end to the long-running Ripple case by dropping the SEC’s appeal. XRP Shoots Up Over 6% XRP jumped over 6% on April 22, reaching a high of $2.25, driven by growing curiosity around Ripple’s legal battle and a spike in crypto ETF applications. These factors could help XRP reach its all-time high of $3.55, though prices might still swing between $1.70 and $3 due to volatility. Furthermore, 12 XRP ETF applications are being reviewed.

He explained that XRP recently hit a key target of $2.1937 as expected and bounced back, hinting that the wave structure is playing out. He urges traders to watch $1.8815 as a critical support level, while $2.22 and $2.40 are the key resistance points to break for a bigger move upward. The analyst believes that XRP’s long consolidation is now over and it is closer to an extreme bull run. XRP is currently trading at $2.24, up over 7.8% in the past day. Popular analyst Ali Martinez also shared that XRP may be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could lead to a bullish breakout to $2.70. Another analyst Diana predicts that XRP could hit $25 as early as January 2026 pointing to the strong historical price trends and the positive catalysts. She has three possible scenarios for XRP depending on how key factors turn out. In a slow-growth case, it could rise to $10, with a 300% gain. If conditions are more favorable, it could soar 600% to $17.50.

A familiar pattern is catching attention: when gold surges, Bitcoin often follows about 100 days later. It’s a move driven by investor psychology. In times of stress, gold usually attracts safe-haven buyers first. But once gold feels too expensive, other options like Bitcoin step into the spotlight. Why Bitcoin Could Be Next Lately, Bitcoin has been outperforming stocks and acting more like a safety net against political and financial risk. Some market watchers believe Bitcoin could one day rival gold’s massive $23 trillion market value. If that ever happened, Bitcoin’s price could jump to over $1 million per coin. For now, the focus is on whether Bitcoin can break past $100,000 — a milestone that’s starting to look more realistic as its market behavior shifts. Gold’s Price Outlook for 2025 Gold’s recent rally has surprised even seasoned analysts. Jeffrey Christian, Managing Director at CPM Group, revealed that the firm has raised its average gold price forecast for 2025 to $2,956 per ounce — up about $250 from the estimate six months ago. Gold started 2025 at $2,662 per ounce, climbing from $2,000 at the beginning of 2024. It’s currently trading close to $3,400. While Christian expects prices might cool slightly over the next few months, he also predicts a rebound later in the year as market worries continue. Why Gold Is Climbing So Fast A mix of global tensions, economic uncertainty, and market volatility is driving more investors toward gold. What’s unusual this time is how gold has broken its old habits — rising alongside falling stock markets, climbing bond yields, and a weaker U.S. dollar. Normally, those factors move in the opposite direction. A turning point came on April 2, when former President Donald Trump announced plans for aggressive new tariffs. The bold proposal rattled markets, raising fears of more economic trouble ahead. That added fresh fuel to gold’s rally as investors rushed to lock in a safe store of value. What Happens Next If the pattern holds, Bitcoin might be next in line for a major price move. With its growing reputation as a hedge against uncertainty, Bitcoin is well-positioned to ride the wave. A push toward $100,000 could come faster than many expect — especially if gold’s momentum holds.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 07:38:58

Klienti pasūta paku, nezinot, ko tieši tā satur, un tas arī rada uztraukumu un prieku. Viens no pazīstamākajiem šo paku veidiem ir Shein Mystery Box “parakstītais noslēpumainais piedāvājums” kas īpaši uzrunā modes un tendenču cienītājus. Pārbaudiet JemLit piedāvājumu Shein Mystery Box fenomena izplatība Pēdējos gados pārsteiguma kastes ir piedzīvojušas uzplaukumu visā pasaulē, un zīmols Shein, kas ir pazīstams ar savu orientēšanos uz pieejamu un mūsdienīgu modi, ir ātri pārņēmis šo konceptu. Shein Mystery Box apvieno populārākos spontānas iepirkšanās, pārsteigumu un izdevīgu piedāvājumu elementus, kas padara to par pievilcīgu iepirkšanās veidu plašai pircēju grupai, jo īpaši jaunākās paaudzes pārstāvjiem. Šāda formāta popularitāte turpina pieaugt līdz ar sociālo plašsaziņas līdzekļu nozīmes palielināšanos, kur lietotāji dalās ar tā sauktajiem ”izpakošanas“ video, atsauksmēm un autentiskām reakcijām uz paku saturu. Līdz ar to tādas platformas kā TikTok, Instagram un YouTube ir ievērojami veicinājušas šīs tendences izplatību un izveidojušas ap to spēcīgu fanu kopienu. Interneta lietotāji, kuri, meklējot izdevīgus piedāvājumus, ieraksta Google meklētājā vaicājumu “Mystery box Latvia” un nolemj pasūtīt Shein Mystery Box, iegūst piekļuvi plašam jaunāko un lētāko produktu klāstam, kas pārsteidz ar negaidītiem atklājumiem, vienlaikus neradot lielu finansiālu slodzi. Lai gan tas ir akls pirkums, bieži vien tieši neparedzētais rada prieku vai vismaz ziņkārību, kas motivē veikt vēl vairākus pirkumus. Kāpēc izmēģināt Shein Mystery Box? Interese par Shein Mystery Box nav saistīta tikai ar pārsteiguma jautrību – šim iepirkšanās veidam ir arī praktiskas priekšrocības, kas piesaista arvien vairāk pircēju. Tiem, kas vēlas atjaunot savu garderobi ar jauniem elementiem bez ilgstoša izvēles procesa, noslēpumainā kaste var būt ideāls risinājums. Lūk, galvenie iemesli, kāpēc to izmēģināt: Jaunas modes detaļas bez liekas piepūles Shein Mystery Box ērtums ir viens no galvenajiem klientu ieguvumiem, jo viņiem nav jāpieņem lēmums par izvēli starp simtiem produktu – piegādātājs visu izdarīs viņu vietā. Tas ietaupa laiku un arī ļauj klientam atklāt jaunus stilus, kurus viņš parasti nebūtu izvēlējies. Daudzi klienti šo pieeju raksturo kā atsvaidzinošu, jo pārsteiguma kaste bieži vien satur praktiskas un jaunas lietas, kas paplašina modes redzesloku. Iespējams, Mystery box ļauj ietaupīt naudu Kastes satura cena bieži vien ir zemāka nekā atsevišķu produktu cenu summa, ja tie tiktu nopirkti atsevišķi. Tas nozīmē, ka klientam ir reāla iespēja saņemt vairāk produktu par mazāku cenu. Šis potenciālais ietaupījums ir viens no galvenajiem iemesliem, kāpēc cilvēki apsver šāda veida pirkumu. Tomēr ir svarīgi piebilst, ka apmierinātība ir atkarīga no saņemto preču kvalitātes un atbilstības – arī tāpēc ir labi izvēlēties pārbaudītus pakalpojumu sniedzējus. Vai Shein Mystery Box ir krāpšana, vai tas ir tā vērts? Tiklīdz kaut kas kļūst virāls, neizbēgami rodas jautājumi par uzticamību. Shein Mystery Box nav izņēmums. Internetā valda dažādi viedokļi – no lieliskām atsauksmēm līdz brīdinājumiem, ka tā ir krāpšana. Kur ir patiesība? Kam jāpievērš uzmanība Ir svarīgi atšķirt Shein oficiālo noslēpumaino kasti (piemēram, akcijas ietvaros) no pārsteiguma kastēm, ko piedāvā ārējie mazumtirgotāji, apgalvojot, ka tās satur Shein produktus. Tieši pēdējās var sagādāt vislielāko neapmierinātību. Daži klienti norāda, ka ir saņēmuši nekvalitatīvas vai neatbilstošas preces, bieži vien bez iespējas tās atgriezt vai iesniegt sūdzību. Kas var darboties labi No otras puses, ir vairāki pakalpojumu sniedzēji, kas piedāvā godīgas pārsteigumu kastes ar atbilstošu saturu un saprātīgām cenām. Galvenais ir izvēlēties pārbaudītu pārdevēju un izlasīt citu klientu atsauksmes par Shein Mystery Box. Ja vien cilvēks vadās pēc sabiedrības pieredzes un viņam ir reālistiskas cerības, noslēpumainā kaste var būt jautrs un ērts veids, kā paplašināt savu garderobi. Viena no šādām platformām ir JemLit . Reāla pieredze Ņemot vērā pieaugošo Shein Mystery Box popularitāti mūsdienās, ir viegli atrast desmitiem atsauksmju par Shein pārsteigumu kastēm gan no regulārajiem pircējiem, gan no populāriem Latvijas influenceriem . Šī pieredze bieži sniedz vērtīgu ieskatu par to, ko sagaidīt no šādas pakas – un no kā būtu jāuzmanās. Rezultāti var būt ļoti atšķirīgi. Shein Mystery Box pārskats Pozitīvo atsauksmju vidū atrodami sajūsmas pilni stāsti, kuros klienti saņēmuši pakas ar modes aksesuāriem un sezonas hitiem. Dažas kastes pārsteidz ar daudzveidību, citas – ar kvalitāti, kas pārsniedz cerēto, ņemot vērā noteikto cenu. Lietotāji sociālajos plašsaziņas līdzekļos bieži dalās ar savu “ izpakošanas” pieredzi – šie ieraksti kalpo ne tikai kā reklāma, bet arī kā iedvesma un pārbaudītu pakalpojumu sniedzēju avots. Un, ja jums nepaveicas… Saraksta pretējā galā ir atsauksmes, kas brīdina par sliktu kvalitāti, atkārtotiem priekšmetiem vai saturu, kas neatbilst aprakstam. Bieži neapmierina arī preces, kas neatbilst izmēram, slikti pieguloši apģērbi vai novecojušas modes tendences. Ievērojiet šos noteikumus Lai jūsu pārsteiguma kaste radītu pozitīvu iespaidu, nevis izraisītu neapmierinātību, ieteicams ievērot dažus vienkāršus noteikumus: Izlasiet atsauksmes par konkrētiem pārdevējiem un meklējiet reālu pircēju fotogrāfijas. Izvēlieties pārbaudītus avotus – vislabāk tieši no Shein vai partneru mazumtirgotājiem. Pārbaudiet noteikumus un nosacījumus – jo īpaši atgriešanas politiku. Saglabājiet reālistiskas cerības – Mystery box nav personalizēts pakalpojums, tas ir pārsteigums. Shein noslēpumu kastes var būt jautras, pieejamas un motivējošas – ja vien izvēlaties tās ar skaidru izpratni un informētu pieeju. Shein pārsteiguma kaste JemLit vietnē Viens no populārākajiem un uzticamākajiem Shein Mystery Box pakalpojumu sniedzējiem neapšaubāmi ir JemLit.com platforma. Šis mazumtirgotājs ir izpelnījies klientu atzinību, pateicoties caurspīdīgai pieejai attiecībā uz laimestu iespējām un tam, ka tas piedāvā tikai oriģinālus Shein produktus. Katrā JemLit piedāvātajā Mystery box var atrasties stilīgi modes elementi, piemēram, kleitas, rokassomas vai aksesuāri, vai arī Shein dāvanu karte no 50 līdz 1000 eiro vērtībā. Liels pluss ir tas, ka klienti precīzi zina, kādas ir viņu izredzes – nekādu slēptu nosacījumu vai maldinošu solījumu. Satura vērtība bieži vien pārsniedz pašas kastes cenu, kas padara to par pievilcīgu izvēli attiecībā uz cenas un vērtības attiecību. Turklāt sortiments ir daudzveidīgs, pielāgots dažādiem budžetiem un modes vēlmēm, un ar piegādes iespējām visā pasaulē, tostarp arī Latvijā. No otras puses, ir daži ierobežojumi, ar kuriem jārēķinās. Kad klients ir pasūtījis kasti, to nevar atgriezt. Atsevišķu kastu saturs var ievērojami atšķirties, kas var nebūt piemērots tiem, kam ir precīzs priekšstats par to, ko viņi vēlas. Lai gan vērtīgākas balvas ir diezgan lielas, nevar gaidīt, ka katrā kastē būs vērtīga dāvanu karte. Turklāt daži populāri Mystery box varianti mēdz tikt ātri izpārdoti, tāpēc jums jārīkojas ātri. Pārbaudiet JemLit piedāvājumu Secinājums par Shein Mystery Box: Modes pārsteigumi Shein Mystery Box ir jautrs, bet vienlaikus pieejams veids, kā atjaunot savu garderobi un piedzīvot pārsteigumus. Lai gan ne vienmēr ir garantēts, ka saturs precīzi būs atbilstošs jūsu gaumei, pateicoties tādiem pārredzamiem mazumtirgotājiem kā JemLit un arvien pieaugošajam atsauksmju skaitam, neveiksmīga pirkuma risku var samazināt līdz minimumam.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-23 07:39:34

Despite Ripple’s partial legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the broader acceleration of digital asset ETF products in the U.S. market, BlackRock has remained notably absent from any XRP-related ETF initiatives. The commentary attributes this inaction to strategic, regulatory, and market-based considerations. 🚨🔥 WHY HASN’T BLACKROCK FILED AN XRP ETF? The Silence Speaks Volumes. Despite Ripple’s SEC victory and growing ETF momentum, the world’s largest asset manager is still sitting out. Here’s why. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/h5OfjVPtbW — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 20, 2025 Bitcoin and Ethereum Success Drives Conservative Strategy The analyst begins by contrasting BlackRock’s aggressive positioning in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets with its total absence in XRP. The iShares Bitcoin Trust recently surpassed $30 billion in assets under management (AUM), and the firm’s Ethereum ETF exceeded $1 billion in AUM within just two months of launch. According to the post, these numbers signal a deliberate strategy of focusing on assets with a clear institutional profile and dominant market share, rather than spreading risk across less established or more controversial digital assets. Lingering Regulatory Concerns Over XRP Classification Though Ripple secured a partial win in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC, the tweet emphasizes that regulatory uncertainties continue influencing institutional behavior. The legal classification of XRP as a non-security in certain contexts has not led to full regulatory clarity. For firms like BlackRock, reputational and compliance risks remain a significant deterrent. The tweet argues that institutional caution, particularly concerning the SEC’s position towards XRP, continues to shape product strategies. Demand, Liquidity, and Legal Clarity Define ETF Eligibility “All Things XRP” asserts that BlackRock’s internal criteria for launching crypto ETFs revolve around three core elements: demand, liquidity, and legal certainty. While XRP is approaching the threshold on these fronts, it is not yet considered a definitive fit. The company’s executives have publicly stated that only Bitcoin and Ethereum currently satisfy their framework for product approval. Other assets, including XRP, are being monitored, particularly through the actions of firms such as Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, who may be more willing to take the first steps into potentially contentious territory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Patience Guides BlackRock’s Market Entry The tweet also references the 2023 incident involving a false XRP ETF filing, which briefly circulated in the market and caused widespread speculation. BlackRock was compelled to issue a public denial, an episode that may have further solidified the firm’s cautious stance. According to the analyst, the public relations fallout from that episode served as a reminder of the volatility and reputational risks tied to premature or unofficial announcements in the digital asset space. Beyond regulatory concerns, market structure and volume are central to BlackRock’s decision-making process. Bitcoin and Ethereum account for most of the total crypto market capitalization and enjoy significantly higher liquidity. In contrast, XRP’s relatively smaller market share means lower institutional trading volume, increasing execution and pricing risk. For BlackRock, launching a new ETF requires a demonstrable institutional need, something the firm apparently has not yet observed regarding XRP. The final points made by “All Things XRP” suggest that BlackRock’s strategy is not to lead but to dominate when it enters a market. With over $11 trillion in AUM, the company can wait until all regulatory, legal, and market-based conditions align. When BlackRock eventually files for an XRP ETF, it will likely do so to command the segment, not merely participate. While some in the crypto community interpret BlackRock’s inaction as reluctance or disinterest, the analysis offered by “All Things XRP” portrays a more calculated approach. According to this view, the asset manager waits for definitive signals of clarity and demand before making a move. If or when it does enter the XRP ETF space, it will be on BlackRock’s terms — and likely at a moment engineered for maximum institutional impact.

Cantor Fitzgerald, currently headed by the son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, plans to set up a $3 billion Bitcoin investment venture alongside SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex, the Financial Times reported. At this point, Cantor Fitzgerald has partnered with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex on the Bitcoin initiative. Cantor Chairman Brandon Lutnick has moved to launch a new public company, 21 Capital, inspired by his Bitcoin investment firm Strategy. 21 Capital aims to create a “public alternative” similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin investment approach, led by Michael Saylor, the company said. Cantor plans to purchase $3 billion worth of BTC for 21 Capital as part of a partnership between Softbank, Tether, and Bitfinex. While the BTC investment initiative received an investment of $200 million in January, it was stated that this money will be used to establish a new firm called 21 Capital, which will buy $3 billion worth of Bitcoin. While it was stated that Tether will contribute $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, it was stated that SoftBank and Bitfinex will contribute $900 million and $600 million respectively. The report also stated that Cantor's Bitcoin investment vehicle will raise $350 million in convertible bonds and $200 million in private equity investments for additional Bitcoin purchases. The FT added that the deal is scheduled to be formally announced in the coming weeks, but could be revised or cancelled. Billionaire Howard Lutnick, who served as Cantor's CEO for 40 years, resigned last month to become President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, while his sons Brandon and Kyle Lutnick took over the Cantor board. *This is not investment advice.

They include USD, GBP, and AED-backed stablecoins. Issuing the new stablecoins on Concordium will help expand the payment finance (PayFi) ecosystem on the Layer 1 blockchain. Layer 1 blockchain Concordium , known for providing an enterprise-focused platform, has announced that four leading stablecoin platforms will issue their assets natively on its chain. The companies issuing the stablecoins are Noon (USN), Deep Blue (DBUSD), Agant (GBPA), and AEDX (AEDX). The companies will leverage Concordium Protocol-Level Token technology to power their stablecoins and join its growing PayFi ecosystem. Concordium CEO, Boris Bohrer-Bilowitzki, was delighted with the partnership, stating the projects will help grow the blockchain ecosystem. Adding to his statement on the issued stablecoins, Bohrer-Bilowitzki stated: “Not only do these partnerships reflect the success of our platform and its ability to support smart contract-less execution, but it underline the real-world impact of web3 technology, particularly when it comes to stablecoins. We look forward to working more closely with Agant, Noon, Deep Blue, and AEDX and to welcoming more innovative projects into our ecosystem.” Additionally, the stablecoins on Concordium will benefit from being natively issued and held directly in wallets with no smart contracts. This eliminates common attack vectors that are present on smart contract chains such as Ethereum and Solana, significantly reducing risk. The first stablecoin to be added is GBPA, a stablecoin pegged to the British pound at a 1:1 ratio. The coin is issued by Agant, a UK-based firm that is also a member of the Digital Pound Foundation and Stablecoin Standard. USN, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by Noon Capital, will also be issued on the Concordium blockchain. The stablecoin is minted by depositing collateral in the form of Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), with collateral then deployed into delta-neutral strategies to generate yield. Recently launched, the stablecoin has gradually grown to a $33 million market cap. Thirdly, the DBUSD offered by Deep Blue and backed by USD reserves is Jersey’s first-ever stablecoin, a mark of the Crown dependency’s progressive approach to fintech innovation. Speaking on the latest issuance of its stablecoins on Concordium, Julien Bahurel, CEO and co-founder of Deep Blue, said: “Launching DBUSD on Concordium is an important milestone in our roadmap, and a reflection of our vision to bridge traditional finance and Web3. We are looking forward to redefining how stablecoins can power cross-border finance with trust and efficiency in the years ahead.” Finally, the AEDX is offered by a company of the same name, is pegged to the UAE Dirham (AED), and is integrated with major financial and commercial entities, particularly in the MENA and CIS markets. The stablecoin is dubbed “the stablecoin for a better world” and will launch its pilot phase with 5 million AEDX tokens expected to be issued. In the future, AEDX plans to scale to 1 billion over the next 3-5 years based on market acceptance and demand. The stablecoins poised to be deployed on Concordium are pegged to three different fiat currencies in USD, GBP, and AED, supporting global adoption. Their introduction reinforces Concordium’s reputation as a leading L1 for stablecoin issuance and extends the opportunities available to users within its growing PayFi ecosystem.

Charlie Eriksen, a researcher at Aikido Security who first spotted the problem, said a hidden issue was added to recent versions of a new toolkit used to build apps that work with the XRP Ledger. “A developer's NPM access token was stolen by the threat actors,” Aikido said on X. “It is unclear how right now. It is also unclear who the threat actors are right now (although we have a hunch we are trying to confirm).” The issue only affects versions of Node Package Manager (NPM), a site where developers share reusable code for projects. Major XRP-related services, like Xaman Wallet and XRPScan, said they were unaffected in separate X posts. This flaw could let attackers steal users’ private keys, possibly accessing their crypto wallets in theory. ""At 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0, our system, Aikido Intel started to alert us to five new package version of the xrpl package. It is the official SDK for the XRP Ledger, with more than 140.000 weekly downloads,"" Eriksen said in a security update. ""This package is used by hundreds of thousands of applications and websites making it a potentially catastrophic supply chain attack on the cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" Eriksen noted. He added that only third-party apps or services that installed the flawed versions during a brief period could be at risk. As such, the XRP Ledger Foundation team quickly fixed the issue by releasing updated versions of the tool to replace the faulty ones. The affected versions (v4.2.1-4.2.4 and v2.14.2) were deprecated. ""To clarify: This vulnerability is in xrpl.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger. It does NOT affect the XRP Ledger codebase or Github repository itself. Projects using xrpl.js should upgrade to v4.2.5 immediately,"" the foundation posted separately. A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written code to simplify tasks in web development.

The world of crypto gambling is experiencing a boom of unprecedented scale, generating a staggering $81.4 billion in gross gaming revenue (GGR) in 2024 alone. This figure, reported by the Financial Times based on research from Yield Sec, represents a fivefold increase compared to just two years prior, in 2022. What makes this surge even more remarkable? It’s happening despite widespread bans and restrictions in major global markets. Understanding the Surge in Crypto Gambling Revenue The headline number of $81.4 billion in crypto gaming revenue paints a clear picture: this is a sector rapidly gaining traction. While traditional online gambling has been established for decades, the integration of cryptocurrencies brings new dynamics and opportunities that are clearly resonating with a significant user base. This isn’t just a niche market anymore; it’s a multi-billion dollar industry challenging conventional regulatory frameworks. Yield Sec’s research highlights the speed of this growth. A fivefold increase in GGR within two years is exceptional in any industry, let alone one facing significant legal headwinds. This suggests strong underlying demand and effective strategies by platforms to reach their target audience. How Are Crypto Casinos Bypassing Global Bans? One of the most striking aspects of this growth is its resilience in the face of adversity. Major jurisdictions like the United States, the European Union, China, and the United Kingdom have implemented various forms of bans or strict regulations on online gambling, and increasingly, on crypto-related activities. Yet, the revenue numbers show these restrictions are not stopping the industry’s expansion. So, how are these platforms operating and attracting users? The report indicates several methods used by players to access these sites: VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): These tools mask a user’s true location, making it appear as though they are accessing the site from a country where it is permitted. Mirror Links: These are alternative URLs that replicate the content of the main site, often used when the primary domain is blocked by regulators or internet service providers. URL Redirection: Similar to mirror links, this involves directing users from one web address to another that hosts the platform’s content. These technical workarounds, combined with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies themselves, make it challenging for traditional regulatory enforcement methods to be fully effective against dedicated users and operators. Leading the Pack: Key Crypto Casino Platforms The crypto casino landscape includes several prominent players. Platforms like Stake, Rollbit, and Roobet are frequently cited as leaders in this space. These sites offer a wide range of casino games, sports betting, and unique crypto-centric games, all powered by various cryptocurrencies. Their operational base is often located in jurisdictions known for more favorable or less stringent regulatory environments for online gaming and cryptocurrency businesses. Curaçao and Malta are frequently mentioned as key locations where these platforms obtain licenses, allowing them to operate globally, albeit in a complex and often grey legal area regarding specific user locations. The scale of these individual platforms is also significant. Stake, for instance, reportedly generated $4.7 billion in GGR last year alone. This single platform’s revenue is comparable to that of many established, publicly traded traditional online gambling companies, underscoring the immense financial activity within the crypto sector. Why the Appeal? The Benefits of Blockchain Gambling Beyond simply bypassing regulations, the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrency and blockchain gambling offer distinct advantages that attract users. These benefits contribute significantly to the sector’s growth: Anonymity and Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, transactions using many cryptocurrencies offer a higher degree of privacy compared to traditional banking methods, which appeal to users concerned about their gambling activities being linked to their personal identity or credit history. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are often processed much faster than traditional fiat methods, which can involve bank delays, processing fees, and identity verification bottlenecks. Lower Fees: Transaction fees for cryptocurrencies can be lower, especially for international transfers, compared to traditional payment processors or banks. Provably Fair Gaming: Many blockchain-based games utilize algorithms verifiable on the blockchain, allowing players to independently confirm the fairness and randomness of game outcomes. This builds trust, a crucial factor in online gambling. Accessibility: For individuals in regions with underdeveloped banking infrastructure or strict financial controls, cryptocurrency can offer a more accessible way to participate in online activities like gambling. Integration with Crypto Ecosystems: Users who already hold cryptocurrency find it convenient to use their existing digital assets for entertainment. These technological and user-experience benefits create a compelling alternative to traditional online gambling , driving adoption even in the face of regulatory challenges. The Scale of the Crypto Casino Market The report by Yield Sec, as cited by The Daily Hodl, estimates the sheer scale of the crypto gambling ecosystem. We are talking about tens of thousands of individual crypto casino platforms operating worldwide. This vast number suggests a low barrier to entry for operators, enabled by readily available software solutions and the global reach of the internet and cryptocurrencies. Serving this multitude of platforms are tens of millions of users globally. This indicates a broad and diverse user base, spanning different continents and demographics, all connected by their willingness to use cryptocurrency for online entertainment and betting. Challenges and Risks in the Crypto Gambling Space While the growth is undeniable, the crypto gambling sector is not without its challenges and risks. The very factors that enable its growth – decentralization and operating in regulatory grey areas – also create potential pitfalls: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent international regulation means both operators and users face legal risks. What is permissible today might be banned tomorrow, leading to instability. Consumer Protection Issues: In less regulated jurisdictions, consumer protection standards might be lower than in traditional regulated markets. This can leave players vulnerable in disputes over winnings, platform fairness (despite ‘provably fair’ claims), or data security. Risk of Scams and Fraud: The ease of setting up online platforms, combined with the pseudonymous nature of some crypto transactions, can attract malicious actors running fraudulent sites or pyramid schemes disguised as gambling platforms. Cryptocurrency Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Winnings (or losses) in crypto can change significantly in value against fiat currencies very quickly, adding another layer of financial risk. Problem Gambling: The speed and accessibility of crypto gambling can exacerbate issues related to problem gambling, potentially making it easier for individuals to lose significant amounts quickly. Addressing these challenges requires a complex interplay between technological solutions, responsible operator practices, and evolving regulatory approaches. What Does the Future Hold for Crypto Gaming Revenue? The trajectory of crypto gaming revenue suggests continued growth, at least in the short to medium term. The innovation in platform features, the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies globally, and the persistent demand for online entertainment indicate a strong market. However, regulatory pressure is likely to intensify. As the sector grows, it becomes harder for governments to ignore. We may see more sophisticated attempts by authorities to block access, target payment processors handling crypto-to-fiat conversions for gambling sites, or even pursue legal action against operators or high-volume users. Simultaneously, the industry might evolve, with some platforms seeking licenses in more established jurisdictions or adopting stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures to gain legitimacy and access larger markets legally. The development of Web3 technologies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could also introduce new models for ownership and governance in gambling platforms. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Gambling Boom The rapid rise of crypto gambling offers insights for various stakeholders: For Regulators: The current approach of outright bans is proving ineffective. A more nuanced approach might involve understanding the technology, focusing on harm reduction, and potentially exploring licensing frameworks that address the unique aspects of crypto while protecting consumers and preventing illicit activities. For the Crypto Industry: The high transaction volume and user engagement in gambling demonstrate a strong use case for cryptocurrencies, but also highlight the need for greater clarity on regulatory compliance and responsible use. For Players: While the benefits are attractive, users must exercise caution. Researching platforms, understanding the risks of volatility and potential scams, and practicing responsible gambling are crucial. For Investors: The sector presents potential investment opportunities, but due diligence is essential given the regulatory uncertainty and competitive landscape. Summary: A Market Defying Expectations The $81.4 billion generated by crypto casinos in 2024 is a testament to the power of technological innovation and user demand in overcoming traditional barriers. Despite facing bans in major markets, the sector, fueled by platforms operating from regulatory havens and users employing technical workarounds, has achieved remarkable growth. The appeal lies in the core benefits of cryptocurrency – speed, privacy, and accessibility – coupled with the potential for provably fair gaming through blockchain technology. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and consumer protection remain significant, the sheer scale of the market, involving tens of thousands of platforms and tens of millions of users, indicates that online gambling is finding a powerful new frontier in the world of decentralized finance and digital assets. The future will likely involve a continued dance between technological advancement and evolving regulatory responses.

Canada’s crypto innovation explained,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-spot-solana-etfs-with-staking-canadas-crypto-innovation-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What are spot Solana ETFs and why are they important? A spot Solana ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds Solana ( SOL ) tokens directly, providing investors real-time exposure to the asset’s market price. Rather than using complex trading platforms or crypto wallets , you can access Solana via a regulated financial product traded on a traditional stock exchange. The value of Solana ETFs is directly tied to the open market price of SOL, offering a simple way to gain exposure to the blockchain’s performance without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs that use derivative contracts to speculate on Solana’s future prices, a spot ETF tracks the performance of the actual asset. This distinction is significant because futures products may face pricing inefficiencies, leading to performance mismatches over time. Spot ETFs are more transparent and directly reflect SOL's real-time supply and demand on the Solana blockchain. Spot Solana ETFs mark a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. These products enable retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem while operating within the bounds of securities regulations. Like spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , spot Solana exchange-traded funds are expected to expand market access and serve as another entry point to decentralized finance (DeFi) for traditional investors. Did you know? Spot ETFs aim to mirror an asset’s current price by directly holding the asset, while futures ETFs use derivative contracts to speculate on future price movements. Launch of spot Solana ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange On April 16, 2025, four spot Solana ETFs started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). With this, Canada became the first country to launch spot SOL ETFs with staking . The OSC granted approval to the spot Solana ETFs of four asset managers: 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve and CI Financial. Unlike products that only track Solana’s price, these funds hold SOL tokens, giving investors direct ownership of the asset. The funds are secured via institutional-grade cold storage custody. Each fund tracks a distinct Solana-related index, offering diverse strategies with onchain asset backing. Despite their structural differences, these ETFs are all designed for long-term investment, reflecting the issuers' strong belief in Solana's future in DeFi. By incorporating staking, these spot Solana ETFs provide an active way for investors to earn returns in the cryptocurrency market, all within a regulatory framework and secure, institutional-grade custody services. These ETFs enable staking through a partnership with TD Bank, allowing the SOL they hold to actively support and secure the Solana network. In return, the network issues staking rewards, which can be passed on to investors. Since Solana typically offers higher staking yields than Ethereum, this structure may translate into greater potential returns for investors. How does staking boost returns for Solana ETF investors? By offering staking, these spot Solana ETFs may boost returns for investors by an estimated 2%-3.5% annually, in addition to the performance of the underlying SOL. The ETFs generate yield by working with staking partners that delegate up to 50% of the fund’s assets for staking. Staking rewards generated by the ETF are typically shared between shareholders and the fund manager, with the specific allocation varying depending on the ETF issuer. Management fees of these spot Solana ETFs vary from 0.15% to 1%, with some providers offering fee waivers during the initial launch phase. After two days of trading, the combined assets under management for the four ETFs total about $73.5 million. Staking Solana may yield higher returns than staking Ether ( ETH ). The ETFs intend to pass these additional rewards on to investors, potentially reducing the long-term cost of owning the ETF. Here is a comparison between the various spot Solana ETFs with staking approved in Canada: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest has incorporated staked Solana into its ARKW and ARKF ETFs, with both funds now holding shares of Canada’s 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ). Did you know? Altcoin ETFs track the prices of one or more cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin ( BTC ). They diversify investor exposure within the cryptocurrency market, as various altcoins exhibit different price behaviors and underlying strengths. How Canada’s spot Solana ETFs unlock passive income opportunities Canada offering spot Solana ETFs with staking is an innovative step. Existing SOL investment products, such as the crypto ETFs in Europe and the futures-based ETFs in the US do not offer an opportunity to earn staking yield. Incorporating yield into a regulated crypto ETF structure addresses a long-standing demand from investors and asset managers interested in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Solana and Ethereum . As staking is central to these tokens’ value, its inclusion enables SOL ETFs to offer a passive income component, making them more appealing to traditional investors seeking income-generating opportunities. The OSC’s approval of the staking feature for spot Solana ETFs may boost SOL’s position. However, staking carries risks, such as potential losses from validator penalties (slashing) or network disruptions, which could affect returns. Nonetheless, this approval reinforces Canada’s pioneering role in crypto ETF innovation, having launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2021, ahead of many other jurisdictions. By allowing staking rewards in spot Solana ETFs, Canadian regulators have signalled a growing acceptance of crypto-powered finance. Did you know? ETFs aren’t without risks. Market fluctuations can lead to losses, and tracking errors can cause an ETF'’s performance to differ from its benchmark index, affecting investor outcome. What Canada’s launch of Solana ETFs with staking means for pending SEC applications Canada’s decision provides alternative cryptocurrency investment choices for its investors and may serve as an example for other countries considering spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Despite a subdued global macroeconomic climate — partly shaped by trade tensions during Donald Trump’s presidency — Canada’s regulators have taken a proactive stance, embracing innovation in the digital asset space. The greenlighting of Solana ETFs with staking reflects a maturing approach to crypto policy and signals confidence in alternative layer-1 networks. Meanwhile, in the United States, anticipation is building. The launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on March 17, 2025, is seen as a stepping stone toward a US spot ETF. The SEC is currently reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications as of April 21, covering a spectrum of assets from major altcoins like XRP ( XRP ) to memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), including proposals for leveraged and derivative products. As of April 21, 2025, the SEC is reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications, including derivatives. The filings range from major cap altcoins to memecoins and include leveraged products and options. The outcome of Canada’s pioneering approach may offer valuable insights to regulators and could potentially influence the SEC’s decisions regarding these filings. However, the SEC’s stance may differ significantly from Canada’s due to structural and regulatory complexities within the US financial system. Unlike Canada's more unified regulatory framework, the US divides oversight between multiple agencies — including the SEC, CFTC, and state regulators — creating friction in crypto policymaking. Canada’s trailblazing move could nonetheless offer a valuable case study for US regulators. As markets await the SEC’s decisions, the key question remains whether Washington will follow Ottawa’s lead — or chart its own course and a slower timeline for non-Bitcoin spot ETFs.",Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-23 08:05:00

The surge comes amid renewed optimism about easing U.S.-China trade tensions and growing political acceptance of digital assets. Trump and Bessent Spark Investor Confidence U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have ignited a market rally with comments suggesting the ongoing tariff war with China may soon see relief. Calling the current tariffs “unsustainable,” Bessent hinted that policy adjustments are being considered—triggering upward movement in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Trump has dispelled rumors about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , a move that reassured markets concerned about inflation and monetary policy uncertainty. Brandon Lutnick’s $3B Bitcoin Bet: 21 Capital Is Here Amid this optimistic backdrop, Brandon Lutnick—the son of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick—has announced the formation of a new Bitcoin-focused investment firm, 21 Capital . As reported by the Financial Times , the public company will give investors stock market access to Bitcoin, much like Strategy’s BTC strategy . The venture is making waves not only because of Brandon’s bold move but also due to his family ties. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is a key player in the finance world and is known for managing a substantial portion of Tether’s U.S. Treasury holdings. While Howard has voiced concerns about Tether’s liquidity during Senate hearings, his son’s Bitcoin bet signals strong conviction in the crypto industry’s long-term value. Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank Fuel $3B Bitcoin Push The launch of 21 Capital is being powered by a heavyweight coalition: Tether : $1.5 billion Bitfinex : $600 million SoftBank : $900 million Additional funding : $550 million through bonds and private investors .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?

Interestingly, the group has fixed Bitcoin’s valuation at $85,000 per coin for the investment—underscoring high confidence in BTC’s price trajectory in the near future. This move marks a turning point where legacy finance, crypto powerhouses, and political families converge. As institutional adoption accelerates, 21 Capital could play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between Wall Street and Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We’ve got some important news coming out of the XRP Ledger ecosystem that requires your immediate attention, especially if you’re a developer or user of applications built on the XRPL. A significant XRP Ledger vulnerability has been identified, specifically impacting certain versions of the popular xrpl.js JavaScript library. This isn’t a flaw in the core ledger itself, which is great news, but it’s a crucial reminder about the importance of vigilance in the broader crypto development landscape. Understanding the xrpl.js Security Concern So, what exactly happened? The vulnerability was discovered by Charlie Eriksen, a security researcher at Aikido Security. He found a serious flaw lurking within specific versions of the xrpl.js package distributed via NPM, a common package manager for JavaScript. The affected versions include: 4.2.1 4.2.2 4.2.3 4.2.4 2.14.2 The concern here is related to xrpl.js security . This library is widely used by developers to build applications, wallets, and services that interact with the XRP Ledger. If a developer used one of these vulnerable versions in their project, that project could potentially be compromised. What is a Supply Chain Attack Crypto Risk? The disclosure from the XRP Ledger Foundation highlights the potential for a supply chain attack crypto scenario. Let’s break down what that means in this context: Software Dependencies: Modern software development relies heavily on using pre-written code packages or libraries (like xrpl.js ) to save time and effort. These are dependencies. The Chain: When you use a library, you’re relying on a ‘supply chain’ of code – from the library’s authors to the platform it’s distributed on (like NPM), and finally to the application you’re building or using. The Attack: A supply chain attack targets a weak link in this chain. In this case, the vulnerability was within the xrpl.js library itself, meaning any application that pulled in a vulnerable version automatically inherited the risk. The Impact: An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially compromise applications using the flawed library, even if the developers of those applications did nothing wrong themselves. This type of attack vector is increasingly common and poses a significant challenge across the entire software industry, including crypto development. Are My Private Keys Safe? The Critical Private Key Protection Angle This is the most pressing question for users. The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to access private key protection mechanisms or even the private keys themselves, *if* those keys were processed or handled by an application built using one of the compromised xrpl.js versions. It’s crucial to understand the distinction: The XRP Ledger Core: The fundamental blockchain infrastructure of the XRP Ledger is not affected by this vulnerability. Your assets stored directly on the ledger are safe from this specific flaw. Applications/Wallets using xrpl.js: If you use a wallet, exchange interface, or application that integrated one of the vulnerable xrpl.js versions, there is a potential risk that interacting with that specific application could expose your private keys to an attacker exploiting the flaw in the library it uses. This underscores the importance of using reputable applications and staying informed about the software they rely on. Actionable Insights: What Should Developers and Users Do? The good news is that a fix is available, and the XRP Ledger Foundation acted quickly to disclose the issue and provide a solution. For Developers Using xrpl.js: If you are using any of the affected versions ( 4.2.1 , 4.2.2 , 4.2.3 , 4.2.4 , or 2.14.2 ) in your project, the most critical action is to: Upgrade Immediately to Version 4.2.5 (or higher). This version contains the patch that resolves the vulnerability. You can typically do this using your package manager: npm install xrpl@^4.2.5# oryarn upgrade xrpl --latest After upgrading, it’s wise to re-test your application to ensure everything is working as expected. For Users of XRPL Applications: While you might not know which library versions a specific application uses, here are some general best practices and things to consider regarding crypto security vulnerability risks: Use Trusted Applications: Stick to well-known and reputable wallets, exchanges, and services that have a track record of security diligence. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, using a hardware wallet (like Ledger or Trezor) provides an extra layer of security, as your private keys never leave the device. Be Cautious with New/Untrusted Apps: Exercise caution when using new or less-established applications that interact with your crypto assets. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from projects you use and the broader crypto community regarding security issues. Minimize Exposure: Don’t keep more funds than necessary in hot wallets connected to various applications. Why This XRP Ledger Vulnerability is a Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security This incident, while contained to a specific library version and not the core ledger, serves as a stark reminder of the challenges inherent in crypto security vulnerability management. The interconnected nature of software development means that a flaw in one component can have ripple effects. Key takeaways regarding the broader security landscape: Dependency Management: Developers must be diligent in managing their project’s dependencies, regularly updating libraries and monitoring for security advisories. Audits: Regular security audits of both core protocols and commonly used libraries are essential. Responsible Disclosure: The process followed here – discovery by a security researcher, disclosure to the foundation, development of a fix, and public announcement – is a positive example of how vulnerabilities should be handled. User Education: Users need to be aware that security isn’t just about the blockchain itself, but also the applications and interfaces they use to interact with it. This event reinforces the need for continuous vigilance and proactive security measures throughout the entire crypto ecosystem, from the base layer to the end-user applications. Summary: Addressing the xrpl.js Security Flaw In conclusion, a significant XRP Ledger vulnerability was found in specific versions of the xrpl.js library, posing a potential supply chain attack crypto risk that could compromise private key protection in applications using those versions. The core XRP Ledger is safe. Developers must urgently upgrade to xrpl.js version 4.2.5 or later to mitigate this risk. This incident highlights the ongoing importance of xrpl.js security and general crypto security vulnerability awareness for both developers and users alike. Stay safe and stay updated!

That’s the exciting possibility being discussed among crypto enthusiasts and analysts, particularly following recent insights derived from in-depth On-chain data analysis . The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently navigating key price levels, and breaking through a specific barrier could pave the way for an impressive ETH price rally . What Does IntoTheBlock’s Data Reveal About the Path Ahead? According to the crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which specializes in leveraging on-chain data for market insights, a critical juncture lies just ahead for Ethereum. Their analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), points to a relatively clear path for ETH once a particular price point is surpassed. IntoTheBlock noted, “On-chain data points to only modest resistance ahead, with the largest potential sell wall near $1,860.” This statement is crucial because it highlights where the most significant selling pressure is anticipated based on current on-chain metrics – specifically, the distribution of ETH holdings and potential sell orders placed around that price. If Ethereum can successfully cross this $1,860 level, IntoTheBlock’s analysis suggests a substantially higher likelihood for the token to advance towards the psychologically significant $2,000 mark. This potential move is heavily predicated on the idea that clearing the $1,860 hurdle removes the most substantial immediate obstacle based on their IntoTheBlock ETH analysis. Understanding Crypto Resistance Levels and Sell Walls In the world of technical analysis and market dynamics, Crypto resistance levels are price points where an upward trend is expected to pause or reverse due to concentrated selling pressure. Think of it as a ceiling that the price struggles to break through. A “sell wall” is a term often used in market depth analysis, particularly on exchanges. It refers to a large number of sell orders placed at or near a specific price level. When analysts like IntoTheBlock talk about a “sell wall” based on on-chain data, they are often inferring potential selling pressure by looking at metrics such as: Concentration of Holders: How many addresses acquired ETH at or near certain price points? Those who bought around $1,860 might be looking to sell as the price approaches their cost basis or a slight profit. Unrealized Gains/Losses: Analyzing which price levels hold the largest volume of ETH currently in profit. Holders with significant unrealized gains at a certain level might decide to take profits, creating selling pressure. Exchange Inflows: Increased movement of ETH to exchanges around specific price levels can indicate an intent to sell. IntoTheBlock’s methodology combines these and other on-chain signals to identify where significant selling pressure is likely to emerge. Their identification of $1,860 as the largest potential sell wall suggests that this is the price point where the confluence of these factors is strongest, making it the primary obstacle for a sustained upward move. Why is $2,000 Such a Significant Target? While $1,860 is identified as a technical resistance level based on data, the $2,000 level carries immense psychological weight in the market. Round numbers often act as significant price targets for traders and investors. Breaking above $2,000 would represent: A return to a key historical price point. A strong bullish signal, potentially attracting more buyers. Confirmation of significant upward momentum. A boost in overall market sentiment towards Ethereum. Successfully reaching and holding above $2,000 could fuel further upward movement as market participants gain confidence and potential sellers who were waiting for that level execute their orders, clearing the path for the next set of targets. Putting On-Chain Data Analysis into Context On-chain data analysis provides a unique perspective compared to traditional technical analysis, which primarily relies on price and volume charts. By examining the transactions occurring on the blockchain, analysts can gain insights into the behavior of market participants, including whales (large holders), retail investors, and miners. Key on-chain metrics include: Holder Distribution: Analyzing the number of addresses holding ETH and how much they hold at different price points. Transaction Volume: Tracking the amount of ETH being moved on the network. Exchange Balances: Monitoring the amount of ETH held on centralized exchanges, which can indicate potential buying or selling pressure. Network Activity: Looking at the number of active addresses and new addresses interacting with the network. IntoTheBlock specializes in packaging this complex data into actionable insights, providing traders and investors with tools to understand underlying market dynamics that might not be immediately apparent from price charts alone. Their current Ethereum price prediction based on this data is a prime example of how on-chain analysis can inform potential price movements. What Happens If ETH Breaks $1,860? Potential Scenarios If Ethereum successfully breaks above the $1,860 resistance level, the scenario painted by IntoTheBlock is one of reduced friction towards $2,000. Here’s a potential breakdown of what could follow: Event Potential Market Reaction Next Key Level Break above $1,860 with conviction (high volume) Increased bullish sentiment, potential for rapid upward move as sell orders at $1,860 are absorbed. Psychological $2,000 level becomes primary target. Consolidation just above $1,860 Testing the level as new support. Could precede a push towards $2,000 or a retest of $1,860 from above. Eyes on $2,000, but also monitoring $1,860 as support. Failure to break $1,860 after multiple attempts Increased bearish sentiment, potential pullback to lower support levels as buyers exhaust. Previous support levels below $1,800 become relevant. A clean break, ideally accompanied by increasing trading volume, would be the most bullish signal that the market has absorbed the selling pressure at $1,860 and is ready to push higher. The move to $2,000 might not be instantaneous, but the path, according to IntoTheBlock’s data, appears clearer beyond $1,860. Challenges and Risks on the Road to $2K While the Ethereum price prediction based on IntoTheBlock’s data is optimistic about the path beyond $1,860, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile and influenced by numerous factors. Challenges and risks that could impede an ETH price rally include: Overall Market Downturn: A significant drop in Bitcoin’s price or negative macroeconomic news can drag the entire crypto market down, regardless of ETH’s individual on-chain metrics. Failure to Sustain Breakout: ETH might briefly touch or move slightly above $1,860 but fail to find sufficient buying support to hold the level, leading to a retracement. Unexpected Selling Pressure: While IntoTheBlock identifies the largest sell wall, other unforeseen events or large individual sell orders could emerge. Regulatory Uncertainty: Negative news or developments regarding crypto regulation in major markets can dampen sentiment and pressure prices. Therefore, while on-chain data provides valuable insights, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Traders and investors should consider a holistic view of the market. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Potential Move Given IntoTheBlock’s analysis, what should market participants consider? Here are some actionable insights (not financial advice): Monitor the $1,860 Level Closely: This is the immediate key level to watch. Observe price action around this point. Does it break with conviction? Does it get rejected? Look for Volume Confirmation: A strong breakout above $1,860 is ideally supported by an increase in trading volume, indicating genuine buying interest. Understand the $2,000 Target: Recognize that $2,000 is a psychological target. There might be increased selling pressure as ETH approaches this level from traders looking to take profits at a round number. Combine Analysis Methods: Don’t rely solely on on-chain data. Look at technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI), market sentiment, and fundamental news related to Ethereum and the broader crypto space. Manage Risk: If trading the potential breakout, consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the move fails. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The insights from IntoTheBlock offer a compelling look at the potential path forward for Ethereum, highlighting the importance of the $1,860 level as a gateway to $2,000. However, staying informed about all market dynamics is key. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Primed for $2K? The latest analysis from IntoTheBlock provides a focused perspective on Ethereum’s immediate price potential. By zeroing in on On-chain data analysis , they’ve identified the $1,860 price point as the most significant resistance, largely due to a concentrated “sell wall” at that level. Clearing this hurdle, according to their data, significantly improves the odds of an ETH price rally towards the widely watched $2,000 mark. This Ethereum price prediction underscores the value of looking beyond traditional charts and into the blockchain’s transparent data. While the path isn’t guaranteed and Crypto resistance levels can be challenging to overcome, IntoTheBlock’s insight offers a data-driven reason for optimism about Ethereum’s short-term prospects if it can gain traction above $1,860. As always, navigating the crypto market requires careful consideration of multiple factors and a robust understanding of the risks involved. The coming days will reveal whether Ethereum has the momentum to tackle the $1,860 resistance and embark on the potential rally towards $2,000 suggested by this insightful IntoTheBlock ETH analysis.

43700032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151792,1745396208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,TRON USDT Sees Massive $70 Billion Issuance Surge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tron-usdt-issuance-soars/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for some eye-popping numbers from the world of stablecoins. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON (TRX), recently shared a significant milestone on X: the total issuance of Tether (USDT) on the TRON network has officially surpassed a staggering $70 billion . Yes, you read that right – $70,000,000,000 worth of USDT is now circulating on TRON. This isn’t just a big number; it’s a powerful indicator of TRON’s growing dominance in the stablecoin landscape and the immense popularity of TRON USDT . Why is TRON USDT So Popular? Understanding the TRON Network Advantage So, what makes the TRON network such a hotbed for USDT activity? It primarily boils down to two critical factors that resonate deeply with everyday crypto users: Speed: Transactions on TRON are incredibly fast. We’re talking seconds, not minutes or hours, which is crucial for moving value quickly. Cost: This is perhaps the biggest draw. Transaction fees on TRON are notoriously low, often just a few cents or even fractions of a cent, especially when compared to networks like Ethereum, where gas fees can skyrocket during periods of high congestion. Think about it: if you’re sending stablecoins to friends, family, or using them for payments or trading, lower fees mean more of your money stays in your pocket. This practical benefit has driven massive adoption, making TRON USDT a go-to choice for many users globally, particularly in regions where high transaction costs on other chains are prohibitive. The Significance of the $70 Billion USDT Issuance Milestone Hitting the $70 billion issuance mark is far more than just a headline number. It signifies several key trends: Market Dominance: This positions TRON as a leading network for stablecoin activity, often rivaling or even surpassing Ethereum in terms of daily USDT transaction volume. User Trust and Adoption: Such a high issuance figure indicates widespread trust and active use of USDT on the TRON chain by millions of users and various crypto platforms. Network Effect: As more users and applications adopt TRON USDT, the network becomes even more valuable and attractive for new entrants, creating a positive feedback loop. This massive figure underscores the fact that while other networks exist, TRON has carved out a significant niche for high-frequency, low-cost stablecoin transfers. Why Tether Prefers the TRON Network for Stablecoin Issuance? Tether, the issuer of USDT, isn’t just picking networks at random. Their decision to issue such a massive amount of the Tether stablecoin on TRON is strategic. Tether aims for USDT to be the most accessible and widely used stablecoin. By leveraging TRON’s efficiency, Tether makes USDT more practical for everyday use cases, remittances, and trading on exchanges that support the TRC-20 standard. The low operational cost for Tether and its partners, combined with the broad user base attracted by TRON’s low fees, makes it an economically sound choice for expanding USDT’s reach. It’s a symbiotic relationship where Tether benefits from TRON’s network effects, and TRON benefits from the immense liquidity and activity brought by USDT. TRON’s Growing Role Among Crypto Stablecoins In the broader landscape of crypto stablecoins , USDT on TRON has become a major player. While USDT also exists on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other chains, the TRON version (TRC-20 USDT) often sees the highest daily transaction counts. This highlights TRON’s success in positioning itself as the go-to network for value transfer using the world’s largest stablecoin. This growth isn’t just about sending money. The presence of such a large volume of USDT fuels activity within the TRON ecosystem, supporting Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, exchanges, and other dApps built on the network. It provides essential liquidity that underpins various financial activities within the TRON universe. Benefits and Considerations for Using TRON USDT Thinking about using TRON USDT? Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons: Benefits: Extremely Low Fees: As mentioned, this is the main selling point. Fast Transactions: Near-instantaneous transfers. Wide Support: Many major exchanges and wallets support TRC-20 USDT. Accessibility: Easier for users in developing regions due to lower costs. Considerations: Centralization Concerns: Both Tether (the issuer) and TRON (the network) have faced criticism regarding centralization, which goes against the decentralized ethos of crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Tether, in particular, has been subject to regulatory reviews regarding its reserves. Network Reliability: While generally reliable, reliance on a single network for such large volumes introduces a single point of failure risk compared to a multi-chain approach. For many users, the practical benefits of low fees and speed outweigh the decentralization concerns for everyday transactions. However, it’s crucial to be aware of these factors. What Does This Mean for the Future? The continued growth of USDT issuance on TRON suggests this trend is likely to continue. As long as TRON maintains its low-fee structure and efficiency, it will remain attractive for stablecoin transfers. This could further solidify TRON’s position as a dominant player in the stablecoin market and potentially attract more development and users to its ecosystem. However, competition is increasing. Other networks are also working on scaling solutions and lower fees. Regulatory environments around stablecoins are also evolving rapidly. The future will depend on how TRON and Tether navigate these challenges and opportunities. Actionable Insight: Using TRON USDT If you want to use TRON USDT, here’s what you typically need to do: Get a wallet that supports the TRON network (TRC-20 tokens). Many popular wallets do. Acquire TRON (TRX) to cover the minimal transaction fees (bandwidth/energy). Receive or send TRC-20 USDT to and from supported addresses or exchanges. Always double-check the network when sending or receiving USDT, as sending USDT on the wrong network (e.g., sending TRC-20 to an ERC-20 address) can result in permanent loss of funds. Conclusion: TRON’s Stablecoin Powerhouse TRON reaching over $70 billion in USDT issuance is a monumental achievement. It highlights the network’s success in attracting users and volume through its focus on low costs and high speed. While challenges like centralization and regulation exist, the sheer scale of USDT activity on TRON underscores its vital role in the global stablecoin economy. This milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to TRON’s strategic positioning and the massive demand for efficient stablecoin transactions.

After weeks of sideways movement, price action has exploded past the $88,000 resistance zone with force. A bullish daily candle has closed well above the upper Bollinger Band, confirming the momentum shift. The 20-day SMA, now sloping upward, reinforces this trend reversal. This breakout is the first decisive bullish move since Bitcoin’s post-halving consolidation began earlier this month. Bollinger Bands Signal Rising Momentum The daily Bollinger Bands are expanding—an early signal of increased volatility and trend strength. Price is comfortably above the middle band at $84,121, with the lower band resting at $75,968. Historically, breakouts above the upper band during expansion phases often precede extended rallies. As momentum builds, the current trend structure suggests that bulls are preparing to test higher resistance levels. 4-Hour Chart Shows Bull Flag Resolution On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin recently broke out from a textbook bull flag—one of the most reliable continuation patterns. After an initial surge, BTC consolidated in a downward-sloping range before breaking out above $88,000. The move was supported by a volume spike, confirming strong buyer interest. This pattern adds confidence that the breakout has room to run, supported by a clean market structure and bullish symmetry. 1-Hour Trend Shows Healthy Momentum The 1-hour chart highlights a strong, controlled uptrend. Bitcoin is consistently printing higher highs and higher lows, respecting the upper Bollinger Band. Minor dips have been quickly bought up, especially near the $90,000 level, now acting as intraday support. This timeframe shows that short-term traders are actively buying strength and defending key levels—clear signs of bullish market control. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Macro and On-Chain Support Fundamentals are reinforcing the technical rally . A recent U.S. CPI miss has reignited hopes for a Fed rate cut, weakening the dollar and boosting demand for alternative stores of value like Bitcoin. Additionally, Bitcoin’s recent halving has reduced new supply, tightening market conditions. On-chain metrics reveal declining exchange reserves and renewed whale accumulation—both signals of long-term bullish positioning. Trade Setup for Today For today’s session , an ideal entry lies around $92,500 on a short pullback. The first target (TP1) is $96,000, with $100,000 as a possible second target (TP2) if momentum continues. A prudent stop loss is $88,500—just below the breakout level and the 20-day SMA. This setup offers a favorable risk-reward profile, aligning both technical and fundamental. Today’s Bitcoin (BTC) Outlook Bitcoin is likely to sustain its upward move today, supported by breakout volume, macro tailwinds, and bullish technical structure across all major timeframes. If the $92,500 level holds, the price could push toward $96,000 before the daily close. Consolidation above this zone would set the stage for a test of $100,000. Overall, today’s trend remains decisively bullish, with dips presenting strong buying opportunities. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The cryptocurrency market is up today, with the total market capitalization rising by approximately 6.7% in the last 24 hours to reach $2.94 trillion on April 23.

Source: Coin360 Easing US-China trade-war tensions A significant catalyst for today’s crypto rally is the potential de-escalation of the trade war between the United States and China. Recent statements from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 22 contributed to easing investor concerns. As reported by Bloomberg, Bessent described the tariff standoff with China as ""unsustainable,"" hinting at an increased likelihood of de-escalation. Source: Cointelegraph Later, while speaking to reporters at the White House, President Trump said that the US tariffs on goods from China ""will come down substantially"" from the current 145% level, signaling a possible thaw in economic relations. Trump also added that he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, following recent pressure on the head of the US central bank to lower borrowing rates. This renewed confidence in global trade stability has contributed to the latest rally in crypto prices, with Bitcoin climbing above $94,000 on April 23, with altcoins following suit . Massive short liquidations fuel price surge Another driver of today’s rally is a wave of short liquidations that have triggered a powerful “short squeeze,” as data from CoinGlass shows. In the past 24 hours, over $624 million in crypto positions have been liquidated across the crypto market, with $545 million representing short position liquidations. Total crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass “Short squeeze!” remarked CoinGlass in response to today’s liquidation event, adding: “The biggest short liquidation so far this year.” The magnitude of this liquidation mirrors the Nov. 6 liquidation event, where more than $426 million in short leveraged positions were liquidated, accompanying a 16% increase ($356 billion) in the total crypto market capitalization on the same day. The short squeeze has played a crucial role in amplifying the current rally, particularly for Bitcoin, which has led the market’s charge past $93,000.

In a matter of hours, $OM plummeted from well over $6 to just $0.60, marking a cruel 90% drop that wiped out more than $6 billion in market cap and sent RWA (Real World Asset) investors reeling. This sudden unweaving of what had been one of the most sought-after tokens of late 2024 and early 2025 is now provoking serious doubts about tokenomics, liquidity, and the shadowy leverage trades that make up the crypto markets. Many are making uncomfortable comparisons to the infamous collapse of $LUNA in 2022. The fall of $OM serves as a sober reminder of the fragility that can lie beneath even the most enticing surface narratives. From RWA Darling to Devastation Between November 2024 and April 2025, $OM had a spectacular rise. The token’s price increased by more than five times, boosted by enthusiasm for real-world assets and the belief that tokenized finance was on the verge of going mainstream. And if you wanted to find reasons to be even more bullish, you could point to political developments: the increasing likelihood of Trump winning a second term was being discussed in crypto circles as a potential game-changer that could lead to a much more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets in the U.S. The leading RWA infrastructure provider, Mantra Chain, had situated itself in front as a developmental community in an emerging line of business. Their technical strengths, combined with a favorable market narrative, had pushed $OM into the spotlight, attracting both retail and institutional investors. The token’s quick rise turned out to be unsteady. The decline came on fast and fierce. LookOnChain data show at least 17 wallets funneling more than 40 million $OM—over $200 million worth at the time—onto centralized exchanges. That amounted to about 4.5% of $OM’s circulating supply. The influx of sell orders hit an already thin market and made it even thinner; then it hit the token’s price and took it down hard. What $6B Lost on $OM Taught Us About Tokenomics? Early on April 14th 2025, the price of $OM plummeted from over $6 to just $0.60 within hours—wiping out more than $6 billion in market capitalization. The collapse dealt a significant blow to investors, especially given that… pic.twitter.com/9vizmm9znv — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 21, 2025 The sell-off was not only a case of market volatility. The size and coordination of the withdrawals pointed strongly to inside jobs or at least a reasonably well-coordinated, large group of profit takers. More significantly, it laid bare a layer of systemic risk that too many people involved in the ecosystem had failed to see. $OM had become a widely accepted form of collateral on many DeFi platforms. Its use in lending protocols meant that the token secured a number of other assets and positions that had been leveraged up. When the price of $OM collapsed, it surely didn’t help that a number of assets also started to fall, triggering a wave of liquidations and margin calls—with the $OM liquidations in DeFi adding to the number of crypto assets that were being forced to market. What $6B Lost on $OM Taught Us About Tokenomics? Early on April 14th 2025, the price of $OM plummeted from over $6 to just $0.60 within hours—wiping out more than $6 billion in market capitalization. The collapse dealt a significant blow to investors, especially given that… pic.twitter.com/9vizmm9znv — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) April 21, 2025 That’s the basic story. Of course, there are many more details to cover, and there is some crypto Twitter grist from the mill as well. Lessons in Token Design and Market Fragility The $OM collapse teaches a cautionary lesson for builders, investors, and regulators. It wasn’t a traditional liquidity crisis, and $OM had a respectable market cap for a crypto asset. But its meteoric rise and the subsequent crash offer insights into the utility-versus-speculation dynamic that many crypto tokens face today. Investors and token holders must ask themselves: What is $OM supposed to do in 5 years, 10 years? And will it do that if, at the time of writing, it has an 8- to 9-figure market cap? And will the average $OM holder be better off holding $OM or receiving a stream of cash or cash-equivalent dividends from Mantra’s supposedly decentralized legal ecosystem? The incident also highlights how concealed leverage can accumulate quietly in crypto markets. In contrast to traditional finance, where some visibility into risk exposure is provided by regulatory reporting, the decentralized structure of crypto enables collateral to be used and reused throughout multiple platforms—without a discernible overview of total risk. The series of liquidation events that followed the fall of $OM show how interwoven the ecosystem had become and how fast confidence can drain when panic sets in. During bullish periods, liquidity seems abundant, but it often disappears just when it’s needed most, which is to say right after a price level gets broken—thoroughly amplifying the nature of large sell-offs. To forge a way ahead, the Mantra Chain team needs to regain the trust of the community and create a more durable and sustainable value proposition for the OM token. For the cryptocurrency market at large, this is another occasion to heed a lesson: that having a strong narrative and good technical qualities is not in itself reliable insurance against a token suffering because of subpar tokenomics and bad risk management. When the dust clears, market agents will have to confront some tough but vital questions about how to evaluate the vitality of tokens, control the amount of risk they have, and create ecosystems that are not only bullish but also resilient.

43701907,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151681,1745400017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Spot Gold Price Falls – How Does it Affect Your Crypto Portfolio?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-gold-price-falls/,"In the world of finance, every significant price movement in traditional markets can send ripples, and a recent dip in the spot gold price is no exception. As crypto enthusiasts, you might wonder why a drop in the price of gold, a centuries-old store of value, is relevant to your digital asset holdings. Well, it’s because the narratives surrounding gold, particularly its role as a safe haven and an inflation hedge, are often compared directly to leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Understanding gold’s movements can offer valuable insights into broader market sentiment and investor behavior that also impact the crypto space. Understanding the Recent Spot Gold Price Drop Recently, the spot gold price experienced a notable decline, falling by nearly 2%. This brought the price briefly down to trade around the $3,315 per ounce mark. While a 2% move might seem modest in the volatile crypto landscape, for a commodity like gold, which is known for its relative stability, this is a significant shift that warrants attention. Several factors can contribute to a drop in gold prices. Typically, gold performs well during times of economic uncertainty, high inflation, or when interest rates are low (making non-yielding assets like gold more attractive compared to bonds). Conversely, gold can face pressure when: Interest rates rise, increasing the opportunity cost of holding gold. The U.S. dollar strengthens, as gold is priced in dollars, making it more expensive for holders of other currencies. Market sentiment shifts towards ‘risk-on’ assets like stocks, reducing demand for traditional safe havens. Inflation expectations decrease. This specific drop could be linked to a combination of these macroeconomic factors, signaling potential shifts in investor confidence or monetary policy expectations. But how does this connect with the digital gold narrative? Gold vs Bitcoin: Navigating the Safe Haven Debate For years, gold has been the quintessential safe haven asset – a place investors flock to protect wealth during economic turmoil or geopolitical instability. Its value is derived from its scarcity, historical acceptance as money, and physical tangibility. However, in the last decade, Bitcoin has emerged as a challenger to this title, often dubbed ‘digital gold’. The comparison stems from Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins), its decentralized nature (immune to single-point failures or censorship), and its global accessibility. Proponents argue that these characteristics make Bitcoin a superior safe haven in the digital age, especially against risks like currency debasement through excessive money printing. Let’s look at a simple comparison: Feature Gold Bitcoin Nature Physical Commodity Digital Asset Supply Finite, but unknown total supply; new supply mined Strictly capped at 21 million; new supply through halving Portability/Divisibility Difficult to transport large amounts; less divisible Highly portable and divisible digitally Storage Requires physical storage (vaults, home safes) Stored digitally (wallets); requires security against hacks/loss Decentralization Central banks hold large reserves; market influenced by institutions Decentralized network; less susceptible to single-entity control Volatility Relatively low Significantly higher Regulatory Status Well-established, regulated market Evolving, often uncertain regulatory landscape While both have merits as potential safe havens, their price movements can diverge. Gold’s recent fall, while Bitcoin’s price action might be different, highlights that they respond to market forces differently, challenging the simple ‘digital gold’ equivalence in the short term. Is Gold Still an Effective Inflation Hedge Compared to Crypto? Another crucial narrative shared by gold and Bitcoin is their potential as an inflation hedge . When the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes due to inflation, investors look for assets that can maintain or increase their value. Historically, gold has served this purpose, as its supply isn’t subject to central bank printing presses. Bitcoin proponents argue that its fixed supply makes it an even better inflation hedge in the digital age. Unlike gold, whose new supply is constantly being mined (albeit with increasing difficulty), Bitcoin’s issuance rate is predetermined and halves approximately every four years, making its scarcity predictable and absolute. However, the effectiveness of both as inflation hedges can be debated, especially in the short term. Gold has shown mixed performance during recent inflationary periods, sometimes lagging behind other assets. Bitcoin, due to its higher volatility and correlation with risk-on assets, has also behaved more like a growth stock than a stable hedge during certain inflationary phases. The recent drop in the spot gold price might suggest that market participants are currently less concerned about immediate high inflation, or perhaps they are favoring other assets (like inflation-protected bonds or even certain equities) to hedge against it. This shift in sentiment could indirectly affect the perception of Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge, especially if the market narrative starts questioning the need for such hedges. Understanding Market Sentiment and Crypto Market Analysis The decline in gold prices is a signal that should be factored into broader crypto market analysis . Traditional markets and crypto markets are increasingly interconnected. Macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and overall investor risk appetite influence both spaces, albeit sometimes with different lag times or magnitudes. For instance, if the gold drop is primarily driven by expectations of rising interest rates, this is highly relevant for crypto. Higher interest rates can make speculative assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive by increasing borrowing costs and offering safer, yielding alternatives (like bonds). A stronger U.S. dollar, another potential driver for gold’s fall, also tends to put pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets. Monitoring gold’s price action, alongside other traditional indicators like bond yields and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), can provide crypto investors with a more holistic view of the market environment. These traditional asset movements can sometimes act as leading or coinciding indicators for shifts in the broader financial landscape that will eventually impact crypto. Key Market Signals to Watch: Interest Rates: Rising rates typically hurt both gold and risk assets like crypto. U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): A stronger dollar is often negative for both gold and Bitcoin. Bond Yields: Higher yields increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Inflation Data: While historically a positive for gold, recent data correlation with gold and Bitcoin has been complex. Geopolitical Events: Traditionally boost gold; their impact on crypto is still debated but can increase safe haven demand. A sudden fall in gold suggests that at least some of these traditional market pressures are currently dominant, and crypto investors should consider how these same forces might influence their portfolios. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you, as a crypto investor, take away from the recent dip in the spot gold price ? It’s not about abandoning crypto for gold, but rather about being an informed participant in interconnected global markets. Here are some actionable insights: Don’t Invest in Silos: Recognize that crypto markets don’t exist in a vacuum. Pay attention to major movements in traditional assets like gold, bonds, and equities, and understand the macroeconomic factors driving them. Evaluate the Safe Haven Narrative Critically: While Bitcoin has safe haven characteristics, its high volatility means it doesn’t behave like gold in many short-term scenarios. Don’t assume a simple 1:1 relationship. Diversification across different asset classes, including potentially a small allocation to traditional assets like gold if it fits your strategy, can be a way to hedge against different types of risk. Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep an eye on inflation reports, interest rate announcements from central banks (especially the U.S. Federal Reserve), and currency strength. These factors significantly influence both gold and crypto. Understand Correlations (and Decoupling): Sometimes gold and Bitcoin might move together, sometimes inversely, and sometimes independently. Analyze *why* they are moving as they are, rather than assuming a constant correlation. A gold drop when crypto is also falling might signal broad risk-off sentiment. A gold drop while crypto is rising might suggest a shift in which asset is perceived as the better hedge or a flow of capital from traditional to digital assets. Adjust Your Strategy Based on Risk Appetite: Gold’s drop might reflect increased market confidence (risk-on) or specific concerns (like rising rates). Assess your own risk tolerance and adjust your crypto holdings accordingly. If macro signals suggest tightening liquidity, increasing exposure to highly speculative altcoins might be riskier. Challenges and Opportunities The challenge for crypto investors is navigating the complex interplay between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset space. The narratives of safe haven assets and inflation hedge are constantly being tested and redefined. Gold’s performance provides one dataset in this ongoing evaluation. However, these market shifts also present opportunities. Understanding the drivers behind gold’s fall can help you anticipate potential headwinds or tailwinds for the crypto market. For example, if gold is falling primarily due to rising real yields, this is a clear signal of a less favorable environment for non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, if gold falls due to a sudden ‘risk-on’ surge driven by positive economic news, this might be bullish for crypto as well. The opportunity lies in using insights from traditional markets to inform your crypto strategy, leading to more robust crypto market analysis and potentially better-timed investment decisions. Conclusion: Gold’s Dip – A Signal, Not a Verdict, for Crypto The recent drop in the spot gold price is a significant event in traditional finance, and it holds relevance for the cryptocurrency world. It serves as a reminder that global markets are interconnected and that factors influencing traditional safe havens like gold can also impact the narrative and performance of digital assets like Bitcoin. While the simple comparison of gold and Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is appealing, their market dynamics are distinct. Gold’s fall doesn’t automatically mean crypto will follow suit, but it provides valuable context about prevailing macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment regarding inflation and risk, and the ongoing debate about what constitutes a true safe haven asset in the modern era. By incorporating insights from gold’s performance into your crypto market analysis , you can gain a more nuanced understanding of the forces shaping your digital asset investments.

Ripple discovered the breach when five new packages were added to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) repository. The package averages 140,000 downloads every week. Thousands of websites and apps use the package. The breach, if left unaddressed, could have caused severe damage to crypto markets, leading to a supply chain disruption that could have spread to other markets. The five new packages added to GitHub did not align with previous releases, raising suspicions about the changes made to the code. The malicious code communicated with a newly registered domain name, 0x9c.xyz, which was used during the wallet creation process, allowing the attackers to access private keys. Analysis of the code reveals that the attackers refined their methods over time. Initially, they coded the exploit in plain code, and then advanced to disguising the backdoor with TypeScript code. Ripple has advised people affected by the attack to check their logs to see whether there is outgoing traffic to the suspicious domain name. Furthermore, applications using the Ripple Ledger should rotate their wallet addresses to prevent future attacks by malicious actors. The compromised XRPL included versions 4.2.1 and 4.2.4. Ripple released new versions that mitigate the threat, including versions 4.2.5 and 2.14.3. Affected users should move their assets immediately to new addresses. The attackers added a method named checkValidityOfSeed() at the end of the file /src/index.ts in the compromised versions. The method allows users to send a String to the web address 0x9c.xyz/xcm, where attackers can store the retrieved data. The method sends the data using an HTTP POST request. The attackers further disguised the request method as an advertisement referral service to hide their activities from network monitoring scanners. The method checkValidityOfSeed() allows attackers to steal private keys, mnemonics, and seeds. The XRP Ledger Foundation (XRPLF) is responsible for maintaining the xrpl.js library, which is an official package used to communicate with Ripple through JavaScript. The xrpl.js library allows programmers to access wallet features, transfer Ripple tokens, and interact with the Ripple blockchain. The package is used widely, with an average of 140,000 downloads per week. Malicious code was inserted in versions 2.14.2, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, and 4.2.4. Ripple has released a fixed version 4.2.5. Developers are advised to replace any infected versions as soon as possible. The problem with these attacks is that they can infect libraries used by developers and then affect general users who download already compromised apps. Ripple has removed any NPM packages that were infected. Ripple assured users that the attack only affected the xrpl.js package and not the core repository for Ripple. “This vulnerability”, wrote Ripple Foundation, “is in xrpl.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger. It does NOT affect the XRP Ledger codebase or the GitHub repository itself. Projects using xrpl.js should upgrade to v4.2.5 immediately.” Coinbase suffered a similar attack in March when attackers targeted their open-source AgentKit. The attack targeted supply chains, identical to the XRPL attack, and aimed to exploit crypto-related projects. However, Coinbase was able to foil the attack and prevent any damage to its supply chain. The North Korean hacking group Lazarus also targeted NPM repositories, using a trick to create repositories with names similar to those of official libraries. Ripple has recently experienced significant gains in the American market, following the SEC’s settlement with the crypto company. The change in American regulation has allowed the Ripple network to expand its business practices and focus on innovation. The XRP price has increased by around 300% since Trump’s inauguration. Ripple has similar price dynamics, in terms of volatility, to other coins like Stellar and TRON, which may be due to overlapping remittance markets. There is now a push to release an XRP ETF. Coinbase, further, released an XRP futures market on its derivatives platform, announcing the change on April 21.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-23 09:21:34

Malicious Code Detected in xrpl.js Package The breach affected xrpl.js, Ripple's recommended JavaScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger, after a hacker inserted malicious code designed to steal private wallet credentials. The vulnerability came to light on Monday evening, when security researchers at Aikido, a crypto-focused cybersecurity firm, discovered unauthorized code within the official Node Package Manager (NPM) distribution of xrpl.js. The backdoor was detected in multiple versions of the library published to the NPM registry between 4:46 PM and 5:49 PM Eastern Time. According to Aikido’s Charlie Eriksen, who identified the exploit, the malicious update posed a potentially catastrophic risk to the cryptocurrency supply chain. The compromised package was capable of stealing wallet seeds and private keys, transmitting them to an attacker-controlled server. This gave threat actors the ability to gain control over affected wallets and drain their assets. Scope and Immediate Impact While the vulnerability threatened a vast number of projects reliant on xrpl.js, Eriksen clarified that the threat was contained to services that downloaded and integrated the tainted versions during a brief window on Monday. Applications and services that did not update their dependencies within this period are reportedly unaffected. Notably, major XRP projects including Xaman Wallet and XRPScan confirmed they remain secure. Nevertheless, security experts urged users and developers to exercise caution. Eriksen advised, “If you believe you may have interacted with the compromised code, assume your wallet keys are exposed. Affected keys should be retired, and assets moved to new wallets immediately.” Ripple Responds and Mitigates Risk Engineers at the XRP Ledger Foundation acted swiftly to mitigate the breach. Updated, secure versions of the xrpl.js library were released shortly after the attack was identified, overriding the malicious packages on NPM. The development team has recommended that all users and projects update to the latest safe version without delay. The XRP Ledger Foundation also stated it would publish a detailed post-mortem once a comprehensive internal review is completed. In the interim, developers relying on xrpl.js have been strongly advised to audit their projects for any exposure to the affected versions. Widespread Adoption Heightens Risk Given that xrpl.js is the XRP Ledger Foundation’s official library for JavaScript-based blockchain interactions, enabling tasks like wallet operations and token transfers, its popularity made the breach particularly alarming. The library recorded over 140,000 downloads in the past week alone, underscoring the potential reach of the attack had it remained undetected. This incident highlights the growing risks posed by supply chain attacks within the cryptocurrency industry, where widely-used open-source dependencies can become vectors for significant financial harm.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are also on the rise. DOGE reclaimed $0.18 and eased downside fears, while analysts predict further upside, possibly even a run toward $1. Memes on the Run The meme coin sector, which underperformed in the past several months, experienced a substantial revival in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization surged to almost $58 billion (according to CoinGecko’s data), representing a 16% daily rise. Literally all top 20 meme coins have charted double-digit price gains, but some have taken center stage with explosive increases. Turbo (TURBO), whose valuation skyrocketed by 70%, is one example. Earlier today (April 23), it pumped to as high as $0.00426, a peak level last seen at the beginning of February. TURBO Price, Source: CoinGecko Other top performers include PENGU (+41%), WIF (+28%), BONK (+25%), FLOKI (+17%), and many more. Meme coins are known for their enhanced volatility, and their prices often follow the overall revival of the entire cryptocurrency industry. Recall that the market capitalization of the digital asset sector recently reclaimed the psychological level of $3 trillion, while Bitcoin (BTC) jumped to over $94,000. How Are the Leaders Doing? Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – the undisputed leaders of the realm – have also gone on the offensive, albeit witnessing less impressive gains than TURBO, PENGU, and some others. The OG meme coin is up 10.5% for the day, currently trading at roughly $0.18. The rise might have reduced Dogecoin’s chances of experiencing a painful decline in the near future . Earlier this week, the popular analyst Ali Martinez assumed that DOGE could plummet to as low as $0.06 unless it turns the resistance at $0.17 into support. The latest resurgence infused optimism across the space, with numerous industry participants foreseeing a further pump on the horizon. X user World of Charts expects DOGE to soar to $0.40 in the coming days, while KALEO set a target of $1. Dogecoin’s biggest rival, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has charted a similar price increase in the last 24 hours. Several hours ago, it ascended to $0.00001387, the highest mark since late March.

Here Are 3 To Rally The Hardest",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/analyst-says-if-bitcoin-price-rallies-altcoins-will-here-are-3-to-rally-the-hardest/,"The crypto industry becomes heated up as Bitcoin reaches $84,400 in April 2025 creating a price milestone. The market environment points to a trend where analysts predict that Bitcoin price increases typically act as an ignition point for alternative cryptocurrency rallies. Altcoins tend to benefit from the rising Bitcoin price since investors become more confident in cryptocurrency investing. The three altcoins with the strongest surge potential include Dogecoin (DOGE) combined with XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The three cryptocurrencies demonstrate unique operational properties that combine decentralized lending power with meme market effects. Dogecoin (DOGE) consolidation sparks hope The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) currently remains between $0.14 and $0.17 within its consolidation network that sits at $0.15. The whale-class investor group showed enhanced interest in Dogecoin (DOGE) as they unloaded more than 570 million coins across last week. Virtual analysts predict DOGE will surge to $1 during summer 2025 based on the Relative Strength Index reaching 43 and other technical measurement signals. Both MACD and signal lines indicate an upcoming rise in buyer demand. The market resistance for DOGE stands at $0.17 while average prices below $0.14 will probe support levels at $0.1405. Social media influences on DOGE prices cause the cryptocurrency to gain market attention but these dynamics remain less stable than detailed project developments. XRP burns fuel cautious optimism The XRP token currently trades at $2.08 which shows an active descent while maintaining $2.24 as the main resistance point. Network transaction volume reached new heights on April 16 when 4,600 tokens got burned leading to double the transaction counts from the day before. The increasing number of users is responsible for the surge according to experts but they emphasize that token burns exist to prevent spam rather than manage supply. Ripple token needs to surpass $2.12 to potentially hit $2.60 although weak trading momentum prevents investors from getting optimistic. Under positive market conditions those who hold XRP for the long term envision reaching $10 within their grasp while the short-term potential heavily depends on breaking through the 200-day EMA. XRP maintains legal momentum despite not presenting the same fundamental purchase mechanisms which emerging projects deliver. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites demand Investors actively participate in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fourth presale by purchasing tokens at $0.025. The increasing number of investors have brought $7 million capital and have distributed 416 million tokens among 8,400 holders. During phase 5 of the presale MUTM will experience a 20% price increase from $0.025 to $0.03 while existing buyers obtain a 20% profit. The project’s MUTM tokens will launch at $0.06 with a 140% increase from the initial price. The market analysts expect MUTM to rise up to $2.50 after launch producing a staggering 9,900% return on investment. The development team is completing the Certik audit procedure while preparing to publicize results through social media platforms. Moreover, the new dashboard which shows the leading 50 token holders creates competitive buying to earn bonus rewards. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers lending services because it differs from speculative token movement in DOGE and incremental token burning in XRP. The presale time pressure is directly related to why investors choose to buy altcoins. Seizing the altcoin surge The rising Bitcoin values activate the entire crypto market which presents favorable conditions for Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens. DOGE brings positive potential through its meme-based approach and XRP demonstrates network growth despite Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishing itself through its systematic development program and its highly enthusiastic presale event. Individuals should access the official Mutuum Finance website to take part in the presale program and benefit from the altcoin market trend.

Heart celebrated the decision as a win for open-source software and crypto rights. Meanwhile, the SEC and DOJ charged Ramil Palafox with running a $200 million Ponzi-like crypto scheme through PGI Global. In Australia, fintech firm Block Earner scored a legal victory after the Federal Court ruled its crypto yield product did not require a financial services license. SEC Backs Off from Richard Heart The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially stated that it will not refile its securities fraud complaint against Richard Schueler, who is also known as Richard Heart. In an April 21 letter to Judge Carol Bagley Amon of the New York District Court, SEC attorney Matthew Gulde confirmed the regulator’s decision. The court previously dismissed the SEC’s initial complaint on Feb. 28, due to a lack of jurisdiction. Judge Amon ruled that the SEC failed to show Heart’s actions were directed at US investors, which completely undermined the foundation of the case. Although the SEC was initially granted the option to amend its complaint, the agency now opted against pursuing any further legal action. After the decision, Heart took to social media on April 22 to declare victory, and stated that Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX “defeated the SEC completely” and achieved a level of regulatory clarity that is rarely seen among cryptocurrencies. Heart explained that while the SEC voluntarily walked away from other cases, this was the only one where the regulator lost entirely in court. He also claimed the case was a broader win for open-source software, cryptocurrency, and free speech, as it involved the SEC targeting the software code itself. The SEC originally filed the lawsuit in July of 2023, and it accused Heart of conducting unregistered securities offerings and raising over $1 billion through the promotion of HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PLSX). In response, Heart argued that the SEC lacked jurisdiction because he resides outside the United States. The SEC countered by pointing to his participation in a promotional event in Las Vegas. Adding to the legal drama, Interpol issued a Red Notice seeking Heart’s arrest in Finland in December. Here, he was also reportedly under investigation for tax evasion. Despite these developments, Heart maintained his defense, and the eventual dismissal of the case is seen as a major landmark moment by his very loyal supporters. (Source: Interpol ) Since reaching an all-time high of $0.031 in December 2024, the native PulseChain token HEX’s price dropped by almost 76%, mirroring the struggles of many altcoins that failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s rally earlier this year. The SEC’s decision to drop the case is part of the pattern under the Trump administration where several enforcement actions against crypto firms were either paused or abandoned entirely. SEC and DOJ Charge Crypto Scam Mastermind Other people in the crypto space are not as lucky as Richard Heart. The SEC and the Department of Justice filed coordinated civil and criminal charges against Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, accusing him of orchestrating a fraudulent crypto scheme that took in more than $200 million from approximately 90,000 investors. The SEC announced on April 22 that Palafox misappropriated more than $57 million from funds that were raised through his company, PGI Global, which operated between January 2020 and October 2021. SEC statement According to the SEC , Palafox used a multilevel marketing model to execute what it called a Ponzi-like scheme, promising guaranteed profits from AI-powered crypto and forex trading. The agency said Palafox hosted lavish events in locations like Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new participants and incentivized referrals with bonuses. However, rather than using investor funds for actual trading, Palafox allegedly used the money to finance a luxury lifestyle. He bought cars, watches, homes, and other personal items. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Palafox to bar him from future involvement in securities and crypto asset sales, along with repayment of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. The Department of Justice filed a parallel criminal case through the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. According to an indictment that was unsealed in March, Palafox faces charges including wire fraud, money laundering, and unlawful monetary transactions. Prosecutors allege that Palafox lured investors with false claims of consistent daily returns between 0.5% and 3% from Bitcoin trading. He also promised that profits would be made regardless of market direction. In reality, most of the funds were allegedly never used for trading, and many investors lost their money entirely. If he gets convicted, Palafox stands to forfeit over $1 million in cash and luxury assets including 17 high-end vehicles, as well as designer goods and jewelry. PGI Global was linked to several other companies, including the Praetorian Group International Trading Inc., whose website was seized by the Department of Justice in 2021. The UK’s High Court later shut down the firm’s UK operations. This case is the SEC’s first major crypto enforcement under its new chair, Paul Atkins, who was sworn in on April 22. Block Earner Beats ASIC in Crypto Court Battle In other crypto-related legal news, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in favor of fintech company Block Earner, overturning a previous decision that found the firm needed a financial services license for its discontinued crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products. In a judgment that was issued on April 22, Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham, and Catherine Button stated that Block Earner’s yield product does not qualify as a financial product, managed investment scheme, or derivative under the Corporations Act. The court determined that the product functioned as a straightforward loan agreement, with users lending crypto assets under fixed terms in exchange for interest payments. Because there was no pooling of funds or shared investment upside, it could not be classified under existing financial product definitions. The ruling is a setback for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), which initially brought the case in November of 2022, and argued that Block Earner required an Australian Financial Services License to offer its crypto yield products. ASIC has been ordered to cover the costs of the proceedings, including appeals, and stated in a press release that it is reviewing the decision. (Source: ASIC ) Block Earner's Chief Commercial Officer, James Coombes , said the court’s decision provides much-needed legal clarity, confirming that crypto assets should not be treated differently from traditional asset classes when applying existing financial laws. He explained that the product was designed to offer fixed returns without exposing customers to pooled investments or the broader risks of the company’s operations. Despite the favorable ruling, Block Earner does not plan to relaunch its Earner product, which was discontinued when legal action began. However, the firm will continue to focus on crypto-backed lending products as its core business offering.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 09:30:00
43702227,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151682,1745400619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Trump Crypto: Unlocking Regulatory Certainty with Paul Atkins,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-crypto-regulatory-certainty/,"The landscape of cryptocurrency in the United States is constantly shifting, influenced by technological innovation, market dynamics, and perhaps most significantly, political will. A recent development that has captured the attention of the digital asset world is the endorsement from former U.S. President Donald Trump for SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Trump expressed significant confidence in Atkins, stating he is the ‘best person’ to bring much-needed regulatory certainty to the complex realm of cryptocurrencies, as reported by Golden Finance. This statement from a prominent political figure like Trump carries weight, especially considering the ongoing debates and often conflicting approaches to crypto regulation within the U.S. government. The call for regulatory certainty is a persistent plea from industry leaders, investors, and developers alike, who argue that clear rules are essential for growth, innovation, and mainstream adoption. Trump’s backing of Atkins suggests a potential alignment towards a specific regulatory philosophy – one that the former President believes will foster a more predictable environment for digital assets. What is the History of Trump Crypto Stance? Donald Trump’s public statements on cryptocurrency have evolved over time, reflecting the changing perception and growing importance of digital assets. Initially, his views were often perceived as skeptical, particularly towards Bitcoin. In 2019, he famously tweeted that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies,” citing their volatility and “thin air” basis, and even suggesting they were used for illicit activities. He also noted that Bitcoin was “not money.” However, as cryptocurrency gained more traction and entered the mainstream consciousness, and especially as he explored campaigning efforts, his tone appeared to soften. More recently, he has acknowledged the popularity of crypto and even suggested that he could be amenable to regulatory frameworks that keep the industry within the United States rather than pushing it offshore. His campaign began accepting crypto donations, a significant shift from his earlier stance. This latest endorsement of Paul Atkins can be seen as part of this evolving perspective, indicating a move towards actively shaping the regulatory environment rather than simply dismissing the asset class. His focus on Atkins suggests a preference for a regulator known for a particular approach, which brings us to the next crucial question. Who is Paul Atkins and Why Does Trump Back Him for SEC Crypto Regulation? Paul S. Atkins is a significant figure in the world of financial regulation. He served as a Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2001 to 2008. During his tenure, he was often seen as a voice for less government intervention and a critic of what he perceived as regulatory overreach. He was notably critical of aspects of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, arguing it placed undue burdens on businesses. Atkins’ background and philosophical leanings provide insight into why Trump might view him as the ideal person to handle SEC crypto regulation . Those who advocate for a lighter touch or a more principles-based approach to digital asset regulation might see Atkins as someone likely to favor clarity and market-driven solutions over stringent, prescriptive rules. His experience within the SEC gives him institutional knowledge, while his known views suggest he might prioritize fostering innovation and reducing perceived regulatory hurdles that the crypto industry often complains about. Trump’s endorsement highlights a desire to place regulatory authority for crypto under a figure whose past actions and stated beliefs align with a vision of regulation that promotes business and investment by providing clear, predictable rules, rather than potentially stifling innovation through aggressive enforcement or ambiguous guidelines. This makes Atkins a key figure to watch regarding the future direction of Paul Atkins crypto policies at the SEC. Why is Regulatory Certainty Crucial for US Crypto Policy? The term regulatory certainty is perhaps the most frequently heard plea from participants in the cryptocurrency space. But why is it so important? Here’s a breakdown: Encourages Investment: Investors, particularly large institutional players, are often hesitant to commit significant capital to markets with unclear rules. Uncertainty creates risk. Clear regulations make the market more attractive and accessible for broader investment. Fosters Innovation: Developers and entrepreneurs need to understand the rules of the road to build compliant products and services. Ambiguity can stifle creativity and lead to companies relocating to jurisdictions with clearer frameworks. Protects Consumers: While the industry seeks flexibility, clear rules are also vital for protecting consumers and investors from fraud, manipulation, and mismanagement. Certainty allows legitimate businesses to thrive while making it easier to identify and prosecute bad actors. Supports Market Maturity: Defined regulations help transition the crypto market from a nascent, speculative space to a mature, integrated part of the financial system. Prevents ‘Regulation by Enforcement’: Without clear rules upfront, regulators often resort to enforcement actions to signal their stance. This can be unpredictable and damaging to companies that believed they were operating compliantly. The current state of US crypto policy is often criticized for its lack of cohesion. Various agencies – the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Treasury Department, and state regulators – all have overlapping or sometimes conflicting claims of jurisdiction and approaches. This creates a confusing environment that hinders progress. A push towards regulatory certainty , potentially led by a figure like Atkins at the SEC, could streamline this process and provide the clarity the market desperately needs. What Are the Implications of This Backing? Trump’s endorsement of Paul Atkins for leading the charge on regulatory certainty has several potential implications: Potential Shift in SEC Approach: If Atkins were to take a leading role or if his philosophy gains more traction within the SEC under future administrations, it could signal a move towards a more industry-friendly or less interventionist regulatory stance compared to some current approaches. Increased Political Focus: Trump’s public support elevates the issue of crypto regulation and the specific role of the SEC in the political discourse, potentially making it a more significant topic in upcoming political discussions and elections. Boost for Atkins’ Influence: The endorsement from a former President, especially one who remains influential, could bolster Atkins’ standing and influence within Republican circles and potentially within regulatory discussions, regardless of his formal position. Signaling to the Market: The statement itself provides a signal to the market about a potential future direction of US crypto policy , particularly under a potential future Trump administration. It suggests a preference for a regulatory framework designed to accommodate and integrate digital assets. Focus on Certainty over Strict Control: The emphasis on ‘regulatory certainty’ rather than just ‘regulation’ suggests a priority on clear rules and predictability, which aligns with the crypto industry’s primary request. It’s important to note that the impact of this endorsement depends heavily on future political developments and how regulatory bodies like the SEC ultimately formulate and enforce rules. However, it undeniably adds a significant voice to the call for clarity and points towards a potential regulatory direction favored by a major political figure. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead for US Crypto Policy While the push for regulatory certainty and the backing of figures like Atkins present opportunities, the path forward for US crypto policy is fraught with challenges. Challenges: Defining Assets: A fundamental challenge remains classifying various crypto assets – are they securities, commodities, or something else entirely? Different classifications fall under different regulatory purviews. Technological Complexity: The rapid evolution of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) makes it difficult for regulators to keep pace and apply existing frameworks effectively. Balancing Innovation and Risk: Regulators must balance the desire to foster innovation with the need to protect investors and prevent illicit activities. This is a delicate and often contentious balance. Political Division: There are differing views on crypto regulation within Congress and across various government agencies, leading to potential legislative and regulatory gridlock. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon. U.S. regulations need to consider international standards and prevent regulatory arbitrage, where companies move to less regulated jurisdictions. Opportunities: Attracting Capital and Talent: Clear and favorable regulations could position the U.S. as a global leader in the crypto space, attracting investment and skilled professionals. Setting Global Standards: The U.S. has the potential to influence global regulatory norms for digital assets. Fostering a Mature Market: Effective regulation can lead to a more stable, transparent, and trustworthy market, encouraging broader participation. Enhancing National Security: Clear rules can help combat illicit finance activities facilitated by crypto, enhancing national security. The debate around SEC crypto regulation , influenced by figures like Paul Atkins crypto perspective and endorsements like that from Trump crypto , will be central to navigating these challenges and seizing these opportunities to shape future US crypto policy . Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For anyone involved in or interested in the cryptocurrency market, keeping an eye on regulatory developments is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor SEC Announcements: Pay close attention to official statements, proposed rules, and enforcement actions from the SEC. These provide direct insight into the current regulatory thinking. Follow Congressional Discussions: Track legislative proposals and hearings related to cryptocurrency. Congress has the power to create overarching frameworks that could supersede or clarify agency actions. Understand Key Figures: Learn about the backgrounds and stated views of key regulators and policymakers involved in the crypto space, such as Paul Atkins, to anticipate potential policy directions. Engage (If Applicable): For industry participants, consider engaging with policymakers and regulatory bodies through public comment periods or industry associations to provide input on proposed rules. Diversify Information Sources: Get news and analysis from reputable sources covering both the crypto industry and financial regulation to get a comprehensive view. The conversation around regulatory certainty , sparked by endorsements like Trump’s, is a positive sign that policymakers are recognizing the need for clearer rules. However, the details of how this certainty will be achieved and what the resulting framework will look like are yet to be fully determined. Compelling Summary Donald Trump’s recent expression of confidence in SEC Chairman Paul Atkins as the ideal candidate to bring regulatory certainty to the cryptocurrency market is a significant development. It underscores the growing political importance of digital assets and highlights a desire from a major political figure for a clear and predictable regulatory environment in the United States. Atkins’ background as a former SEC Commissioner known for advocating for less government intervention suggests a potential direction focused on fostering innovation alongside necessary oversight. The pursuit of regulatory certainty is paramount for the growth and maturation of the US crypto policy . While challenges remain in classifying assets, keeping pace with technology, and navigating political divisions, endorsements like this signal a potential shift towards prioritizing clear rules to attract investment and talent. As the debate around SEC crypto regulation continues, with figures like Paul Atkins crypto perspectives gaining prominence under the spotlight of Trump crypto endorsements, staying informed on policy developments will be essential for all market participants.

The visual, titled “Interledger: Enabling Interoperability Across Platforms (2020–2025),” outlines how traditional money networks from Japan, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China could be interconnected via the XRP Ledger, acting as a central bridge. Everyone wants to know why I’m only investing in XRP vs being diversified… this visual should be enough for most people to understand. Interesting timing… pic.twitter.com/MKBA7KyNnr — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) April 20, 2025 The graphic also shows connections to several platforms across sectors, including blockchain, capital markets, trade finance, Internet of Things, and digital payment solutions. This image highlights the interoperability between centralized financial systems (such as Zengin, SEPA, ACH, FPS, and HVPS/BEPS) and emerging platforms via the Interledger Protocol, with the XRP Ledger at the core of this envisioned network. These connections suggest a framework where financial transactions could flow seamlessly across borders, technologies, and institutional boundaries, supported by the integration of ILP and the XRP Ledger. Claver’s Investment Rationale Claver captioned the post with a direct explanation: “Everyone wants to know why I’m only investing in XRP vs being diversified… this visual should be enough for most people to understand. Interesting timing…” His decision to concentrate investments exclusively in XRP is presented as a logical conclusion drawn from the structure depicted in the image attached to his tweet. The post suggests that Claver views the XRP Ledger not as a digital asset network but as a foundational infrastructure for future cross-platform financial interoperability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The illustration portrays the XRP Ledger as a central hub through which various money networks and platforms, from payment platforms like PayPal and Apple Pay to capital markets data providers like Bloomberg, can communicate and transact using ILP. Claver’s focus on XRP, rather than a diversified approach, appears rooted in the belief that its central position in this model gives it a unique strategic advantage. Responses and Broader Investor Sentiment The post drew attention from other users in the digital asset community. One user commented : “Anyone who’s been here multiple cycles knows better than to go all in xrp. I’m heaviest in XRP but I’m also packing in xdc, qnt, and xlm. Makes sense to hold other lower cap gems as well as xrp.” This reply reflects a common view among many long-time investors who maintain positions in a broader range of digital assets, particularly those they consider to be interoperable or complementary to XRP in function or vision. Despite these differing views, Claver’s statement underscores a specific investment philosophy—one that prioritizes perceived long-term utility and integration within future financial infrastructure over broader exposure.

Many altcoins have marked explosive gains over the past 24 hours as well, including ETH, which has soared by 10%, and SUI, which has skyrocketed by almost 30%. BTC Above $94K A lot can change in the cryptocurrency space within the span of just a few weeks. Recall that the primary cryptocurrency plunged hard on April 7 and 9 due to the ongoing tariff madness started by the US to under $75,000 to mark a five-month low. However, the overall improving conditions, including a tariff pause for most countries, helped the asset begin its recovery. Last week, it traded about $10,000 higher than its low, but the beginning of the new one brought even more impressive gains. After trading sideways during the weekend at around $84,000, BTC went on the offensive on Monday and pushed above $87,000. It kept climbing in the following days and broke past $90,000 yesterday. That was still not the end as the cryptocurrency flew to over $94,000 earlier today for the first time since early March. Its market capitalization has shot up to $1.870 trillion on CoinGecko, while its dominance over the altcoins remains strong at over 61%. BTCUSD.

Ethereum, which has been among the leaders in terms of underperformance, has soared by 10% and tapped a multi-week peak of its own at $1,800. Double-digit gains are evident from ADA, DOGE, AVAX, LINK, XLM, SHIB, and many others. SUI has stolen the show from the larger-cap alts. The asset has exploded by over 27% in the past day and sits close to $3. XRP, SOL, HBAR, TON, and LTC are also well in the green, but in a more modest single-digit manner.

At a conference in New York, ECB official Francois Villeroy de Galhau said aggressive trade measures threaten to throttle an already fragile economy. He added that increasing tariffs between major economies creates uncertainty for business, discourages investment, and risks financial market stability. Villeroy, one of Europe’s most influential central bankers, emphasized the growing need for honesty across the Atlantic, urging a thorough assessment of the trade war’s damage and encouraging efforts to reopen the path for constructive dialogue. His remarks follow a series of deteriorating global economic forecasts. Only hours before Villeroy spoke, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecasts downwards for this year and the next. The IMF warned things could worsen if the trade war escalated further. Villeroy stands up for Europe’s values Villeroy also directly addressed comments by President Trump criticizing the European Union . Trump has criticized the EU as a group created to exploit the United States and has called it unfair in trade matters. Villeroy pushed back hard on that narrative. The European Union, he added, was forged after World War II with deep American support. Villeroy added that peace, democracy, and market-based economies are core American values and that the European Union was multilateralism “at its best,” with firm backing from the United States. The ECB official’s defense reflects increasing European unease about how the current U.S. administration treats longtime allies. Past American presidents have done so as partners in global leadership when dealing with Europe. Trump’s defiant posture is a notable departure. Villeroy’s comments also came after ECB President Christine Lagarde called on EU governments to boost internal trade and cooperation earlier in the day. Lagarde called on European countries to eliminate barriers to one another to withstand external shocks like trade wars more effectively. Villeroy calls for positive dialogue Villeroy ended his speech by urging deliberate, rational discussions between the U.S. and Europe aimed at settling disagreement. He rejected the notion that international trade is a zero-sum game, where one nation’s success comes at the expense of another. Instead, he framed global commerce as a powerful driver of mutual prosperity—built on exchanging goods, services, talent, and innovation. Villeroy also pointed to often-overlooked facts in heated trade debates. He noted that the U.S. holds a significant services trade surplus with Europe, particularly in finance, technology, and consulting—areas where it stands to benefit most. He further noted that mechanisms like Value-Added Tax (VAT) differ from customs duties and are not intended as protectionist measures. Villeroy added that the ECB’s baseline scenario continues to project inflation returning to near 2% in 2025 without a big recession. But he conceded that rising trade tensions pose risks to this forecast. Villeroy called on Europe to react by growing stronger — investing better, innovating quicker, and building new partnerships worldwide. He also emphasized that there’s still an opportunity to work with the U.S., particularly in global financial stability, cybersecurity, digital assets, and fighting climate change. To close, he sounded a sharp warning about political interferences into central banks, saying attacks on their independence and credibility, as seen recently, could have fundamentally damaging financial consequences. Trump has often attacked the U.S. Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell , suggesting the U.S. central bank has failed to do enough to foster economic momentum. Yet Trump said on Tuesday that he does not intend to fire Powell. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

This is reflected in market data, including the so-called Coinbase premium — the difference in pricing between the BTC/USD pair on the largest US exchange, Coinbase, and Binance's BTC/USDT equivalent. A positive premium indicates US buyer interest, with current values showing “alternate” demand between Coinbase and Binance. “These two exchanges, which can be considered the largest in the world, have their whales alternately pushing the market up, creating a very positive situation, CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan summarized in one of its “ Quicktake ” blog posts.

Get ready for some potentially game-changing news in the world of digital assets and sports engagement. Chiliz (CHZ), the project behind the popular Socios.com platform and a leader in the Fan Token space, is reportedly gearing up for a significant re-entry into the U.S. market. This isn’t just a rumor; it comes alongside news of high-level meetings with U.S. regulators and policymakers, signaling a serious intent to capture a slice of the massive American sports and entertainment landscape. What is Chiliz and Why Does its U.S. Crypto Market Return Matter? For those new to the scene, Chiliz is a blockchain network specifically designed for sports and entertainment entities. Its primary product is Socios.com, a platform that allows sports teams, leagues, and other organizations to launch Fan Tokens. These aren’t just collectibles; Fan Tokens give holders various benefits, such as voting rights in minor club decisions (like jersey designs or goal celebration music), access to exclusive merchandise, VIP experiences, and gamification features. Chiliz previously operated in the U.S. but withdrew, likely due to the evolving and often uncertain regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. The U.S. is the world’s largest sports market by revenue, and its entertainment industry is equally immense. A successful return for Chiliz could unlock a massive potential user base and partnership opportunities with major American sports franchises across leagues like the NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, and MLS, as well as various entertainment brands. The news of Chiliz planning its re-entry is significant because it suggests the project feels confident enough to navigate the complex U.S. legal and regulatory landscape. It also highlights the growing maturity of the crypto market, where projects are actively seeking compliance rather than avoiding jurisdictions with stringent rules. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: The Crucial SEC Meeting A key piece of information driving this news is that Chiliz recently held a meeting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a critical step for any crypto project looking to operate legally and transparently in the United States. The SEC is the primary regulator for securities markets, and whether certain cryptocurrencies or crypto-related products (like Fan Tokens) fall under their purview has been a major point of contention and uncertainty. Meeting with the SEC Meeting indicates that Chiliz is taking a proactive approach. Instead of launching and hoping for the best, they appear to be engaging directly with regulators to understand the requirements, discuss their product, and potentially seek guidance on how to structure their U.S. operations to be compliant. This engagement is vital for building trust and reducing the risk of future enforcement actions. While the specifics of the meeting haven’t been fully disclosed, the fact that it happened is a strong positive signal. It suggests that Chiliz is willing to invest time and resources into ensuring their operations align with U.S. laws, which is paramount for long-term success and widespread adoption in the country. Engagement Beyond the SEC: Meeting with Policymakers Further underlining Chiliz’s serious intent for a U.S. comeback is the reported meeting between Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus and Bo Hines, the chairman of the White House Presidential Cryptocurrency Advisory Council. A photo shared by Dreyfus on X (formerly Twitter) showed the two together, indicating dialogue at a high level of U.S. government. Meeting with policymakers like Mr. Hines is different from meeting with regulators like the SEC. While the SEC focuses on enforcing existing laws and regulations, advisory councils often play a role in shaping future policy and providing input to the executive branch on important emerging areas like cryptocurrency. Engaging with such councils allows Chiliz to: Educate policymakers about their technology and business model (Fan Tokens). Provide input on how future regulations might be structured to foster innovation while protecting consumers. Signal their commitment to operating responsibly within the U.S. framework. This multi-pronged approach – engaging with both regulators and policymakers – demonstrates a sophisticated strategy by Chiliz to lay the groundwork for a successful and compliant re-entry into the U.S. Crypto Market . Timing is Everything: Targeting the 2026 FIFA World Cup The reported target timeline for Chiliz’s U.S. re-entry is strategically aligned with a massive global event: the 2026 FIFA World Cup . This prestigious tournament will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, bringing an enormous amount of attention, tourism, and fan engagement to North America, particularly the U.S. Why is this timing significant for Chiliz and Fan Tokens? Increased Soccer Interest: The World Cup will dramatically boost interest in soccer across the U.S., a sport that is already growing rapidly in popularity. This creates a prime opportunity to introduce Fan Tokens to a wider audience. Global Audience on U.S. Soil: Millions of international fans, many of whom may already be familiar with Fan Tokens through European or South American teams, will be in the U.S. for the event. Partnership Potential: The lead-up to and during the World Cup could present unique partnership opportunities with host cities, venues, or even U.S. national team-related initiatives. Marketing Momentum: The World Cup provides a massive marketing platform. Launching or significantly expanding U.S. operations around this time could allow Chiliz to ride the wave of sports excitement. Aligning their re-entry with such a major sporting event suggests Chiliz is aiming for maximum impact and adoption from day one. Investing in the Future: The $50M-$100M Commitment Actions speak louder than words, and Chiliz is backing its U.S. ambitions with a substantial financial commitment. Reports indicate the company plans to invest between $50 million and $100 million in its U.S. operations. This is a significant figure that underscores the seriousness of their re-entry plans. Where might this investment go? It could be allocated across several key areas: Compliance and Legal: Navigating U.S. regulations requires significant legal expertise and potentially infrastructure changes. Business Development and Partnerships: Securing deals with major U.S. sports leagues, teams, and entertainment brands will be crucial and likely expensive. Marketing and User Acquisition: Building awareness and encouraging adoption of Fan Tokens among the U.S. audience will require substantial marketing efforts. Team Expansion: Hiring local talent for operations, legal, marketing, and partnership roles in the U.S. Technology and Infrastructure: Potentially adapting the platform or infrastructure to meet specific U.S. requirements or handle anticipated scale. This level of investment suggests Chiliz is not just dipping its toes back in; it’s preparing for a full-scale launch to become a major player in the U.S. Fan Tokens market. What Does This Mean for Fan Tokens and CHZ Holders? For existing holders of CHZ, the native token of the Chiliz blockchain, and for the broader Fan Token ecosystem, this U.S. re-entry plan is overwhelmingly positive news. The United States represents a massive untapped market for fan engagement platforms like Socios.com. Increased adoption and usage of the Chiliz platform in the U.S. could lead to: Higher Demand for CHZ: CHZ is often needed to acquire Fan Tokens or participate in platform activities. Increased U.S. user activity could drive demand. New Partnerships: Securing major U.S. sports team partnerships would add significant value and credibility to the ecosystem. Ecosystem Growth: More users and partnerships contribute to the overall health and growth of the Chiliz ecosystem. Potential Price Impact: While not guaranteed, positive developments like expansion into a major market often have a favorable impact on a token’s price due to increased interest and potential demand. For U.S. sports fans, this could mean gaining access to a new way to engage with their favorite teams, offering unique participation opportunities beyond traditional fan clubs. Challenges and Opportunities in the U.S. Landscape While the potential is huge, Chiliz will face challenges in the U.S. market: Regulatory Clarity: Despite meetings, the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto is still evolving and can be unpredictable. Market Education: Many U.S. consumers are still unfamiliar with Fan Tokens and their utility. Educating the market will be key. Competition: While perhaps not direct Fan Token competitors yet, other platforms are vying for fan attention and digital engagement dollars. Adoption Curve: Convincing major U.S. leagues and teams to fully embrace Fan Tokens might take time. However, the opportunities are compelling: Market Size: The sheer scale of the U.S. sports and entertainment market is unparalleled. Tech Savvy Population: A large portion of the U.S. population is digitally native and open to new technologies. Passion for Sports: American sports culture is deeply ingrained, with highly engaged fan bases. Chiliz’s strategy, including the timing around the 2026 FIFA World Cup and significant investment, suggests they are well aware of both the challenges and the immense potential rewards. In Conclusion: A Bold Move for Chiliz Chiliz’s reported plan to re-enter the U.S. market is a bold and strategic move. Backed by substantial investment and proactive engagement with U.S. regulators and policymakers, the project seems determined to establish a strong foothold ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. This development is positive news for the Fan Tokens ecosystem, holding significant implications for the future growth and adoption of sports-related cryptocurrencies in one of the world’s largest markets. It signals growing confidence in navigating the complex U.S. Crypto Market and a commitment to expanding the utility and reach of fan engagement through blockchain technology. The journey won’t be without its hurdles, but the potential rewards are substantial.

Now suddenly everyone’s an expert on the blockchain instruction kit that’s being touted as a replacement to the EVM – and by no less than Vitalk himself . While some crypto figures have heaped praise on the Ethereum founder for belatedly seeing the light, others are surprised he didn’t convert sooner – particularly given that RISC-V’s capabilities have been well documented for years. Describing the function of RISC-V is less than straight-forward, since it’s not technically a virtual machine like the EVM. It’s been variously described as “instruction set architecture” and “hardware-level ISA for physical processors,” neither of which sheds much light on what RISC-V actually does. So let’s express it in layman’s terms: RISC-V make computer run better. There, that was easy. As for whether Ethereum will indeed ditch the virtual machine that’s got its name in it and switch to the rival RISC-V that’s more synonymous with Polkadot remains to be seen. But for the record, the following blockchain projects were long RISC-V long before Vitalik latched on. Cartesi One of the first projects to have seen RISC-V’s potential is Cartesi , the modular blockchain for performant dapps, all secured by rollups. It specified its chain to be powered by RISC-V from day one – indeed the framework is cited 56 times in Cartesi’s original whitepaper . As its docs explain, “The RISC-V ISA, on which Cartesi Machines are based, consists of a minimal 32-bit integer instruction set to which several extensions can be added.” If that’s a little too technical for you to parse, we’ll stop there, since Cartesi’s explanation only gets more complex from there. Besides, what’s important isn’t so much the implementation as the foresight that Cartesi’s team had in identifying the need for a processor that was more scalable than the EVM. This might sound obvious now, in an age where Ethereum is stagnating and newer L1s such as Solana and Sui are racing ahead, but that’s just hindsight talking. In 2018, the EVM could do no wrong in the eyes of most devs. Cartesi saw things differently, and it’s now been vindicated, regardless of whether or not Ethereum ultimately switches software. Wanxiang Blockchain As its name suggests, Wanxiang is a Chinese blockchain company and its team was one of the earliest to see the potential in RISC-V, having been touting the tech since 2021. In fact, Wanxiang’s technical team were so intrigued by the potential for RISC-V’s implementation within a blockchain context that they founded an SIG (special interest group) to explore applications for it. Together with partners LeapFive, StarFive, and SiFive, Wanxiang has put its brightest minds to the task of identifying how best to leverage RISC-V’s ISA to create innovative blockchain solutions powered by open source technology. The Wanxiang team were particularly taken with RISC-V’s ability to support a range of cryptographic algorithms and enable developers to create secure, trusted solutions. Web3 Pi If you’ve never heard of Web3 Pi, don’t be ashamed – most crypto users haven’t. It’s a project dedicated to making it easier to run an Ethereum node on a Raspberry Pi. This might not be the stuff that web3 mass adoption is made of, but it’s an interesting exercise from an intellectual and technological perspective nonetheless – especially when you discover that Web3 Pi has managed to run a fully synced Ethereum node on RISC-V. This was achieved just over a month ago, and may have influenced Vitalik to go public with his thoughts on why Ethereum is ready to embrace the blockchain instruction set. Since this article can’t be closed out until RISC-V has been described a dozen different ways, incidentally, it should be noted that Web3 Pi refers to the tech as an “open-standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).” We’ll leave the final word on RISC-V and its potential path to being integrated onto Ethereum mainnet to Vitalik : “A more radical approach from a protocol perspective is to convert existing EVM contracts into contracts that call an EVM interpreter contract written in RISC-V that runs their existing EVM code.” For a developer community still coming to terms with Pectra and its umpteen delays, the prospect of running all existing dapps through a converter may be a tough gig to sell. But if anyone can do it, Vitalik can.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 09:40:56

Bitcoin Breaks Out According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Bitcoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern—a formation often seen as a bullish reversal—could technically lead prices to as high as $99,000. However, in his April 23 market report, Thielen expressed doubt over the momentum’s longevity. “The absence of strong stablecoin inflows raises questions about follow-through,” he cautioned, highlighting a key liquidity metric that often correlates with more durable rallies. Thielen emphasized that while futures leverage has spiked, indicating speculative enthusiasm, it’s the return of “stickier money” through stablecoin minting that truly underpins sustainable market moves. Without that foundational support, the current rally might be flying on borrowed time. Institutional Interest Spikes as Trump Softens Stance What gives the rally more weight is the record-setting influx into spot Bitcoin ETFs . On April 22 alone, U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs drew in $912.7 million—their highest single-day net inflow since January 17, according to Farside data . Analysts like Swyftx’s Pav Hundal interpret this surge as a signal that the rally is more than just retail-driven euphoria. “This is a true, demand-led rally,” he noted, dismissing the idea that short-term futures traders are solely behind the price pump. Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s earlier tariff threats in February—which rattled global markets—recent comments have hinted at a potential softening of his trade war stance . Traders have begun interpreting this as a potential easing of economic uncertainty, which could improve risk appetite across the board, including in crypto. Thielen sees $95,000 as the next key resistance zone—one that, if breached, could trigger a cascade of short liquidations and force further upside. Still, he remains cautious, stating that a sustained move toward $100,000 will require more than technical breakouts and speculative fervor—it needs true liquidity support. The post Bitcoin to $100K?

In an April 22 report , crypto forensics and compliance firm AMLBot revealed that many drainer operations have transitioned to a SaaS model known as drainer-as-a-service (DaaS). The report revealed that malware spreaders can rent a drainer for as little as 100 to 300 USDt ( USDT ). Crypto drainers report image. Source: AMLBot AMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk told Cointelegraph that “previously, entering the world of cryptocurrency scams required a fair amount of technical knowledge.” That is no longer the case. Under the DaaS model, “getting started isn’t significantly more difficult than with other types of cybercrime.” Demchuk explained that would-be drainer users join online communities to learn from experienced scammers who provide guides and tutorials. This is how many criminals involved with traditional phishing campaigns transition to the crypto drainer space. Related: North Korean hackers target crypto devs with fake recruitment tests Cybercrime in Russia — almost legal Groups offering crypto drainers as a service are increasingly bold and some are evolving almost like traditional business models, Demchuk said, adding: “Interestingly, some drainer groups have become so bold and professionalized that they even set up booths at industry conferences — CryptoGrab being one such example.“ When asked how a criminal operation can send representatives to information technology industry events without repercussions, such as arrests, he pointed to Russian cybercrime enforcement as the reason. “This can all be done in jurisdictions like Russia, where hacking is now essentially legalized if you're not operating across the post-Soviet space,” he said. The practice has been an open secret in the cybersecurity industry for many years. Cybersecurity news publication KrebsOnSecurity reported in 2021 that “virtually all ransomware strains” deactivate without causing harm if they detect Russian virtual keyboards installed. Similarly, the information stealer Typhon Reborn v2 checks the user’s IP geolocation against a list of post-Soviet countries. According to networking firm Cisco , if it determines that it is located in one of those countries, it deactivates. The reason is simple: Russian authorities have shown that they will act if local hackers hit citizens of the post-Soviet bloc. Related: What is Bitcoinlib, and how did hackers target it? Drainers keep growing Demchuk further explained that DaaS organizations usually find their clientele within existing phishing communities. This includes gray and black hat forums on both clearnet (regular internet) and darknet (deep web), as well as Telegram groups and channels and gray market platforms. In 2024, Scam Sniffer reported that drainers were responsible for about $494 million in losses, a 67% increase over the previous year, despite a 3.7% increase in the number of victims. Drainers are on the increase, with cybersecurity giant Kaspersky reporting that the number of online resources dedicated to them on darknet forums rose from 55 in 2022 to 129 in 2024. Developers are often recruited through normal job adverts. AMLBot’s open-source intelligence investigator, who prefers to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told Cointelegraph that while researching drainers, his team “did come across several job postings specifically targeting developers to build drainers for Web3 ecosystems.” He provided one job advert that described the required features of a script that would empty Hedera ( HBAR ) wallets. Once again, the offer was mainly targeted at Russian speakers: “This request was originally written in Russian and shared in a developer-focused Telegram chat. It’s a clear example of how technical talent is actively recruited in niche, often semi-open communities.“ The investigator further added that ads like this appear in Telegram chats for smart-contract developers. Those chats are not private or restricted, but they are small, with usually 100 to 200 members. Administrators quickly deleted the announcement provided as an example. Still, “as is often the case, those who needed to see it had already taken note and responded.” Traditionally, this kind of business was conducted on specialized clearnet forums and deep web forums accessible through the Tor network. Still, the investigator said that much of the content moved to Telegram thanks to its policy against sharing data with authorities. This changed following the arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov: “As soon as Telegram announced that it was giving out data, then the outflow to Tor started again, because it is easier to protect oneself there.” Still, this is a concern to cybercriminals that may no longer be relevant. Earlier this week, Durov expressed misgivings over a growing threat to private messaging in France and other European Union countries, warning that Telegram would rather exit certain markets than implement encryption backdoors that undermine user privacy.

Sports and entertainment-focused cryptocurrency project Chiliz (CHZ), which has withdrawn from the US market, recently met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to an official statement, Chiliz, which has addressed the regulatory uncertainty regarding fan tokens with the SEC, plans to re-enter the US market in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. At this point, Chiliz is expected to return to the US market with a planned investment of between $50 million and $100 million for the 2026 World Cup. The meeting also noted that NBA and NFL teams are interested in issuing fan tokens if regulations are made clearer. Chiliz and the SEC also discussed why a fan token should not be classified as a security. While the meeting with the SEC was held yesterday, April 22, on the same day, Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus shared a photo with White House Cryptocurrency Advisory Council chairman Bo Hines on X, signaling that a second meeting would be held with White House officials. Chiliz made a strategic decision to exit the US market in 2022 due to regulatory uncertainty and the FTX collapse.

43702879,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151684,1745401824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Decoupling: Crucial Uncertainty in US Stock Market Divergence,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-decoupling-market-analysis/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a question that has long captivated investors: Is Bitcoin decoupling from the traditional financial markets, specifically the US stock market ? For years, the price movements of Bitcoin and major stock indices often seemed to mirror each other, particularly during periods of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, recent observations have sparked hope among crypto enthusiasts that Bitcoin might finally be forging its own path. But is this divergence a fleeting moment or the start of a fundamental shift? Is Recent Bitcoin Decoupling a Long-Term Shift? According to experts cited by Decrypt, it’s still too early to definitively declare that Bitcoin decoupling from the US stock market is a sustained, long-term trend. While there has been a noticeable gap in performance recently, the underlying causes of this divergence are crucial to understanding its potential longevity. Jake Ostrovsky, an OTC trader at Wintermute, suggests that the current separation might be closely tied to fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar. If the perceived gap between stocks and Bitcoin is simply a reaction to a declining dollar, then this decoupling effect could be temporary. Ostrovsky posits that if the US dollar index (DXY) stabilizes, the divergence might come to an end. This highlights the dollar’s significant, albeit sometimes overlooked, role in global asset price movements, including cryptocurrencies. The Shadow of the Dollar: Why the US Dollar Index DXY Matters The US dollar index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. When the DXY falls, it means the dollar is weakening against other major currencies. Historically, a weakening dollar can sometimes coincide with rising prices for assets perceived as alternatives or hedges against inflation, such as commodities or, potentially, Bitcoin. Coinbase Institutional Research Lead David Duong elaborates on why concerns about the dollar’s value are currently growing. He points to the ongoing U.S. debt situation and the public exchanges between former President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as factors contributing to this sentiment. Uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy (debt) and monetary policy (Fed actions) can erode confidence in the dollar’s stability, leading investors to look elsewhere. If investors are moving into Bitcoin specifically as a hedge against a weakening dollar or potential inflation stemming from U.S. economic policies, then the observed Bitcoin decoupling from stocks might simply be a function of this specific macro trade. Once the dollar finds its footing or macroeconomic concerns shift, the correlation might reassert itself. Understanding the Bitcoin Price Trend in Context To truly confirm whether Bitcoin decoupling is a long-term phenomenon, we need to observe the Bitcoin price trend across a variety of market conditions, as David Duong suggests. A sustained divergence would need to hold even when the dollar stabilizes, when stock markets rally, or when they face downturns unrelated to currency concerns. Factors influencing the Bitcoin price trend are complex and multifaceted. While macroeconomics (like the dollar and stock market) play a role, Bitcoin’s price is also driven by: Network Fundamentals: Developments like the halving events, network hash rate, and transaction volume. Institutional Adoption: Increased investment and integration by large financial institutions. Regulatory Landscape: Government policies and regulations around the world. Technological Developments: Upgrades and innovations within the Bitcoin protocol and the broader crypto ecosystem. Market Sentiment: Fear, greed, and overall investor psychology unique to the crypto space. A true, lasting Bitcoin decoupling would imply that these unique crypto-specific factors are becoming the dominant drivers of the Bitcoin price trend , overriding the influence of traditional markets like the US stock market and the dynamics of the US dollar index (DXY) . Observing Crypto Market Trends for Confirmation Watching broader Crypto market trends is also key. Is the potential decoupling limited to just Bitcoin, or are other major cryptocurrencies also showing less correlation with traditional assets? If the divergence is a broader crypto phenomenon, it might indicate a maturing asset class less beholden to traditional finance’s whims. If it’s primarily a Bitcoin-specific move, it could be tied to unique narratives around Bitcoin’s role as digital gold or a dollar hedge. Here’s a simple way to visualize the different states: Market State Bitcoin-Stock Correlation DXY Influence Decoupling Status Past Norm (Often) High (Positive) Indirect/Complex Low Recent Observation Lower/Negative Gap Significant (via Dollar Weakness) Potential Short-Term True Long-Term Decoupling Low/Zero Minimal Confirmed Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Watch? Given the current uncertainty around Bitcoin decoupling , what should investors and observers focus on? The US Dollar Index (DXY): Monitor its movement. Does Bitcoin continue to diverge from stocks if the DXY stabilizes or strengthens? Federal Reserve Policy & US Debt: Keep an eye on Fed announcements and developments regarding U.S. fiscal health. How does Bitcoin react to news that impacts dollar stability? US Stock Market Performance: Observe how Bitcoin behaves during significant rallies or sell-offs in the S&P 500 or Nasdaq, especially when there isn’t a clear dollar catalyst. Bitcoin’s Internal Metrics: Pay attention to on-chain data, hash rate, and adoption metrics, as these represent factors unique to the Bitcoin price trend . Broader Crypto Market Trends: See if other major digital assets are following Bitcoin’s lead or if its performance is an outlier. Conclusion: Patience is Crucial While the idea of Bitcoin decoupling from traditional markets is exciting for many in the crypto space, the current divergence seems closely tied to specific macroeconomic factors, particularly the perceived weakness of the U.S. dollar driven by debt concerns and monetary policy uncertainty. Experts are rightly cautious, emphasizing that it’s simply too early to call this a permanent shift. Confirming a long-term decoupling will require observing the Bitcoin price trend and broader Crypto market trends under various conditions, independent of dollar movements or specific concerns impacting the US stock market . Until then, the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional finance remains complex and heavily influenced by the global macroeconomic landscape. Patience and careful observation of key indicators like the US dollar index (DXY) are essential for navigating this period of uncertainty.

According to Polymarket , the odds of Jerome Powell being removed as Federal Reserve Chair by 2025 are now 14%, down 9 percentage points in the last 24 hours. The shift follows a public statement from U.S. President Donald Trump, who confirmed he has “no intention” of firing Powell, despite prior tensions over interest rate policy, as reported by Reuters. Trump added that he would prefer Powell to be “a little more active” in cutting rates but has no plans to replace him. This marks a sharp reversal from just a week ago when rumors circulated that Trump’s administration was preparing to interview candidates to replace Powell. These rumors intensified following Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments and reports of ongoing disagreements between Powell and Trump regarding monetary policy. Trump has been pushing for more aggressive rate cuts to offset the economic effects of his newly imposed tariffs.

The news has helped ease concerns of leadership instability, often a source of volatility in both traditional and crypto markets. The cryptocurrency market responded well to the news, coupled with Trump’s softening stance on aggressive tariffs imposed on China. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surpassed $93,000, its highest level in weeks. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is now in the “Greed” territory after rising 25 points to 72, indicating a higher risk appetite among investors. With 13 months remaining in Powell’s term, Trump’s support has brought temporary calm to a previously heated debate. Market analysts say continued clarity from the White House on economic policy will be key to maintaining investor confidence in the coming months.

A prominent whale wallet has surfaced with an unrealized profit of $153 million from a four-year Solana staking play, while the newly rebranded DeFi Development Corporation has rapidly expanded its SOL treasury to over $34 million following a strategic buyout by former Kraken executives. Solana Whale Nets $153M Profit in Four-Year Staking Masterstroke Amid Surge in Network Activity A Solana (SOL) address has drawn widespread attention across the crypto community after blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed the wallet is sitting on over $153 million in unrealized profit—marking one of the most successful long-term staking plays on the network to date. According to the report, the whale initially staked nearly 1 million SOL in 2021 when the token was trading around $27. The total investment at the time came in at approximately $27 million. Over the following four years, as Solana weathered both bear markets and bullish rallies, the whale’s holdings grew steadily thanks to staking rewards, eventually reaching 1.29 million SOL. With Solana now trading near $140, the whale’s total position is worth around $180 million. On April 22, the whale began taking profits by unstaking 100,000 SOL—valued at roughly $14 million—and transferring the tokens to Binance, a move widely interpreted as a precursor to selling. Despite the offload, the address still holds about 1.19 million SOL, worth $166 million. Based on the original $27 million investment, this leaves the wallet with an unrealized profit of about $153 million, a stunning example of the potential power of long-term crypto staking strategies. This whale's move is not an isolated event. Earlier this month, on April 4, Arkham Intelligence reported another massive SOL staking unlock involving four wallets that had initially staked $37 million worth of tokens in 2021. By the time the tokens were unlocked in 2025, their value had ballooned to over $206 million. Following the unlock, approximately $50 million worth of SOL was sold, sparking conversations about the broader implications of large staking withdrawals and their influence on Solana's price and ecosystem health. The event was dubbed “the largest single-day unlock of staked SOL” by Arkham, highlighting the sheer scale and coordinated nature of these staking strategies. Solana Temporarily Overtakes Ethereum in Staking Market Cap These massive unlocks and wallet movements come at a time when Solana has seen renewed enthusiasm, not just in token price but also in network engagement and staking participation. On April 20, Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum in staking market capitalization, reaching over $53 billion in staked value. Although Ethereum soon reclaimed the top spot, the milestone served as a symbolic moment in Solana’s competitive trajectory. Still, reactions from the crypto community were mixed. Some hailed Solana's brief dominance as a sign of maturity and adoption, while others raised concerns over sustainability, citing the risks associated with such high concentrations of tokens in the hands of a few players and potential sell-offs like the one currently unfolding. The staggering $153 million gain not only shows the effectiveness of early strategic staking but also raises questions about the long-term impact of large-scale token unlocks on Solana’s market dynamics. As more whales consider liquidating parts of their portfolios, the market could face periods of volatility, especially if tokens are rapidly funneled to exchanges. On the flip side, the strong price growth, robust staking participation, and increasing institutional attention suggest that Solana is maturing as a blockchain network capable of attracting both individual and institutional capital. The rise of staking as a dominant investment mechanism in crypto portfolios could also be reinforced by such success stories, which might fuel more users to lock their assets in proof-of-stake protocols—further cementing staking as a core component of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DeFi Development Corporation Deepens Solana Treasury Strategy After Kraken Executive-Led Buyout In other news, the DeFi Development Corporation (DDC), previously known as Janover, is emerging as a rising force in the crypto treasury movement following its strategic pivot into digital assets led by a group of former Kraken executives. The company announced on April 22 that it had acquired an additional 88,164 Solana (SOL) tokens—worth $11.5 million—bringing its total SOL holdings to approximately 251,842 tokens, valued at $34.4 million. The move marks the company’s latest and most aggressive expansion into crypto since its April 7 acquisition and rebranding. Prior to the buyout, the company operated as a digital platform facilitating connections between lenders and commercial real estate buyers. According to the official announcement, the latest SOL acquisition builds on a previous $10.5 million Solana purchase completed on April 16. The firm’s leadership has emphasized that its treasury strategy is more than just a capital hedge—it’s a core component of its long-term business model. In line with this vision, DDC also confirmed plans to stake the entirety of its SOL holdings to earn yield and support the security and decentralization of the Solana blockchain. Shares of DeFi Development Corporation (ticker: JNVR) jumped 12.83% on the news, trading sharply higher intraday, according to Google Finance. DeFi Development Corporation's intraday performance (Source: Google Finance ) Pivot to Crypto Gains Momentum DeFi Development Corporation’s pivot mirrors a broader movement among forward-thinking firms leveraging crypto not just as an investment, but as a strategic asset. The decision to hold Solana specifically aligns with the network’s recent performance gains and its unique positioning in the proof-of-stake ecosystem. Solana briefly surpassed Ethereum on April 21 in total staked value, recording over $53.9 billion staked across more than 500,000 wallets. With an estimated 8.31% annualized staking return, it offers an attractive combination of speed, scalability, and passive income potential—traits that are increasingly appealing to companies looking to optimize capital reserves. The decision to build a Solana-based reserve treasury puts DeFi Development Corporation in a growing class of companies that are redefining balance sheet management in the digital era. The movement began gaining traction in 2020 when Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), under Michael Saylor’s leadership, made headlines for converting large portions of its cash reserves into Bitcoin. Since then, a wave of companies—ranging from tech firms to healthcare players—have experimented with similar treasury models. Japanese company Metaplanet saw a staggering 4,800% surge in its share price after unveiling its Bitcoin holdings in 2024, though its valuation has since cooled. Likewise, US-based Semler Scientific experienced a 30% boost after adding BTC to its reserves. However, companies like DeFi Development Corporation and Upexi—a Nasdaq-listed supply chain firm that recently announced a Solana treasury—are charting a new path by embracing cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin. Institutional Confidence in Solana Grows Solana’s increasing appeal to institutional actors shows its comeback narrative. Once plagued by outages and scalability concerns, the network has made major technical strides, including the launch of Firedancer, a second validator client built to enhance performance and resiliency. The blockchain’s revival has been further fueled by a surge in developer activity, thriving NFT ecosystems, and DeFi protocols that now command billions in total value locked (TVL). Combined with aggressive staking incentives and institutional validation from companies like DDC, Solana is increasingly positioning itself as a viable competitor to Ethereum in both financial and technological dimensions. DeFi Development Corporation’s $34.4 million Solana play marks one of the most significant treasury reallocations outside of Bitcoin in recent memory. As the firm transitions from real estate financing to blockchain-driven financial infrastructure, it sends a clear signal: the corporate treasury is being reimagined for the Web3 era. Whether other mid-cap companies follow DDC’s lead remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—crypto is no longer just a speculative asset class. It’s becoming foundational to how forward-looking organizations manage capital, create yield, and future-proof their balance sheets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 10:00:00

Both Bitcoin Open Interest & Spot Volume Have Shot Up In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of derivatives positions related to BTC that are currently open on all exchanges. Related Reading: Solana Whale Takes Out $52.7 Million In SOL From Binance: Bullish Sign? It would appear that the recent push toward recovery has led to a surge in speculative interest around the cryptocurrency, as the Open Interest has witnessed a notable increase. “BTC Futures Open Interest rose from $36.2B on Monday to $38.6B today, a +$2.4B increase in less than 36 hours,” notes the analytics firm. This significant rise in the metric has garnered attention from the community, but something that’s being talked about less is that the other side of the market has also seen a boost in activity. More specifically, the Trading Volume associated with the spot market has observed a sharp increase recently. The “Trading Volume” is an indicator that measures the total amount of the cryptocurrency that’s becoming involved in trading activities on the centralized exchanges. In the current case, only the Trading Volume associated with the spot platforms is of interest. This part of the Trading Volume has gone up from $2.9 billion to $8 billion, which suggests spot activity has almost tripled within less than 36 hours. “This shows a simultaneous influx of capital into the spot market alongside the OI spike,” says Glassnode. Generally, rallies that are built on high speculative interest tend to be unstable, because the underlying leveraged positions can be susceptible to easy liquidation. Related Reading: Cardano Breaks Out Of Triangle—27% Surge Incoming? While the rise in the Open Interest could be bad for the current recovery run for this reason, the fact that the spot Trading Volume has also shot up at the same time could be a more optimistic sign. Rallies require constant fuel to be sustainable, which comes in the form of an increase in the Trading Volume. Runs that fail to gather attention from the spot market tend not to last. With both the Open Interest and spot Trading Volume up right now, it remains to be seen how Bitcoin would turn out in the coming days. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued to add to its recovery during the past day as the asset’s price has now managed to touch the $91,000 level.

Announced in collaboration with TheBlock. — The International Chamber of Virtual Assets – — Good Game Group is bringing its vision for a globally interconnected gaming ecosystem to life with this bold new step. The launch of $GDGM is a strategic blend of content, community, and commerce—three pillars at the heart of Good Game’s operations. The token, built on the Avalanche blockchain, is set to unlock a wide range of experiences and opportunities for its holders, from exclusive gaming events to collectible digital assets and in-game rewards. The gaming industry is massive, with over 3.3 billion players worldwide and a market size exceeding $240 billion. Yet, it lacks a unifying platform that brings together the best of entertainment, community engagement, and digital asset ownership. Good Game Group is positioning itself to change that. With $GDGM, the company says it wants to create a seamless bridge between its physical Hubs—where the core Reality Show (reaching 1 billion impressions in 2025), live tournaments and content creation take place—and its expanding digital footprint. The token serves as both a utility and access mechanism, giving holders a range of exclusive benefits – VIP access to live tournaments and reality-show filming, behind-the-scenes content and influencer interactions, merchandise and collectible NFTs, staking rewards, gamified incentives, and more. TheBlock. as a Launchpad for Innovation Critical to this launch is the partnership with TheBlock, a Dubai-based virtual asset chamber designed to support startups and scale-ups in the blockchain space. Known for providing regulatory guidance, business development support, and access to investor networks, TheBlock. offers a fertile environment for the $GDGM token to thrive. Dubai’s rapid ascent as a leader in digital asset innovation is well-aligned with the ambitions of both Good Game and TheBlock. The city’s favorable regulatory climate and investment-friendly infrastructure have attracted global interest, and this collaboration is set to further solidify its status as a Web3 capital. “We built TheBlock. to empower blockchain projects like Good Game to launch and scale effectively,” said Farbod Sadeghian, Founder of TheBlock. “Dubai is becoming a global leader in digital assets, and we’re excited to support Good Game’s journey within our ecosystem.” In addition to TheBlock., the launch of $GDGM is backed by AMN Virtual Asset FZE and Pegasus Fintech Group. These strategic allies bring a wealth of expertise in compliance, infrastructure development, and ecosystem integration, ensuring that the token’s rollout is both secure and scalable. The choice of Avalanche as the underlying blockchain further enhances the project’s efficiency and speed. Known for its high-performance architecture, Avalanche allows near-instant transaction processing and minimal fees—essential for a token that will be used in high-volume, real-time gaming environments. The pre-token generation event (TGE) rounds for $GDGM are now open to select partners, with a public sale scheduled to launch later in April. Additional details, including a comprehensive Light Paper, are available on Good Game’s official website.",Information|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 10:00:23

Prices can swing dramatically, and investor emotions often follow suit. One popular tool many traders and enthusiasts watch closely is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this index made a significant move, jumping a substantial 25 points to hit 72, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone as of April 23rd. This shift from the previous day’s ‘Neutral’ territory signals a noticeable change in overall Crypto Market Sentiment . Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index So, what exactly is this index, and why does a 25-point leap matter? Provided by Alternative.me, the index is designed to gauge the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market. Think of it as a sentiment meter for digital assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Emotions can play a huge role in market movements. High greed can lead to irrational buying and potential bubbles, while extreme fear can trigger panic selling and capitulation. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried, potentially a buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Market is apprehensive, uncertainty prevails. 50-50: Neutral – Sentiment is balanced, neither overwhelmingly fearful nor greedy. 51-74: Greed – Market is optimistic, prices are rising, FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) starts to set in. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria is high, market might be overheating, potential for a correction increases. The recent move to 72 means the market has transitioned from a state of balance (Neutral) to one dominated by optimism and increasing levels of Greed Zone Crypto behavior. What Drives the Index? Breaking Down the Factors The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different market factors, aiming to provide a holistic view of sentiment. Understanding these components helps us appreciate why the index moves the way it does. Here are the key factors and their weightings: Factor Weighting What it Measures Volatility 25% Looks at the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market, but rapid upward volatility can also signal excitement. Market Momentum / Volume 25% Compares the current volume and market momentum to average values. High buying volumes in a rising market suggest greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media 15% Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, focusing on specific hashtags, sentiment analysis of posts, and how fast interactions are happening. High engagement and positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys 15% Polls users to get their sentiment (this factor is currently paused by Alternative.me, but historically contributed). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can signal fear (people fleeing altcoins to Bitcoin’s perceived safety) or greed (Bitcoin leading a bull run). Its interpretation depends on context. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and crypto. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while searches for “buy crypto” or specific coins could suggest greed. The combined movement of these factors is what caused the index to jump significantly to 72, reflecting a broad shift towards more optimistic, perhaps even exuberant, sentiment in the market. Entering the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does it Signal? A reading of 72 means the market is feeling confident, perhaps even overly confident. When the index is in the Greed Zone Crypto investors are generally feeling bullish. Prices are likely on an uptrend, and there’s a sense that things can only go up. This is often fueled by positive news, price rallies, and increasing media attention. While optimism isn’t inherently bad, high levels of greed can lead to: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): People see prices rising rapidly and jump in without doing thorough research, simply because they don’t want to miss out on potential gains. Overextension: Assets can become overbought, with prices moving up too quickly without healthy consolidation. Increased Risk of Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed (readings above 75) have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. When everyone is already bullish and invested, there are fewer new buyers to sustain the rally, and profit-taking becomes more likely. It’s important to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty, but it does provide valuable insight into the prevailing market psychology. How Can Investors Use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index? So, now that the index is showing high levels of greed, what should an investor do? This is where understanding Crypto Investing Strategy comes into play. Many experienced investors use the Fear and Greed Index as a contrarian indicator. The famous quote, often attributed to Warren Buffett, is to “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” When the index is high (Greed/Extreme Greed): This might be a time to exercise caution. It could signal a potential top or at least a period where the market is due for a breather. Some investors might consider taking some profits, reducing exposure, or holding off on new purchases. It’s a time to be disciplined and not get swept up in the euphoria. When the index is low (Fear/Extreme Fear): This is often seen as a potential buying opportunity. When others are panicking and selling, assets might be undervalued. However, buying during fear requires conviction and the understanding that prices could still fall further. Using the index as part of your Crypto Investing Strategy means combining it with other forms of analysis, such as technical indicators, fundamental analysis of projects, and overall market conditions. It’s one tool in the toolbox, not the only one. Looking at the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index Context While the index is called the ‘Crypto’ index, it is heavily weighted towards Bitcoin (BTC) due to its market dominance and influence. Therefore, the movement of the index to 72 strongly reflects sentiment surrounding Bitcoin specifically, which then tends to influence the broader altcoin market. A high Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index reading often coincides with strong BTC price performance and increased optimism across the entire crypto ecosystem. Considering the market context around April 23rd (when the index hit 72), Bitcoin had likely experienced positive price action leading up to that point, potentially fueled by factors like institutional interest, ETF inflows, or anticipation around events like the Bitcoin halving. These positive drivers would naturally contribute to increased market momentum and positive sentiment reflected in the index’s components. Challenges and Limitations While a useful tool, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has its limitations: Not a Price Predictor: It tells you about sentiment, not where the price will go next. A market can remain irrational and greedy for longer than you might expect. Lagging Indicator: Sentiment often follows price. The index might reach ‘Greed’ *after* a significant price run has already occurred. Subjectivity: Factors like social media and Google Trends can be influenced by noise or coordinated efforts, although the index attempts to filter this. Weighting: The specific weighting of factors is determined by the index provider and might not perfectly capture all nuances of market sentiment. Therefore, relying solely on this index for investment decisions is not advisable. It’s best used as a supplementary tool to confirm or challenge your own analysis. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Sentiment With the index sitting at 72, signaling strong greed, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Your Portfolio: Are you comfortable with your current level of exposure? High greed periods can be good times to rebalance or trim positions that have performed exceptionally well. Practice Caution with New Investments: Avoid making impulsive buys based purely on FOMO. If you’re looking to enter the market or add to positions, consider waiting for potential pullbacks or dollar-cost averaging. Stick to Your Strategy: If you have a long-term investment plan, don’t let short-term market euphoria derail it. Avoid taking on excessive risk just because the market feels bullish. Stay Informed: While sentiment is high, keep an eye on other indicators and fundamental developments that could signal a change in trend. The move into the ‘Greed’ zone is a signal to be mindful of market psychology and its potential impact on volatility. Conclusion: Navigating the Greed Zone The 25-point jump in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 72 marks a clear shift in Crypto Market Sentiment towards optimism and greed. While this reflects positive price momentum and confidence, it also serves as a yellow flag for savvy investors. High greed levels have historically coincided with periods of increased risk and potential corrections. Understanding the factors behind the index and using it as part of a broader Crypto Investing Strategy , perhaps as a contrarian signal, can help investors navigate these emotional market phases more effectively. As the market basks in optimism, maintaining discipline and a long-term perspective remains crucial.

The new card, Spend, is available via companion app Ledger Live, and allows Ledge r users to seamlessly make purchases using their digital holdings, which are converted to fiat currency. Moreover, users can fund the new debit card directly from self-custody. Ledger’s more than 7 million-strong user base can open the card instantaneously and without any new fees through the companion app. At present, fiat purchases can be made with the more than 150 million merchants across the globe that accept Mastercard. Mercuryo’s new cryptocurrency debit card represents a significant milestone Spend currently supports Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), although support will expand to stablecoins and other digital tokens in the coming months. Reflecting on the debit card’s launch, Petr Kozyakov, the Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Mercuryo, said: “We are delighted to launch Spend in Ledger, the preeminent non-custodial hardware wallet that has won a huge cult-like following among crypto enthusiasts, having made self-custody both accessible – and cool. Ledger, Mercuryo and Mastercard share the same vision of using state-of-the-art technology to deliver a seamless user experience, making this partnership a perfect fit.” Jean-Francois Rochet, Executive Vice President of Consumer Services at Ledger, highlighted the growing partnership between the two entities, stating that: “We are happy to see Mercuryo join the family of card programs compatible with Ledger, directly available and securely manageable from within Ledger Live. This is the second service provided by Mercuryo to Ledger Live users, after crypto purchase services. Card programs that offer the ability to integrate directly with self-custody give users the best possible experience. The Spend card, paired with the power of Mastercard’s global payments network, will bring Ledger users more choice to spend their crypto.” Users of the most popular hardware wallet will now be able to fund their accounts seamlessly, benefit from minimal and transparent fees, while enjoying the state-of-the-art security and the consumer protection afforded by Mastercard’s robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) protocols.

During the breakout, Bitcoin traded above $94,000 and briefly touched $96,000, marking one of its strongest performances of the year.

Cryptocurrency market maker and investor DWF Labs has invested $5 million in Mask Network, a decentralized social platform bridging web2 and web3, as part of its push to support user-owned internet technologies. In a Wednesday blog announcement , DWF Labs’ managing partner Andrei Grachev explained that the decision to back Mask Network comes as the project “has consistently demonstrated both vision and execution in this space.” Following the announcement, the price of MASK ( MASK ) rose 14% to $1.21, according to data from crypto.news price tracking page. Founded in 2018 by Suji Yan, Mask Network allows users to access web3 features like encrypted messaging, non-fungible tokens , and decentralized finance directly through existing social platforms. Before DWF Labs, the project also secured funding from investors like Animoca Brands, Digital Currency Group, and Longling Capital.

The attack, which lasted approximately 11 minutes, occurred just hours after his 29th birthday celebration. Yan suspects either a private key leak or an offline attack during the gathering, where his phone was briefly unattended.

According to data from crypto.news Immutable X ( IMX ), a Layer-2 network focused on gaming and NFTs, surged to an intraday high of $0.687 on April 23, nearly 100% higher than its lowest level this month. Its market cap has climbed to around $1.16 billion, and trading volume has exploded by more than 760% to $432 million, signaling a wave of new buying activity. The price rally was supported by a sharp rise in trading activity in IMX’s derivatives market. According to CoinGlass, open interest surged 96% overnight to $54.4 million, indicating a wave of new positions. While open interest includes both longs and shorts, the rising price suggests that the majority of traders are likely betting on further upside. The hype started building after Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson teased a “multibillion-dollar” partnership that’s apparently been in the works for two years. While details are still under wraps, just the hint of a major partnership was enough to get investors piling in, hoping for even bigger price moves once the news drops. You might also like: SEC ends investigation into Immutable with no enforcement action taken IMX’s recent rally is part of a broader surge in gaming-related tokens, with coins like Gala ( GALA ), Sandbox ( SAND ), Axie Infinity ( AXS ), and SuperVerse (SUPER) gaining between 5% and 20%. This surge comes against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 6% rally over the past 24 hours to nearly $94,000 today, which has helped lift the total crypto market cap back above $3 trillion. A supportive macro backdrop is adding to the optimism. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently hinted that tariff tensions with China may ease soon. Meanwhile, Paul Atkins’s confirmation as the new SEC chair has lifted sentiment across the crypto sector, with many anticipating a shift towards more accommodating regulatory policies. Finally, Immutable’s NFT ecosystem is showing signs of recovery. According to CryptoSlam data , NFT sales on the network rose 2.4% over the past 30 days to $24.6 million, while the number of active buyers and sellers surged by over 50%. IMX price analysis On the daily chart, IMX is now trading above its 50-day moving average, a sign that buyers are starting to take control. IMX price, 50-day EMA and MACD chart — April 23 | Source: crypto.news The MACD lines are also pointing upward, showing momentum is building, even though they’re still below the zero line. That usually means a bullish reversal might be on the way. Adding to that, the Supertrend indicator has flipped green, which is another bullish signal suggesting that the trend could be shifting in favor of the bulls. IMX Supertrend chart — April 23 | Source: crypto.news With this setup, IMX could soon test the key psychological level at $1 if it breaks above and holds that as support, there’s a good chance it could rally toward $1.6, which is the next major resistance zone. Analysts echo a similar outlook, poin t ing out that IMX has recently broken out of a descending broadening wedge, a pattern that often hints at a strong upside move. If this breakout holds, they believe IMX could potentially double in value from the point it broke out.

This move aligns with 10x Research’s prediction, which turned bullish on April 12. Since then, BTC has gained over 10%, with the next key resistance level between $94,000 and $95,000. A clean breakout from this zone could pave the way for Bitcoin to hit six figures, fueling further optimism in the market. Echoing this sentiment, Michaël van de Poppe highlighted Bitcoin’s strong uptrend, pointing to the breakout above $87,000 as the catalyst for testing the $92,000 to $94,000 range. He expects some short-term consolidation between $93,500 and $95,250 but remains bullish, suggesting the possibility of a fresh rally toward new all-time highs. Institutional Inflows Drive Bullish Sentiment Driving this bullish momentum are significant ETF inflows, with Bitcoin ETFs experiencing their best day since January 17, 2025, potentially attracting over $1 billion. 10x Research’s Money Inflows Indicator has also shown a sharp rise in institutional interest, with cumulative inflows reaching $146.3 billion since January. This growing confidence among institutional players is adding fuel to the rally. The futures markets have also seen a surge, with open interest climbing from $22 billion to $29 billion. This increase in leverage suggests that buying pressure remains high as investors become more confident in Bitcoin’s potential. The fading political tension, following Trump’s softer stance on tariffs and interest rates, further contributes to the risk-on sentiment. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K , Stablecoin Activity Still Lagging, But Hopeful Outlook However, analysts remain cautious, noting that stablecoin activity is still not at full strength. Stablecoins are often used to purchase cryptocurrencies , and their slower pace of minting could raise concerns about the sustainability of the rally. Nevertheless, stablecoin inflows have started to pick up, and any decrease in uncertainty could reignite liquidity across the board. Path to $100K: Institutional Demand Supports Rally With strong technical indicators, rising institutional inflows, and a favorable political climate, Bitcoin is well-positioned to break through resistance levels. A push above $95,000 could trigger liquidations, adding more fuel to the rally. Major institutions, including Fidelity, BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Bitwise, are actively accumulating Bitcoin, reinforcing its bullish outlook and increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin reaching the $100,000 mark soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A recent report suggests a potentially crucial development on the international stage: a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. While this might seem distant from the world of digital assets, the outcomes of a Trump Xi meeting can significantly influence investor sentiment and capital flows, ultimately affecting the cryptocurrency market impact . Understanding the Context: The US-China Trade War The backdrop to any meeting between these two leaders is the ongoing US China trade war . This conflict, characterized by tit-for-tat tariffs and strained diplomatic relations, has been a major source of uncertainty for businesses and investors worldwide. The trade dispute affects supply chains, corporate profits, and overall economic growth forecasts. Key aspects of the US-China trade situation include: Tariffs: Imposition of taxes on imported goods by both countries, increasing costs for consumers and businesses. Technology Restrictions: Bans and restrictions on technology companies (like Huawei), raising concerns about technological decoupling. Currency Manipulation Claims: Accusations regarding the manipulation of national currencies to gain trade advantages. Phase One Deal: A partial agreement reached earlier, aiming to de-escalate tensions but leaving many core issues unresolved. These tensions create a volatile environment for traditional assets. But how does this connect to the seemingly separate realm of digital currencies? How Geopolitics Influences Global Markets and Crypto Major geopolitical shifts, especially involving the world’s two largest economies, have a direct impact on global markets . When trade tensions rise or fall, it affects: Investor Confidence: Uncertainty makes investors risk-averse, often leading them to pull back from riskier assets. Capital Flows: Money moves towards perceived safe havens or regions less affected by the conflict. Economic Outlook: Trade wars can slow down global economic growth, impacting demand and investment. The cryptocurrency market impact is complex and debated. Some view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as uncorrelated assets or even digital safe havens during times of traditional market turmoil. Others see them as risk assets, similar to tech stocks, that suffer during economic downturns or increased volatility. Historically, periods of heightened US-China tension have sometimes coincided with increased interest in Bitcoin, potentially as an alternative store of value outside traditional financial systems tied to national currencies and trade policies. However, crypto markets also react to broader risk-on/risk-off sentiment, often moving in tandem with equity markets. Potential Scenarios and Their Cryptocurrency Market Impact A meeting between Trump and Xi in early May could lead to several outcomes, each with potential implications for the crypto space: Meeting Outcome Scenario Impact on Global Markets Potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact Positive Breakthrough (e.g., tariff reduction, new deal) Increased investor confidence, risk-on sentiment, potential equity market rally. Could lead to increased liquidity and speculative investment in crypto (risk-on). Or, if seen purely as a safe haven, potentially less demand as traditional markets stabilize. Mixed impact depending on dominant narrative. Status Quo (meeting happens, but no significant progress) Continued uncertainty, markets remain range-bound or react little to the meeting itself, focusing on underlying issues. Crypto market likely continues to trade based on its own internal dynamics and broader market correlation trends, without a direct strong catalyst from the meeting. Negative Outcome (e.g., talks break down, new tariffs threatened) Decreased investor confidence, risk-off sentiment, potential sell-off in equities and traditional risk assets. Could potentially increase demand for Bitcoin as a safe haven asset. Alternatively, a broader market sell-off could drag crypto prices down as investors liquidate assets across the board. Increased volatility is highly probable. The exact Bitcoin price reaction is difficult to predict, as it depends on the market’s interpretation of the news and the prevailing narratives (safe haven vs. risk asset). However, increased volatility around the time of the meeting and subsequent announcements is a reasonable expectation. Actionable Insights for Crypto Holders Given the potential for market movement triggered by developments in the US China trade war and the upcoming Trump Xi meeting , what can cryptocurrency enthusiasts do? Stay Informed: Monitor news regarding the meeting, particularly official statements and market reactions. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that geopolitical events add a layer of uncertainty. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk appetite. Consider Your Narrative: Are you holding crypto as a long-term investment, a speculative asset, or a potential safe haven? Your strategy might adapt based on your view of how these events affect crypto. Prepare for Volatility: Be aware that prices could move sharply in either direction. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news spikes. Look Beyond the Headlines: While the meeting is a catalyst, the underlying economic fundamentals and broader crypto market trends remain important. The intersection of global politics and decentralized finance is becoming increasingly apparent. Events once considered solely within the realm of traditional diplomacy now have tangible effects on novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in Global Markets The prospect of a Trump Xi meeting in May, reported by Zerohedge citing Reuters, highlights how interconnected global markets are. The outcome of discussions related to the US China trade war carries significant weight, potentially impacting everything from stock prices to commodity futures, and yes, the cryptocurrency market impact is a factor to consider. While predicting the exact effect on the Bitcoin price or other digital assets is impossible, staying informed about these major geopolitical events is crucial for anyone navigating the complex landscape of modern finance. Prepare for potential volatility and remember that the crypto market’s reaction will be a combination of direct influence, broader market sentiment, and its own unique dynamics.

According to recent data shared by on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, a clear divergence is emerging between long-term and short-term Bitcoin holders. Behind the Scenes: What Bitcoin Smart Holders Are Doing Right Now “If long-term participants continue increasing their positions, while short-term supply gets flushed out. This setup may serve as a constructive base for future price recovery.” – By @IT_Tech_PL pic.twitter.com/Wph6fKleXN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) April 22, 2025 While the long-term holders are quietly increasing their positions, the short-term holders, however, appear to be succumbing to fear and uncertainty, offloading assets in times of weakness. According to the full report , the Net Position Change metric for Long-Term Holders (LTH), defined as those holding Bitcoin for more than 155 days, has turned positive for the first time since the last market peak. This signals a notable shift in market sentiment among seasoned investors who are strategically re-entering the market. Their steady accumulation marks a departure from the distribution behavior seen in previous months, a pattern often interpreted as cyclical repositioning rather than reactionary moves. In contrast, Short-Term Holders (STH), those holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days, are continuing to capitulate. Their Net Position Change remains deep in negative territory. Historically, such divergence between long- and short-term investor behavior has served as a precursor to broader market recoveries. Rising Futures Activity and Liquidity Point to Renewed Confidence While on-chain data paints a picture of strategic accumulation, derivatives market behavior is also flashing bullish signals. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. reported a significant spike in futures market activity over the past three days, with traders opening Bitcoin positions totaling 57,000 BTC, valued at approximately $5.34 billion at the current price level. Over the last three days, positions totaling 57,000 BTC were opened in the futures market, worth $5.345B at the current rate. This is the largest liquidity increase in the past year. pic.twitter.com/VE08w0ZvhQ — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) April 23, 2025 This marks the largest liquidity influx in the futures market in over a year, coinciding with Bitcoin breaking through the $93,000 threshold. Supporting this surge, data from CoinGlass reveals that long positions on Bitcoin have surged by over 33%, reaching a 24-hour volume of $74.4 billion. Meanwhile, short positions have declined by 27.5%, dropping to $68.2 billion. Source: CoinGlass As of April 23, long positions now make up over 44% of all open interest. Total futures open interest has also hit a new high of $121.6 billion, led by platforms such as CME and Binance. This wave of liquidity and leveraged positioning indicates a renewed bullish conviction among traders. However, on the flip side, there is a heightened leverage that increases market fragility. Any sharp price correction could trigger a cascading series of liquidations, thereby exacerbating volatility. Still, this influx of capital points to a market preparing for a potential breakout, rather than retreat. Macroeconomic Tailwinds and Technical Breakouts Add Momentum Beyond investor behavior, broader macroeconomic developments have also contributed to Bitcoin’s recent rally. A significant contributing factor has been the perceived easing of tensions in the ongoing US-China trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments on April 22, describing the current tariff standoff as “unsustainable,” have sparked optimism for de-escalation. President Trump added to this sentiment by stating that tariffs on Chinese goods would be “substantially reduced,” while also reaffirming confidence in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. These geopolitical signals have helped restore investor confidence across risk-on assets, with the cryptocurrency market particularly responsive. As a result, Bitcoin climbed to as high as $94,000 on April 23, while the total crypto market capitalization surged by 6.7% to $2.94 trillion. Ether also saw a sharp rise, jumping by 13% in the same time frame. Source: Cryptonews Technical indicators are also aligning in Bitcoin’s favor. CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC noted a sharp reversal in Bitcoin’s futures funding rates, which had previously declined during the last correction. Bitcoin Funding Rates Highlight Weak Derivatives Demand “The current state of Funding Rates aligns with the broader market's sentiment, where participants exhibit hesitation, particularly after the rejection at $108K.” – By @ShayanBTC7 Link https://t.co/FaZFOgKvkN pic.twitter.com/km8pTtwUVx — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 8, 2025 Historically, a simultaneous drop in price and funding rates indicates a reduction in speculative froth. The recent surge in funding rates suggests renewed interest in long positions and may signal that market sentiment is shifting decisively bullish. At the broader market level, the total market cap has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish technical formation. After successfully retesting the upper resistance of the wedge at $2.6 trillion and breaching the 50-day simple moving average at $2.68 trillion, the market is now targeting the wedge’s technical projection of $3.12 trillion. Source: CoinMarketCap Before reaching that target, however, bulls must clear the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which form a significant resistance zone between $2.93 trillion and $2.94 trillion. Source: TradingView Another technical driver behind Bitcoin’s current surge is the short squeeze. In the last 24 hours alone, more than $624 million in crypto positions were liquidated, including $545 million in short positions. CoinGlass highlighted this as the largest short liquidation event of the year so far, surpassing the $426 million liquidated during a sharp rally on November 6. As it stands, Bitcoin’s climb back above $90,000 might just be the beginning. It is underpinned by multiple converging factors as mentioned above. Should these trends continue to align, the current price action may be setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next major upward leg, a potential challenge to its all-time highs.

43705582,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151794,1745407237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Noxtua Raises $92M: Breakthrough in German Legal AI with Sovereign Technology,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/noxtua-sovereign-legal-ai/,"In a significant development at the intersection of artificial intelligence and specialized industries, Noxtua , formerly known as Xayn, has successfully closed a substantial funding round. The company announced it raised $92.2 million (approximately €81.2 million) in a Series B round. This funding signals strong investor confidence in its unique approach to sovereign AI , particularly within the demanding German legal sector. The journey to this point began differently. Back in 2020, the company operated as Xayn, focusing on privacy-based, on-device AI for smartphones. This early experience provided valuable insights, eventually leading to a strategic pivot. The company shifted its focus to developing specialized AI for the legal sphere, culminating in the rebranding to Noxtua and this impressive legal AI fundraising achievement. Why is Sovereign AI Crucial for German Legal AI? One of the core tenets of Noxtua’s strategy is the concept of sovereign AI . This approach addresses a critical need in highly regulated fields like law, especially in countries like Germany. Unlike general-purpose AI models, often trained on broad, sometimes jurisdictionally mixed, datasets and hosted on international infrastructure, sovereign AI is designed to operate within specific legal and geographical boundaries. Dr. Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, CEO and Co-Founder of Noxtua, highlighted this necessity. He noted that foundational AI models developed in the U.S. or U.K. are primarily based on data and contracts from those countries. This presents significant challenges when applied to legal systems with different structures, precedents, and compliance requirements, such as those in Germany or France. Using non-sovereign models can lead to inaccuracies and potential legal compliance issues, particularly for government services or sensitive legal work. Powering German Legal AI with Unparalleled Data A key factor enabling Noxtua’s specialized approach is its strategic partnership with C.H. Beck, Germany’s leading legal publisher. C.H. Beck holds a unique position, effectively owning a comprehensive repository of German legal cases and judgments. This partnership grants Noxtua access to C.H. Beck’s entire archive and legal news wire, providing an invaluable dataset for training its AI. The legal AI product developed through this collaboration is dubbed Beck-Noxtua. It leverages a massive database containing 55 million documents, reportedly the largest legal database in the German-speaking world. This extensive and specific dataset is crucial for training an AI model that can accurately understand, analyze, and generate content compliant with the high standards of the German legal system. For any AI legal tech solution aiming for precision and trustworthiness in this market, access to such data is paramount. Building Secure Infrastructure for AI Legal Tech Beyond specialized data, the infrastructure hosting the AI is equally important for sovereignty and compliance. Noxtua has addressed this by partnering with Northern Data Group, a high-performance computing specialist based in Frankfurt. Beck-Noxtua will run as a sovereign AI on Northern Data’s cloud infrastructure, which is contained entirely within Germany. This decision is influenced by geopolitical considerations and the increasing desire to ensure sensitive legal data and AI processing remain within national borders. Running the AI on German-based infrastructure provided by Northern Data reinforces the sovereignty aspect, adding a layer of security and compliance assurance for customers, especially those in government or highly regulated industries. Investor Confidence in Noxtua’s Vision The $92.2 million Series B round was led by the strategic investor C.H. Beck itself, underscoring the publisher’s commitment to this joint venture and the future of AI legal tech . Additional new investors in this round include Northern Data Group, reinforcing the infrastructure partnership, Germany’s largest business law firm CMS, and global law firm Dentons. The participation of prominent legal firms highlights the perceived value and potential adoption of Noxtua’s technology within the legal community. Previous and existing investors, including Global Brain, KDDI Open Innovation Fund, and Dominik Schiener, also participated, indicating continued support for the company’s evolution. This broad base of strategic and financial investors reflects strong belief in Noxtua’s pivot and its potential to become a leader in German legal AI . Noxtua’s technology originated from research undertaken by its founders at reputable institutions like the University of Oxford and Imperial College London, and was further developed in collaboration with CMS. This academic and industry foundation underpins the technical capabilities of their AI model, which is a proprietary version of a transformer model specifically trained on legal contracts and data. Professor Dr. Klaus Weber, a member of the executive board at C.H. Beck, commented on the partnership, stating that Noxtua ‘s vision of a sovereign European legal AI aligns closely with C.H. Beck’s values and innovation strategy. He sees Noxtua as a cornerstone for the future. What Noxtua’s AI Can Do Noxtua claims its highly specialized AI is capable of performing complex legal tasks. This includes researching legal matters, analyzing legal documents, and even drafting legal documents. The crucial differentiator is the claim that it performs these tasks in a legally compliant manner, specifically for the German context, thanks to its training data and sovereign infrastructure. The company has already begun rolling out its solution to law firms and legal departments, indicating practical application and adoption of its technology. The partnership with C.H. Beck, described by CEO Lundbæk as effectively the ‘Thompson Reuters for law’ in Germany, provides not just data but also a strong distribution channel and credibility within the legal profession. Conclusion: A New Era for German Legal AI Noxtua’s successful $92.2 million legal AI fundraising round, coupled with its strategic partnerships with C.H. Beck and Northern Data, positions it as a key player in the emerging field of specialized, sovereign AI for regulated industries. By focusing specifically on the unique requirements of the German legal system and leveraging the vast data resources of C.H. Beck, Noxtua is addressing a critical gap that general-purpose AI models cannot fill. This development is a significant step towards providing accurate, compliant, and trustworthy German legal AI solutions, potentially setting a precedent for other countries with distinct legal frameworks.

Its recent price action has led the cryptocurrency to break out of a bullish formation, which could propel ADA to a key resistance zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Breakout From Multi-Month Downtrend, But Can ETH Hold $1,600? Cardano Breakout Eyes 27% Move On Tuesday, Cardano followed Bitcoin’s price jump and climbed to the $0.66 resistance, attempting to break above the key level for the third time this month. ADA has been in a downtrend since hitting its 3-year high of $1.32 in December 2024, retracing over 50% in the past four months. In March, the cryptocurrency surged 80% toward the $1.17 mark, driven by US President Donald Trump’s initial announcement of a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” comprised of ADA, XRP, and Solana (SOL). However, after the White House’s Crypto Czar, David Sacks, explained that the listed cryptocurrencies were used as an example of leading tokens, ADA’s price retraced to the $0.70-$0.80 range. Amid the late March retraces, Cardano lost the $0.70 mark, falling to the $0.50-$0-55 zone in early April. This month, the cryptocurrency has retested the $0.66 level but has been rejected twice. Today, it attempted to break this level again but was rejected a third time. Nonetheless, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that ADA has broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern amid its current performance. Cardano has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle formation throughout April, setting the stage for a 27% price move. After surging above the $0.63 mark, ADA broke out of the pattern, eyeing a surge toward the $0.77 resistance next. ADA Preparing For Key Retests Analyst Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency “is brewing,” as it’s moving within a four-month descending channel. ADA has bounced toward the upper boundary, which has served as resistance, each time it has retested the lower trendline as support. After the recent drop to $0.50, Cardano could retest the upper boundary soon, at around the $0.80 price range. Moreover, the analyst pointed out that the token is currently breaking out of an Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern within the descending channel, which could see the cryptocurrency surge toward the key resistance level. Another market watcher suggested that the cryptocurrency could be following its 2020-2021 pattern. According to the chart, once ADA broke out of its bear market rally levels, it reached a new cycle high, followed by a retest of the bear market rally as support. Related Reading: Analyst Says “The Clock Is Ticking” For XRP — Here’s Why After breaking out of the downtrend, it rallied toward its all-time high (ATH) of $3.09 in the coming months. “If ADA broke out this week and followed the same pattern as last cycle, it would be on track to hit a new ATH in the middle of August,” the analyst asserted. Meanwhile, Dan Gambardello affirmed that Cardano’s biggest resistance is at the $3 mark, “where a lot of people have regret for not selling last cycle.” The analyst forecasted that once ADA hits ATH levels, its pump “will probably pause in that general area with a lot of volatility, and then continue to $5. It’ll be like a crypto bus stop.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|ADA|ADA analysis|ADA breakout|ADAUSDT|bitcoin|btc|Cardano|Cardano analysis|crypto analyst|crypto investors|crypto market correction|Crypto Market Recovery|Crypto trader|Sol|xrp,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-23 11:30:25
43705870,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151793,1745407840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Amazing Grok AI Chatbot Now Sees the World with Grok Vision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grok-ai-grok-vision/,"The world of AI chatbots is moving fast, and staying updated on the latest capabilities is key, especially for those interested in the cutting edge of technology like cryptocurrencies and AI. A significant development just arrived from xAI: their Grok AI chatbot can now interpret and respond to visual information from your smartphone’s camera. This feature, dubbed Grok Vision, brings a powerful new dimension to how users interact with the AI, allowing it to ‘see’ and understand the physical environment around you. What is Grok Vision? The New Way to Interact with xAI Grok xAI Grok is stepping up its game with the introduction of Grok Vision. This capability means you can point your phone at an object, a document, a sign, or even a complex scene, and ask Grok questions about it. Imagine asking your chatbot, “What is this product?” or “Translate this sign,” simply by showing it through your camera. This visual understanding is a significant leap, moving AI chatbots beyond just text and voice input to interpreting the real world. It’s a feature we’ve seen emerge in other leading models, and its arrival for Grok makes the platform much more versatile for everyday tasks and inquiries. Grok Vision Availability and Other Exciting Features Currently, Grok Vision is rolling out and is accessible through the Grok app specifically for iOS users. Android users eager to use the vision feature will need to wait a bit longer, but xAI has indicated broader availability is planned. Beyond vision, xAI also launched other valuable features alongside Grok Vision: Multilingual Audio: Grok’s voice mode now supports multiple languages, making it easier for non-English speakers to interact using natural speech. Real-time Search: Also available in voice mode, this feature allows Grok to pull up the latest information from the web instantly to answer your spoken queries. It’s worth noting that while iOS users get Grok Vision initially, Android users can access the multilingual audio and Real-time AI search features, but only if they are subscribed to xAI’s premium SuperGrok plan. How Grok Vision Compares to Other AI Chatbots The ability for an AI Chatbot to ‘see’ is not entirely new. Competitors like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT have also introduced similar real-time vision capabilities. However, Grok’s implementation is part of xAI’s broader strategy to build a comprehensive AI that is both powerful and relevant, often leveraging its connection to the X platform for real-time information. Here’s a simple comparison of the approach: Feature xAI Grok Vision Google Gemini OpenAI ChatGPT Visual Input Yes (Camera/Image) Yes (Camera/Image) Yes (Image) Real-time Vision (Camera Feed) Yes (iOS initially) Yes Developing / Image upload Multilingual Audio Yes Yes Yes Real-time Search (Voice Mode) Yes Yes Yes (with plugins/features) Grok Vision places xAI’s offering firmly in the league of cutting-edge multimodal AI models, capable of processing and understanding different types of data inputs simultaneously. Grok’s Continuous Evolution: More Than Just Grok Vision The addition of Grok Vision is just the latest in a series of rapid updates for Grok AI . Recently, xAI introduced a ‘memory’ feature, allowing Grok to recall details from previous conversations, making interactions more personalized and coherent over time. Grok also gained a canvas-like tool, enabling users to create documents and even basic applications within the chat interface. These updates highlight xAI’s commitment to quickly developing and enhancing Grok’s capabilities, aiming to make it a comprehensive tool for information access, creation, and now, understanding the physical world. Conclusion: A Clearer Picture for Grok AI With the launch of Grok Vision, multilingual audio, and enhanced Real-time AI search, xAI is significantly expanding the functionality of its Grok chatbot. The ability for Grok to ‘see’ the world through your phone’s camera opens up numerous possibilities for practical applications, from identifying objects to translating text on the fly. While Grok Vision is currently an iOS exclusive, the rollout of other features to Android (for SuperGrok users) demonstrates a broader push for accessibility and power across platforms. As Grok continues to evolve with features like memory and creative tools, it solidifies its position as a competitive and rapidly advancing player in the AI chatbot landscape.

These assistants are revolutionizing how developers work, making certain startups incredibly valuable targets. Recently, buzz has surrounded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and its reported interest in acquiring players in this exact space. This isn’t just tech gossip; it reflects a significant strategic play in the competitive AI landscape. Why Was Anysphere Cursor Such a Hot Target for OpenAI Acquisition? Anysphere, the company behind the popular AI coding assistant known as Cursor, found itself at the center of acquisition talks, even reportedly with OpenAI. The reason is simple: phenomenal growth and user adoption. Sources close to the company indicate that Anysphere Cursor is experiencing such rapid expansion that selling is currently not on their agenda. Consider these points highlighting Anysphere Cursor’s appeal: It’s recognized as one of the leading AI-powered coding tools in the market. Its revenue growth has been exceptional, reportedly doubling every two months on average. The company’s average annual recurring revenue (ARR) is estimated to be around $300 million, according to sources. This kind of performance makes Anysphere Cursor a prime target for larger tech entities looking to quickly expand their AI offerings. Why Did Anysphere Cursor Turn Down Acquisition Offers? Despite approaches, including early discussions with OpenAI that CNBC previously reported, Anysphere Cursor chose not to pursue acquisition. Sources close to the company confirmed that Anysphere walked away from these talks. They also reportedly received and declined other acquisition offers. The primary reason cited for turning down these lucrative opportunities is the startup’s strong desire to remain independent. Instead of selling, Anysphere has reportedly been in discussions to raise significant capital, with Bloomberg reporting talks around a $10 billion valuation last month. This indicates a strategic choice to fund independent growth rather than integrate into a larger company. OpenAI’s Pivot: Targeting Windsurf AI Undeterred by Anysphere’s decision, OpenAI continued its search for an established AI coding tool startup. CNBC reported that OpenAI engaged with over 20 other companies in this space. The search reportedly became serious with Windsurf AI, another rapidly growing player in the AI coding market. Bloomberg recently reported that OpenAI made a significant acquisition offer for Windsurf, valued at $3 billion. While smaller than Anysphere, Windsurf AI is also demonstrating impressive growth. A source indicated Windsurf’s ARR is around $100 million, a substantial jump from $40 million just months prior. Windsurf AI is also gaining traction within the developer community and is designed to integrate with legacy enterprise systems, adding to its strategic value. What Drives OpenAI’s Interest in AI Coding Tools? OpenAI’s active pursuit of AI coding tools through potential acquisitions like Anysphere Cursor and Windsurf AI highlights its strategic priorities. Several factors likely contribute to this: Market Competition: Giants like Google with Gemini and China’s DeepSeek are intensifying competition, particularly putting pressure on the pricing of foundational AI models. Acquiring application-layer tools can open new revenue streams and solidify market position. Coding Benchmark Performance: Recent models from competitors like Anthropic and Google have shown strong performance on coding benchmarks, potentially making them preferred choices for developers in certain tasks. Acquiring a popular coding tool provides a direct channel to this user base. Accelerated Product Development: While OpenAI could build its own comprehensive AI coding assistant from scratch, acquiring an existing, popular product significantly accelerates market entry and user adoption. It leverages an established user base and proven technology. As Chris Farmer, partner and CEO at SignalFire, noted to Bitcoin World, speculating on OpenAI’s strategy, “They’ll be acquisitive at the app layer. It’s existential for them.” This suggests a belief among investors that M&A at the application level is crucial for OpenAI’s long-term survival and growth in a competitive landscape. The Future of AI Startups and M&A The intense interest in AI startups like Anysphere Cursor and Windsurf AI underscores the dynamic nature of the artificial intelligence market. Companies with strong products, rapid growth, and dedicated user bases are becoming prime targets for acquisition by larger players seeking to expand their ecosystems and fend off competition. Whether Anysphere continues its independent trajectory funded by venture capital or Windsurf AI becomes part of the OpenAI family, these events highlight the significant value being placed on specialized AI applications, particularly those that enhance productivity for crucial demographics like software developers. Investors and market watchers will continue to observe these moves closely, as they signal potential shifts in the power dynamics of the AI industry.

It's a high-conviction meeting of founders, investors, policy shapers, and enterprise leaders driving the frontiers of how decentralized infrastructure will transform identity, finance, and trust in the digital world. Dubai's role in Web 3.0 is increasingly recognized internationally. As the world tilts toward decentralized infrastructure, Dubai has emerged as the nexus where policy, capital, and innovation come together. With government-backed regulatory clarity, enterprise-grade adoption, and a thriving ecosystem of startups and investors, the emirate is fast becoming the capital of the decentralized ecosystem. The Unchained Summit is a significant event contributing to the momentum of the Web 3.0 movement in Dubai. The Dubai edition brings global architects of Web 3.0 together in one place, making Dubai a living laboratory for what the internet of value, trust, and autonomy really is.

We’re here to drive the conversation. Web 3.0’s growth hinges on infrastructure that can scale — it’s about throughput, cost-efficiency, and long-term sustainability. We’re proud to be at Unchained Summit, pushing the notion on sustainable blockchain designs,” said Abhijit Shukla , Founder of TAN Blockchain. Richard Ma , CEO and founder of Quantstamp, said, “I'm honored to be speaking at Unchained Summit, a premier event bringing together visionary leaders and innovators in the Web 3.0 ecosystem.

We're excited to be at Unchained Summit talking about what it takes to put real-world assets in the hands of real people,” said José F. Pereira , Executive Director, Own. “Web 3.0 moves fast—and the ones who show up shape where it goes. Unchained Summit brings together the doers, not just the talkers. At TBV, we’re here to back the founders turning big ideas into real traction,” said Tobias Bauer, General Partner, TBV. “Dubai is no longer just participating in Web 3.0, but it’s directing traffic,” says Sharath Kumar , Founder & CEO of Aeternum and organizer of Unchained Summit. “This is the one of the first real moments where we’re seeing decentralized technologies collide with institutional capital, national policy, and entrepreneurial energy—all in one city.” Unchained Summit’s official sponsors include: Platinum Sponsors : Mesh and Own Afterparty Sponsor : Consciousness Gold Sponsors : KoinBX , MOI Technology , and TAN Blockchain Silver Sponsors : AEON , BTSE , Mantle Network , and f(x) Protocol Bronze Sponsors : BlockchainX , Gresham International , EcoTrader , and Threshold Official Media Partner : Coin Edition With increasing interest in industries ranging from AI-driven gaming to tokenized assets, Unchained Summit indicates a wider industry transition: Web 3.0 is increasingly finding its way into mainstream enterprise planning. As a result, after its Dubai edition, Unchained Summit is set to make its India debut on 5th and 6th December 2025, reaffirming its commitment to bridge APAC, Middle Eastern, and European Web 3.0 and crypto ecosystems.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that he thinks policymakers will methodically debase the US dollar to manage debt payments. According to Pal, the dollar debasement will trigger a surge in global money supply and benefit risk assets like Bitcoin and crypto. “Everyone needs and wants a weaker dollar to service their dollar debts. No one wants it to move too fast (it blows up value at risk), but they need it lower over the next 12 months. This is the purest form of global liquidity and is the largest driver of global M2 currently. The US knows this too and is a key part of trade negotiations, especially with China.” To support his bullish stance on Bitcoin, the macro guru says that total global liquidity has an 87% correlation with BTC. He also points out that Bitcoin rallied hard five years ago due to currency debasement. “See 2020 for details. Recession and rising liquidity = stronger BTC.” Pal shares a chart showing that Bitcoin tends to follow the rise and fall of global liquidity, with the latter having a 12-week lead. “Maybe, just maybe, it was this easy all along. IF this works, it will definitively prove that liquidity is THE dominant factor still in markets. Not tariffs. Not politics, Not rates. Not (insert your narrative).” Source: Raoul Pal/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $93,570. Meanwhile, the US national debt stands at $36.214 trillion.

He compared the movement of Bitcoin (vs. gold) with Dogecoin and found that both are following nearly the same path. But this isn’t just about matching charts. It could be a sign of a Bearish Run. Two Different Assets, One Similar Pattern At first glance, Bitcoin and Dogecoin seem worlds apart. One is seen as “digital gold,” while the other started as a joke. But McGlone’s chart shows something surprising, their movements have been very similar for the past year. Both rose sharply at the end of 2023 and reached their peaks early in 2024. Since then, both have dropped and bounced around, following the same rhythm. Right now, both the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio and Dogecoin’s price are resting on a long-term upward trendline. This support level is like a safety net. But McGlone doesn’t think it will last much longer. He believes this isn’t a sign of a new bull market, just a bounce in a longer-term bear market. Recession Fears A Drop McGlone thinks things could turn worse soon, as his main reason is the U.S. stock market. Many people thought a recession would happen in 2023, but it didn’t. Now, McGlone believes the recession was only delayed, not avoided. He thinks it will still come, and when it does, risky assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin could drop sharply. His message is clear. The recent crypto price bounce might not mean a bullish rally. It could just be a short break before prices fall again. Dogecoin – Bitcoin Price Update Dogecoin has jumped nearly 10% in the past 24 hours and is now trading around $0.1827. The popular meme coin is now aiming for the $0.1885 level, but first, it needs to break above the $0.186 resistance. Looking at the charts, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above 83 , which suggests that Dogecoin is currently in an “overbought” zone. This usually means a short-term price correction could be on the way. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is also showing strength. It has broken past the $94,000 mark and is up nearly 6% in the last 24 hours.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 11:45:54

The firm recently met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss its reentry strategy, which includes a proposed $50 to $100 million investment in the local market. Chiliz Engages SEC Amid Shifting Political Winds According to a publicly available meeting request, Chiliz hopes to resume operations stateside by the time the U.S. hosts the next World Cup. The company is also exploring renewed partnerships with high-profile sports leagues like the NBA and NFL, who are reportedly open to launching fan tokens—pending greater regulatory clarity. On April 22, the same day as the SEC meeting, Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus posted a photo with Bo Hines, executive director of the Trump administration’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, hinting at parallel discussions with White House officials. During the SEC meeting, Chiliz argued that fan tokens should not be categorized as securities. The conversation centered on the tokens’ utility-based design and lack of profit expectation—a key point in the broader legal battle around whether digital assets fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. The regulatory fog that has clouded crypto’s U.S. future appears to be lifting, giving international firms like Chiliz room to explore expansion once again. Ecosystem Struggles to Regain Traction Despite its global recognition, Chiliz has faced headwinds over the past year. Data from DeFiLlama reveals the total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem has tumbled by 63.5%, from $17.8 million in December 2024 to just $6.5 million by late April 2025. This decline underscores the waning on-chain activity even as off-chain negotiations pick up pace. Its native token hasn’t fared much better. According to CoinMarketCap , Chiliz’s governance token has lost 67% of its value over the past 12 months, tracking the broader downturn in altcoins since Bitcoin’s 2024 highs. Still, the company’s high-profile partnerships with clubs like FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and Manchester City show the brand’s staying power in global sports. Chiliz had previously invested $80 million into U.S. partnerships back in 2021. But the twin forces of regulatory confusion and the FTX collapse led to a strategic retreat. With the 2026 World Cup looming and political tides shifting, Chiliz appears ready to return—this time with deeper pockets and a clearer playbook.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bears-are-in-trouble-in-the-crypto-market-millions-of-dollars-of-short-positions-became-liquid-here-are-the-details/,"The broad rally in the cryptocurrency market has triggered over $500 million worth of short liquidations in the past 24 hours, marking the largest short squeeze since October. Crypto Market Rally Triggers $500 Million in Short Liquidations as Bitcoin, Ether, and Dogecoin Soar The rally was led by Bitcoin (BTC), which climbed from $88,000 to above $93,500 during early Asian trading hours. Major altcoins followed suit, with Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) each gaining around 14%. Green dominated the top 100 coins by market cap, with Solana (SOL) and XRP gaining around 7%. The rally was partly driven by renewed optimism in macroeconomic conditions following comments by former U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting a softer stance on tariffs against China. Trump has indicated that he will be very lenient in upcoming trade talks and suggested that tariffs could be lowered if the US and China reach a deal. The unexpected spike in prices led to approximately $530 million in liquidations of leveraged short positions betting on crypto prices to fall. Data shows Bybit had the largest share at $234 million, followed by Binance with $100 million and Gate.io with around $70 million. The largest single liquidation was an Ethereum futures position on Binance worth more than $4.5 million. Liquidations occur when exchanges forcibly close leveraged positions due to insufficient margin. This is a mechanism intended to protect traders and the platform from cascading losses. Altcoin Momentum and the Memecoin Craze While large-cap tokens led the way, several altcoins and memecoins saw even stronger gains. SUI, UNI, and NEAR all rose by as much as 18%, while memecoin MOG jumped by a staggering 30%, continuing its trend of being a high-beta play closely tied to Ethereum’s market movements. *This is not investment advice.

43706451,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151788,1745409045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Washington Post Forge Crucial Partnership for ChatGPT News Integration,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-washington-post-deal/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, developments are happening at breakneck speed, influencing everything from coding to content consumption. For those tracking the bleeding edge of technology, much like following cryptocurrency markets, understanding these shifts is crucial. A significant announcement has just landed, impacting how millions access information: OpenAI and The Washington Post have struck a deal that will see the renowned newspaper’s content integrated directly into ChatGPT, bringing OpenAI Washington Post content to users. What Does the OpenAI Washington Post Deal Mean for ChatGPT News? This new collaboration fundamentally changes how users might interact with news via the popular AI chatbot. Under the terms of the partnership, ChatGPT will gain the ability to summarize and directly link to original reporting from The Washington Post within its responses. This move aims to provide ChatGPT users with access to high-quality, timely, and well-sourced information directly from a reputable news organization. For The Washington Post, the primary benefit lies in reaching ChatGPT’s massive audience, reportedly over 500 million users. This provides a vast new channel for distribution and potential reader engagement. OpenAI, on the other hand, gains access to premium content, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the ChatGPT News output it provides, addressing common concerns about AI generating inaccurate or unsourced information. Understanding the Broader Trend of AI Media Deals The partnership between OpenAI and The Washington Post is not an isolated event. It represents a growing trend of artificial intelligence companies seeking licensing agreements with major publishers. OpenAI has been particularly active in this space, having already inked deals with more than 20 news organizations globally. These AI Media Deals are seen as a way for AI developers to legally access and train on vast amounts of high-quality, copyrighted content, while publishers look for new revenue streams and audience reach in the digital age. However, these deals are not without controversy. While some publishers have embraced the opportunity, others remain wary or are actively challenging the use of their content. The most notable example is The New York Times’ lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging the unauthorized use of its copyrighted work for training AI models. This highlights the complex legal and ethical landscape surrounding AI’s interaction with existing digital content. The Implications of Publisher Partnerships with AI The decision for news organizations to enter into Publisher Partnerships with AI companies like OpenAI involves a delicate balancing act. On one hand, there’s the potential for significant audience exposure and a share of the financial benefits (though terms are often undisclosed, as is the case with The Washington Post deal). On the other hand, there are concerns about how AI summarization might impact traffic to their own sites, the potential for AI to replace traditional search and discovery, and the control over how their valuable content is used and presented by the AI. Key considerations for publishers include: Audience Reach: Gaining visibility among chatbot users who might not otherwise visit their site. Content Value: Ensuring their high-quality reporting is appropriately credited and valued. Monetization: Exploring new revenue models beyond traditional advertising and subscriptions. Control: Maintaining influence over how their brand and content are represented by the AI. These partnerships are still in their early stages, and their long-term impact on the news industry and the consumption of information remains to be fully seen. The Future of Digital Content in the Age of AI The integration of news articles into AI responses signals a potential shift in how users access and interact with Digital Content . Instead of navigating to multiple news websites or relying solely on search engines, users may increasingly turn to AI chatbots for summaries and direct links to information. This could have profound effects on website traffic, advertising models, and the perceived value of original reporting. As AI models become more sophisticated, the demand for diverse, accurate, and timely training data will only grow. This makes high-quality journalistic content incredibly valuable. Partnerships like the one between OpenAI and The Washington Post underscore the importance of reliable sources in combating misinformation and ensuring that AI models are built on a foundation of credible information. Ultimately, the success and sustainability of these AI-publisher partnerships will depend on finding models that benefit both parties, respect intellectual property rights, and continue to provide users with access to the comprehensive and nuanced reporting necessary for an informed society.

They added that Coinbase’s focus on Charlotte is in response to the city’s emergence as a key financial and tech center, making it a prime choice for expansion to address increasing customer and compliance demands. With a fast-growing population and a highly skilled talent pool, Charlotte offers an ideal setting to support Coinbase’s long-term growth, the spokesperson said. Related: Coinbase Derivatives lists XRP futures Coinbase remains a remote-first company Coinbase has operated as a remote-first company since 2020, with existing offices in San Francisco and New York. “We are still a remote-first company; however, we have some roles globally that are in office due to the nature of the role and our focus on how we can best deliver for our customers,” the spokesperson said. They added that around 95% of Coinbase’s employees have the option to work from home, an office, or a mix. The bigger picture here is we’re making an intentional push to meet top talent where they are.

Drainer-as-a-Service Lowers the Barrier to Entry AMLBot’s April 22 report reveals a game-changer in the crypto threat landscape: drainers now operate on a drainer-as-a-service (DaaS) model. These malware kits are being leased for $100–$300 USDT, enabling nearly anyone to get into crypto theft. “Scamming no longer requires coding knowledge,” AMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk stated. There are now tutorials and mentoring online in communities, making it relatively easy to pivot from traditional phishing to crypto. Bold Criminal Operations Appear at Tech Conferences A few DaaS operators no longer hide. CryptoGrab is one of the entities that have stands at information technology exhibitions. Demchuk explains this brazenness due to lax cybercrime prosecution in areas like Russia. “Hacking is practically legal if it doesn’t target local citizens,” he said. Russian law enforcement is inclined to leave alone such players as long as they don’t target the post-Soviet area. A Safe Harbor in Russia for Cybercriminal Innovation KrebsOnSecurity and Cisco have already reported on how malware like ransomware and info stealers avoid targeting Russian-based systems. Geolocation checks and Cyrillic keyboard detection are standard practices to stay under Russian law enforcement’s radar. This permissiveness has allowed DaaS to flourish, with operations promoting themselves quite openly in Russian-language developer communities. Telegram and the Deep Web Facilitate Growth The majority of DaaS activity occurs within Telegram groups, clearnet forums, and deep web space. Telegram’s once hands-off policy made it a popular platform—though recent policy changes have pushed some players back towards Tor-based forums. Advertisements for drainer developers regularly appear in open Telegram chats, according to AMLBot’s OSINT researcher. Although the advertisements are removed quickly by administrators, those who are interested are already engaged. Drainer Threat Growing Year on Year Scam Sniffer estimates that drainers have stolen $494 million in 2024—a 67% growth compared to 2023. Meanwhile, Kaspersky documented a growth of online drainer infrastructure from 55 in 2022 to 129 in 2024. As the DaaS model matures, analysts warn that growing numbers of non-technical actors will adopt the crypto crime space, expanding the risk to investors and platforms alike.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-23 11:55:34

The session, titled ""Seamless Transactions: The Next Leap for Digital Payments,"" focused on interoperability, user experience, and the infrastructure gaps limiting wider adoption of digital asset payments. Panelists included Pakning Luk , Director of Strategy at Paydify; Yam Ki Chan , VP of APAC at Circle; and Stefano Sanabria , Director at Alea Research. Luk noted a growing disconnect between user expectations and the current state of blockchain payment infrastructure. ""Users don't want to think about wallets, chains, or conversions — they just want to pay with what they already have,"" Luk said. ""But on the merchant side, the reality is still far too complex, with fragmented tools and a lack of standardization stalling meaningful adoption."" According to data from the Onchain Report , 31% of users cited limited merchant acceptance as a barrier to using digital assets, while 26% noted a lack of trusted payment service providers. These pain points, combined with ongoing issues around cross-chain compatibility and manual wallet address entry, underscore the need for streamlined and standardized solutions. Paydify , which launched earlier this week, offers a plug-and-play gateway designed to simplify digital asset payment acceptance for merchants. Through a single integration, businesses can receive payments from any supported wallet or blockchain, with instant settlement in stablecoins and no transaction fees. Existing integrations include Bitget Wallet, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet, with initial pilots launched across physical retail and online commerce. The company plans to scale across key global industries, including e-commerce, travel, Web3-native platforms, and more, as part of its mission to establish a universal acceptance layer for digital asset transactions.

As major altcoins show potential for growth, Ethereum , Solana , and XRP are gaining attention. The buzz around these digital assets suggests a shift in market dynamics. This article explores which coins may be on the verge of a surge. Ethereum: Recent Trends and Current Price Dynamics Ethereum price movement saw a monthly drop of 10.62% and a six-month decline of 29.29%, while a one-week jump of 12.89% highlighted short-term recovery. The history reflects a period marked by volatility and mixed signals, where short-lived gains have not countered an overall downtrend. A steady fluctuation indicates a battle between momentum and broader bearish pressure that has shaken investor confidence. Trading now occurs within a range of $1538 to $2325.85. Key resistance levels are found at $2829.45 and $3616.37, while supports stand at $1255.61 and $468.69. RSI at 55.46 shows balance, suggesting traders may look to exploit moves between these levels as a new trend takes form. Solana Price Movements: Recovery Amidst Market Volatility Solana posted a 13.57% price increase over the last month while recording a 14.87% decline over the past six months. The recent rise suggests increasing investor interest, indicating potential short-term recovery after a prolonged bearish period. Price dynamics show a shift from previous downtrends towards a more stable position, as the asset adjusts to current market conditions. Currently, Solana trades between approximately $97.94 and $165.67, with support near $71.30 and resistance around $206.76. Bulls are gaining momentum, reflected by a one-week gain of 19.64% and an RSI close to 65, yet the trend remains unclear. Traders may look to buy near support levels, while they should keep an eye on potential breakouts at resistance. XRP Price Dynamics: 6-Month Surge and Key Price Levels in Focus XRP experienced an 8.85% decline over the past month while recording a massive 317.93% increase over the last six months. The coin has shown volatile behavior recently but achieved significant gains over the longer term, indicating a strong recovery. Price movements reflect an overall upward trend despite short-term pullbacks. This performance highlights solid progress for investors who remained through the fluctuations. Currently, XRP trades between $1.66 and $2.77, with a clear support level around $1.23 and another near $0.11. Resistance is noted at $3.45 and again at $4.56. Market indicators show a balanced situation with slightly positive momentum and an RSI of 56.18. Trading ideas suggest buying near support levels and taking profits as the price approaches the first resistance level. Conclusion As Bitcoin remains below $90,000, attention turns to other cryptocurrencies. ETH shows potential for growth due to strong development and adoption. SOL 's network performance and innovations position it as a notable contender. XRP might rise, driven by ongoing legal clarity and partnerships. Each coin has distinct strengths, which could lead to significant gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Businesses are increasingly turning to crypto not just as a trend, but as a superior alternative to fiat currencies. Why are businesses accepting crypto payments? How increase your business income by 13%* Which Crypto Payment Gateway to Choose in 2025 Why is NOWPayments the payment gateway your business needs? According to Chainalysis , the total global cryptocurrency transaction volume reached $15.8 trillion in 2021, up from $2.3 trillion in 2020 — a 567% increase year-over-year, driven largely by retail and commercial adoption. Although the market experienced corrections since then, stablecoins and blockchain payments continue to demonstrate steady growth and use in real-world transactions.

Crypto, especially on low-fee networks like TRC-20, can reduce transaction costs by up to 90%. Faster Settlements: Fiat payments, especially across borders, can take days. Crypto payments are typically confirmed in minutes — or even seconds on certain blockchains. Global Access: Crypto payments are borderless. Whether your customer is in Brazil or Japan, they can pay instantly without currency exchange hassles. Security & Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures immutable transaction records and reduces fraud risks, giving merchants peace of mind. New Market Segments: Accepting crypto can attract younger, tech-savvy customers and international buyers who prefer decentralized finance options. As digital commerce grows, embracing crypto payments is no longer an edge — it’s becoming a necessity. With platforms like NOWPayments , businesses can easily start accepting crypto while enjoying auto-conversion to fiat, stablecoin payouts, and low-fee transactions. Why are businesses accepting crypto payments? In recent years, many businesses accepting crypto payments have recognized the benefits of crypto as a viable payment option. By accepting payments in cryptocurrency, they can tap into a growing customer base that prefers bitcoin payment and other cryptocurrencies as payment. This shift allows merchants to accept payments without the constraints of traditional payment methods, such as credit card payments or fiat currencies that often involve high transaction fees. Furthermore, global crypto adoption enables merchants to send crypto and hold crypto seamlessly across borders, making crypto transactions more efficient. As businesses look to accept new payment options, they are increasingly turning to crypto processing solutions that facilitate crypto payments as a business. By embracing this innovative approach, merchants see crypto payments as a way to enhance their financial flexibility and cater to a tech-savvy clientele. How increase your business income by 13%* Switching from traditional payment systems to NOWPayments — and specifically using USDT deposits on the TRC-20 network — can significantly boost your bottom line. Here’s how: seeing strong demand for crypto payments across businesses of all sizes, NOWPayments has reduced the average fee for USDT TRC-20 deposits from $4 to just $1 .

It’s pure operational efficiency — turning savings directly into profit. *Actual savings may vary depending on transaction volume and network conditions. Which Crypto Payment Gateway to Choose in 2025 As we look ahead to 2025, choosing the right crypto payment gateway is crucial for business owners wanting to accept Bitcoin and other digital assets. The landscape of accepting cryptocurrency is rapidly evolving, with numerous options available for small businesses to integrate crypto payments. When evaluating top crypto payment processors, consider their ability to accept cryptocurrency payments from a variety of crypto assets, as well as the ease of use for customers who use a crypto wallet or pay with crypto directly. Additionally, examine the payment process and whether the provider requires KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, as this can affect user adoption. One of the most comprehensive and business-friendly solutions is NOWPayments — a gateway that supports over 300 cryptocurrencies, offers low fees starting at just 0.5%, and requires no KYC for onboarding. With features like fiat conversion, non-custodial services, and seamless integration with major platforms, NOWPayments is the best crypto payment gateway for 2025. Understanding the pros and cons of accepting Bitcoin and crypto payments is essential; while accepting cryptocurrencies can enhance your business’s appeal and grow your business, there can be challenges such as volatility and regulatory compliance.

43706784,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151787,1745409651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bold Move: OpenAI Exec Expresses Interest in Buying Google Chrome Amid Antitrust Trial,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-wants-google-chrome/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, where giants constantly jockey for position, a recent revelation has sent ripples through the industry, catching the attention of anyone interested in the future of digital interaction and data. An executive from AI leader OpenAI has publicly stated the company’s interest in acquiring Google’s widely used Google Chrome browser, should the opportunity arise. This bold declaration was made during Google’s ongoing Antitrust Trial , adding a fascinating twist to the proceedings. Why Would OpenAI Want Google Chrome? The statement came from Nick Turley, a chief at OpenAI, while testifying during the Google Antitrust Trial . According to reports from Bloomberg, Turley explained that acquiring Chrome would enable OpenAI to “offer a really incredible experience” and “introduce users into what an AI Browser looks like.” This suggests a strategic vision by OpenAI to integrate its artificial intelligence capabilities directly into a primary user interface for the web. Key reasons behind this potential interest: Direct User Access: Control over a major browser provides a direct channel to millions of users, bypassing the need to rely solely on third-party platforms or operating systems. AI Integration: Building an AI Browser from the ground up, or integrating AI deeply into an existing popular one like Chrome, could redefine web browsing. Imagine AI features seamlessly assisting with search, content summarization, task automation, and personalized experiences directly within the browser window. Data and Feedback Loop: A browser offers a rich source of data on user interaction patterns, which could be invaluable for training and improving AI models. Context of the Antitrust Trial Turley was called to testify by the Justice Department as part of the extensive Antitrust Trial against Google. The trial aims to determine necessary modifications to Google’s business practices after a judge ruled the company had monopolized the online search market. One significant request from the Justice Department has been that Google be potentially forced to divest certain assets, including its Chrome browser. This is the specific scenario that prompted OpenAI’s executive to voice their interest, highlighting the potential ripple effects of the trial’s outcome on the broader tech landscape and potential Tech Acquisition opportunities. Has OpenAI Explored Building an AI Browser Before? Yes, reports indicate that OpenAI has indeed considered developing its own web browser to compete in the market currently dominated by Google Chrome . This isn’t just speculation; the company took a concrete step by hiring former Google developers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher several months ago. These individuals are notable as they worked on the original Chrome project, bringing valuable expertise and insight into browser architecture and development to OpenAI. This hiring decision further underscores OpenAI’s serious contemplation of entering the browser space, whether through building or potential Tech Acquisition . What Does a Potential Tech Acquisition of This Scale Mean? While currently hypothetical, the idea of OpenAI acquiring Google Chrome represents a massive potential shift in the tech ecosystem. It moves beyond typical AI model development into foundational internet infrastructure. Such a Tech Acquisition would position OpenAI not just as an AI research lab or service provider, but as a direct competitor to major tech companies in core user software. It highlights the increasing convergence of AI and fundamental computing platforms. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Any acquisition of this magnitude would face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators globally. Integration Complexity: Merging OpenAI’s AI focus with Chrome’s vast codebase and user base would be technically challenging. Google’s Stance: Chrome is a core part of Google’s ecosystem; it’s highly unlikely Google would willingly sell it unless forced by regulators. The testimony from the Antitrust Trial provides a rare glimpse into the strategic thinking of major tech players and the potential, albeit conditional, interest in significant asset shifts like the acquisition of Google Chrome . OpenAI’s ambition to create an AI Browser is clear, and while buying Chrome is contingent on the trial’s outcome, it reveals the company’s long-term vision for embedding AI deeply into the user’s internet experience.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-23 12:10:00

A China-based startup, Sand AI, has recently unveiled an impressive openly licensed video-generating AI model named Magi-1. While praised by figures like Kai-Fu Lee, the founding director of Microsoft Research Asia, testing reveals a concerning practice: apparent AI censorship. Understanding Sand AI and the Magi-1 Model Sand AI’s Magi-1 model is designed to generate videos by predicting sequences of frames. The company claims it offers high-quality, controllable footage with improved physics accuracy compared to other open models. This development in video generation AI is significant, pushing the boundaries of what AI can create visually. However, accessing the full capabilities of Magi-1 presents a challenge for most users. The model is massive, requiring between four and eight high-end Nvidia H100 GPUs to run, making it impractical for standard consumer hardware. Consequently, Sand AI’s hosted platform becomes the primary access point for testing Magi-1. AI Censorship Discovered on Sand AI Platform Testing conducted by Bitcoin World on Sand AI’s hosted platform quickly uncovered limitations. The platform requires a ‘prompt’ image to initiate video generation, but not all images are permitted. The filtering mechanism appears to be robust, blocking specific politically sensitive content at the image upload level, regardless of file names. Images blocked by Sand AI include: Xi Jinping (China’s leader) Tiananmen Square and Tank Man (symbols associated with the 1989 protests) The Taiwanese flag Insignias supporting Hong Kong liberation Attempting to upload these images results in an error message from the platform, indicating a likely prohibited image. China AI Regulations and Industry Practices Sand AI is not alone in implementing such filters. Hailuo AI, a generative media platform from Shanghai-based MiniMax, also blocks images of Xi Jinping. However, Sand AI’s filtering seems more extensive, as Hailuo reportedly allows images of Tiananmen Square. This practice is rooted in China’s stringent information controls. A 2023 law mandates that AI models must not generate content that ‘damages the unity of the country and social harmony’. This broad mandate can encompass content that challenges or contradicts the government’s official historical and political narratives. To comply, Chinese AI startups often employ censorship methods, including prompt filtering or fine-tuning models to avoid generating sensitive content. Interestingly, while Chinese models tend to heavily filter political speech, reports suggest they often have fewer filters for pornographic content compared to their American counterparts. A recent report highlighted that some video generators from Chinese companies lack basic safeguards against generating non-consensual nude images. The Implications of Sand AI’s Filtering The discovery of AI censorship within Sand AI’s platform raises questions about the true openness and accessibility of their Magi-1 model, despite its openly licensed nature. While the core model might be open, its practical usability via the company’s hosted platform is restricted by these political filters. This highlights the tension between open-source principles and the regulatory environment in which companies operate. For developers and users interested in leveraging advanced video generation AI, these restrictions can limit creative expression and the ability to explore certain themes. It underscores the varying degrees of freedom and control present in AI development across different geopolitical landscapes. In conclusion, while Sand AI’s Magi-1 represents a notable technical achievement in video generation AI, the apparent AI censorship on its hosted platform serves as a stark reminder of the regulatory complexities and content restrictions faced by technology companies operating within China. This practice, while perhaps necessary for the company’s survival in that market, impacts the accessibility and potential applications of their advanced AI technology for a global audience.

This April, Bitcoin dominance crossed the 64% mark, meaning that the market cap of Bitcoin accounts for nearly two-thirds of the entire crypto market capitalization. While some still wait for the altcoin season to begin, others state this cycle is different, and there will probably be no altcoin seasons ever again. Bitcoin dominance is nearing 64%, last seen at the peak of the 2020 bear market. This isn't just a $BTC move. Its capital rotating out of alts. Historically, this level has been a turning point. If it breaks 66%, alts might bleed harder before a true altseason. Watch closely👀 pic.twitter.com/5EudWiQkJX — nordin.eth (@nordin_eth) April 17, 2025 What does the Bitcoin dominance metric indicate? Bitcoin dominance is a metric indicating the share of Bitcoin in the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization. When Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency in the world, it had a 100% share. As soon as other cryptocurrencies began to emerge, Bitcoin’s dominance began to decrease. However, Bitcoin has always been the most expensive crypto, so it took years for the rest of the crypto market to gain a substantial share of the market. 2017 was a transformative year, when the rise of Ethereum-based tokens and especially an ICO boom dragged Bitcoin dominance from 96% down below 40% by 2018. From 2018 to 2020, Bitcoin’s share has been volatile, moving in high amplitude. In the first half of 2021, Bitcoin dominance dropped from 70% to around 40% in the wake of the rise in the DeFi market. The year also saw an NFT market surge, and most NFTs were built on Ethereum and BNB Chain. It may seem that the Bitcoin dominance chart is rather a reflection of the market state, but it is also an indicator used by traders and investors to figure out the market sentiment and correct their trading/investment strategies. For instance, declining Bitcoin dominance was seen as a crypto rally sign, as in the bull market, traders and investors were eagerly experimenting with altcoins. High Bitcoin dominance was usually seen as a sign of a bear market, a period when crypto investors preferred to stick with the best store of value, Bitcoin, rather than invest in riskier altcoins. However, some experts think that this cycle will change the altcoins’ role in the crypto market. You might also like: CoinW interview: Bitcoin dominance grows as altcoin market struggles How soon is the altcoin season? “Bitcoin, not crypto,” — a motto especially popular among Bitcoin maximalists, is now reflecting a new trend in crypto investment. Scott Melker, a host of the Wolf of All Streets, has referred to a model in which investors eagerly buy both Bitcoin and altcoins as “a washing machine,” in which value is endlessly circulating between Bitcoin and altcoins with gradual inflows of new money. In an interview with Crypto.news, CoinW CSO Nassar Achkar claims that this cycle is different. Instead of buying the dip to sell high, investors buy Bitcoin whenever they can and never sell it. More than that, fewer people are eager to exchange Bitcoin for altcoins. The idea of Bitcoin as a reserve currency has been boosted by governments and corporations and is spreading among retail investors. Governments and corporations themselves became massive Bitcoin buyers. They spend millions of dollars to buy bitcoins. These dollars are new for the market, not some gains from the altcoin trading. This new money is staying in Bitcoin, as no one sells it. That’s an outlook that explains the growing Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin gets pumped with new fiat inflows, while altcoins’ share is slowly fading away. As Melker outlines it, “altcoins are bleeding against BTC because holders are selling to pay bills, not to rotate into Bitcoin.” The Cryptoverse CEO, Benjamin Cowen, noted that the Bitcoin dominance is 69% if we exclude stablecoins. When asked about the altcoin season, he just shared a chart indicating that the altcoin/BTC pairs should decline even more before they bounce back and start growing. I think #ALT / #BTC pairs need to go down before they can go up pic.twitter.com/ULAodEPGp2 — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) April 16, 2025 Some believe the altseason will be on time. Although the logic of those who say that altcoins will no longer get massive is pretty solid, belief in altcoins is not pointless. The thing is that we can’t know what will happen with the crypto market in the next couple of years. The new trends like DeFi or NFT booms in the past may accelerate the altcoin market and unleash a new altseason. It depends on new technologies and the mass appeal of those technologies. It’s not the first time that Bitcoin dominance is on the rise. It was happening in 2018 and the first half of 2019, but then it turned out that altcoins are anything but dead. Without a doubt, Bitcoin is the word of this season. It doesn’t cast a shadow on a sudden gold price rally.

In an April 23 X post, Saylor wrote that “SEC Chairman Paul Atkins will be good for Bitcoin.” The statement follows Atkins’ swearing-in as the 34th chairman of the SEC on April 21. Source: Michael Saylor Blue Macellari, the head of digital assets at investment firm T. Rowe Price, also commented positively on Atkins’ swearing in during a recent Bloomberg interview . She seemed hopeful and recognized a change in how the SEC has acted under the new administration, particularly with crypto-related information, including “close to six or seven roundtables” with industry professionals. She said: “I think that that’s gonna feed into the ability to make thoughtful and considerate policies.” Related: SEC and feds charge man over $200M crypto trading scheme Who is Atkins, and what does he mean for crypto? Accolades from representatives of the crypto industry readily followed Atkins’ appointment by US President Trump in late 2024 . Bitwise Asset Management general counsel Katherine Dowling said at the time that he is a “great choice,” and Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he “will bring common sense back to the agency.” Not everyone was happy with the choice. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said during Atkins’s nomination hearing that he had had “staggeringly bad judgment” in his role as a SEC commissioner leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Atkins served at the agency from 2002 to 2008. She also raised an issue with his consulting firm, Patomak Global Partners, which had advised the crypto exchange FTX before its 2022 collapse. Warren said: “Your clients pay you north of $1,200 an hour for advice on how to influence regulators like the SEC, and if you’re confirmed, you will be in a prime spot to deliver for all those clients who’ve been paying you millions of dollars for years.” Related: SEC says it won’t re-file fraud case against Hex’s Richard Heart Atkins accused of bias Warren also sent a letter to Atkins in late March, stating that he should expect questions about his potential role at the agency due to his ties to the crypto industry through Patomak. Before being appointed, Atkins revealed a personal and family financial portfolio worth more than $327 million, according to a public ethics filing released ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing. Similarly, Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, David Sacks, filed a notice in early March suggesting that his venture capital firm sold more than $200 million in crypto and related stocks ahead of assuming his role.

According to Robert Kiyosaki , silver is a highly attractive investment in 2025 due to its substantial upside potential. The prominent investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad’, took to X on April 22 to, as he put it, bring ‘GOOD NEWS for people with not much money.’ In the post, the influencer revealed his intent to buy more Silver Eagles – America’s official silver bullion coins – while reminding his followers that their ‘profit is made when you buy…. Not when you sell.’ The author reiterated that the precious metal is significantly below its all-time high (ATH) and forecasted it ‘will 2x in 2025,’ thus reaffirming his previous price target of $70 . Silver YTD price chart. Source: TradingView Indeed, as silver is changing hands at $32.95 at press time, after a 14.10% year-to-date (YTD) rise, investing $1,000 now in the commodity would yield $1,124.43 in profits by the end of 2025, should Kiyosaki’s target be met. https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1914738298356178987 Kiyosaki warns against investing in Gold after latest rally Within the same X post, the author made a rather uncommon comment, essentially describing gold , one of his favored assets, as an unwise buy due to its staggeringly high price. On April 22, the yellow metal made history when it crossed above $3,500. However, the issues with holding such a valuation became immediately apparent as the commodity retraced to its press time price of $3,332. Elsewhere, the tweet did not contain an argument against buying Kiyosaki’s third most favored investment, Bitcoin ( BTC ), as the influencer simply stated he isn’t buying more since he already owns enough. Starting on April 20, BTC entered a powerful rally , detaching from the struggling stock market . Still, much like gold, Bitcoin corrected after crossing above $95,000 and is changing hands at $93,688 at press time, thus demonstrating it has some way to go before the big test at $100,000.

43707400,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151785,1745410856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Character.AI Launches AvatarFX: AI Video Raises Deepfake Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/character-ai-avatarfx-video/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, especially within the realm of AI chatbots and generative models, Character.AI, a prominent platform for interacting with AI personalities, has made a significant announcement. The company is venturing into AI video generation with its forthcoming model, AvatarFX. This move is particularly interesting for those following the intersection of AI and digital content creation, including its potential impact on various online spaces, which often overlap with cryptocurrency and web3 communities exploring new forms of digital identity and interaction. What is Character.AI’s AvatarFX? Character.AI’s new offering, AvatarFX, is a video generation model designed to bring the platform’s diverse range of AI characters to life visually. Currently in closed beta, AvatarFX allows users to create animated videos of their chosen characters. Unlike some other video generation models that rely solely on text prompts, AvatarFX distinguishes itself by also enabling video creation from existing images. This means users could potentially animate photos, adding a layer of complexity and versatility to the tool. How Does AvatarFX Compare to Other AI Video Generation Tools? When discussing AI video generation, models like OpenAI’s Sora often come to mind. While Sora is primarily known for its text-to-video capabilities, AvatarFX offers a broader input range, including images. This image-to-video functionality sets it apart, providing users with a different creative avenue – animating static visuals. This feature could unlock new possibilities for character animation and visual storytelling within the Character.AI ecosystem. Exploring the Potential of AI Chatbots with Video Character.AI is already a popular platform built around AI chatbots, allowing users to engage in conversational and roleplaying scenarios. The introduction of AvatarFX aims to enhance this experience by adding a visual dimension. Imagine chatting with an AI character that can now express itself through animated video, potentially making interactions feel more immersive and lifelike. This integration of video could deepen user engagement and create more dynamic character interactions. Addressing Concerns Around Deepfake Technology The capability to generate videos from images, especially photos of real people, immediately raises concerns about the potential misuse of deepfake technology. The technology to create convincing fake videos already exists, but integrating it into a widely accessible consumer platform like Character.AI could significantly increase the risk of malicious use. Users could potentially upload images of public figures or private individuals and create realistic-looking videos depicting actions or statements that never occurred. This highlights the ongoing ethical challenges associated with powerful generative AI tools. Safety and Ethical Implications for Character.AI Character.AI has faced scrutiny regarding safety issues on its platform previously, including serious allegations related to the harmful influence of its AI chatbots on young users. The introduction of a video generation tool, particularly one capable of animating images, adds another layer of complexity to these safety concerns. While Character.AI states it is implementing safeguards like parental controls, the effectiveness of such measures relies heavily on user adoption and vigilance. The potential for emotional manipulation, already a concern with text-based AI, could be amplified when combined with convincing visual elements created through AI video generation and deepfake technology. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of AI and Digital Interaction Character.AI’s launch of AvatarFX signals an exciting step forward in bringing AI characters to life through video. This development in AI video generation offers creative potential but also underscores critical ethical considerations, particularly concerning deepfake technology and user safety. As AI capabilities continue to expand, the industry faces the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation with robust safeguards to prevent misuse and protect users, especially in platforms popular with younger audiences. The evolution of AI chatbots into visually animated entities through tools like AvatarFX will undoubtedly shape the future of digital interaction, making the discussion around responsible AI development more crucial than ever.
