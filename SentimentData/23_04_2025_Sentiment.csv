With the increasing number of new blockchain initiatives launching, it’s becoming harder to keep track of those that will make waves in the market. Whether you’re looking for quick wins or long-term potential, one thing’s for sure: the blockchain space is packed with competition, and only the best will rise to the top. Today, we’ll dive into three standout projects—Qubetics, SUI, and Astra—and help you figure out which one might be the most imaginative play for your next crypto move. When it comes to choosing a crypto to invest in, it’s crucial to focus on those with strong, tangible use cases, backing from the right partners, and an innovative vision that can address real-world problems. Qubetics, SUI, and Astra all bring something unique to the table, and each one is making waves with its technological advancements. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these projects stand out and why they could be the top crypto to invest in for short-term gains. So, what’s the deal with Qubetics? How does it compare to the competition, such as SUI and Astra? And why should you be keeping an eye on the $TICS token presale? Let’s break it down and find out why the future of blockchain could be in the hands of these rising stars. Qubetics’ Unique Edge in Interoperability and Digital Finance Qubetics is dedicated to bridging the gaps between different blockchain networks, enabling seamless transactions, collaboration, and interaction for businesses, professionals, and everyday users across multiple platforms. The Qubetics network’s primary strength lies in its interoperability, enabling various blockchain ecosystems to connect in ways that were previously impossible. This opens up countless opportunities for decentralized applications (dApps), cross-border payments, and asset tokenization, with Qubetics playing the central role as the connecting hub. How Qubetics Solves Real-World Problems What sets Qubetics apart from other blockchain projects? While many of its predecessors have struggled with scalability, security, and user adoption, Qubetics is designed to address these issues head-on. The platform’s unique approach ensures seamless communication between blockchain systems, a feature that many projects have overlooked. By offering a decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) and advanced wallet features, Qubetics is well-positioned to cater to future demands in digital finance, particularly in cross-border payments —a growing pain point in today’s financial landscape. Additionally, the Qubetics ecosystem enables the tokenization of real-world assets, which will revolutionize the way businesses interact with blockchain technology, particularly in industries such as banking, real estate, and beyond. As companies seek more efficient ways to manage payments, investments, and assets, Qubetics provides the right framework to do so securely and effectively. Qubetics Presale – A Red-Hot Opportunity Currently in Stage 31 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has sold over 509 million tokens to more than 25,100 holders, raising more than $16.3 million. The presale is still ongoing, with the $TICS token priced at $0.1902. Analysts are predicting massive potential with a return on investment (ROI) of 425% at $1, 2527% at $5, and an incredible 7783% ROI at $15 after the mainnet launch. Analysts’ Predictions for Qubetics’ Future: Current $TICS Price : $0.1902 per token $TICS at $1 After the Presale : 425% ROI $TICS at $5 After the Presale : 2527% ROI $TICS at $15 After Mainnet Launch : 7783% ROI Analysts predict that $TICS will be valued between $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. This makes Qubetics one of the most exciting projects in the market today, with strong growth potential in the short term. Sui (SUI) Cryptocurrency: Stepping into the Spotlight with Game-Changing Updates Sui (SUI) is making significant strides in the crypto world, gaining attention from both mainstream media and investors alike. Recently, Canary Capital Group filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will track Sui’s spot price. This marks a significant step for the cryptocurrency, as it continues to demonstrate strong potential for adoption in traditional financial markets. Additionally, Sui is working on simplifying blockchain access by introducing Zero Knowledge Login and Sponsored Transactions, which will enable users to access the network seamlessly. These innovations are poised to make Sui a more user-friendly platform, helping it attract a broader base of users and solidify its place in the growing blockchain ecosystem. Astra Space’s Strategic Expansion: Rocket 4 Program Gets Boost from New Leadership and Defense Contracts Astra Space is positioning itself for future growth with significant developments in its Rocket 4 program. The company recently appointed Dr. Alan Weston, a renowned missile defense expert, to lead the development of Rocket 4. This is a crucial move as Astra aims to strengthen its capabilities for providing responsive space access. In addition to the leadership change, Astra secured a multi-million-dollar contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to support the development of its Rocket 4 program, including the expansion of its production facilities. This contract, valued at up to $44 million, signifies the government’s confidence in Astra’s ability to provide reliable and cost-effective launch services. Furthermore, Astra has now transitioned into a private company, completing its privatization process, which could offer the company more flexibility in its operations and long-term growth strategy. Interoperability – The Key to Blockchain’s Future The concept of interoperability is central to the success of blockchain technology. It refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and collaborate, enabling users to transfer assets and data seamlessly across various platforms. Interoperability enables the creation of decentralized applications that are not limited to a single blockchain, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and broadening the scope of blockchain’s potential use cases. Benefits of Interoperability in Blockchain: Cross-Chain Transactions : Users can transfer assets between different blockchains, enabling smoother transactions and reducing the need for intermediaries. Increased Scalability : Interoperability allows blockchain networks to scale more efficiently, handling larger transaction volumes without sacrificing speed or security. Enhanced User Experience : With interoperable systems, users can interact with various decentralized platforms using a single wallet or interface, streamlining their experience. In a world where blockchain is becoming an increasingly critical part of the financial ecosystem, interoperability is the key to unlocking its full potential. Projects like Qubetics are at the forefront of this trend, offering solutions that facilitate cross-chain communication and enable users to benefit from a connected, decentralized future. Conclusion: Which Crypto to Choose for Short-Term Gains? With numerous options available, selecting the right crypto project can be a daunting task. However, when it comes to short-term investments, Qubetics, SUI, and Astra each present compelling cases. Qubetics , with its focus on interoperability and innovative blockchain solutions, is well-positioned for significant growth, especially as its presale continues to gain traction. SUI’s speed and scalability, along with its decentralized infrastructure, make it a strong contender in the blockchain space, while Astra’s focus on tokenized assets ensures it will be a key player in the digital finance revolution. Ultimately, the decision on which project to back comes down to your goals and risk tolerance. For those seeking a project with massive upside potential, Qubetics ($TICS) presents one of the most exciting opportunities in the market today.

SUI was last trading around $2.70, up around 20% on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump appeared to signal taking an easier approach to the trade war with China. JUST IN: President Trump says Chinese tariffs will come down substantially and he will go easy on China. pic.twitter.com/mVVzRwPjem — BRICS News (@BRICSinfo) April 22, 2025 That was the trigger for a major risk asset rally, as fears of tariff-induced economic weakness subsided. As traders piled back into risk assets, the Sui price snapped a downtrend going all the way back to the start of 2025. It also mustered its first major breakouts above its 21 and 50 DMAs since early 2025. Technically speaking, the door has now been opened to a substantial rally in the near term. Bulls will be focused on a possible near-term retest of the 200DMA just above $3.0. A break above here could open the door to a rapid surge all the way back to the record highs printed in early 2025 above $5.0. So Sui could feasibly be looking at 2x gains in the near future. Sui Price Might 2x, But Altcoin Season Isn’t Back Yet That said, traders would do well not to get overly enthusiastic about the start of a new “ altcoin season”.

SEND $ETH TO $10,000 NOW!!! pic.twitter.com/qhAlWeR9uR — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 22, 2025 If Trump is backing off from the trade war, that’s a major relief for the market that paves the way for further near-term upside. But macro risks remain elevated. Trade war uncertainty plus austerity by the US government remain major downside risks to the US economy, with recession risks still elevated. And, given an elevated risk of sticky inflation thanks to tariffs, the Fed under Chairman Jerome Powell will be reluctant to “save the markets/economy” with aggressive easing should the economy roll over. Evidence of an impending recession could yet trigger a reversal in sentiment. With the economy not yet “out of the woods”, traders should remain suspicious of the longevity of altcoin rallies. Traders should remember that the real “rocket fuel” behind past altcoin seasons have been massive floods of liquidity from central banks. Yes, global M2 is rising as central banks around the world ease. Global Liquidity (M2) x Bitcoin Price Send it. pic.twitter.com/fk6d9CMQ80 — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) April 22, 2025 But altcoins won’t really pop until the Fed follows, and massive Fed easing remains some way off. There is a chance that the Sui price could retest record highs in the near future, but the chances of a meaningful breakout remain low, unless the US economy remains remarkably resilient to a slowdown and inflation. Stack Sui Macro conditions remain unfavorable for a renewed altcoin season. Savvy long-term investors will view this as an opportunity to continue stacking high-quality altcoins like Sui at discount prices. And Sui is certainly an altcoin worth stacking. The blockchain’s rapid late-2024 ascent positions it as a frontrunner for the next altcoin market surge. Boasting over 25 million active accounts and $1.36 billion in TVL by late 2024, Sui is already demonstrating robust on-chain adoption, much more than can be said for the vast majority of altcoins out there. Projects like Cetus, a leading DEX with $105 million TVL, and NAVI Protocol, a lending platform surpassing $135 million TVL, underscore its thriving DeFi ecosystem. Sui’s roadmap, leveraging the Move programming language and parallel transaction processing, ensures scalability and speed, rivaling Solana and Ethereum. And Innovations like the SuiPlay0X1 gaming console and USDC integration further cement Sui’s potential to lead blockchain innovation. Sui is the best network on which to build games.

But crypto traders are likely to look back on Trump’s second term as a “glory age” for crypto. The Trump administration is ardently pro-crypto and seeks to foster growth in the industry. Over the coming years, it seems highly unlikely that leading coins like Sui won’t perform very well. Traders shouldn’t rule out a potential Sui price of $10 or even $20 per token by the end of Trump’s term.

The survey was conducted by the Korea Financial Consumer Protection Foundation (KFCPF), the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on April 22.

(Source: CoinGecko) The survey also found that 52% of respondents said they had “made a profit” through their crypto investments. And while over three-quarters of the respondents said they had traded or currently hold Bitcoin (BTC) , the survey showed that South Koreans are also altcoin-keen. On average, respondents said they hold or have traded more than three types of coin. Bitcoin took first place in the popularity stakes with 76%. Following behind were Ethereum (ETH) with 52.8%, XRP with 32.2%, Dogecoin (DOGE) with 24.6%, and Solana (SOL) with 14.7%. Most of the respondents said their crypto buys were a form of investment. However, a large minority said they were also motivated by “curiosity about cryptoassets.” A much smaller minority still said they had bought crypto to access “specific services” or “use in transactions in place of fiat.” Most people said they had made profits under the 10 million won ($7,000) mark, with the majority also saying they had sold their coins less than a year after buying them. The news agency remarked that “short-term, small-sum investments” accounted for the majority of retail activity in the South Korean crypto market.

This achievement underscores the increasing prominence and acceptance of digital currencies in the global financial arena. For anyone following the digital asset space, this is a moment that highlights the remarkable journey of Bitcoin from a niche technology to a major financial force. Understanding Bitcoin’s Ranking Among Global Assets According to data compiled by 8marketcap, which tracks the market capitalization of various global assets, companies, and commodities, Bitcoin’s market cap has reached a level that places it firmly within the top echelon. As of the latest figures, Bitcoin boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.792 trillion. This valuation is derived from its current trading price of around $90,256, reflecting a positive movement of 2.36% over the past 24 hours. What does it mean to be the 8th largest asset globally? It means Bitcoin is now valued higher than numerous established multinational corporations and even some traditional commodities. While the list of assets above it includes giants like gold, major tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Saudi Aramco, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent is a testament to its growing adoption and perceived value. This new Bitcoin ranking isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal about the shifting landscape of global finance. What Drives Bitcoin Market Cap and Price? The impressive rise in Bitcoin’s market cap is fundamentally driven by its price and circulating supply. However, the price itself is influenced by a complex interplay of factors: Increasing Adoption: Both institutional and retail investors are showing growing interest. Large corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offering crypto services significantly boost demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Concerns about inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty often drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value or ‘digital gold’. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap (21 million coins) and events like the halving (which reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created) create scarcity, potentially driving up demand relative to supply. Technological Development: Ongoing improvements to the Bitcoin network and surrounding infrastructure (like scaling solutions and improved security) can increase confidence and utility. Market Sentiment: News, regulatory developments, and overall market psychology play a significant role in short-term price movements. The current positive momentum contributes to the high BTC price we are seeing. The Ripple Effect on the Crypto Market Cap Bitcoin’s performance is often a bellwether for the entire digital asset space. As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, its movements significantly impact the overall crypto market cap . When Bitcoin shows strength and reaches new milestones like the 8th global ranking, it typically boosts confidence across the altcoin market, leading to broader gains. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s success story benefits the wider ecosystem, attracting more attention and capital to digital assets as a whole. The increasing size and legitimacy of Bitcoin as demonstrated by its ranking among the largest assets by market cap also pave the way for greater integration with traditional financial systems. We are seeing more financial products, regulatory discussions, and corporate strategies incorporating Bitcoin, which further solidifies its position and contributes to the growth of the entire crypto market cap . Implications of Bitcoin’s High Ranking Achieving the 8th position is more than just bragging rights. It carries significant implications: Increased Legitimacy: Being ranked alongside world-renowned companies and assets lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Institutional Attraction: Higher ranking and larger market cap make Bitcoin a more viable and attractive option for large institutional investors who require liquidity and market depth. Mainstream Awareness: Such milestones capture headlines and bring Bitcoin into mainstream financial conversations, increasing public awareness and understanding. Store of Value Narrative: Reaching this scale reinforces the argument that Bitcoin can serve as a significant store of value in the digital age. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, this new Bitcoin ranking is a clear indicator of the asset’s maturation and its growing importance in the global financial system. The journey of Bitcoin’s market cap from zero to nearly $1.8 trillion and the 8th position globally is a remarkable story of innovation and market evolution. For investors and enthusiasts, this milestone serves as a powerful validation of the potential of digital assets. It underscores the importance of staying informed about developments in the space, understanding the factors influencing the BTC price , and recognizing the increasing significance of the overall crypto market cap .

He reveals that the action at this support signals renewed buyer confidence and indicates that BCH could be positioning itself for a sustained upward push. With price structure aligning with historical trends, this rebound may be the early sign of a broader bullish continuation forming on the charts. UniChartz also highlighted that Bitcoin Cash remains structurally sound within a descending wedge pattern. Despite recent pullbacks, the overall pattern is holding steady, and the strong defense at the $309 support level is keeping bullish hopes alive. As long as BCH stays above this zone, the technical outlook favors buyers, suggesting that momentum could gradually build in their favor. The analyst suggests that BCH could target the $480 and $500 resistance zone. A move above these levels might trigger a broader rally, with potential mid-term gains stretching toward the $600 and $1,200 range, signaling a strong recovery. Is The Bitcoin Cash Rally Sustainable? While BCH is showing encouraging signs of recovery, the key question now is whether this rally has the strength to hold. Sustained momentum will largely depend on continued buying pressure, strong volume confirmation, and broader market support. Technically, the price remains above the crucial $309 level, and as long as it holds, bulls retain control. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Price Jumps 15%: Is This Just the Beginning of More Gains? However, if this setup fails and the price slips below the crucial $309 support level, it could signal a weakening bullish structure. Such a breakdown would invalidate the current reversal pattern and shift the focus back to lower support zones. In that case, BCH may revisit the next key levels around $211 and potentially $85, where buyers would need to step in to prevent a deeper correction.

Recently, the crypto market witnessed one such significant event: an Ethereum whale offloaded a substantial amount of Ether following a notable price increase. This action immediately caught the attention of the community and on-chain analysts alike. Who Are These Ethereum Whales and Why Do They Matter? In the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular digital asset. For Ethereum, this means controlling a significant supply of ETH. These large holders wield considerable influence due to the sheer volume of their holdings. When a whale decides to buy or sell, their actions can potentially impact market liquidity and price dynamics. Their movements are closely watched because they can sometimes signal shifts in sentiment or provide insights into potential future price movements. While not every whale transaction dictates the market, a large, sudden move can certainly create ripples, especially if the market is already sensitive. A Closer Look at the Recent ETH Price Action and Whale Sale According to details shared by pseudonymous on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), a specific anonymous wallet, identified as a whale, executed a significant sale shortly after the Ethereum price experienced a rapid uptick. The report indicates that within a mere 15 minutes, this whale sold 15,000 ETH. The timing is particularly noteworthy. The sale occurred immediately after Ether’s unit price had risen by approximately 4.2% over the preceding hour. This suggests the whale was capitalizing on the recent price momentum to exit a portion of their position. Here are the key transaction details: Amount Sold: 15,000 ETH Asset Received: 24.905 million USDT (Tether) Average Selling Price: Approximately $1,660 per ETH Context: Sale happened within 15 minutes of report, after a 4.2% ETH price rise in the hour prior This transaction size, valued at nearly $25 million, is substantial and highlights the significant capital controlled by such market participants. What Does This On-Chain Analysis Reveal? On-chain analysis is the examination of public blockchain data to gain insights into market activity, sentiment, and potential trends. Analysts like @EmberCN track large transactions, wallet movements, and other on-chain metrics to understand what is happening beneath the surface of exchange order books. In this instance, the on-chain data provided immediate visibility into a major market participant’s actions. It revealed: Profit-Taking Behavior: Selling a large amount of ETH right after a quick price rise strongly suggests the whale was taking profits from their holdings. Liquidity Absorption: The market was liquid enough to absorb a $25 million sale relatively quickly, indicating underlying demand or efficient market mechanisms. Wallet Activity: Tracking this wallet allows analysts to potentially monitor future large movements from the same entity. On-chain analysis offers transparency that isn’t available in traditional markets, allowing anyone to verify transactions and study the flow of assets, albeit without necessarily knowing the real-world identity behind the wallet address. Why Did the Whale Choose to Sell ETH Now? Pinpointing the exact reasons behind a whale’s decision is speculative without direct information, but several possibilities are commonly considered in the world of crypto trading : Profit Realization: The most straightforward reason. The price rose, presenting an opportunity to lock in gains on a significant portion of their investment. Portfolio Rebalancing: The whale might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting capital from ETH into stablecoins (like USDT) or other assets. Anticipating a Pullback: Perhaps the whale believes the recent price surge is temporary and is selling now with the intention of buying back at a lower price later. Funding Other Ventures: The funds could be needed for investments outside of crypto, operational costs, or other financial obligations. Risk Management: Reducing exposure to ETH amidst market volatility or uncertainty. Given the immediate sale following a quick price pump, profit realization or anticipating a short-term pullback are highly probable motivations. How Does This Impact the ETH Price and Broader Crypto Market? A sale of 15,000 ETH, while large, needs to be put into perspective against the total trading volume and market capitalization of Ethereum. Ethereum is a massive network with billions of dollars traded daily across numerous exchanges. The immediate impact on the ETH price from this specific sale appears to have been absorbed by the market without causing a dramatic price collapse. The average selling price of $1,660 indicates the market was buying at that level. However, repeated large sales from whales, or a cluster of whales selling simultaneously, could exert significant downward pressure. Conversely, if whales are accumulating, it can signal confidence and potentially support prices. For the broader crypto market , whale activity in a major asset like ETH is a data point that traders and analysts consider. It contributes to the overall narrative around market sentiment and liquidity. It serves as a reminder that large players are actively managing their positions. Navigating the Crypto Market: What Can You Learn from Whale Activity? For individual investors and traders, observing whale movements through on-chain analysis platforms can be informative, but it’s crucial not to base decisions solely on one or two large transactions. Here are some actionable insights: Whale moves are signals, not guarantees: A whale selling doesn’t automatically mean the price will crash. Understand the context – was it after a pump (profit-taking)? Is there news? Look for patterns: Is this a one-off sale, or is a specific whale or group of whales consistently selling or accumulating? Consider market depth: How easily was the large order absorbed? This tells you about market liquidity. Combine with other analysis: Use on-chain data alongside technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market news for a more complete picture. Manage your own risk: Don’t blindly follow whales. Have your own investment strategy and risk management plan. Understanding whale activity is a valuable tool in the crypto trading toolkit, offering a glimpse into the actions of major players, but it should be used as part of a broader analytical approach. Conclusion: Whale Activity is a Key Data Point The recent sale of 15,000 ETH by an Ethereum whale after a price surge is a clear example of how large holders actively manage their positions in response to market movements. This instance, identified through on-chain analysis , likely represents profit-taking or portfolio adjustment rather than a bearish signal intended to crash the market, especially since the sale was absorbed around the $1,660 mark. While individual whale transactions can influence short-term dynamics, the long-term trajectory of the ETH price and the overall health of the crypto market depend on a confluence of factors, including adoption, development, regulatory news, and broader economic conditions. Keeping an eye on significant on-chain movements provides valuable context for anyone participating in the digital asset space.

43686723,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=162901,1745366418,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/43686723.jpeg,"Dragoin’s Presale at $0.0000292 Outpaces PEPE’s 12% Rally and ETH’s Recovery Attempt With a 6,750% ROI Roadmap",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dragoins-presale-at-0-0000292-outpaces-pepes-12-rally-and-eths-recovery-attempt-with-a-6750-roi-roadmap/,"Momentum across crypto is shifting, but not always in the ways expected. While tokens like PEPE and Ethereum (ETH) present familiar narratives of technical bounces and potential chart breakouts, Dragoin $DDGN is proving that building out a functioning product early can be a more effective strategy. Ethereum may have found short-term stability, and PEPE could trigger its next wave with a golden cross formation, but Dragoin is working on long-term engagement through user interaction and real-time rewards. As speculative energy gives way to informed accumulation, Dragoin stands out for what it’s already offering, not just what might come next. Here’s what to look out for. PEPE: Eyeing the Golden Cross PEPE is gaining technical attention as it approaches a golden cross—where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day. This pattern is considered bullish and often signals the beginning of an upward trend. Traders have noted increasing volume alongside this setup, which could support further upside if momentum holds. Currently trading around the $0.000007 range, PEPE is still reacting to the wider meme coin narrative. A breakout past resistance near $0.0000077 could see the price test levels closer to $0.0000090. However, its movement remains highly sensitive to external sentiment, particularly from social media influence and market-wide news. For short-term traders, these signals present opportunity—but for long-term holders, PEPE’s reliance on momentum without additional utility remains a critical factor. Ethereum: Searching for a Floor After weeks of decline, Ethereum is attempting to stabilize. Analysts now believe that ETH may have found a temporary bottom, supported by technical strength forming near the $3,200 mark. While not yet in confirmed recovery mode, the coin’s recent pause in downward momentum has raised expectations of a potential rebound. Market watchers note that Ethereum is still a pillar for decentralized applications and token standards, but current price action is reflecting fatigue. The token’s short-term trajectory is less about innovation and more about volume, trendlines, and overall market recovery. There is optimism for a shift back above $3,500, though upcoming economic indicators and altcoin movement could influence that outcome. While ETH remains a major player, its near-term upside is dependent on factors outside of its core ecosystem. Dragoin: Engaging Users Before Launch Unlike many of its counterparts, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building a community by offering something usable right now. The presale is ongoing in Stage 1, with each token priced at $0.0000292 and a launch price set at $0.002. This pricing path suggests up to 6,750% ROI for early participants. But Dragoin isn’t relying on speculation alone—the tokenomics are clearly outlined, with 50% of the total supply allocated for presale, 30% reserved for ecosystem development, 15% for liquidity, and 5% for the team, which is locked for two years. What makes Dragoin more attractive is its transparent structure. The smart contract will be renounced after launch, and all unsold tokens will be permanently burned—reducing supply and strengthening long-term value. Unlike projects that rely on hype spikes, Dragoin is steadily growing through community referrals, staking plans, and real-time utility. It’s not a placeholder token waiting for functionality; it’s already delivering it. To Sum it Up… PEPE and ETH may attract volume based on historical performance and chart patterns, but Dragoin’s progress is built on consistent delivery. Its game integration, fixed pricing model, and fully mapped token distribution offer clarity in a market often driven by guesswork. Dragoin’s approach doesn’t rely on external triggers—it thrives on continued user engagement and transparent goals. For anyone considering the best crypto for future potential, Dragoin presents a blend of entertainment, structure, and community access. Its early success shows that crypto projects don’t have to wait for a bull cycle to start delivering. Instead of promising future value, Dragoin is creating it now—making it credible among today’s top crypto gainers.

Stellar (XLM) is drawing attention with its ascending triangle setup, suggesting a possible push toward $0.29. Ethereum (ETH) is also gaining interest as it tests major resistance levels, with traders watching for a breakout. While these price formations fuel speculation, BlockDAG is pushing past guesswork. Its Beta Testnet is live and fully operational, supporting smart contracts, staking, and NFT minting. In an industry where delays are common, BlockDAG’s functioning infrastructure stands out. Stellar (XLM) Eyes Breakout With Strong Backing Stellar (XLM) has formed an ascending triangle on the 4-hour chart, signaling a potential breakout. Analysts are watching for a move toward the $0.29 mark. A clean break above the current descending channel could trigger an 18% jump to this resistance zone. Beyond technical indicators, Stellar’s fundamentals offer strong support. The network’s foray into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, in collaboration with Franklin Templeton and Ondo Finance, aims to bring $3 billion in tokenized assets to its blockchain. This development not only boosts Stellar’s utility but also makes it more attractive to institutional investors. Although momentum appears somewhat muted in the short term, the alignment of chart patterns and these real-world initiatives suggests Stellar could be ready to move. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on the $0.29 level for confirmation. Ethereum (ETH) Charts Hint at Upside Despite Exchange Flows Ethereum (ETH) is also showing signs of strength, currently forming an ascending triangle pattern on the weekly chart—a setup that often precedes upward price action. According to Titan of Crypto, ETH could test the top of this formation, possibly reaching $3,600. In the near term, ETH has moved past the $1,550–$1,600 support zone and is nearing resistance at $1,670. A close above this level could open a path toward $2,000. However, caution is needed. On-chain data reveals that over 368,000 ETH have been transferred to exchanges this month, which might create selling pressure. Despite this, the general technical outlook for Ethereum remains positive. Traders are keeping a close watch on these critical levels to gauge where the price might head next. BlockDAG Unlocks Real Utility With Beta Testnet Milestone BlockDAG has reached a significant milestone with its Beta Testnet now fully supporting EVM-based smart contracts, MetaMask connectivity, token burns, staking, and NFT minting. Unlike many projects that rely on future promises, BlockDAG is offering hands-on functionality right now. The latest AMA highlighted these features in action. Users are already creating ERC-20 tokens, staking BDAG, and minting NFTs on-chain. Additionally, a Smart Contract Wizard is coming soon, which will enable even non-developers to launch their own decentralized apps. Meanwhile, the presale continues to accelerate. BlockDAG has now raised $216 million, with its current batch (27) priced at $0.0248. Holders who joined in batch 1 have already seen returns of 2,380%, and more than 19.3 billion BDAG tokens have been sold. While other projects hold back features for later marketing cycles, BlockDAG is delivering now. Its focus on immediate, usable tech is setting it apart as a serious contender among Layer-1 chains. Summing Up! While Stellar and Ethereum attract attention through chart setups and speculative potential, the value of these moves depends heavily on follow-through. Stellar’s tokenization initiatives and Ethereum’s resistance testing are promising, but still speculative. BlockDAG, by contrast, is offering tangible progress. With live smart contracts, staking, and NFTs already active, it is delivering what many others still claim to be developing. Rather than waiting for future milestones, users can interact with its ecosystem right now. As the market continues to seek clarity, BlockDAG is emerging as a chain backed not just by speculation but by real results. In a landscape filled with predictions, BlockDAG is offering performance.

Pseudonymous analyst Inmortal tells his 231,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the native asset of the layer-2 scaling solution Mantle ( MNT ). According to Inmortal, MNT appears to be mirroring Chainlink’s consolidation from 2019 to 2020, which preceded LINK’s ascent from a low of $1.36 to a high of $53 – a whopping 3,797% explosion. “MNT gives me early LINK vibes. Many people think the bull market is over, but there are coins like Mantle that haven’t even started it yet. Conviction play for me.” Source: Inmortal/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that MNT could soar to as high as $6 by next year. At time of writing, MNT is worth $0.66. Turning to Bitcoin, Inmortal says BTC’s reaction at one crucial price area will determine whether the crypto king will see new lows this cycle. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BTC may mirror its 2022 price action when it briefly soared above $45,000 before plunging to a bear market low at $16,000. But Inmortal highlights that the bearish outlook will be invalidated if Bitcoin flips a key price level as support. “$95,000 is where we find out if this bounce is a: a) Last exit before new lows b) Local bottom BTC.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $87,355.

With ETF talks, fresh utility updates, and network upgrades, altcoins are pulling ahead of slower-moving layer-1s and offering stronger ROI setups for 2025. Some names have already started gaining traction, while others are flying under the radar. That’s exactly where the best upside lies right now. If you’re looking for top altcoins to buy now, the timing couldn’t be better. Projects with active development, growing ecosystems, and major presale offers are lining up for serious upside. Whether you’re into utility, tech, or early-stage price advantages, this list gives you all three. Let’s start with the one that’s turning a $1 buy into $7 — BlockDAG. 1. BlockDAG – 600% Bonus and 2,380% ROI Setup BlockDAG has become one of the most talked-about opportunities right now, thanks to its active presale and massive bonus offers. With over $216 million raised, the presale has moved into Batch 27 at a price of $0.0248, and the coin will launch at $0.05. That’s a 2,380% ROI since the first batch. But what’s really driving momentum is the return of the Golden Ticket code — BDAG1200 — which gives a 600% bonus on all new purchases. That’s turning every $100 buy into $700 worth of tokens, making BlockDAG one of the most rewarding picks among the top altcoins to buy now. Beyond the numbers, the tech is already in action. BlockDAG uses a hybrid consensus model combining DAG scalability with PoW security, launching with 2,000 TPS and aiming for 15,000 TPS in future upgrades. The team has shipped 10,000 mining devices, onboarded 1.2M+ mobile miners, and rolled out tools like a no-code token builder and NFT creator. With 10 CEX listings lined up and its testnet already live, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale — it’s a fast-moving ecosystem with actual traction. All of this makes it one of the strongest contenders for anyone eyeing the top altcoins to buy now. 2. XRP – ETF Hype and Market Rank Boost XRP has bounced back to $2.07 after dipping to $1.60 earlier this April. One major catalyst is that the long-standing SEC lawsuit is reaching a resolution. The SEC is set to settle for $50 million and drop the permanent injunction, which clears a huge hurdle for Ripple’s business. This regulatory clarity is pushing XRP closer to ETF approval, with Polymarket giving it a 77% probability for a spot ETF in 2025. On top of that, XRP just surpassed Ethereum in fully diluted market cap—now standing at $208.4 billion. XRP is also starting to build a stronger DeFi footprint. Its AI-based DEX, XploraDEX, is in its final presale stages, and that’s attracting DeFi-focused communities back to the ecosystem. Analysts have set future targets at $11 and even $57, with some bullish long-term forecasts aiming at $101. The combination of real legal progress, ETF speculation, and DeFi expansion makes XRP one of the top altcoins to buy now if you’re betting on institutional demand coming in later this year. 3. Litecoin – Chart Patterns Hint at a Potential Comeback Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $76.59 and holding strong even after a slight decline from earlier in the year. What’s keeping traders interested right now is the bullish engulfing pattern forming on the weekly charts. While short-term projections point toward a possible dip to $72.75, there’s also upside potential to $126 if momentum holds. With lower volatility and a long history of resilience during BTC corrections, LTC is being eyed as a hedge for altcoin-heavy portfolios. The April outlook shows price ranges between $75 and $126, with the average monthly estimate hovering near $115. That kind of setup—clear support, upside potential, and a proven history—keeps Litecoin on the list of top altcoins to buy now. It’s not the flashiest coin, but for traders looking at predictable returns and stability within alt exposure, LTC continues to hold its ground. 4. Avalanche – Trying to Break Resistance Above $20 Avalanche (AVAX) has moved up to $19.63 after sliding below $15 in Q1. It’s now testing the $20 resistance zone, and a solid breakout could flip its structure bullish for the first time in months. Technicals show room for a push higher if it confirms above $20, and RSI indicators point toward a reversal as it comes off oversold levels. With the token’s strong ecosystem and DeFi presence, this current range is drawing in renewed buyer interest. Price projections for April range between $16.17 and $19.91, but long-term models suggest it could hit $36.60 by December 2025. That would be a 93% gain from current levels. As the Avalanche network continues to improve throughput and scale its subnet architecture, the fundamentals are aligning with the technical rebound. For mid-term growth and a potential breakout setup, AVAX is one of the smarter picks among top altcoins to buy now. 5. Sui – Transaction Volume Surges Past Ethereum SUI has shot past the 500 million transaction mark, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin in activity this April. It’s currently priced at $2.14 and showing strong signs of accumulation. A falling wedge pattern is forming on the daily chart, a setup that often triggers bullish reversals. Analysts are pointing to upside targets around $5 in the coming months. Predictions for April range from $2.14 to $7.24, with the average outlook sitting near $4.22. Beyond price action, Sui’s network activity is exploding. Total value locked (TVL) is now at $1.22 billion, and daily DEX volume has crossed $250 million, showing deep on-chain engagement. This isn’t just hype—it’s real usage. With this level of traction, the coin is catching the attention of analysts and traders as one of the top altcoins to buy now for both utility and momentum. It’s shaping up to be a serious contender heading into the second half of the year. Summing Up Sui’s network activity, Avalanche’s breakout setup, Litecoin’s stability, and XRP’s legal clarity all highlight why these are among the top altcoins to buy now. Each offers a unique mix of growth potential, whether through strong fundamentals, technical reversals, or upcoming catalysts like ETF approval. But BlockDAG clearly takes the lead with its unmatched presale momentum, real testnet progress, and the powerful 600% Golden Ticket bonus still live. The ability to secure up to 2,380% returns before launch is a rare opportunity, especially with 10 exchange listings and 15,000 TPS scalability on the roadmap. For anyone scouting serious upside right now, BlockDAG offers the most compelling setup across both new and established altcoins. It’s the one to watch first.

This action underscores the commitment of international law enforcement agencies to dismantle platforms facilitating criminal enterprises, particularly those involving dangerous substances and money laundering. What Exactly Was the Nemesis Market? At the heart of this recent legal action lies the Nemesis Market , a darknet platform that operated outside the reach of standard web browsers, accessible only through specialized software like Tor. Active for a period spanning from 2021 until its eventual seizure in March 2024, Nemesis Market carved out a notorious space for facilitating the trade of illegal goods and services. The sheer scale of its operations is staggering: Transactions: The platform processed over 400,000 illegal transactions. Sales Value: These transactions amounted to nearly $30 million in illicit sales. User Base: Nemesis Market boasted a substantial user base, with over 150,000 registered users. While a wide range of illegal items were likely traded, the DOJ specifically highlighted the sale of dangerous drugs, including fentanyl, a potent opioid contributing significantly to public health crises worldwide. This focus on fentanyl underscores the severe real-world consequences stemming from such online marketplaces. Who is Behrouz Parsarad and What Are the Charges? The focus of the DOJ’s indictment is Behrouz Parsarad , an Iranian national alleged to be the mastermind behind the Nemesis Market’s operations. According to the indictment, Parsarad was not merely a user or vendor but the individual responsible for running the entire illicit enterprise. Parsarad faces serious federal charges, reflecting the gravity of the crimes facilitated by the platform he allegedly controlled: The primary charges against him are: Drug Distribution Conspiracy: This charge relates to his alleged role in facilitating the widespread sale of illegal narcotics through the Nemesis Market. Given the volume and the dangerous nature of the drugs involved (like fentanyl), this carries severe penalties. Money Laundering Conspiracy: Operating an illegal marketplace generating millions requires sophisticated methods to conceal the origin of the funds. This charge alleges that Parsarad engaged in activities designed to launder the nearly $30 million in proceeds from the illicit sales. Darknet markets often utilize cryptocurrencies for transactions, and money laundering in this context typically involves techniques to obfuscate the flow of these digital assets, such as using mixers, tumblers, or multiple wallets. If convicted on these charges, Behrouz Parsarad faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in federal prison, with the potential for a maximum sentence of up to life imprisonment. This potential sentence reflects the significant harm caused by the operation of such a market. The Scope of the DOJ Indictment and International Effort The DOJ Indictment against Behrouz Parsarad is a testament to the persistent efforts of U.S. law enforcement to pursue cybercriminals regardless of their location. However, tackling platforms operating across international borders requires significant collaboration. This case highlights the critical role of international cooperation in dismantling darknet infrastructure. The successful seizure of the Nemesis Market in March 2024 was not solely a U.S. operation. It involved crucial assistance from law enforcement authorities in both Germany and Lithuania. This joint effort demonstrates how countries are pooling resources and intelligence to track down and disrupt complex cybercriminal networks that exploit the internet for illegal purposes. The indictment details how Parsarad allegedly managed the technical infrastructure and financial operations of the market, facilitating transactions that often relied on cryptocurrencies for their pseudonymous nature. The investigation likely involved tracing digital footprints, analyzing blockchain data (where possible), and traditional investigative techniques combined with cyber expertise. Understanding the Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Crime While the core crime here is drug trafficking and money laundering, the operation of darknet markets is intrinsically linked to Cryptocurrency Crime . These platforms overwhelmingly favor cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Monero, and others because they offer a degree of anonymity or pseudonymity compared to traditional financial systems. This makes tracing funds more challenging for law enforcement. However, this case, like many others before it, demonstrates that cryptocurrency transactions are not untraceable. Blockchain analysis firms and law enforcement agencies are becoming increasingly sophisticated at following the flow of illicit funds, identifying patterns, and linking digital wallets to real-world identities. The indictment of a darknet market operator sends a clear message: Operating illegal marketplaces online carries severe consequences. International borders offer little protection against determined law enforcement collaboration. The perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency is not absolute and can be overcome by skilled investigators. The fight against Cryptocurrency Crime is multifaceted, involving not just prosecuting market operators but also targeting vendors, buyers, and the infrastructure that supports these illicit economies. This Nemesis Market case is a significant victory in that ongoing battle. Challenges in Policing the Darknet Despite successes like the Nemesis Market seizure, policing the darknet remains incredibly challenging. Operators and users employ various techniques to evade detection: Encryption and Anonymity Networks: Using Tor and other anonymity networks makes it difficult to determine the physical location of servers and users. Cryptocurrency Mixers/Tumblers: Services designed to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency transactions add layers of complexity to financial investigations. Decentralized Structures: Some newer darknet models attempt to use decentralized technologies to make takedowns harder. International Jurisdictions: Coordinating investigations and prosecutions across different countries with varying laws and capabilities is complex and time-consuming. This case highlights that overcoming these challenges requires sustained international partnerships, technological expertise, and long-term investigative commitment. Conclusion: A Blow Against Online Illicit Trade The indictment of Behrouz Parsarad and the seizure of the Nemesis Market represent a substantial blow against the darknet ecosystem that facilitates drug trafficking and other severe crimes. It serves as a stark reminder that operating or participating in such illicit online ventures carries significant legal risks, culminating in severe penalties like lengthy prison sentences. The successful collaboration between the U.S. DOJ and authorities in Germany and Lithuania is a powerful example of how global cooperation is essential in tackling cybercrime that transcends national boundaries. As technology evolves, so too must the methods employed by law enforcement to ensure that the dark corners of the internet do not become safe havens for criminals preying on vulnerable populations. This case reinforces the message that while the digital world offers new frontiers, it does not offer immunity from justice for those who choose to engage in illegal activities.

ASIC argued that the features of the Earner product made it a financial product under Australian law that required a license. However, the Court found the product could not meet the legal definitions required to deem it as such. ASIC said in a brief public note it is “considering this decision.” The regulator has yet to venture the matter by the High Court. The ruling is a setback for ASIC, which has ramped up its oversight of cryptocurrency products and platforms in Australia. Court declares Block Earner offered loans, not investments ASIC commenced proceedings against Block Earner on the first of November 2022 — the start of the legal saga. Central to the case was whether the Earner product operated as a conventional investment scheme — which would need to be tightly regulated — or whether it was just a loan agreement between Block Earner and its customers. The Court reasoned that the product was structured as a plain loan. Customers signed agreements to lend their crypto assets to Block Earner for a fixed return. Crucially, there was no pooling of customer assets. The agreement for each customer was separate. Customers also had no interest in Block Earner’s broader business operations or performance aside from earning the agreed interest. The court also held that the structure was not a managed investment scheme. The ruling stated that the product details were clear and that the customers’ rights were fixed and contractual, not dependent on the performance of a pooled investment. This distinction was central to exonerating Block Earner of any wrongdoing. Block Earner celebrates court ruling but rules out reviving product In response to the win, the leadership at Block Earner celebrated the decision as a win for innovation and regulatory clarity. Block Earner’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Karaboga, said, “From the outset, we sought to ensure that our modern product suite could fit into a less-modern regulatory environment.” Block Earner’s chief commercial officer, James Coombes, agreed that clearer treatment of crypto assets would allow companies to build new financial products responsibly. Coombes said that the more crypto assets were treated like existing asset classes, the easier it would be for businesses to innovate. Even though the ruling was in its favor, Block Earner said it has no intention of bringing the Earner product back to market. A spokesman for Block Earner said they were focused on the future and that the ruling freed them to continue building compliant, innovative solutions for Australians seeking safe and secure access to digital finance. The case has wider implications for Australia’s burgeoning crypto economy. According to Block Earner, an estimated four million Australians have been exposed to cryptocurrencies, whether directly or via investment platforms. Legal experts say the ruling could shape how other crypto companies structure and promote products to comply with Australia’s financial regulations . It also indicates that courts might take a more nuanced approach when looking at traditional finance laws used for blockchain-real services until new, digital asset-oriented regulations come on stream.

DeFi Development, a company focusing on AI for commercial real estate, has just made a significant move by adding a substantial amount of Solana (SOL) to its balance sheet. This latest acquisition highlights a growing trend among companies exploring digital asset strategy as part of their financial planning. DeFi Development’s Growing SOL Investment According to recent reports, DeFi Development completed another major SOL investment , purchasing an additional 88,164 SOL tokens. This buy is valued at approximately $11.5 million based on recent market prices. This isn’t their first foray into the Solana ecosystem; the company previously known as Janover, rebranded to DeFi Development and announced its intention to hold SOL as a strategic reserve asset earlier this month. This recent purchase significantly increases their total exposure to the Solana network. The company’s total crypto holdings in SOL now stand at an impressive 251,842 tokens. This makes them a notable player among corporate entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Why a Digital Asset Strategy? It’s fascinating to see companies like DeFi Development, rooted in traditional sectors like real estate and AI, pivot towards integrating digital assets into their financial framework. What drives such a decision? A Digital Asset Strategy can serve multiple purposes: Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like cryptocurrencies can help diversify a traditional portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Potential Growth: Companies may see digital assets as a way to participate in the growth of emerging technologies and potentially outperform traditional investments. Inflation Hedge: Some view cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies or strong network effects, as a potential hedge against inflation, although this is a debated topic. Alignment with Future Trends: For a company like DeFi Development, which leverages AI and technology, holding digital assets might align with its forward-thinking brand identity and potential future business models that could interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies. Market fluctuations can be extreme, potentially impacting the company’s balance sheet value significantly. Analyzing DeFi Development’s Solana Holdings Let’s take a closer look at the numbers behind DeFi Development’s SOL Holdings . The company started accumulating SOL recently and has quickly built up a substantial position. Action Amount Purchased (SOL) Approx. Value (USD) Total SOL Holdings Initial Accumulation (Estimate) ~163,678 ~$21.3 million ~163,678 Latest Purchase 88,164 ~$11.5 million 251,842 (Note: Initial accumulation numbers are estimates based on the reported total holdings minus the latest purchase. Values are approximate based on the $11.5M value of the latest purchase.) This table clearly illustrates the rapid increase in their Solana reserves. It signals strong conviction from the company’s leadership regarding Solana’s future prospects. What Does This Mean for Solana? Large purchases by publicly known entities, even if they are relatively new to the space like DeFi Development, can sometimes have a positive impact on market sentiment for Solana . While an $11.5 million purchase isn’t massive in the context of Solana’s multi-billion dollar market cap, it represents: Institutional/Corporate Interest: It shows that companies outside the traditional crypto industry are looking at Solana as a viable asset for their treasury. Validation: It provides some level of validation for Solana’s technology and ecosystem from external players. Increased Demand: Direct buying pressure, however small relative to total volume, contributes to overall demand for the asset. This continued accumulation as part of their Digital Asset Strategy could inspire confidence among other potential corporate or individual investors watching the space. Key Takeaways from DeFi Development’s Move DeFi Development’s significant SOL Investment offers several insights: The line between traditional corporate finance and the crypto world continues to blur. Solana remains a popular choice for investors and companies looking for high-throughput blockchain platforms. Adopting a Digital Asset Strategy is becoming a more mainstream consideration for businesses. Building substantial Crypto Holdings is a deliberate strategic choice, not just speculative trading, for some companies. It will be interesting to follow DeFi Development’s journey and see how their Solana holdings evolve over time and how this strategy impacts their overall business and financial performance. Conclusion DeFi Development’s latest $11.5 million purchase of Solana underscores a clear strategic shift towards incorporating digital assets into their corporate reserves. With total SOL Holdings now exceeding 250,000, the company is making a notable statement about its belief in the potential of the Solana ecosystem. This move, part of a broader Digital Asset Strategy , highlights the increasing intersection of traditional business sectors with the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As companies continue to explore and adopt digital assets, the landscape of corporate finance is undeniably changing.

43687223,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151608,1745367637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive BANKEX Lawsuit Targets Matter Labs Over ZKSync Tech,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bankex-lawsuit-matter-labs/,"In a development that has sent ripples through the blockchain community, the now-defunct cryptocurrency banking platform, BANKEX, has filed a significant BANKEX lawsuit against Matter Labs, the company behind the popular Ethereum scaling solution, ZKSync. The core of the dispute centers on serious allegations of intellectual property (IP) infringement, claiming that ZKSync’s foundational technology was improperly acquired. What is the Core Claim in the BANKEX Lawsuit? According to reports, including one by CoinDesk, the BANKEX lawsuit alleges that two former employees of BANKEX stole proprietary technology from the company and used it to build ZKSync. This isn’t just a simple disagreement; it’s a direct accusation of theft of intellectual property, a critical asset in the fast-paced world of tech and blockchain development. Key points of the BANKEX claim include: Allegations of technology theft by former BANKEX employees. The claim that this stolen technology was foundational to the development of ZKSync. The naming of specific individuals involved. Matter Labs and ZKSync: The Defendants Respond At the heart of this legal battle is Matter Labs , the developer of ZKSync. ZKSync is a prominent Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, utilizing zk-rollup technology to enable faster and cheaper transactions. Its role in the Ethereum ecosystem is significant, making this lawsuit particularly noteworthy for many users and developers. Matter Labs has not remained silent. The company has publicly denied the claims made by BANKEX. Their stance is that ZKSync is built upon unique technology developed internally. This sets the stage for a potentially complex legal battle where the origin and nature of ZKSync’s technology will be heavily scrutinized. Who Are the Individuals Implicated in the Crypto IP Infringement Claims? The BANKEX lawsuit names specific individuals, tying them directly to the alleged theft and the subsequent development of ZKSync. The individuals named are: Alexandr Vlasov: Currently holds the position of R&D Director at Matter Labs. Petr Korolev: Identified as the founder of blockchain security firm Oxorio. Chris Burniske: A former co-director at Matter Labs is also implicated in the lawsuit. The involvement of these individuals, particularly those currently or formerly holding key positions, adds another layer of complexity and public interest to the case. Their roles and actions during and after their time at BANKEX will likely be central to the legal proceedings. Why Does This Blockchain Lawsuit Matter? This case highlights a growing challenge within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space: crypto IP infringement . As the industry matures and projects become more complex and valuable, disputes over intellectual property are becoming more common. This blockchain lawsuit serves as a stark reminder that innovation in this space, while often collaborative and open-source, still involves proprietary technology and potential legal conflicts. Challenges in such cases often include: Defining and proving ownership of intangible digital assets and code. Tracing the origin and evolution of technology across different entities and individuals. Navigating varying international laws regarding intellectual property. The outcome of the BANKEX lawsuit could potentially set precedents for how IP disputes are handled in the crypto world, influencing future development and collaboration models. What Happens Next? The Path Forward for Matter Labs and BANKEX With Matter Labs firmly denying the allegations, the case is expected to proceed through the legal system. This will likely involve discovery phases, where evidence is gathered, and potentially a trial if a settlement is not reached. The process could be lengthy and complex. For users and investors interested in ZKSync , this lawsuit introduces an element of uncertainty, although Matter Labs continues to operate and develop the network. The focus will be on how the legal proceedings unfold and whether any evidence emerges that could substantiate or refute BANKEX’s claims. This blockchain lawsuit is a developing story, and the crypto community will be watching closely to see how these significant allegations of crypto IP infringement are resolved and what implications they hold for the future of blockchain technology development.

Right now, a significant point of tension is brewing between Europe and the United States over the rapid expansion of Stablecoins . These digital assets, pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar, are seeing explosive US Stablecoin Growth , and it’s got European authorities worried. The ECB (European Central Bank) has sounded a clear warning: the European Union’s landmark crypto rulebook, known as the MiCA Regulation , might not be enough to handle the potential risks emanating from across the Atlantic. What Are Stablecoins and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the regulatory clash, let’s quickly recap what Stablecoins are. Think of them as the bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the relative stability of traditional fiat currencies. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose prices fluctuate wildly, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, typically 1:1 with a currency like the US Dollar ($) or the Euro (€). They achieve this stability through various mechanisms, most commonly by holding reserves of the underlying asset (like dollars in a bank account or short-term government bonds). This stability makes them crucial for several reasons: Trading: They allow crypto traders to move in and out of volatile assets without converting back to traditional currency, which can be slow and costly. Payments: They offer a potentially faster and cheaper way to send value globally compared to traditional banking rails. DeFi (Decentralized Finance): They are the backbone of many decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading platforms. The market for Stablecoins has grown exponentially, particularly those pegged to the US Dollar, making them a significant force in the global digital economy. Europe’s Answer: The MiCA Regulation Recognizing the growing importance and potential risks of crypto assets, including stablecoins, the European Union developed the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCA Regulation ). This comprehensive framework aims to provide legal certainty for crypto assets not covered by existing financial services legislation. It sets out rules for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and addresses issues like market integrity, investor protection, and financial stability. For stablecoins, MiCA introduces specific categories: Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs): Stablecoins backed by more than one fiat currency or one or more assets. Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs): Stablecoins backed by a single fiat currency (like USD or EUR). These are treated similarly to traditional electronic money. MiCA imposes strict requirements on issuers of ARTs and EMTs, including reserve requirements, redemption rights, and governance rules. It grants supervisory powers to national competent authorities and, for larger stablecoins deemed ‘significant’, to the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the ECB . Why is the ECB Concerned About US Stablecoin Growth? Despite the existence of the MiCA Regulation , the ECB remains apprehensive, specifically citing the accelerating pace of US Stablecoin Growth . Their concerns stem from several interconnected risks: 1. Financial Stability Risks: If a large, widely used stablecoin were to fail (e.g., due to insufficient reserves or a run), it could trigger contagion across the digital asset ecosystem and potentially spill over into traditional financial markets. Given the dominance of US dollar-pegged stablecoins, a failure could have significant global repercussions, including in Europe. 2. Undermining Monetary Sovereignty: The widespread use of stablecoins pegged to a foreign currency (primarily USD) within the Eurozone could challenge the primacy of the Euro. If people and businesses increasingly conduct transactions in dollar-denominated stablecoins, it could weaken the ECB’s control over monetary policy and potentially fragment the European payment landscape. 3. Capital Flight: If stablecoins become a preferred store of value or medium of exchange, capital could potentially flow out of Euro-denominated assets into dollar-denominated stablecoins, impacting European banks and financial institutions. 4. Dependence on Foreign Infrastructure: Relying heavily on stablecoins issued and managed by entities primarily regulated (or potentially less regulated from the ECB’s perspective) under US jurisdiction creates dependence on foreign infrastructure and regulatory oversight, which the ECB sees as a risk to European strategic autonomy. The ECB’s fears are amplified by the political climate in the US, where figures like President Trump have expressed support for the stablecoin industry, potentially paving the way for further rapid expansion and adoption across borders. Could MiCA Regulation Really Fall Short? The European Commission contends that MiCA Regulation is robust and provides the necessary tools, including powers for the ECB to intervene if significant stablecoins pose risks. However, the ECB’s perspective suggests potential gaps or challenges: Pace of Innovation: The stablecoin market evolves rapidly. Will MiCA be able to keep pace with new models or technologies? Cross-Border Reach: While MiCA regulates issuers operating in the EU, the usage of stablecoins issued elsewhere is harder to control. Can the EU effectively mitigate risks from a globally dominant, non-EU stablecoin? Enforcement Challenges: Ensuring full compliance and effective supervision across multiple member states and with entities whose primary operations are outside the EU is complex. Defining ‘Significant’: The threshold for a stablecoin to be deemed ‘significant’ and thus subject to stricter ECB/EBA oversight might be too high, allowing risks to build up in smaller but numerous stablecoins. The ECB’s concern isn’t necessarily that MiCA is flawed in its design for EU-based issuers, but rather whether it provides sufficient defense against the systemic risks posed by the sheer scale and accelerating momentum of US Stablecoin Growth operating globally. Europe’s Strategic Response: The Digital Euro In light of these concerns and the broader trend towards digital currencies, the ECB has been actively exploring and advocating for a Digital Euro . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s envisioned as a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – digital cash issued directly by the central bank. The push for a Digital Euro is seen as a strategic necessity to safeguard Europe’s monetary sovereignty and offer a public alternative in the face of increasing dominance by foreign-issued stablecoins and private digital payment systems. A Digital Euro would aim to provide: Monetary Sovereignty: Ensure the Euro remains the anchor of the European financial system in the digital age. Financial Stability: Offer a safe, risk-free digital form of central bank money. Innovation: Provide a platform for innovation in payments and financial services within a European framework. Inclusion: Ensure access to digital payments for all citizens. The ECB views the Digital Euro not just as a technological upgrade, but as a crucial tool to counter the influence of non-Euro stablecoins and maintain control over its monetary and payment systems. EU vs. US: A Regulatory and Market Showdown? The current situation highlights a potential divergence in approaches between the EU and the US regarding Stablecoins . While Europe has moved forward with a comprehensive framework under MiCA Regulation , the US approach has been more fragmented, though efforts towards federal legislation are underway. The rapid US Stablecoin Growth , partly fueled by this environment and political endorsements, presents a challenge to the EU’s carefully constructed regulatory perimeter. This isn’t just a regulatory debate; it’s a competition for influence in the future of finance. Will the global digital economy primarily transact in stablecoins anchored to the US dollar, or will other currencies, like the Euro (potentially in digital form), maintain significant ground? Here’s a simplified look at the comparison: Aspect European Union (EU) United States (US) Primary Regulation MiCA Regulation (Comprehensive) Fragmented (State/Federal efforts ongoing) Stablecoin Market Size Smaller (Euro-pegged stablecoins) Larger (USD-pegged stablecoins dominate globally) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Digital Euro (Exploration/Preparation Phase) Digital Dollar (Research Phase, less immediate push) Strategic Goal Safeguard Monetary Sovereignty, Financial Stability via MiCA & Digital Euro Foster Innovation, Address Risks via potential future legislation What Does This Mean for You? (Actionable Insights) For users and businesses operating in or interacting with the European market, the ECB ‘s concerns and the ongoing regulatory developments are important: Stay Informed: Keep track of how MiCA is implemented and enforced, particularly regarding stablecoins. Understand Risks: Be aware that even widely used stablecoins carry risks, and regulatory frameworks like MiCA are designed to mitigate these, but global dynamics (like US Stablecoin Growth ) add complexity. Watch the Digital Euro: The progress of the Digital Euro project could significantly impact the future of payments and digital assets in the Eurozone. Consider Jurisdiction: Understand where the stablecoins you use are issued and regulated, as this impacts your protections and the risks involved. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Digital Finance The ECB ‘s warning about the potential shortcomings of the MiCA Regulation in the face of accelerating US Stablecoin Growth underscores a critical challenge for Europe. It’s a balancing act between embracing digital innovation and protecting financial stability and monetary sovereignty. While MiCA provides a foundational framework, the global nature of Stablecoins , particularly the dominance of dollar-pegged assets, presents ongoing complexities. The push for a Digital Euro is a clear signal that Europe is preparing to defend its economic territory in the digital realm. The coming years will reveal whether MiCA proves sufficient, whether the Digital Euro gains traction, and how the competitive landscape between Euro and dollar-anchored digital currencies evolves. One thing is certain: the future of money is being shaped right now, and the regulatory and strategic decisions made today will have lasting impacts.

43688006,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151619,1745369427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Miners Face Alarming Allegations of Tariff Evasion on ASIC Equipment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-miners-tariff-evasion/,"Recent reports have surfaced regarding alleged practices by some Bitcoin miners importing specialized hardware into the United States. According to CoinDesk, citing industry sources, certain miners are reportedly under-reporting the true value of their ASIC mining equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). What’s Behind the Allegations Against Bitcoin Miners ? The core of the issue revolves around the valuation of high-cost hardware used for cryptocurrency mining. ASIC mining equipment , or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are powerful machines designed specifically for the complex computations required to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These machines can be incredibly expensive, often costing thousands or tens of thousands of dollars per unit. When importing goods into the U States, businesses are typically required to pay customs duties and import tariffs based on the declared value of the goods. These duties and tariffs contribute to government revenue and can influence trade dynamics. The allegation is that some Bitcoin miners are deliberately declaring a lower price for their imported ASICs than what they actually paid. This practice, if true, would allow them to pay significantly less in customs duties and import tariffs, reducing their operational costs. How Does Under-reporting ASIC Mining Equipment Values Work? Import procedures require detailed declarations about the nature, quantity, and value of goods entering the country. Importers must submit documentation, such as commercial invoices, that reflect the transaction’s details. Customs authorities review these documents and may inspect shipments to verify the declarations. Sources cited in the CoinDesk report suggest that some companies might be understating the price on invoices submitted to CBP. Jill Ford, founder of mining equipment procurement specialist BitFord Digital, described this practice as fraudulent and illegal. Ford indicated that while some miners might attempt to under-declare equipment prices by 20-30%, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to get away with it. This suggests that customs authorities may be enhancing scrutiny or that the paper trail for expensive ASIC mining equipment makes it harder to falsify values without detection. Why Evade Customs Duties and Import Tariffs ? The primary motivation behind under-reporting is simple economics: cost reduction. ASIC mining equipment represents a significant capital expenditure for mining operations. Reducing the cost of acquisition, even through potentially illegal means, can directly impact a miner’s profitability, especially in competitive markets or during periods of lower Bitcoin prices. Lower Initial Investment: Paying less in tariffs means a lower upfront cost to deploy mining rigs. Improved Profit Margins: Reduced import costs can translate into higher profit margins per mined Bitcoin over time. Competitive Edge: Companies that illegally reduce costs might gain an unfair advantage over competitors who comply with import regulations and pay full customs duties and import tariffs. However, the short-term financial gain is juxtaposed with significant legal and financial risks. The Risks of Cryptocurrency Import Duty Evasion Engaging in fraudulent activities like under-reporting import values carries severe consequences under U.S. law. These risks extend far beyond simply having to pay the correct amount of duty later. Potential repercussions include: Fines and Penalties: Customs authorities can impose substantial fines, often multiples of the evaded duty amount. Seizure of Goods: The imported ASIC mining equipment can be seized by customs, resulting in a total loss of the hardware investment. Legal Prosecution: Intentional fraud can lead to criminal charges against the individuals and companies involved. Reputational Damage: Being associated with illegal activities can severely harm a company’s reputation within the cryptocurrency industry and with financial partners. Increased Scrutiny: Once flagged, a company may face intense scrutiny on all future imports, causing delays and additional costs. As Jill Ford noted, it is becoming more difficult for companies to successfully under-declare values, suggesting that CBP may be increasing its monitoring of high-value cryptocurrency import shipments, particularly those containing specialized hardware like ASICs. What’s Next for Bitcoin Miners and ASIC Mining Equipment Imports? This report highlights the ongoing challenges and regulatory complexities faced by the global Bitcoin mining industry. As mining operations scale and rely heavily on the import of expensive ASIC mining equipment , navigating international trade regulations and paying appropriate customs duties and import tariffs legally is crucial for sustainable business practices. The increased difficulty in under-reporting suggests that regulatory bodies are becoming more aware of the value and volume of cryptocurrency import activities. Companies involved in importing ASIC mining equipment must ensure strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations to avoid significant legal and financial pitfalls. Legitimate businesses operating in the space will likely welcome stricter enforcement, as it levels the playing field and prevents those engaging in illegal practices from gaining an unfair cost advantage. Summary: The Cost of Cutting Corners Allegations of some Bitcoin miners under-reporting the value of imported ASIC mining equipment to evade customs duties and import tariffs underscore the pressures within the competitive mining industry. While the motive is likely cost reduction, the risks associated with such fraudulent activities, including hefty fines, seizure of assets, and legal consequences, are substantial and illegal. Industry experts note that successfully under-declaring values is becoming harder, indicating increased vigilance from customs authorities regarding cryptocurrency import hardware. For sustainable growth and credibility, compliance with international trade laws remains paramount for all players in the sector.

The appointment comes a little over five months after US President Donald Trump nominated Clayton to take on the role. He replaces Damian Williams, who played a major role in the conviction of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other high-profile crypto cases. Clayton said on April 22 his top priorities would be to protect public safety, ensure the integrity of the US financial system, defend national security interests and combat fraud, particularly against the elderly and most vulnerable. The temporary nature of Clayton’s appointment resulted from Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s use of a blue slip to block Clayton’s confirmation on April 16, effectively preventing a Senate vote and official confirmation of his position. Blue slips can be used by senators to block US attorney or district court judicial nominees in their home states. Clayton is allowed to serve as interim US attorney for up to 120 days without Senate confirmation. After that, he will need to be approved in a Senate vote or receive a temporary extension of his interim status from Manhattan’s federal court. Trump criticized Schumer’s move in an April 17 Truth Social post, pointing out that Clayton received bipartisan support in the Senate and that Clayton complied with all requests asked of him. Source: Donald Trump The interim status of Clayton’s position will last until around Aug. 20. The role will see him as the top law enforcement officer for New York’s Southern District, encompassing the counties of New York, Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Dutchess and Sullivan. The Southern District of New York is the oldest federal court district in the US, and its location in the country’s financial epicenter means it often handles high-profile cases involving white-collar crime.

DeepSeek AI Sees It Hitting $5 in 4 Months,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-025-crypto-outperform-solana-sol-in-2025-deepseek-ai-sees-it-hitting-5-in-4-months/,"Mutuum Finance stands at its fourth presale stage where it has collected $7 million while giving away 417 million tokens to 8,400 holders. DeepSeek AI predicts a price escalation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to $5 during the upcoming four months despite its initial price being $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes a brash market forecast against Solana (SOL) which currently fails to overcome $150 resistance barriers. The declining network interest surrounding Solana allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to gain crypto market attention by delivering its unique lending solution. Will MUTM overtake Solana for top performance during 2025? A thrilling competition is about to unfold between these two entities. Solana’s Stumbling Momentum The crucial moment finds Solana (SOL) in a difficult position. The token currently remains between $135 while it fails to surpass the significant $150 resistance zone which historic trading data indicates as a crucial point of resistance. Houston-files indicate network demand has weakened by 21% since the start of the year through current data. Solana’s short-term meme coin boost could not mask its declining core stability. Since the Relative Strength Index reveals brief signs of bullishness followed by bearish indications the momentum appears short-lived. The failure to maintain positions above the 21-day exponential moving average signals potential SOL price movement to $100 thus undermining its market potential for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has established itself through its innovative approach in the market. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale (MUTM) features tokens available for purchase at $0.025. The project has earned $7 million through its fundraising efforts due to strong purchasing behavior from 8,400 individuals. The current phase 4 sales rate is rapid while phase 5 will start at $0.03 which presents profit opportunities for existing investors. The tokenomics provide investors with a 140% return beginning from the $0.06 listing price and experts anticipate the price will rise to $3.50 after launch for a total return of 13,900%. To bolster trust, the team is undergoing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social channels. This presale’s velocity underscores Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) allure. Innovative Lending Model The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) decentralized finance project has established itself through its combined lending approach. Mutuum Finance operates through a unique integration of peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer networks to support users doing asset loans for income and loans backed by collateral. The team launched a dashboard displaying positions of the top 50 token holders who obtain bonus tokens for keeping their rankings under surveillance to enter a competitive investment environment. The structured nature of the ecosystem stands apart from Solana’s wider but unfocused blockchain structure. The emphasis on useful functionality has led Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to gather yield-seeking investors who want reliable return-on-investment rewards. Mutuum Finance operates its buying and distributing mechanism to maintain consistent demand that will propel its growth through 2025. Outpacing Solana in 2025 The $5 price projection from DeepSeek AI regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives the crypto market a shock by anticipating four-month performance. Solana (SOL) encounters significant challenges because declining transaction volumes combined with resistance barriers stand as major hurdles for attaining its former 2021 success. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents unique investment potential to market participants because it has both affordable start-up costs and well-designed tokenomic system. The 140% gain during listing represents only the starting level investors can anticipate because the $3.50 future price will deliver substantial growth potential. Phase 4’s fleeting availability heightens urgency. The presale is currently available for MUTM tokens on Mutuum finance’s website until the pricing increases so users should visit now. The upcoming 2025 year will potentially transform DeFi through Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which projects to surpass Solana’s future success.

43688296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151636,1745370025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ukraine War: Putin’s Stunning Peace Deal Offer to Trump and its Potential Geopolitical Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ukraine-war-peace-deal-trump/,"In the ever-turbulent world of geopolitics, whispers of potential shifts can send ripples across global markets, including the volatile crypto market . A recent report from Solid Intel on X has ignited significant discussion, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed halting the Ukraine war to pursue a peace deal specifically with former U.S. President Donald Trump . Understanding the Alleged Trump Putin Proposal The core of the report is a striking claim: Vladimir Putin is allegedly willing to freeze the current conflict lines in Ukraine and enter into peace negotiations, but only if his counterpart is Donald Trump. This isn’t just a procedural offer; it’s framed as a highly personalized proposal, bypassing the current Biden administration. Key aspects of this alleged offer: Direct Appeal to Trump: The offer is reportedly contingent on Trump being the U.S. President. Immediate Ceasefire Proposal: The starting point would be a halt to current military actions along existing front lines. Negotiated Peace Agreement: The goal is a comprehensive deal, though details are sparse. Source: The information originates from Solid Intel on X, a source that requires careful verification and context. While this report is unverified and should be treated with caution, the mere suggestion of such a high-stakes negotiation involving two of the world’s most prominent and often unpredictable leaders is enough to capture global attention and fuel speculation about the future of the Ukraine war . Why This Peace Deal Report Matters (Even If Unverified) Reports like this, even from non-official sources, matter because they enter the information ecosystem and can influence perceptions, strategies, and market sentiment. Here’s why this particular claim is noteworthy: 1. The Trump Factor: Donald Trump has historically expressed a desire to quickly resolve the Ukraine conflict and has a complex, often debated, relationship with Vladimir Putin. The idea of Putin seeking a deal specifically with Trump aligns, in theory, with Trump’s past rhetoric about his ability to negotiate directly with world leaders. 2. Potential Shift in Strategy: If true, it could signal a Russian calculation that a future Trump presidency might be more amenable to terms favorable to Moscow than the current administration or other potential Western leaders. 3. Geopolitical Uncertainty: The report adds another layer of uncertainty to an already volatile geopolitical landscape. Will this influence political discourse in the U.S.? How will allies react? What does it mean for ongoing support for Ukraine? 4. Market Reaction Potential: Geopolitical stability (or instability) is a major driver for global markets. A credible path towards ending the Ukraine war could have significant economic implications, potentially impacting everything from energy prices to investor confidence, and yes, even the crypto market . Navigating the Challenges and Skepticism It’s crucial to approach this report with a healthy dose of skepticism. Several significant challenges and questions arise: Source Credibility: Solid Intel on X is a social media account. While some accounts can break news, they lack the institutional verification processes of major news organizations. The report needs independent confirmation from multiple reliable sources. Ukraine’s Position: Any peace deal fundamentally involves Ukraine. It is highly unlikely that Ukraine would agree to freeze the conflict along current lines, especially as it would legitimize Russian territorial gains. Ukraine’s stated position is the full restoration of its territorial integrity. Western Allies’ Unity: The U.S. is part of a coalition supporting Ukraine. A unilateral deal sought by Russia with a specific U.S. president would likely face strong opposition from European allies and NATO members. Domestic Politics: Such a proposal would be intensely scrutinized within U.S. domestic politics, particularly during an election cycle. The terms of any potential deal would face immense debate. Given these factors, while the report is attention-grabbing, it remains speculative until verified by more robust sources or official statements. The Broader Geopolitical Impact and Market Connection Major geopolitical events and potential shifts have a profound impact on global financial markets. The initial invasion of Ukraine, for instance, caused significant volatility in stocks, commodities (especially energy and food), and also the crypto market . How might a potential Trump Putin peace initiative, however distant or unlikely, tie into market dynamics? Reduced Uncertainty: A credible path towards peace could reduce the geopolitical risk premium currently priced into various assets. This might lead to increased investor confidence in traditional markets. Commodity Price Shifts: An end to hostilities could impact oil and gas prices, agricultural commodities, and other resources affected by the conflict and sanctions. Investor Sentiment: Global stability generally fosters positive investor sentiment, encouraging investment in riskier assets. Conversely, uncertainty breeds caution. For the crypto market , the connection is often debated. Cryptocurrencies sometimes act as risk-on assets, moving in tandem with tech stocks. Other times, they are discussed as potential safe havens against inflation or geopolitical instability. The reality is complex and depends on the specific circumstances and investor psychology at the time. A significant reduction in global geopolitical tension, such as the resolution of the Ukraine war , could theoretically reduce the perceived need for ‘safe haven’ assets if crypto is seen in that light by some. Alternatively, increased global economic activity following peace could boost overall liquidity and investment appetite, potentially benefiting crypto. Conversely, the *process* of negotiating such a complex deal, filled with potential setbacks and disagreements, could introduce *more* volatility in the short to medium term. Markets dislike uncertainty, and a drawn-out, unpredictable negotiation would be a prime source of it. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers Given this speculative news and the broader geopolitical impact , what should market participants, including those in the crypto market , consider? 1. Verify Information: Treat reports from social media or unverified sources with extreme caution. Wait for confirmation from reputable news outlets or official government statements before making any investment decisions based on them. 2. Understand the Context: Recognize the political complexities involved. A peace deal is not solely in the hands of the U.S. and Russia; Ukraine and its allies are central players. 3. Monitor Geopolitical Developments: Keep an eye on official statements from Washington, Moscow, Kyiv, and European capitals. These will provide more reliable indicators of potential diplomatic shifts. 4. Assess Risk Tolerance: Understand that geopolitical events are significant drivers of market volatility. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in volatile markets like crypto. 5. Focus on Fundamentals: While macro events matter, don’t lose sight of the fundamentals of the assets you hold. For crypto, this means understanding the technology, adoption rates, and ecosystem developments. 6. Be Prepared for Volatility: Regardless of the outcome of this specific report, the geopolitical landscape remains uncertain. Be prepared for potential price swings in response to news developments. Conclusion: Watching Geopolitics and the Crypto Market The report suggesting Vladimir Putin has offered to halt the Ukraine war for a peace deal with Donald Trump is a fascinating, albeit unverified, development. It highlights the complex interplay between personal relationships, national interests, and the immense challenges of resolving international conflicts. While its immediate credibility is questionable, it serves as a powerful reminder of how geopolitical events, or even the rumour of them, can capture global attention and potentially influence the climate for markets worldwide. For those invested in the crypto market , this report underscores the need to stay informed about global affairs, understand the potential for geopolitical factors to drive volatility, and maintain a disciplined approach based on verified information and long-term strategy rather than reacting impulsively to unconfirmed reports. The path to peace in Ukraine remains uncertain, and navigating its potential impacts requires careful observation and critical thinking.

43688867,https://thecoinrise.com/dragoin-rises-to-become-the-best-crypto-under-1-as-tron-eyes-breakout-and-pengu-drops-26/,1745370056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43688867.jpeg,Dragoin Rises to Become the Best Crypto Under $1 as TRON Eyes Breakout and PENGU Drops 26%,https://thecoinrise.com/dragoin-rises-to-become-the-best-crypto-under-1-as-tron-eyes-breakout-and-pengu-drops-26/,"Investor attention is split as different crypto projects chart wildly different courses this week. Tron (TRX) is holding steady within a bullish triangle pattern, possibly priming for a breakout, while PENGU, the token tied to the Pudgy Penguins community, has plummeted by 26% over the past week. Amid both hesitation and hype, Dragoin ($DDGN) is building differently. It has gathered massive attraction within Stage 1 of its presale and offers more than promise—it has a live product and clear incentives in motion. For traders seeking movement backed by action rather than speculation, Dragoin continues to present a compelling case in an unpredictable environment. Tron: Setup Suggests Breakout Potential Tron (TRX) is drawing bullish interest this week as it continues to consolidate inside a symmetrical triangle formation. Technical analysts have flagged this pattern as a possible launchpad for upward movement. Currently trading above key moving averages and testing the upper boundary of its triangle, TRX is ready for a breakout if momentum holds. Despite broader market uncertainty, Tron has managed to hold its structure. Strong support levels are holding firm, and volume profiles indicate growing participation. Analysts suggest that if TRX breaks above the current formation, a move toward higher price levels could follow quickly. However, until the breakout occurs, traders remain cautious. For investors, Tron’s appeal still lies in its transaction speed and low fees, particularly for smart contract deployment. But short-term gains will depend heavily on whether the breakout materializes—and whether whales or institutions fuel the next wave. PENGU: Community Power Meets Weak Price Action PENGU, the meme coin associated with the Pudgy Penguins community, has dropped more than 26% in just one week. Despite its strong branding and loyal holder base, the token has failed to maintain upward momentum. As of now, its technical outlook shows little recovery, with support zones under pressure and little buyer strength to halt further losses. The decline has raised questions about sustainability in meme coins that lean heavily on community branding but offer little functional interaction or roadmap detail. While PENGU’s association with a well-loved NFT brand brings visibility, its visibility alone hasn’t been enough to stop the price drop. Analysts warn that without fresh developments or utility-based catalysts, PENGU could remain under pressure. It may still find support among loyal users, but investors seeking tangible growth are beginning to shift focus elsewhere. Dragoin: Transparency and Utility from Day One Unlike PENGU’s stalled momentum and Tron’s technical waiting game, Dragoin is executing a very different strategy—one rooted in real-time delivery. Launched on the Ethereum blockchain, Dragoin is currently in Stage 1 of its presale. With massive attention gained already, tokens are available at $0.0000292. The target launch price is set at $0.002, giving early backers the opportunity for a 6,750% ROI if price targets are met. Dragoin’s edge isn’t just in its pricing structure—it’s in the fact that its core product is already functional. The Telegram-based play-to-earn game lets players control dragons, complete challenges, and earn $DDGN tokens. This isn’t a roadmap promise—it’s a live experience already gaining attention. Token allocation reinforces long-term viability: 50% of the 200 billion total supply goes to presale, 30% is reserved for ecosystem and gameplay development, 15% is set aside for liquidity, and 5% is locked for the team over a two-year period. Dragoin has also committed to permanently burning any unsold presale tokens, and ownership of the smart contract will be renounced at launch to ensure decentralization. Unlike other meme projects riding sentiment, Dragoin builds value through user engagement and transparent mechanics. Referral bonuses, staking rewards, and open community updates create a feedback loop where participants are both users and stakeholders. Ending Note Tron and PENGU are on two very different paths—one approaching a possible breakout, the other reeling from a sharp correction. But in both cases, investors are waiting: for price action, for news, for confirmation. Dragoin offers an alternative—a project where progress is already being made. With a live game, a popular presale, and a fixed token strategy, Dragoin isn’t speculating on future adoption—it’s building it. For those seeking exposure to a meme coin with real-time usability and structured opportunity, Dragoin continues to separate itself in a crowded 2025 market.

This question is particularly relevant for those navigating the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market, as global economic shifts often have ripple effects on digital assets. Recent comments from high-level U.S. officials suggest a potential pivot, hinting at a less confrontational approach to the ongoing US China trade relationship. Why is the Tariff Conflict Likely to Ease? U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently offered a significant perspective on the state of the tariff conflict with China. According to reports from Bloomberg, Secretary Bessent stated that the current level of tariff-based conflict is simply “unsustainable” and is therefore “likely to ease.” This assessment from a key economic official signals a potential shift in strategy or at least a recognition of the economic realities imposed by prolonged trade friction. Bessent also clarified that the U.S. is not actively pursuing a policy of “decoupling” from the Chinese economy. Decoupling implies a complete separation of economic ties, which is a far more drastic measure than the targeted tariffs and trade restrictions seen in recent years. The distinction is important, suggesting that while strategic competition remains, a total economic divorce is not the goal. This nuance provides a potentially more optimistic economic outlook regarding future interactions. Progress in Trade Negotiations: What Did the White House Say? Adding to the narrative of potential de-escalation, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also commented on the administration’s trade discussions. Earlier today, she indicated that President Trump is observing “good progress” in trade negotiations, not only with China but also with other countries. While specific details of these negotiations were not disclosed, the mention of progress aligns with Secretary Bessent’s view that the intense trade war dynamics may be softening. The lack of specific details is typical in sensitive trade talks, but the public acknowledgment of positive movement from the White House is notable. It suggests that behind-the-scenes discussions may be paving the way for a reduction in trade barriers or a more stable trade framework between the two economic superpowers. How Do Global Markets React to Trade Tensions? Understanding the potential easing of the US China trade dispute is crucial because trade tensions have a significant impact on global markets . Uncertainty surrounding tariffs, trade balances, and potential restrictions on technology or investment can lead to volatility in stock markets, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. When tensions are high, investors often become risk-averse, potentially pulling back from more speculative assets. Conversely, signs of easing tensions or progress in negotiations can boost investor confidence. A more stable and predictable trade environment reduces economic uncertainty, which can be positive for market sentiment. While the link isn’t always direct, positive sentiment in traditional finance markets can sometimes spill over into the cryptocurrency space, which is often viewed as a risk asset. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? While the news about trade negotiations might seem distant from Bitcoin or Ethereum, developments in global markets and the broader economic outlook are highly relevant to crypto investors. Here’s why: Risk Appetite: Reduced trade tensions can increase overall market risk appetite. When traditional markets are confident and performing well, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Economic Stability: Easing trade friction contributes to greater global economic stability. A more stable macro environment is generally considered more favorable for the growth and adoption of emerging technologies and asset classes like crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Trade dynamics can influence supply chains and the cost of goods, indirectly affecting inflation and central bank monetary policy decisions. These factors are significant drivers of cryptocurrency market movements. Capital Flows: Changes in international trade and investment flows can impact where capital is deployed globally, potentially influencing liquidity in various markets, including crypto. Therefore, monitoring the progress of the trade war and the evolving US China trade relationship provides valuable context for understanding potential shifts in market sentiment and liquidity that could affect your crypto portfolio. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the positive comments, it’s important to acknowledge that resolving the tariff conflict is a complex process with potential challenges. Negotiations can be protracted, and unexpected developments can arise. The underlying strategic competition between the U.S. and China on issues like technology, intellectual property, and geopolitical influence remains. However, the statements from Secretary Bessent and Press Secretary Leavitt offer a hopeful sign that both sides may be looking for ways to de-escalate the most economically damaging aspects of the conflict. A measured approach that seeks to ease the trade war without pursuing complete decoupling could pave the way for a more predictable international trade landscape, which would be a welcome development for global markets and contribute positively to the overall economic outlook . Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Global Economics The indication from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the tariff conflict with China is unsustainable and likely to ease, supported by White House comments on negotiation progress, is a potentially significant development. For participants in the cryptocurrency market, this news underscores the interconnectedness of digital assets with traditional finance and global markets . While the direct impact is not always immediate or obvious, a positive shift in the US China trade relationship could contribute to improved investor sentiment and a more favorable economic outlook globally, influencing capital flows and risk appetite that are vital for the crypto space.

43689074,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=736323,1745371859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43689074.jpeg,"Is The Bitcoin Price Top In At $109,000 Already? What The MVRV Z-Score Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/what-bitcoin-mvrv-z-score-says/,"After months of bullish momentum that pushed the Bitcoin price to an all-time high of over $109,000 earlier this year, analysts are now debating whether that surge marked the official market top. Strengthening this argument, a confluence of technical indicators suggests the market cycle may have already peaked—most notably, the behavior of the Market Value to Real Value (MVRV) Z-Score reinforces this view. MVRV Z-Score Shows Bitcoin Price Has Topped A new technical analysis by crypto analyst Tony Severino, which combines MVRV Z-Score and monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI), is flashing warning signs that Bitcoin‘s market top may already be in. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bullish Confirmation: What Needs To Happen For Next Leg Up To $130,000 Looking at the logarithmic price chart, Bitcoin’s MVRV Z-Score has broken below a long-standing uptrend support line. This pattern is significant, as the Z-Score has always respected the uptrend support lines during bull markets, with similar breaks only emerging after Bitcoin reaches an official market top. Notably, this isn’t the first time Bitcoin has displayed such a trend behavior. Similar support line breaks occurred before BTC’s market peaks during the 2017 and 2021 bull cycles. The bearish argument that Bitcoin may have already reached a price peak is further strengthened by the visual correlation between the Z-Score and Bitcoin’s monthly RSI, which is shown by a black line on the chart. In past cycles, Bitcoin’s RSI fell below 70 twice, indicating fading momentum and weakening price action. Historically, such moves below the 70 level occur shortly after price tops, not before. Even more compelling, the RSI-based Moving Average (MA), highlighted by the orange line on the chart, is now curling downwards. This subtle but strong signal has only appeared in past cycles after the market has already topped, serving as a confirmation rather than a prediction. Taken together, these technical indicators and historical trends strongly suggest that Bitcoin’s $109,000 peak may have marked the top of this market cycle. In line with previous post-top bull market behavior, Bitcoin could now be on the verge of entering a prolonged bear market. This bearish outlook is reinforced by recent steep price corrections, reduced investor confidence, and a clear shift in market sentiment toward caution and uncertainty. Bulls Attempt To Reverse Bitcoin Bearish Outlook In another of his most recent analyses of Bitcoin, Severino revealed that bulls appear to be pushing for a price recovery. The analyst acknowledged that his previously dominant bearish narrative of Bitcoin may soon see a significant shift if bulls can sustain momentum into April’s monthly close. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Open Interest Too High Or Can The BTC Price Still Rally? According to the presented chart, Bitcoin is now testing a key area of interest while simultaneously showing early bullish signs of reversing the bearish crossover on the monthly long-term Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Adding to the intrigue, the possible formation of a Morning Star candlestick pattern reinforces the possibility of a bullish reversal for Bitcoin. Notably, similar chart setups occurred in 2022 and mid-2023, both of which marked major turning points for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. If the cryptocurrency manages to close April with a complete Morning Star pattern, it could force a reevaluation of bearish expectations.

Here’s What the Latest Price Action Signals,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-bitcoin-breaking-free-from-wall-street-heres-what-the-latest-price-action-signals/,"Bitcoin surged past $93,000 on Tuesday, brushing off mounting political tensions and marking a fresh four-week high of $93,988. The move came after former President Donald Trump reignited criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, dubbing him “Mr. Too Late” and demanding immediate interest rate cuts to mitigate inflation stemming from sweeping new tariffs on over 180 countries. Trump’s comments sent a jolt through traditional markets—Wall Street fell sharply, while Bitcoin rallied over 6% in a classic risk-off rotation. Mr. Too Late needs to step it up. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #MrTooLate #LowerRates pic.twitter.com/DgSmvtPFcd — Mark (@sierraranchhome) April 22, 2025 On Truth Social, Trump doubled down on his rhetoric, saying the Fed’s policy missteps had allowed inflation to spiral during the pandemic. His fiery remarks appeared to dent confidence in the Fed’s independence, but they reinforced Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against institutional risk and monetary uncertainty. Crypto Market Reacts: Bitcoin Leads, Altcoins Diverge Bitcoin’s safe-haven appeal is once again in the spotlight. Analysts suggest BTC’s recent breakout isn’t just a technical move—it’s part of a larger macro trend. “When trust in institutions erodes, investors turn to alternatives like Bitcoin and gold,” said Juan Leon, Senior Analyst at Bitwise. Supporting this thesis, gold also hit a new record at $3,442 per ounce. Swan Bitcoin’s Steven Lubka added, “Bitcoin’s strength compared to equities suggests it’s already diverging from traditional risk assets.” Elsewhere in crypto, the market response was bullish: Total Crypto Market Cap: Holding steady at $2.9 trillion Solana (SOL): Up 6% to $147 Dogecoin (DOGE): Up 12% XRP: 5% Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Levels to Watch After peaking at $93,988, Bitcoin has pulled back slightly and is now trading around $93,119. The rally, which began at $88,682, has formed a steep ascending channel on the 4-hour chart. However, the MACD histogram is showing signs of fading momentum, suggesting a possible short-term cooldown. Trade Setup: Buy on Dip: $91,269 or $88,682 Breakout Entry: Above $93,988 with volume Targets: $96,973 and $99,692 Stop Loss: Below $88,682 This is a textbook “wait-for-confirmation” moment. If BTC sustains above $91,269 and reclaims $93,988 on strong volume, it could push toward $97K and beyond. But without confirmation, a dip to the lower trendline or support levels is likely. Best Wallet ($BEST): Presale Surges Past $11.8 M as Launch Nears Best Wallet ($BEST) is quickly emerging as one of the most promising crypto apps of 2025—offering users a secure, streamlined platform to manage digital assets with ease.

Cold Wallet’s 50x Potential Beats MetaMask, Trust Wallet, & Coinbase Wallet Combined",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-to-invest-in-cold-wallets-50x-potential-beats-metamask-trust-wallet-coinbase-wallet-combined/,"Looking for the top crypto to invest in right now? The crypto wallet sector is heating up, and it’s not just about storing your assets anymore. Today’s wallets offer staking, governance, DeFi integration, and more. But one new player is taking things even further, aiming to dethrone MetaMask and rewrite what a wallet can be. Here are five wallet-linked crypto projects that stand out, starting with a presale opportunity that could redefine user ownership. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT) – Builders, Not Buzzwords Too many crypto projects are powered by marketing. Cold Wallet is powered by people who’ve actually built the infrastructure of Web3. Its team includes blockchain engineers who’ve audited top DeFi protocols, cryptographers with expertise in zk-SNARKs, and product veterans who know how to ship tools for millions. Their mission is clear: take the tools institutions trust, and make them accessible to everyone. This isn’t their first bear market. They’ve seen hype come and go, and know that utility, timing, and trust are what drive real adoption. This credibility is backed by a roadmap that’s already underway, with MVP features launching in Q3 and the Cold Wallet Launchpad following in 2026. For those looking to align early with the project, the $CWT token is now in presale stage 1 at $0.007, set to launch at $0.35. This is more than a team of dreamers, it’s a team of doers, builders, and privacy-maximalists. When you back a Cold Wallet, you’re not just buying a token, you’re betting on execution. And this team has the track record to deliver. 2. MetaMask – The Original DeFi Access Point MetaMask is still the go-to Ethereum wallet for millions, and for good reason. Its browser extension and mobile app provide straightforward access to dApps, NFT platforms, and DeFi tools. MetaMask helped define the self-custody movement, and its recent token rumors and growing integration with Layer-2 networks show that it’s not standing still. While MetaMask doesn’t currently offer a public token, it remains a major player in the wallet space. Any future airdrop or native token launch could make it a target for speculation, keeping it relevant on any list of the top crypto to invest in, even if just by association or potential upside. That said, its lack of DAO governance and minimal built-in staking options leaves room for challengers like Cold Wallet to step into a leadership role for community-first wallet platforms. 3. Trust Wallet – A Mobile-First Giant With Staking and Multi-Chain Support Owned by Binance but operating as a decentralized product, Trust Wallet is a heavyweight in the mobile crypto space. It supports hundreds of tokens across dozens of blockchains, with built-in staking for coins like BNB, TRON, and Cosmos. Users can also connect directly to dApps through the in-app browser. Trust Wallet Token (TWT) gives holders a small degree of influence over development and offers occasional rewards or fee discounts. While this utility is limited compared to Cold Wallet’s deep integration of CWT into governance, staking, and rewards, Trust Wallet still makes the list of top crypto to invest in thanks to its massive user base and token accessibility. Its strength lies in convenience, but long-term holders may want a project that ties ownership more closely to platform growth. 4. Coinbase Wallet – Clean UX, Backed by a Giant Coinbase Wallet benefits from its connection to one of the most well-known crypto exchanges in the world. It’s easy to use, integrates seamlessly with the Coinbase app, and supports Ethereum, EVM chains, and NFTs. While it’s non-custodial in practice, its branding and integration with centralized services make it a hybrid solution. Unlike Cold Wallet or Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet doesn’t have a dedicated utility token for governance or staking. This limits its appeal for users seeking tokens that reward them directly for participating in the ecosystem. Still, as an easy onboarding gateway for new users and a stepping stone into full DeFi participation, Coinbase Wallet earns its place among the top crypto to invest in adjacent tools, especially if rumors of tokenization or Web3 expansion plans solidify. 5. MyEtherWallet (MEW) – The Veteran Ethereum Companion MyEtherWallet, or MEW, has been around since 2015 and remains a respected name in Ethereum self-custody. While it lacks a mobile-first design or tokenized governance structure, it’s still widely used by advanced users for interacting with Ethereum directly, including signing transactions, managing ENS names, or accessing complex dApps. MEW doesn’t currently offer a governance token or staking layer, which may make it less attractive for investors looking for upside tied to usage. However, for users prioritizing legacy support and control over Ethereum-native assets, it’s a tool that continues to hold relevance. That said, compared to Cold Wallet, which combines Ethereum support with DAO control, staking incentives, and real-time platform upgrades, MEW feels more like a legacy utility than a growth play. Still, it rounds out the list as a functional option with potential future relevance. Final Thoughts As non-custodial wallets become the new standard for digital asset management, investors are seeking platforms that go beyond storage. Governance rights, staking layers, and ecosystem participation are fast becoming must-haves. That’s why Cold Wallet, with its DAO-first model, deep CWT utility, and 50x presale growth window, currently ranks highest among the top crypto to invest in this sector. For those who want to do more than just store, and actually shape the future of the tools they use, the next wave of wallet tokens is already here. The post Top Crypto to Invest In?

What really matters is timing, tech, and utility. With the 2025 cycle heating up, some projects are showing serious momentum — not just in price charts but in real product delivery and adoption. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, the right mix includes strong infrastructure coins, undervalued platforms, and presales tied to actual working tools. This list breaks down four tokens that tick those boxes. Unstaked is leading with AI-driven automation for Telegram and X. Solana is speeding ahead with low-cost transactions and DeFi growth. TRON continues to dominate stablecoin transfers and smart contracts.Here’s everything you need to know about why these four should be on your radar. 1. Unstaked – Real AI Agents for On-Chain Growth Unstaked is flipping the script on Web3 engagement. Instead of community managers running X and Telegram, users can now deploy their own AI agents — fully autonomous bots that grow, engage, and even moderate communities 24/7. What sets Unstaked apart is its on-chain structure: these agents generate trackable Proof of Intelligence, meaning activity can be verified and rewarded. Each bot costs just $10–$25/month to run, replacing full teams at a fraction of the cost. The token behind it — $UNSD — powers everything. It’s required for agent creation, upgrades, and use across the ecosystem. The tokenomics are tight: 6B total supply, 60% in presale, and no private sales. The price is currently at $0.0065 , aiming for a public listing around $0.1819 — a projected ROI of ~2,700%. With features like Instagram and Discord integration, a marketplace for AI agent modules, and NFT-based upgrades on the roadmap, Unstaked is more than hype — it’s product-first. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, this is where real-world utility meets token traction. 2. Solana – Still the Fastest Lane in DeFi Solana (SOL) keeps proving it can handle scale. With fees under a cent and throughput north of 65,000 transactions per second, it’s a favorite for developers building DEXs, NFTs, and real-time apps. As of mid-April 2025, SOL is trading around $178, recovering well from its March lows and holding strong support levels. Major protocols like Jupiter, MarginFi, and Tensor continue to push traffic to the chain, helping it dominate DEX volume this year. The upcoming Firedancer validator client is expected to increase reliability and speed even further, adding more stability to the network. Institutional players are also starting to revisit SOL after seeing sustained usage and consistent developer activity. That’s the kind of groundwork that builds staying power. For long-term believers or anyone hunting for the best crypto to buy now, Solana still stands as one of the few chains that works under pressure — and works fast. 3. TRON – The Quiet Powerhouse of Stablecoin Transfers TRON (TRX) has carved a niche in the world of stablecoins and smart contracts. It processes the most USDT transfers of any chain — over $40B monthly — with a focus on cost efficiency and transaction speed. TRX is priced around $0.124 as of April 2025 and has maintained a tight trading range, showing resilience in a market filled with volatility. While it doesn’t make a lot of noise, its dominance in on-chain finance tells the real story. With the TRON DAO Reserve actively supporting DeFi projects and ecosystem growth, TRX continues to find utility in payments, remittances, and staking. It’s also becoming a preferred chain for token issuance, especially in Asian markets. The energy fees model, paired with high network uptime, makes it ideal for both users and developers. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now, TRON offers a functional, high-volume chain that’s already running at scale. Best Cryptos To Watch Now With crypto, the timing of entry matters — but so does the actual product. A good long-term play should offer both utility and upside, not just speculative hype. That’s what connects the four projects on this list. Unstaked brings automation to the frontlines of community building, with real AI agents and an ROI-focused presale. Solana is showing continued growth in DeFi, NFT, and payment applications. TRON powers massive stablecoin volumes and offers low-cost, high-efficiency transfers. If you’re narrowing down the best crypto to buy now, use this guide as your shortlist. From enterprise-grade blockchains to AI-backed presales, these projects cover multiple use cases and stages of growth. Just remember — the projects that survive and grow are the ones with real users, working products, and solid economics. All four of these check those boxes.

However, it still shows a bearish Death Cross on the daily chart, keeping the outlook mixed. While DOGE gained 6% to reach $0.166, its inability to hold momentum beyond that has left traders watching closely. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows signs of potential rebound with growing on-chain activity. Yet, SHIB also faces tough resistance ahead. Both remain well-known digital assets, but a new name is now drawing stronger interest. BlockDAG (BDAG) is attracting attention with fast growth and a compelling offer. Its presale has crossed the $216 million mark, and large-scale buyers are moving in fast. A special code—BDAG1200—unlocks a 600% bonus for early participants. This limited-time offer is expected to end once BlockDAG’s beta testnet reaches capacity, creating urgency among those tracking emerging projects. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Setup Sends Mixed Signals Recent Dogecoin (DOGE) activity showed a short-lived Golden Cross after prices rose 6% to $0.166. This setup, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day, often signals upward potential. However, the presence of a Death Cross on the daily chart still casts doubt. This contradiction is splitting short- and long-term sentiment. DOGE volume hit 71 million in just 24 hours, showing strong interest. Still, technical levels are critical. The current resistance stands at $0.181. If DOGE breaks through, it could rise to $0.257. But failure to hold support may send prices down to $0.142 or even $0.129. These mixed signals make the next move unclear. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Analysis Hints at Bounce Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently hit $0.00001175, marking an 11% rise over the past week. Its RSI is around 35, indicating oversold territory and potential for a short-term bounce. However, SHIB faces resistance at $0.00001222, while support remains near $0.00001066. A bullish engulfing candle on the weekly chart is drawing attention, but many are waiting for confirmation. Meanwhile, activity on Shibarium is rising, and whale inflows are up 315%. These signs support SHIB’s ongoing use case. Still, trader sentiment remains mixed, with just 24% feeling optimistic. Targets range from $0.00001414 to as high as $0.00002644 if momentum picks up. Whales Are Rushing to BlockDAG’s 600% Bonus Before It Ends BlockDAG’s presale is breaking records, with over $216 million raised and 19.3 billion coins sold so far. But it’s not just the numbers turning heads—whales are entering fast, drawn in by a limited-time 600% bonus using the BDAG1200 code. This exclusive offer won’t last long. Once BlockDAG’s beta testnet hits full capacity, the bonus ends. Right now, BlockDAG is in Batch 27, and each coin is priced at $0.0248—a sharp rise from just $0.001 in Batch 1. That’s a 2,380% surge in value for early participants. The testnet is already live, and users are earning 10,000 testnet coins and competing for $2,000 BDAG rewards. BlockDAG isn’t all hype—it’s delivering. The beta testnet includes a real-time explorer, a no-code token creator, decentralized apps (dApps), and weekly airdrops. So far, over $6.9 million worth of miners have been sold, and more than 17,000 units are already in users’ hands. The project has also locked in 10 CEX listings for 2025, positioning itself for a strong market debut. With this kind of momentum and product delivery, BlockDAG is moving beyond early hype—it’s proving it can scale. Between the rising presale ROI and the countdown on the 600% bonus, BlockDAG is being seen as one of the top crypto coins to watch heading into 2025. Key Points Dogecoin (DOGE) shows short-term promise, but its conflicting signals make the long-term picture unclear. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is nearing a possible bounce zone, but its progress depends on stronger confirmation and ongoing on-chain strength. The bigger momentum appears to be with BlockDAG. It’s $216 million presale, a 600% bonus using BDAG1200, and an active testnet have set it apart.

Big moves aren’t holding. Rallies stall halfway. Charts flash green, then turn grey before anything plays out. According to the latest Bittensor price analysis, $TAO jumped 55% after rebounding off $205, slicing through its wedge formation—but momentum paused just under a long-standing resistance. Algorand crypto news is leaking confidence—301 million tokens pulled from staking, and its price is now dragging near yearly lows. When the market starts feeling unstable, scammers show up. They know uncertainty makes people reckless. They know how to look real until it’s too late. Web3 ai ($WAI) was built for this exact moment. It tracks smart contracts, scans sentiment shifts, and flags hidden risks before they surface. That level of insight is exactly why the project is seeing real traction. In Stage 1 of its presale, the $WAI token has already attracted serious investors. TAO Price Analysis: Rally Pauses at Key Resistance After bouncing off the $205 support level, Bittensor (TAO) surged over 55%, cutting through a short-term wedge and landing just below a 134-day descending resistance. However, according to the latest TAO price analysis, weekly indicators like RSI and MACD still flash neutral-to-bearish. The daily chart offers more clarity: bullish divergences suggest TAO is in wave A of an A-B-C corrective structure, with room to climb toward the $350–$385 range. For now, this Bittensor price analysis shows momentum is building, but without a clean break above trendline resistance, the breakout story remains unfinished. Algorand Crypto News: Staking Exodus Weighs Heavily on ALGO Price The latest Algorand crypto news paints a cautious picture, with ALGO hovering near yearly lows around $0.1865. Staking outflows have surged—over 301 million tokens exited the network in the past month, despite a reward rate above 7%. This signals growing hesitation among long-term holders. ALGO’s charts aren’t offering relief either. A death cross has formed, and the price has broken key Fibonacci support. As bearish pressure builds, this Algorand crypto news reinforces what the charts already suggest: without a shift in sentiment or on-chain strength, deeper lows remain on the table. Scam Risk in Crypto Is Real – Web3 ai Is Built to Catch It Scams in crypto rarely announce themselves. They blend in, play the part, and vanish with funds before most investors realize something was off. That’s the risk that Web3 ai decided to face head-on by building a system that sees past the surface. The platform’s Crypto Scam Detector doesn’t rely on red flags alone. It analyzes smart contracts, traces team credibility, tracks suspicious social sentiment patterns, and compares behavior against a historical fraud database. It’s not watching one data point – it’s watching everything. And when something doesn’t line up, it acts. The same goes for risk. Web3 ai uses statistical models like Monte Carlo simulations and GARCH to forecast where exposure could lead, not just where it’s been. That level of insight gives users a chance to adjust before the fallout. And that foundation is already drawing serious traction. Web3 ai’s crypto presale has attracted serious attention, and it’s still only in Stage 1, priced at just $0.0003 per $WAI. With a projected launch value of $0.005242, the math points to a 1747% ROI for those getting in early. But what really separates Web3 ai is that it’s not asking users to trust blindly. It’s giving them the tools to verify, detect, and protect without needing to become experts themselves. That kind of security, baked into every decision, is rare in crypto. Which is the Best Crypto for 2025? To sum up the latest Bittensor price analysis: TAO is up 55%, but without a breakout above that 134-day resistance, it’s just potential on pause. ALGO? It’s sitting at its lows. Over 301 million tokens have been pulled, and a 7% reward rate isn’t enough to keep people in. Both projects carry long-term potential, but right now, that potential is weighed down by hesitation and risk. Web3 ai approaches the equation differently. Its current Stage 1 price of $0.0003 paired with a projected launch value of $0.005242 puts early ROI at 1747%. But it’s not just the math that makes it the best crypto for 2025 —it’s the structure. From scam detection to risk modeling, Web3 ai isn’t just promising profit. It’s creating the perfect conditions for it!

If you remember watching it go from a few bucks to hundreds, then you already know how brutal that feeling of missing out can be. You scroll through charts, see the growth, and think, “Why didn’t I just jump in sooner?” That’s the thing with crypto—those who act early, eat early. But if you’re still on the hunt for the next popular crypto coin to buy that hasn’t blown up yet, you’re about to find one that’s still under $0.20 and moving fast. Qubetics ($TICS) is that second-chance moment you’ve been waiting for. While most people are distracted by coins that have already done their run, Qubetics is still in presale and already heating up. With over 509 million tokens sold, it’s clear that early buyers are getting in before the price floor shifts again. The Qubetics presale offers not just a low entry point, but also real-world use cases, which are honestly rare in the space. This isn’t just a hype play. Its tokenization marketplace brings real-world utility, and the fact that each stage lasts only seven days—with a 10% price hike at every new level—is creating serious FOMO across the board. If you’re still on the fence, this might be your final nudge. Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy—And You Still Have a Shot Qubetics early supporters who joined its whitelist had the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 with zero upfront investment. Qubetics started its journey on September 29, 2024, and you’ve already missed a ton of those low-entry stages. But here’s the deal—it’s not too late yet. Qubetics is currently in its 31st presale stage, priced at just $0.1902. Over 509 million tokens have already been sold, with more than $16.3 million raised and a growing holder base of 25,100+. That tells you one thing—people aren’t sleeping on this. They’re making moves. If you’re someone who missed out on Litecoin, this is a clear do-over. Let’s talk numbers. With the current Qubetics presale price, an investment of $1,000 gives you about 5,256 $TICS. Now, if the token hits just $1 post-presale, that’s already a $5,255.90 bag. But it gets wilder—at $5, you’re looking at over $25,000. And if it reaches $10 after the mainnet launch? That same $1K becomes over $51,553.02. Yeah, let that sink in. A shot at 5,155% ROI for those who move now. This isn’t just potential—it’s math. What makes Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy isn’t just hype, it’s real application. Its flagship product is a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace that gives everyone—from small business owners to art collectors—a way to digitize and fractionalize their physical assets. Think of a landlord turning their apartment into tradable digital tokens, or a company in logistics tokenizing its fleet assets to gain liquidity without selling them outright. That’s the kind of utility that makes institutions and individuals both take notice. And with tokenized ownership, people can trade, sell, or invest in chunks—breaking the traditional barriers of capital and control. This is exactly why Qubetics is quickly rising among the popular crypto coin to buy picks. It isn’t another meme. It’s a tech-driven platform tapping into trillion-dollar traditional industries. And the kicker? Its mainnet launch is scheduled for Q2 2025. Once that hits and the utility becomes fully active, don’t be shocked if the price rockets well beyond $10. For now, the Qubetics presale still offers a 10% discount before the next stage hits, but every hour that passes is one step closer to missing it again. This isn’t just a good entry—it’s the best crypto presale in motion right now. Litecoin Already Ran—You Blinked, It Passed You Litecoin was that coin everyone heard about but few truly believed in until it already did a 100x. Launched in 2011 at just a few cents, it quietly crept up in value while Bitcoin took the spotlight. Then boom—its all-time high in the last bull cycle pushed above $400. The community watched a coin once seen as “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” hit center stage, offering speedier transactions and lower fees that helped define its unique edge. But by the time the headlines caught up, the price had already soared, leaving thousands watching from the sidelines again. Those early Litecoin moments taught the entire crypto community a hard lesson—sleeping on innovation costs you big. Since its launch, Litecoin has stayed consistent in performance and maintained a firm spot in the top 30 cryptos globally. But the biggest gains? They already happened. Litecoin now serves more as a digital asset of stability than the explosive opportunity it once was. If you’re hunting for that ground-floor moment again, you’re going to have to shift your eyes toward newer projects with bold use cases and serious scalability. And that brings us back to Qubetics. Just like Litecoin had a mission and stuck to it, Qubetics is going after tokenized real-world assets in a way that’s practical and scalable. While Litecoin filled the need for faster payments back in the day, Qubetics is about to fill the trillion-dollar gap between physical ownership and decentralized digital access. For anyone still chasing a story like Litecoin’s but at the very beginning, Qubetics is sitting right in front of you. Don’t make it another “I should’ve bought it at $0.20” story. Conclusion: Don’t Regret This One Too—Qubetics Is Still the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy There’s a reason early adopters keep raving about Qubetics—it’s got that rare mix of affordability, application, and clear upside. Unlike Litecoin, which already had its breakout, Qubetics is still letting you in before the explosion. It’s the popular crypto coin to buy right now if you’re looking for something real, underpriced, and packed with ROI potential. And let’s not ignore the numbers—over half a billion tokens gone, over $16 million raised, and thousands already backing it while it’s still under $0.20? That’s not just hype, that’s traction. Crypto doesn’t give second chances often. If you’re serious about not missing another run like Litecoin’s, then join this crypto presale now. Qubetics is still in reach, but it won’t be for long. The clock’s ticking on this one, and every day you wait is another presale stage closer to higher prices. Don’t just read about the next big thing—this time, be part of it.

Bitcoin Surges 10%+ in Sudden Upside Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/crypto-comeback-bitcoin-surges-92k/,"Bitcoin price is moving higher above the $92,500 zone. BTC is gaining pace and might continue higher above the $94,000 zone in the near term. Bitcoin found support at $88,000 and started a decent upward move. The price is trading above $90,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $90,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $94,000 zone. Bitcoin Price Gains Over 10% Bitcoin price remained stable above the $85,000 level and started a fresh increase . BTC was able to climb above the $88,000 and $90,000 resistance levels. The bulls were able to pump the price above the $92,000 resistance. It even spiked and tested the $94,000 resistance zone. A high is formed near $93,888 and the price is consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $86,400 swing low to the $93,888 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $91,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $90,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $93,500 level. The first key resistance is near the $94,000 level. The next key resistance could be $95,000. A close above the $96,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $97,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $98,000 level. Downside Correction In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $94,000 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $92,000 level. The first major support is near the $91,500 level.

His post, seen over 10.7 million times, highlights a common trick used by scammers—using fake profiles to lure victims. In 2023, crypto scams led to $3.9 billion in losses. Scammers often promise big profits and use fake websites or endorsements. Musk’s post is a reminder to stay alert and avoid shady crypto offers.

The company blamed weak demand on political backlash and global trade uncertainty. It pulled back its 2025 forecast and warned of near-term challenges. Despite this, Tesla confirmed plans to launch new, affordable models and a robotaxi by June. Analysts said the stale vehicle lineup and Musk’s political role have hurt the brand, with calls growing for him to refocus on Tesla.

Block Earner’s crypto-linked fixed-yield earning product is not a financial product, or a managed investment scheme, and is not a derivative under the Corporations Act, Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button said in an April 22 judgment. The trio said Block Earner’s yield product couldn’t be classed as an investment or financial product because users loaned crypto under fixed terms for interest payments and didn’t pool contributions to generate further benefits. The terms and conditions framed it as a loan, and users had no exposure to the firm’s business outside of the agreed interest rate, they added. A court has dismissed the legal proceedings against Block Earner and ordered Australia's financial regulator to pay costs. Source: ASIC The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), which first brought the case, has been ordered by the court to pay costs for the proceedings, including appeals. The regulator said in an April 22 press release that it is currently “considering this decision.” Block Earner’s chief commercial officer, James Coombes, told Cointelegraph the court decision brings clarity that crypto assets shouldn’t be treated differently from other asset classes when applying existing laws. “Our product was simply defined as one where customers would lend their assets to us for a fixed return, there was no share in the upside of the pool of assets and as such no Managed Investment Scheme existed,” he said. “The fact that it included crypto assets should not alter that simple definition, and I believe this case forms a bedrock for ambitious brands around Australia to build from.” An ASIC spokesperson declined further comment. Earner product won’t make a return Despite the win in court, Block Earner will not be reviving its Earner product after axing it when legal proceedings began, but Coombes said that “crypto-backed loans products remain the core focus of the company.” “Regulation going forward is not an easy task, and we empathise with the regulators on this point,” Coombes added. “We hope a collaborative process can bring about positive change.” Related: Australia outlines crypto regulation plan, promises action on debanking ASIC launched civil legal proceedings in November 2022 , arguing that Block Earner needed an Australian Financial Services License to offer its three crypto-linked fixed-yield earning products. In February 2024, an Australian court initially found the fintech firm would need a financial services license to operate its crypto yield-bearing products. Another June 2024 ruling released Block Earner from any financial penalties because it had “acted honestly” and pursued its legal opinions before launching the products, which ASIC appealed.

33767162,[object Object],1745377212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Broader Than SEC’s Case: Oregon AG Lawsuit Against Coinbase Calls 31 Cryptocurrencies ‘Unregistered Securities’,https://bitcoinist.com/broader-than-secs-case-oregon-ag-lawsuit-against-coinbase-calls-31-cryptocurrencies-unregistered-securities/,"Oregon’s Attorney General (AG) has listed XRP and 30 other cryptocurrencies as alleged “unregistered securities” in its state-level complaint against Coinbase. The lawsuit follows the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to drop its case against the crypto exchange, which has led industry figures and investors to call the move an unlawful and “politically motivated” action. XRP, SOL, And ADA Called ‘Unregistered Securities’ Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a complaint against Coinbase on April 18, alleging the US-based crypto exchange had violated the Oregon securities law by facilitating the sale of unregistered cryptocurrencies to the state’s residents. The court document, filed in in Multnomah County Circuit Court, states that the crypto exchange “has continuously and repeatedly violated the Oregon Securities Law, which ascribes liability to persons ´who [s]ell[] or successfully solicit[] the sale of a security … in violation of the Oregon Securities Law’ (ORS 59.115(1)(a)), as well as to persons who ‘participate[] or materially aid[] in the sale’ (ORS 59.115(3)).” On Monday, Paradigm’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs, Justin Slaughter, highlighted that the Oregon AG’s complaint is a “true kitchen sink lawsuit,” covering significantly more tokens than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s case. The lawsuit claims that the crypto exchange offered and sold 31 cryptocurrencies as investment contracts. The list of alleged “unregistered securities” includes AAVE, ADA, ALGO, AMP, APE, ATOM, AVAX, AXS, CHZ, COMP, DASH, DDX, EOS, FIL, FLOW, ICP, LCX, LINK, MATIC, MIR, MKR, NEAR, POWR, RLY, SAND, SOL, UNI, VGX, WLUNA, XRP, and XYO. Journalist and Podcast host Eleanor Terret noted that Rayfield’s complaint names 18 more cryptocurrencies than the SEC originally named in its case, which listed 13 tokens: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO. For context, the SEC sued Coinbase in June 2023, claiming the platform was an unregistered securities exchange. The regulatory agency argued that the exchange operated as an unregistered broker-dealer and illegally sold unregistered securities through its staking program. Nonetheless, the lawsuit was dismissed in February 2025. Coinbase Slams Oregon AG’s Lawsuit Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Paul Grewal, stated that “no matter your asset or project,” the Oregon Attorney General has “accused you of violating securities laws and fleecing your token holders.” In his Monday post, He added that the exchange had notified around 560,000 of its users in Oregon “about the unlawful action taken in their name.” Last week, Grewal called the lawsuit an “embarrassing waste of Oregon taxpayer dollars.” Rayfield argues that Coinbase sold high-risk investments without being properly vetted to protect consumers, causing significant losses for Oregonians. Nonetheless, Grewal has criticized the legal action, suggesting the lawsuit is politically motivated after the complaint omitted key details. Look no further than section 9, where it 1) omits Judge Failla’s order granting interlocutory appeal of the @SECGov case; 2) omits any mention of Judge Torres’ decision in XRP; and 3) bears the stamp of the two private law firms brought on to profit from this suit; 4) labels the Chairman of the SEC as a “crypto lobbyist” and 5) decries the reassignment of Gensler’s lead lawyer to the IT department. Not exactly subtle. Coinbase’s CLO has also stated that the Attorney General’s office had “made it clear” that they were “literally picking up where the Gary Gensler SEC left off.” Grewal considers that Oregon AG’s “copycat case” is attempting to “resurrect” the Commission’s long-criticized regulatory approach, which was recently dropped. Notably, the SEC has pivoted from its “regulation by enforcement” strategy to oversee the sector under the crypto-friendly Trump administration. As part of its shift, the regulatory agency has scaled back on its special crypto enforcement unit, closed or paused most of its major litigations, and created the Crypto Task Force to oversee the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework.",Crypto News|ADA|coinbase|Coinbase CLO|Coinbase Lawsuit Oregon|Oregon AG|Oregon Attorney General|Oregon vs Coinbase|Paul Grewal|SOL|total|total crypto market cap|unregistered securities|US SEC|XRP,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-23 03:00:12

After climbing steadily, XRP is now facing a critical test near the $2.10–$2.20 resistance zone — a level that could determine the asset’s next major move. Despite this hurdle, recent data points to strong underlying network activity that supports the bullish case. Related Reading: Solana Short-Term Indicator Signals Potential Risk – Reversal Or Pause? According to Glassnode, XRP network activity surged 67.50% in recent days, with the number of active addresses jumping from 27,352 to 40,366. This spike in activity suggests growing interest and participation on-chain, a key indicator often associated with sustained momentum. As investors closely monitor the broader market’s reaction to macroeconomic events, XRP stands out as a token that continues to draw attention based on both price performance and blockchain engagement. With bulls attempting to break through resistance, the coming days will be crucial for XRP’s trajectory. A successful breakout could ignite a fresh rally, while a rejection may invite short-term consolidation. Either way, XRP’s rising on-chain metrics indicate the asset remains firmly on investors’ radar. XRP Market Eyes Breakout As Active Addresses Surge XRP bulls are holding strong as the market braces for its next major move. After staying consistently above the $1.80 level, XRP now appears well-positioned to continue its upward momentum. Analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic, especially as the broader macroeconomic environment hints at eventual easing. Once tensions between global superpowers begin to cool and markets gain clarity, many believe a large surge across crypto assets, led by XRP, could follow. While sentiment grows more positive, some analysts warn of another leg down before a true breakout occurs. They suggest the market may need to establish a stronger demand base by dipping below current lows to shake out weak hands. This view contrasts with the more bullish narrative, but both sides agree: a major move is brewing. Adding to the bullish thesis, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared key data from Glassnode showing a significant uptick in XRP network activity. Over the past few days, active addresses on the XRP Ledger jumped 67.50%, rising from 27,352 to 40,366. This spike signals heightened user engagement and increasing on-chain demand — often a precursor to notable price movement. With network activity accelerating and price structure holding firm, XRP may be nearing a critical inflection point. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Sets $3,000 Target As Price Action Signals Momentum – Details Price Faces Key Technical Test: Can Bulls Defend $2 Level? XRP is currently trading at $2.10, showing resilience near a critical support zone. However, a technical warning is flashing on the chart. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) is on the verge of crossing below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a pattern that often signals weakening bullish momentum or potential market fatigue. This development places added pressure on bulls to defend the $1.95 support level. A breakdown below this point could lead to further downside and reset market sentiment. For now, holding above this zone remains crucial to maintain short-term bullish structure and avoid a larger retracement. On the upside, a decisive breakout above the $2.25 level would confirm renewed buying interest and mark the beginning of a recovery rally. Such a move could take XRP toward the upper boundary of its current range and reignite momentum across the broader altcoin market.

That one comment from the White House kicked off an after-hours rally across stocks and crypto, reversing earlier tension that had been building after Trump spent the last week trashing Powell and calling for his removal. The president’s sudden but typical 180, after days of calling Powell a “major loser,” came hours after he’d demanded interest rates be cut and posted that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 444 points, or 1.1%. S&P 500 futures climbed 1.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures moved up 1.6%. That was just hours after the Dow had already finished the day up over 1,000 points, cutting short a four-day losing streak. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed Tuesday with gains above 2%, sending a clear signal that investors were reacting directly to Trump’s remarks on Powell. Dollar, Bitcoin and crypto push higher after Trump talks Powell Bitcoin rose about 3% overnight, trading at $92,727 on Wednesday, right after Trump’s press comments hit. Smaller tokens joined the move: Ether, XRP, and Solana were all up in the hours after Trump gave Powell a pass. Source: TradingView The US dollar also surged by approximately 0.9% against the Japanese yen after a period of significant weakness, with the greenback having hit a three-year low against a basket of major currencies on April 21, as measured by the ICE Dollar Index, which fell to 97.92. Trump’s decision not to remove Powell came right after Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, told investors in a private meeting Tuesday that the tariff war with China couldn’t be maintained by either side. He said both governments would need to find a way to de-escalate and avoid permanent damage to their economies. More fuel landed on the crypto fire when a late-night report revealed that Cantor Fitzgerald LP, Tether Holdings Ltd., and SoftBank Group were in talks to build a $3 billion special purpose acquisition company that would be designed to absorb billions in crypto holdings. Traders expect a short-term pullback while gold keeps rising Despite the spike, some traders warned the move might not hold. Stefan von Haenisch, who leads over-the-counter trading in Asia-Pacific for Bitgo, said the crypto market had run too far, too fast. “The market has rallied relentlessly and feels a bit overbought here,” Stefan said . He added that a drop to $88,000 for Bitcoin would “not be unexpected” before the week is over. While Bitcoin and stocks were climbing, some investors weren’t buying it. They’ve been shifting into gold for weeks, and that trend hasn’t stopped. Gold futures have surged over 8% this month, and on Tuesday they hit a record high of $3,509.90. People are keeping their cash in gold while they watch the political noise play out. Jamie Cox, the managing partner at Harris Financial Group, said that move is temporary. “There is a ton of money hiding out in gold at the moment, so there’s plenty of unproductive money that will find its way back into the market at some point,” Jamie said. “The money is there, it’s just yellow at the moment.” The big takeaway from all of this: one sentence from the President of the United States can still move every corner of global finance. Stocks, Bitcoin, gold, everything—it all reacts to Trump’s mood, especially when it’s about the Federal Reserve. On Monday he was ready to fire Powell. On Tuesday he changed his mind. By Wednesday morning, markets had added trillions in value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The SEC said on April 22 that it had charged Ramil Palafox, a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, claiming he misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds gained through his company, PGI Global, between January 2020 and October 2021. The regulator alleged Palafox used a multilevel marketing model to execute a “Ponzi-like” scam until the company’s collapse in 2021. The SEC said he lured investors through “false claims of crypto industry expertise and a supposed AI-powered auto-trading platform.” The SEC claimed Palafox hosted lavish events in Dubai and Las Vegas to recruit new members who were offered referral bonuses to recruit others and used investor funds to pay other investors to further promote the scheme, as well as to line his own pockets. Excerpt from the SEC’s complaint against Ramil Palafox. Source: SEC “Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds,” said Scott Thompson, associate director of the SEC’s Philadelphia office. The SEC is charging Palafox with violating the anti-fraud and registration provisions of the federal securities laws and is seeking a permanent injunction to ban him from the future sale of securities and crypto assets, repayment of ill-gotten gains and civil penalties. Justice Department files twin action The SEC’s complaint is running parallel to action brought by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which arraigned Ramil Palafox on criminal charges. According to an indictment filed under seal on March 13, federal prosecutors charged Palafox with wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions. Prosecutors alleged Palafox misled investors with false promises of daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 3% from Bitcoin trading and hid information about PGI’s profitability, licenses, and business activity. The indictment said Palafox told investors that substantial returns were being generated via the company’s crypto exchanges and that “his traders were able to make money regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin was going up or down.” However, the Justice Department alleged that, in reality, most investors' money was never used to buy or trade Bitcoin, and many lost some or all of their funds. Property listed in the indictment that would be forfeited by Palafox if convicted includes over $1 million in cash, 17 vehicles, including two Teslas, a Ferrari 458 Special, two Lamborghinis, and two Porsches, plus a variety of designer bags, wallets, shoes, jewellery and watches. Related: Crypto crime goes industrial as gangs launch coins, launder billions — UN Various linked companies were included in the scheme, including the Praetorian Group International Trading Inc., the website for which was seized by the Department of Justice in 2021, leading to its UK-based operations being shut down by the UK’s High Court. It’s the agency’s first crypto-related case under its crypto-friendly SEC chair, Paul Atkins, who was sworn in on April 22. The SEC had brought a case against Nova Labs in January, accusing it of selling unregistered securities by offering devices that mined the Helium ( HNT ) token. The SEC reached a settlement with Nova Labs in April that resulted in the lawsuit being dismissed and a $200,000 civil penalty.

The funds are expected to go live later in 2025, subject to regulatory approval. Trump Media plans to invest some of its cash reserves into the ETFs, which will be launched alongside a number of Truth.Fi Separately Managed Accounts. The US law firm Davis Polk will be advising on the development and launch of the products. The initiative is part of the firm’s financial services and fintech strategy, using up to $250 million custodied by Charles Schwab following a partnership agreement with the bank in January. The finalization of the agreement follows Trump Media and Crypto.com signing a non-binding deal in March . It's set to be the latest crypto-related venture involving Trump and his family. The Trumps helped launch a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, in October, which has a linked token and plans for a stablecoin. President Trump’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., have also gone in on a crypto mining venture called American Bitcoin.

The sell-off also sparked a broader debate about the role of ‘safe-haven’ assets in the wake of global and economic uncertainty. Trump called Powell a “major loser” and warned that the U.S. economy could slow down unless interest rates are lowered immediately. He wrote on Truth Social that “‘Preemptive Cuts’ in Interest Rates are being called for by many.” Financial market drops amid Trump’s attack on Powell US stocks and dollar sink as Trump renews attacks on Fed chair Powell Currency sell-off intensifies after president steps up criticism of central bank head for not cutting rates — Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) April 22, 2025 The President argued that there is currently “virtually No Inflation” in the U.S. and that costs for energy and “most other things” are on the decline. Trump also added that, with costs trending downward just like he predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, “but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Trump’s latest remarks raised questions in his administration about whether they can legally fire the Fed Chair before his term expires in May 2026. Risk-off investments, including long-term bonds and the U.S. dollar, which are considered historical hedges against volatility, aggressively sold off yesterday, parallel to the sharp drop in the stock market. The dollar (DX-Y.NYB) plummeted to its lowest since 2022, while the 10-year yield (^TNX) rose back above 4.4%. The 10-year yield continued to trade around 4.4% on Tuesday while the U.S. dollar index dropped below the 100 level, which is a key psychological and technical level. The markets showed unusual developments because they appeared to pull back instead of investors moving to safe havens like bonds or U.S. currencies. Wall Street warns of a ‘sell America’ trade A rare “SELL AMERICA” moment is unfolding. For the first time since 1981, the US dollar index is down over 5%, the S&P 500 is off more than 5%, and 10-year Treasury yields have climbed 10bps—all in just a month. That combo hasn’t hit since the double-dip recession days. pic.twitter.com/tkB07G4o8T — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) April 21, 2025 The unusual market development depicts a rare dislocation Wall Street strategists have dubbed the “sell America” trade. The chaotic market dynamics have raised concerns over stagflation, where growth stalls, inflation persists, and unemployment rises, keeping Wall Street on edge that shifting trade dynamics could induce a self-inflicted recession. Wall Street saw investors move into commodities like gold, which rallied to yet another record on Tuesday, reaching $3,500 per ounce of gold. Investors also rushed to speculative positions such as Bitcoin, which traded near $91,000 for the first time since February. Fears of political interference in monetary policy might have triggered Monday’s sharp decline, but the exact catalyst remains unclear amid pressure from tariffs, slowing growth, and escalating geopolitical tensions. “This is not a good spot to be in in terms of narrative. No one’s betting against America, but no one’s saying, ‘Oh, we should be going all in over there right now, either.” -Ann Berry, founder of Threadneedle Ventures. JPMorgan also noted that U.S. equity ETFs realized net outflows of $3.6 billion last week, while developed international markets saw above-average inflows totaling $3 billion. The financial institution acknowledged that it was a notable shift given how heavily U.S. markets rely on foreign capital. Chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management, Callie Cox, maintained that foreign investors own nearly a third of U.S. equities and more than a quarter of U.S. government debt. Cox noted that “Wall Street is America’s secret weapon of global dominance.” She also argued that it’s because the U.S. has innovative companies, strong institutions, and a stable rule of law. “Every one of those factors has been called into question lately,” Cox added. Micheal Goosay, chief investment officer of global fixed income at Principal Asset Management, believes that international investors who are supporters of the U.S. Treasury market “are getting a little nervous.” He argued that, whether it’s related to government uncertainty and policy uncertainty or growth and inflation uncertainty, it was undermining some of the confidence they have. In the wake of economic uncertainty, some argue about the long-term prospects of safe havens. Kevin Khang, senior economist at Vanguard, puts it “At the minimum, this reminds all of us that the world is watching whether the U.S. is going to continue its role as a provider [of] stability.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he had “no intention of firing” Powell . He also suggested that the steep tariffs his administration imposed on China could be reduced, saying they “will come down substantially,” although he added they “won’t be zero.” Bitcoin Breakout Follows Trump’s Retreat from Fed Showdown The remarks marked a sharp shift in tone from earlier this week, when Trump labelled Powell a “major loser” and hinted at firing him. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough, despite nominating Powell to lead the central bank in 2017. . @POTUS on Fed Chair Jerome Powell: ""I have no intention of firing him.

Bitcoin rose to $93,055, extending its gains to over 11% for the week. US stock futures also jumped, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures climbing in after-hours trading. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin tend to rally during times of perceived policy uncertainty or weakening confidence in traditional financial systems. Trump’s recent attacks on the Fed, paired with signs of political interference, have likely fuelled demand for decentralised assets that operate outside of central bank control. Trump Retreats on Powell Threat After Market Jitters Trump’s comments followed reports that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had raised the legal question of whether the president could remove Powell , a move that spooked markets and drew concern from economists about undermining the Fed’s autonomy. The Fed has maintained a cautious stance on further rate cuts, citing inflation that remains above its 2% target. Last week, Powell warned that the White House’s escalating tariffs could drive prices even higher. Trump responded by criticizing Powell’s stance and escalating threats to remove him. On Tuesday, however, Trump walked back those statements, telling reporters: “The press runs away with things. No, I have no intention of firing him.” The post Bitcoin Rips 6% Higher Above $93K After Trump Ditches Powell Firing Plans appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-23 03:39:44

The transaction, tracked by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, comes after four years of patient staking, with the deep-pocketed investor originally accumulating 991,079 SOL at an average price of $27. Whale Moves With Solana trading around $140, the realized and unrealized gains from the original allocation now exceed $153 million. Despite the sell-off, the whale still holds 1.19 million SOL that remains staked, with the stash valued at about $166.37 million, suggesting this could be more of a strategic rebalancing than a full exit. In typical crypto fashion, the responses on X have been a mix of insight, anxiety, and meme-driven skepticism. One user was quick to suggest the move could signal a SOL-to-ETH rotation in reference to Galaxy Digital’s recent flows, which saw it deposit $105 million worth of ETH to Binance while pulling nearly $100 million in SOL from the exchange. Last week, the firm transferred ETH valued at $80 million to Coinbase and Binance, with other large holders selling off another 143,000 ETH worth roughly $230 million. Interestingly, in a show of contrasting strategies among big investors, Lookonchain also reported a newly created wallet withdrawing 44,116 SOL from Binance, with an estimated value of $6.15 million, which was promptly staked. While some are cashing out, others are doubling down. Reversal and Bullish Signals On the chart, Solana is showing a delicate blend of strength and volatility. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $140.29, having gained a modest 0.8% in the last day. Despite inching higher, SOL has stayed within a tight 24-hour range of $134.72 and $140.35, indicating consolidation rather than breakout behavior. Additionally, it registered a 6% jump on the week, outpacing both the broader crypto market, which is up 5%, and its Coinbase Index peers, which are flat. Across 14 days, the asset has pumped nearly 29%, but its monthly gain is a more modest 5.9%, hinting at recent turbulence following a euphoric breakout earlier in the month. That rally, which saw SOL shoot up 38% in 10 days, was not without technical merit. Analysts noted that the cryptocurrency had formed a bullish falling wedge as well as a textbook cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. This convergence of bullish signals coincided with high investor engagement near the $129–$130 price level, now widely viewed as critical support.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has climbed 5.62% over the past 24 hours and surpassed $93,000 on April 22 for the first time since March 3, continuing a 12% price rally its seen over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin traders eye “craziest one-minute candle” Bitcoin quickly jumped from just below $91,500 to $93,000 in minutes, leaving traders guessing where the rally could go next. “This is the craziest one-minute candle I’ve ever seen on the Bitcoin chart,” Bitcoin commentator Michael Sullivan said in an April 22 X post. Edit the caption here or remove the text Pseudonymous crypto trader Crypto General said Bitcoin “is going as planned, as stated in the last post, a breakout was eyes and today we witnessed our breakout.” Just hours before Bitcoin’s upside swing, crypto commentator “Ted” told his 158,200 X followers that Bitcoin is “going to catch up” with gold and the $100,000 price level, which it hasn’t seen since Feb. 3, is “loading.” It comes amid an improvement in crypto market sentiment, more money flowing into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and US President Donald Trump’s softer tone on the trade war. On the same day, Trump said he had “no intention of firing” US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after previously criticizing him for not cutting interest rates . It comes only days after Trump called for his termination again in an April 17 Truth Social post , which led to speculation that he would follow through on threats and find a way to remove Powell. Trump just ticked “bullish boxes,” says trader Alongside this, Trump said tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially,” though they “won’t be zero,” which led to an uptick in positive sentiment among crypto analysts.

Meanwhile, the day before, the 11 US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a joint net inflow of $381.3 million.

Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is seeing gains as Bitcoin price surge above $93,000 , triggering a wave of excitement across investors. The sudden surge has many asking — why is the crypto market up today? The answer lies in a powerful mix of political optimism, institutional inflows, and renewed risk appetite. Trade Optimism and Institutional Inflows Drive Rally U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made market-moving remarks hinting at potential relief in the U.S.-China trade war. Bessent called the current 145% tariffs “unsustainable” and suggested a de-escalation could be near. That was enough to boost investor confidence, not just in equities but also in risk-on assets like crypto . Backing the momentum, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw $381 million in net inflows on Monday , the highest since January. The return of institutional money is a bullish signal, especially as MicroStrategy added another 6,500 BTC to its holdings — reinforcing long-term belief in Bitcoin. SEC Shakeup, Altcoin Surge, But Caution Remains Adding to the bullish sentiment, newly appointed SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has already dismissed several crypto enforcement cases. His pro-crypto stance is giving the industry fresh hope for a more innovation-friendly regulatory climate. Meanwhile, Ethereum jumped above $1,700 , Dogecoin surged 8.6% , and SUI spiked nearly 12% . Traditional markets also bounced back, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovering from recent losses. However,the liquidity and new demand remain weak compared to past bull runs, according to CryptoQuant . Resistance zones could still trigger pullbacks, but for now, the rally has reignited crypto market momentum .",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 04:02:29

The initiative comes at a moment when Bitcoin continues to trade near historic highs and investors seek exposure to the next phase of the cryptocurrency cycle. The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the deal would see the creation of a new entity called 21 Capital, backed by $3b worth of Bitcoin contributed by the crypto firms. Tether would contribute $1.5b in Bitcoin, while SoftBank would add $900m and Bitfinex would provide $600m, FT said. The structure is designed to mirror the strategy used by MicroStrategy , which transformed itself from a modest software company into a Bitcoin powerhouse with tens of billions in digital assets. Cantor didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. *CANTOR NEARS $3B CRYPTO VENTURE WITH SOFTBANK AND TETHER: FT Brandon Lutnick is partnering with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex to create a multibillion-dollar bitcoin acquisition vehicle, according to three people briefed on the matter. The vehicle raised $200M in January and… — db (@tier10k) April 22, 2025 Cantor’s Bitcoin Push Led By Lutnick Heir as Firm Deepens Crypto Ties Brandon Lutnick, who took over as chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald after his father Howard Lutnick joined the Trump administration as commerce secretary, is leading the effort. Under his leadership, the firm has increased its involvement in digital assets, advising on high-profile deals such as Tether’s $775m investment in video platform Rumble. The vehicle will operate through Cantor Equity Partners, a special purpose acquisition company that raised $200m earlier this year. It will also issue a $350m convertible bond and raise an additional $200m through a private equity placement to expand its Bitcoin holdings. The strategy involves converting the Bitcoin contributions into shares of 21 Capital at a price of $10 each, with an internal valuation of $85,000 per Bitcoin. While the parties are aiming to announce the deal in the coming weeks, the details are still subject to change. The final agreement could shift or fall through altogether. Crypto Resurgence, Policy Tailwinds Draw Wall Street Deeper Into Bitcoin The timing reflects a broader resurgence in institutional crypto investment. Bitcoin’s price soared to over $108,000 following Trump’s electoral victory in November and has since fluctuated, now sitting around $92,000. Despite volatility, the broader trend has attracted interest from firms seeking to replicate the gains of early adopters. MicroStrategy, whose pivot to Bitcoin began in 2020, now carries a market capitalisation of more than $9b. Its model of raising equity and debt to accumulate Bitcoin has become a template for firms seeking to position themselves as crypto-native entities within public markets. The new venture also comes with a degree of reputational risk. Tether and Bitfinex, both of which are owned by the same parent company, settled major investigations with US regulators in 2021. However, the Trump administration has promised a lighter regulatory touch for crypto, which may create a more favourable environment for such initiatives.

Musk’s comment appears to have been the main catalyst behind Tesla’s (TSLA) 5.4% price jump in after-hours trading on April 22 to $250.80 after closing the trading day up 4.6%, according to Google Finance. It comes as the automaker’s Q1 results released the same day show revenues hit $19.34 billion, missing Wall Street estimates by 7.85% and marking a 9.2% fall from the same period last year. Tesla’s net income of $409 million also marked an 80.8% quarter-on-quarter drop and a 70.5% fall from Q1 2024. Source: Tesla Tesla’s digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1, alongside Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) 11.56% price fall to $82,514 over the same time, according to CoinGecko data. A new rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board allows public companies to report their crypto holdings at market value. Before, only losses were recorded — unless the crypto was sold. Tesla’s 11,509 Bitcoin stash is now worth over $1.07 billion as a result of the market rebound over the last week, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings haven’t changed since June 30, 2022. Musk to ease up on DOGE duties In an April 22 earnings call , Musk promised that he would scale back his time working at the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to focus more on Tesla. “Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,” Musk said. “I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.” Musk said he’ll continue to spend “a day or two per week” on DOGE-related matters for as long as US President Donald Trump needs to ensure the “waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.” Related: Peirce signals SEC ‘reorientation’ under new chair Paul Atkins Tesla’s 5.4% rise in after-hours came on the back of a 4.6% increase to nearly $237 during the April 22 trading day as the broader market clawed back some losses from earlier in the week. Tesla shares are still down over 37% year-to-date, driven partially by declining sales, Musk’s increased political presence and economic uncertainty stemming from Trump’s tariffs.

Despite a small price uptick, concerns are mounting as more tokens are set to hit the market in the coming weeks. Today, approximately 5.8 million PI tokens are scheduled to unlock, with a much larger wave — 223 million tokens — expected to be released over the next 30 days. This influx of supply could intensify downward pressure on the price, especially in the absence of strong buying demand. At the time of writing, Pi is hovering around $0.66, a critical level for bullish sentiment. If the price can close above this level on the daily chart, analysts suggest it could open the door for a potential rally toward $1 or higher. However, failure to hold this support might see the price slide further, especially as token unlocks flood the market. Since being listed in February, Pi Coin has seen dramatic price swings — climbing as high as $3 at its peak before plunging to lows around $0.40. The decline has left many early adopters and miners, particularly those active since Pi’s early days in 2019 and 2020, disappointed. Several factors have contributed to Pi’s ongoing price struggles: Mass Selling After Token Releases : Like many airdropped tokens, Pi faces significant sell-offs after token generation events. A large portion of its user base, especially in regions like Africa and Asia, has been quick to liquidate holdings for cash, leading to increased supply pressure. High Circulating Supply : Currently, Pi has a circulating supply of over 6.9 billion tokens, with a total supply cap near 100 billion. Compared to Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million, the sheer volume of Pi tokens makes high price expectations — like $100 or even $10 — highly unlikely under current conditions. Limited Real-World Adoption : Although Pi’s vision includes becoming a widely-used medium of exchange, real-world usage remains minimal. While a few businesses accept Pi, broader adoption is still lacking, which limits utility-driven demand for the token.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 04:38:09

The former BitMEX CEO dropped the entire theory in his new essay “Ski Cut,” where he explained how a liquidity trick buried inside the bond market is going to melt faces. Arthur explained the Treasury Department started the buyback program years ago. Now it’s back, bigger, and more aggressive. The setup is simple. The Treasury sells a new bond. Then it takes that cash and buys old, inactive bonds—so-called off-the-run bonds—which barely trade. When that happens, prices of those dusty bonds go up because the Treasury becomes the only buyer that matters. That price jump helps RV funds—hedge funds running relative value strategies—lock in fast profits. They unload the overpriced bonds, shut down their short futures positions, and grab the gains. Bessent needs leverage junkies to buy more bonds The US bond market is currently being greased by this buyback loop. And Arthur believes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent knows exactly what he’s doing, so he can push as many buybacks as he wants. Congress doesn’t need to approve this, because technically it’s just the Treasury replacing one type of debt with another. “The trade is cash flow neutral,” Arthur said. The Treasury doesn’t borrow new money—it just swaps the old bonds for fresh ones of the same size with a primary dealer. Arthur warned this is only happening because Elon Musk, who’s running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), couldn’t hit his promised savings. Elon projected $1 trillion in cuts per year. That crashed to just $150 billion. Arthur said the government will keep spending like a degenerate gambler, and someone needs to buy the debt. Right now, that’s the leveraged traders. By March, the FY25 deficit was already 22% higher than FY24 at the same time. Arthur said falling stock prices, tariffs, and shaky businesses mean tax revenue will drop. That’s a problem. If the government spends the same but collects less, the deficit gets wider. Bessent will have no choice but to issue more debt. And to avoid a meltdown, RV funds have to load up. Buybacks are the only way to make that happen. Arthur pointed out that the same trick happened back in Q3 2022. That was when Sam Bankman-Fried crashed, the Fed kept hiking, and former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had to stop the bleeding. Powell wouldn’t help, so Yellen used T-bills to suck cash out of RRP accounts, which added $2.5 trillion of liquidity, and Bitcoin shot up almost 6x. Arthur said it’s happening again. People are waiting for Powell to ease rates. Arthur said, “He won’t. He can’t. He’ll sit there and stew.” RRP balances (white) vs. Bitcoin (gold). Source: Arthur Hayes substack Even though some traders think Bitcoin is headed back below $60,000, Arthur thinks they’re clueless. “They don’t understand the buybacks are flooding the market with dollar leverage,” he said. The last time traders missed it, they got caught off guard and were forced to chase the rally. May will confirm everything. On May 1, the Treasury’s QRA will drop, showing how much more debt Bessent plans to issue. Then mid-May, the April tax receipts will come in. If the deficit keeps widening, Arthur said the buybacks will go full throttle. If that’s not enough to calm things down, Arthur said the Fed could still help indirectly. One option is to exempt Treasuries from the Supplemental Leverage Ratio (SLR), which would let banks buy bonds with no cap. Another is a QT Twist, where cash from expiring mortgage bonds gets reinvested into fresh treasuries. That would push $35 billion a month into the market for years. Arthur said Bitcoin will separate from tech stocks and sit next to gold as the digital hedge. And once Bitcoin clears $110K, Arthur expects a blowoff. “Maybe it just misses $200K.” After that, altcoins run. But he warned only a few tokens actually earn revenue and reward holders. Until then? “Back up the truck, and buy everything,” said Arthur. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The court had previously dismissed the SEC’s original complaint on Feb. 28 as Judge Amon said the regulator failed to establish that it had jurisdiction over Heart’s activities, which she said were not specifically targeted at US investors. She granted leave for the SEC to file an amended complaint by March 20, later extending the deadline to April 21. Heart posted to X on April 22 that “Richard Heart, PulseChain, PulseX, and HEX have defeated the SEC completely and have achieved regulatory clarity that nearly no other coins have.” Letter from the SEC to Judge Amon. Source: PACER Heart added that the SEC walked away from some of its other cryptocurrency cases voluntarily, but claimed his was the only case where “the SEC lost and crypto won across the board, with a dismissal in court of every single claim the SEC brought.” Heart said it was a victory for open-source software, cryptocurrency and free speech because the SEC “actually sued software code itself in this case.” SEC hunted Heart in Finland The SEC sued Heart in July 2023 for alleged unregistered securities offerings of three tokens, HEX, PulseChain (PLS), and PulseX (PSLX), claiming he made more than $1 billion by touting the tokens as a “pathway to grandiose wealth for investors.” In April 2024, Heart tried to have the suit tossed, claiming the regulator “has no sway over him,” because he didn’t reside in the United States. Related: Finnish police seize watches worth $2.6M from Hex founder Richard Heart: Report The SEC opposed this in August, claiming he touted the tokens at a Las Vegas event. In December 2024, Interpol issued a Red Notice for Heart, seeking his arrest in Finland, where he was also suspected of tax evasion . The PulseChain native token (HEX) hit an all-time high of $0.031 in December 2024 but has since tanked 76% as most altcoins have failed to follow Bitcoin’s momentum this year.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied for a second consecutive day, supported by macroeconomic headwinds and increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon pivot to rate cuts. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has slipped to a three-year low, increasing Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against currency devaluation. The situation mirrors recent gains in gold, which, like BTC, is often viewed as a store of value during uncertain economic conditions. Altcoins Join the Rally The bullish momentum wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) jumped by 13%, while XRP and Solana (SOL) each gained 7%. Dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 14% surge, riding the wave of renewed retail interest and risk-on sentiment. XRP: Holding Strong, Waiting for Breakout XRP has been holding firm within a well-established range, currently trading above key support between $1.21 and $1.55. Analysts highlight that, despite minor wicks and volatility, this zone remains structurally intact. A rally in wave five, as suggested by some Elliott Wave analysts, may still be in play. For a bullish breakout confirmation, XRP would need to clear $2.25, the recent local high from April 13. A successful push beyond that level could open the door for a move toward $3.30, and potentially extend to targets between $5.00 and $5.65, depending on broader market momentum. At the time of writing, XRP has gained more than 7% and is trading at $2.25. However, the path higher isn’t guaranteed. A break below $1.82 could shift focus to a deeper correction.

In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $635 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $665 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $620 resistance, it could start another decline.

The figure, disclosed in its earnings release on Tuesday, is down from $1.076b at the close of December, reflecting the dip in Bitcoin’s price during the quarter. Tesla did not sell any of its holdings, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence . Tesla continues to hold 11,509 Bitcoin, a position it began accumulating in early 2021 when it became the first major automaker to add the digital asset to its balance sheet. Image Source: Arkham FASB Rule Change Lifts the Lid on Unrealized Bitcoin Gains This isn’t the first time Tesla’s financials have reflected the impact of new accounting standards for digital assets. The latest figure comes under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s updated rule requiring companies to mark crypto holdings to market each quarter. Previously, companies had to record the lowest value of the asset during the reporting period, often obscuring unrealised gains. The change now allows firms like Tesla to present a more accurate view of their digital asset positions. It also comes at a time when institutional confidence in Bitcoin is strengthening, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Q1 Earnings Fall Short as Tesla Battles Cost Pressures and Slowing Demand Total revenue declined 9% to $19.3b, down from $21.3 billion a year ago. Automotive revenue fell 20%, dropping to $14b from $17.4b in the same quarter last year. Net income plunged to $409m, or 12 cents per share, down sharply from $1.39b, or 41 cents, a year earlier. The company did not issue new growth guidance for the year and said it would revisit its 2025 outlook in the next quarter. CEO Elon Musk has been spending significant time in Washington, working with the Trump administration on a broad plan to reduce the size of the federal government. The White House’s sweeping tariff policy has raised concerns for EV manufacturers, as higher import costs for key inputs such as battery components, circuit boards and specialty glass threaten to erode margins.

Speaking during Tesla’s earnings call, Elon confirmed that his work at President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will drop “significantly” by next month. The company’s stock shot up nearly 5% in after-hours trading once the words left his mouth. Elon told investors that while he’s stepping back, he’ll still help out with DOGE “to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back.” He also said he’ll continue spending “a day or two per week” on government work “for as long as the president would like me to do so.” The comment came just minutes after Tesla reported a 20% drop in automotive revenue and a 71% collapse in net income for the first quarter. Elon Musk’s political influence is dwindling after he spent nearly $300 million to elect Trump According to the Associated Press, Elon created DOGE after putting nearly $300 million into Trump’s 2024 campaign, which helped return him to the White House and made Elon the country’s “First Buddy,” as he so calls it. Over the past three months, DOGE has hacked away at agencies that include the IRS, National Park Service, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs. DOGE also went after federal agencies responsible for keeping an eye on Elon’s businesses—namely, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These offices saw major job cuts under DOGE while Elon remained in government. The White House labeled Elon a “ special government employee ” back in February, a legal title that softens the ethics rules and lowers the bar for conflict-of-interest disclosures. The Justice Department says that category is for people working 130 days or fewer in a calendar year. By the end of May, the Trump administration will hit the 130-day mark, meaning Elon’s window for federal employment closes unless reappointed under a different label. Tesla’s market value has nosedived during the same time DOGE has been active. The company has lost roughly $600 billion in market cap so far. At the same time, DOGE’s website—last updated Sunday—claims it’s saved the government $160 billion. But not everyone’s buying those numbers. DOGE has already deleted some of its most extreme savings estimates from the site, after pushback. Tesla is still receiving backlash Elon also addressed protests targeting Tesla, which have broken out across both Europe and the United States. On the call, he blamed “very organized” protest groups for the backlash and claimed—without proof—that some people were showing up because they were “receiving fraudulent money” or were “recipients of wasteful largesse.” He didn’t explain further. The protests have added fuel to growing public anger over Elon’s political ties, including his open support of Germany’s far-right AfD party. Those affiliations have tanked brand trust in Tesla, especially overseas. Tesla is also struggling with an outdated lineup of electric vehicles and increasing competition from Chinese automakers. The company posted its worst quarterly performance since 2022, and its stock is down 41% in 2025 alone. Despite those numbers, the stock spiked after Trump said Tuesday he’s not planning to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that briefly boosted investor confidence. Inside government offices, DOGE staff have done more than trim jobs. In February, employees at the Department of Education said DOGE operatives physically pushed senior officials out of their offices, rearranged furniture, and installed white noise machines to block conversations. This chaos raised alarms on Capitol Hill. US senators warned that DOGE may have gained access to federal student loan data tied to tens of millions of borrowers. Every move Elon made inside government—every agency he touched—is under even more scrutiny now as he prepares to pull back. Whether the cuts from DOGE hold or not, one thing is clear: Wall Street thinks Tesla might have a better shot with Elon spending more time in the office and less time breaking furniture in D.C.

New research suggests that the cryptocurrency could climb as high as $200,000 per coin in 2025, driven by surging demand from exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate treasuries, and macroeconomic hedging strategies. At the same time, Bitcoin infrastructure firms like Bitdeer are doubling down on growth with multimillion-dollar investments in mining equipment and energy resources, signaling a broader shift toward the industrialization of the network. As financial markets continue to absorb Bitcoin into traditional portfolios, the asset’s dual role as both a hedge and a technological platform is coming into sharper focus. Bitdeer Secures $60M Loan to Scale ASIC Production as Bitcoin Mining Arms Race Heats Up Bitcoin mining firm Bitdeer is charging full steam ahead in the face of intensifying global mining competition, securing a $60 million loan to accelerate its ASIC hardware manufacturing just as the Bitcoin network hits an all-time high in computational power. According to its recently published annual report , Bitdeer finalized a loan agreement in April with Matrixport, a crypto financial services firm founded by Bitdeer’s own chairman and industry heavyweight, Jihan Wu. The credit facility, which can scale up to $200 million, is collateralized by Bitdeer’s proprietary Sealminer hardware and features a floating interest rate of 9% plus market benchmarks. As of April 21, Bitdeer has tapped $43 million of the available funds. This latest funding comes on the heels of a broader capital strategy executed over the past year. In January, the company raised $17 million via an unsecured loan and added $572.5 million in 2024 through convertible notes. Bitdeer also boosted its equity base by issuing over six million new shares, raising nearly $119 million. Powering Up for a Mining Boom The company's funding spree is matched by major infrastructure investments. In February, Bitdeer acquired a fully permitted 101 megawatt (MW) gas-fired power project near Fox Creek, Alberta, for $21.7 million in cash. The Alberta site, already grid-connected with a 99 MW connection, is set to be developed with an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner and expected to come online by Q4 2026. With scalable potential up to 1 gigawatt, the site is positioned to become a core pillar of Bitdeer’s future operations. To complement this expansion, Bitdeer purchased 40 MW of liquid-cooled mining containers from Saiheat in March, signaling its continued pivot to more energy-efficient, high-performance mining infrastructure. Jeff LaBerge, head of capital markets and strategic initiatives at Bitdeer, confirmed a shift in the company’s strategy amid changing market dynamics. “Our plan going forward is to prioritize our own self-mining,” LaBerge said, noting that cooling demand from external hardware customers had prompted the strategic realignment toward in-house operations. In a sign of confidence, Bitdeer launched a $20 million share repurchase program on Feb. 28, 2025. The program, active through February 2026, has already seen the firm buy back over 1 million Class A shares worth about $12 million. Bitdeer’s aggressive growth comes at a time when the Bitcoin network is experiencing unprecedented computational intensity. Earlier this month, the network’s total hashrate soared past 1 sextillion hashes per second — a level never before seen, according to data from BitInfoCharts. While a high hashrate is often viewed as a sign of robust network security and decentralized participation, it also means stiffer competition for block rewards. As more miners, or increasingly powerful machines, join the race, the rewards are divided among a growing pool of participants, squeezing margins and reducing the profitability per terahash. Adding to the pressure, transaction fees — a crucial secondary revenue stream for miners — remain historically low. The average Bitcoin transaction fee currently sits near $1, a stark drop from the $16 levels seen in April 2024, per YCharts . This double blow of rising costs and shrinking earnings has forced many public mining firms to liquidate significant portions of their Bitcoin holdings. Bitcoin transaction fee chart (Source: YCharts) In March alone, more than 40% of BTC mined by public miners was sold to cover operational expenses — the highest ratio since late 2024. Companies like Hive, Bitfarms, and Ionic Digital reportedly went as far as selling over 100% of their monthly production. Mining Future Powered by Capital and Innovation Despite these challenges, Bitdeer’s actions suggest a strong belief in the long-term viability and profitability of Bitcoin mining — provided the right mix of capital access, energy efficiency, and operational scale. The company’s tight integration of financing, infrastructure acquisition, and strategic shifts in operational priorities could serve as a blueprint for other miners trying to survive and thrive in what is becoming an increasingly industrialized and capital-intensive sector. As Bitdeer looks to harness its growing fleet of Sealminer rigs and leverage its Alberta power project, the firm is setting itself up not just to weather the current storm — but to come out of it stronger and more dominant than ever. Bitcoin’s Institutional Boom: Analysts See Path to $200K in 2025 Amid ETF Inflows and Geopolitical Hedging In related news, Bitcoin could reach a staggering $200,000 per coin by the end of 2025, according to bullish forecasts from analysts at Standard Chartered and artificial intelligence-driven investment firm Intellectia AI. The reports suggest that a surge in institutional adoption — especially through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and macro-hedging strategies — could drive a dramatic appreciation in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The prediction more than doubles Bitcoin’s current trading price of around $93,000 and builds on mounting evidence that traditional finance (TradFi) players are embracing digital assets as part of broader portfolio strategies. The sentiment reflects a growing consensus that Bitcoin is no longer just a retail-driven phenomenon but a maturing financial asset being woven into the fabric of institutional portfolios. ETF Inflows Signal Growing Appetite Fueling this optimistic outlook is a wave of inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw their largest single-day net inflow since January on April 21. According to data from CoinGlass, over $380 million flowed into the 11 US spot BTC funds, marking a renewed vote of confidence from Wall Street and retail investors alike. The surge in ETF investments coincides with Bitcoin’s climb above $90,000 for the first time in six weeks, a rally driven by rising concerns over global trade tensions and geopolitical instability. Both Bitcoin and gold saw gains as investors hedged against a backdrop of uncertainty following President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping import tariffs on April 2. ”While the forecast is optimistic, it's also conditional,” cautioned Fei Chen, chief investment strategist at Intellectia AI. “Any black swan — from a major regulatory clampdown to a geopolitical event — can disrupt trajectories.” According to the research, institutional players are no longer dipping their toes — they’re diving in. Analysts pointed to growing treasuries held in Bitcoin by corporations, as well as steady activity on exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which now cater to a rising tide of professional investors. Data from Bitcointreasuries.net shows that corporate treasuries collectively hold nearly $65 billion in BTC — a figure that has been climbing steadily in 2025. This shift in ownership is critical, say analysts, because it reflects a long-term strategic outlook rather than speculative trading. Corporate Bitcoin holdings (Bitcoin Treasuries) Bitcoin vs. Gold: Hedge or Hype? The conversation around Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge has resurfaced amid increasing global instability. Investment bank JP Morgan noted in a January 2025 research paper that both Bitcoin and gold are being more frequently positioned as inflation and risk hedges in investor portfolios. However, the data on correlation tells a more nuanced story. Binance Research reported earlier this month that Bitcoin’s correlation with gold remains low, particularly after President Trump’s tariff announcement. Instead, Bitcoin has continued to track more closely with equities, raising questions about its real value as a geopolitical hedge. This tension has sparked debate among analysts and market participants. “Paradoxically, sustained ETF inflows could weaken Bitcoin’s role as a hedge,” said Spencer Yang, a core contributor to the Fractal Bitcoin infrastructure project. “Institutions holding BTC for balance sheet exposure are different from users who transact, build, or innovate on the network.” While ETF-driven inflows and treasury holdings can supercharge demand, some warn that Bitcoin’s long-term resilience will depend on more than institutional interest. Yang emphasized that true strength lies in actual usage, not just speculation. “Despite growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s long-term resilience won’t be secured by balance sheet optics alone — it depends on real usage,” he said. “That means people actually transacting, building, and experimenting on the network — not just holding BTC as a speculative asset.” The tension between financialization and functional utility shows the dual nature of Bitcoin in 2025. It’s at once a digital gold, a hedge, a speculative vehicle, and a permissionless network — and how it balances these identities may define whether or not it reaches that six-figure milestone. A $200K Dream — or Mirage? With Bitcoin’s trajectory increasingly tied to institutional flows and macroeconomic currents, the road to $200,000 is far from guaranteed. But the convergence of financial adoption, geopolitical hedging, and the evolution of crypto infrastructure suggests that such a target is no longer a fringe prediction — it’s a plausible scenario.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 05:30:00

The move extends BTC’s surge over the past two days, making it a 7.6% rallye since Sunday’s low. The rise unfolds amid the dollar plumbing three‑year lows, developments traders widely link to renewed trade‑war brinkmanship in Washington. The macro backdrop is unusually binary. On one side, Wall Street benchmarks are off roughly 16% from their February highs as investors digest President Donald Trump’s decision to impose—and then partially suspend—“reciprocal” tariffs on allies while ratcheting levies on Chinese goods to 145 %. Two weeks into the 90‑day pause, negotiators from Seoul, Tokyo, Brussels and Beijing still have no agreements in hand, and fresh talks convene in Washington later this week. “The consultation process may not be easy,” South Korea’s acting president Han Duck‑soo conceded ahead of his delegation’s departure. Why Is Bitcoin Up? Capital continues to migrate toward classic safe havens. Spot gold blasted through $3,400 an ounce on Monday—its fourth record in as many weeks—lifting the metal’s market value above $20 trillion for the first time. The yellow metal has added roughly $6 trillion in market cap year‑to‑date, three times Bitcoin’s value at its own January peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Above $87,000 In Sudden Move — Here’s The Catalyst Bitcoin’s latest leg higher has been greased by a burst of institutional demand. US spot‑Bitcoin ETFs absorbed a net $381 million on Monday, the largest single‑day haul since February and a sharp reversal from the net outflows that dogged the complex in March and early April. A lively debate is raging on X over what, exactly, is powering Bitcoin’s outperformance versus risk assets. Hedge‑fund manager Benn Eifert argues the answer is largely arithmetic: “Bitcoin is NASDAQ denominated in a basket of global currencies, not USD, and USD is collapsing.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Several Bullish Signals But Short-Term Holders Still Struggle Macro commentator TXMC contests the popular narrative that an upswing in global money supply is the dominant driver. In a thread rebutting “Global M2” overlays, he agreed with Eifert: “This is quite an accurate way of thinking about BTC’s performance. And it’s the same reason people’s Global M2 models have appeared to be skyrocketing even though the M2 data is 1-2 months old- because they’re overreacting to currency moves and don’t understand their models.” Where Is BTC Headed Next? Short‑term traders are fixated on a narrow resistance shelf that has capped every rally since late February. Analyst Jelle calls the area the “main event,” adding: “Reclaim $92,000 and #Bitcoin sends higher. A lot higher.” On‑chain metrics paint a similar picture. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, notes that Bitcoin is pressing into the Traders’ Realised Price band at roughly $91k–$92k. “The trader’s Realized Price acts as support when market conditions are bullish (green area, bull score >= 60), and as resistance when market conditions are bearish (red area, bull score <= 40). We are currently still in the second scenario,” he cautions. Momentum gauges have begun to thaw. Cold Blooded Shiller flagged a “first RSI 50 crossover on BTC in 3 months,” adding “if we’ve got counter-trend juice, this is where it ramps up.” That optimism is tempered by structural hurdles. Daan Crypto Trades reminds followers that Bitcoin is “closing in on the big $90k–$91k horizontal area which acted as the previous range low… This is also where the Daily 200MA is located.” A decisive push a “few percent” higher would, in his view, leave the chart “pretty great. Bulls know what to do.” At press time, BTC traded at $90,394.

He took a softer approach, reiterating that now is the “perfect time” to lower rates and hopes that Powell will “be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.” Trump just ticked most de-escalation/bullish boxes.

This move coincides with a shift in SEC leadership under new Chair Paul Atkins, which could signal a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Meanwhile, former SEC Chair Jay Clayton has been appointed interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Chiliz Meets SEC to Pave Way for American Reentry The fan token sports betting company Chiliz is preparing to reenter the United States crypto market ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The company recently met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to discuss a big investment ranging from $50 million to $100 million, along with plans to relaunch operations in the US market. This move was made in a much more crypto-friendly environment under the current White House administration and a growing push for clearer digital asset regulations. According to public SEC records , Chiliz used the meeting to advocate for a new fan token framework, and argued that such tokens should not be classified as securities. The classification of digital assets has been a contentious issue in the US, and a favorable regulatory stance could greatly impact the growth of crypto-related ventures. Chiliz’s CEO Alexandre Dreyfus also posted a photo with Bo Hines, the executive director of Trump’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, which also implies that the company plans to engage with government officials. The company’s strategic timing aligns with the upcoming World Cup, which is set to be hosted by the United States in June of 2026, with Canada and Mexico also participating as co-hosts. Chiliz is banking on renewed regulatory clarity and increased public interest in global sporting events to fuel its reentry. Discussions are reportedly ongoing with National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Football League (NFL) teams about launching official fan tokens, provided there is a clear legal pathway. Despite these plans, Chiliz recently struggled to maintain its momentum. Data from DeFiLlama reveals that the total value locked (TVL) in its ecosystem plummeted by 63.5% since December of 2024, falling from $17.8 million to $6.5 million by April 22, 2025. Chiliz TVL (Source: DeFiLlama ) Its native token, CHZ, also saw a steep 65% decline over the past year, according to CoinMarketCap . While Chiliz still has some strong partnerships with elite football clubs like FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and Manchester City, its US presence was previously scaled back because of the regulatory fallout from the FTX collapse in 2022. The company invested $80 million in the US in 2021 but withdrew the following year as the market environment became increasingly uncertain. With renewed efforts to define the legal boundaries of crypto assets and growing institutional interest in Web3 innovations, Chiliz is forging ahead to reengage with US sports leagues and fans just as global attention shifts toward the 2026 World Cup. SEC Transition Raises Expectations for Crypto Clarity Hester Peirce, a member of the SEC’s crypto task force, recently shared her thoughts on the direction of the SEC now that Paul Atkins has been sworn in as the agency’s new chairman. Peirce previously served as counsel to Atkins during his first term at the SEC from 2004 to 2008, and expressed confidence in his leadership due to his focus on economic growth and market support. She placed a lot of emphasis on Atkins’ integrity and is also excited for the opportunity to collaborate again, especially in efforts to recalibrate the agency's regulatory approach to better serve its broader mission. Atkins was officially sworn in on April 21, after his nomination by President Donald Trump to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler. His appointment was seen by many in the crypto community as a potential shift toward more supportive regulation. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Atkins faced questions about his past connections to the crypto industry, which some lawmakers suggested could present conflicts of interest. Peirce dismissed these concerns by pointing out his adherence to ethical standards and her respect for his character. The leadership transition at the SEC happened at a time of uncertainty in the crypto space. With Atkins now in place, the agency’s makeup includes four commissioners, though only three are currently active due to recent departures. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw is expected to leave before 2026, which could further tip the balance unless a Democrat is nominated to maintain bipartisan representation. Acting chair Mark Uyeda, who was appointed by Trump in January, indicated he will resume his regular commissioner role, leaving Atkins to take over full chair responsibilities. This period of change follows widespread criticism of the SEC’s enforcement-led approach to crypto under Gensler. During his time at the agency, it filed numerous high-profile lawsuits against major firms like Coinbase, Ripple, and Binance. Since the beginning of the year, however, many of these cases have been dropped, and industry stakeholders are hopeful for a regulatory reset. Peirce explained that there is now a shared desire for clear and constructive crypto regulations, and stated that the agency’s ultimate goal should be to create a transparent framework that supports innovation and compliance. Former SEC Chair Jay Clayton Returns in Top Legal Post Jay Clayton, the former Chair of the SEC, also recently confirmed his appointment as the interim US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The role places him at the helm of one of the most influential legal jurisdictions in the country, and was granted after a procedural move by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blocked a Senate vote on Clayton’s confirmation. (Source: Truth Social ) Schumer used a “blue slip” , which is a Senate tradition that allows senators to reject nominees from their home state, to halt the process on April 16. As a result, Clayton can serve in the position for up to 120 days without official Senate confirmation, with his interim term set to expire around Aug. 20. (Source: US Attorney's Office ) Clayton replaces Damian Williams, who led several high-profile prosecutions. This includes the conviction of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other major crypto-related cases. Clayton said his priorities as interim attorney will include safeguarding public safety, preserving the integrity of the financial system, defending national security, and combating fraud, especially schemes targeting the elderly and vulnerable populations. President Donald Trump nominated Clayton over five months ago, and criticized Schumer’s maneuver as politically motivated as Clayton had bipartisan Senate support and complied fully with the nomination process. The Southern District of New York, the nation’s oldest federal judicial district, oversees a region that includes New York City and surrounding counties and often handles big cases involving financial crimes. Clayton served as SEC Chair from 2017 to 2020, and has a nuanced track record with cryptocurrency. While his administration filed 56 enforcement actions against crypto firms, he has since spoken a lot more positively about blockchain technology and tokenization. He even described them as transformative for financial systems. He is also positive about Bitcoin as a store of value, though he did not approve any Bitcoin ETFs during his time at the SEC.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-23 05:43:39

He also hinted towards lowering tariffs on China, resulting in relief for investors worried by the President’s aggressive moves earlier. “I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates…but, no, I have no intention to fire him,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The remarks somewhat steadied nervous global investors and nudged U.S. stock futures and the dollar higher while pulling gold back from record peaks. The softer tone arrived less than a week after Trump tweeted that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” On Tuesday, Trump downplayed outside speculation that the White House was actively studying a dismissal plan. He shrugged off earlier comments by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who had said lawyers were looking into whether a president could fire a Fed chair. “This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,” Trump said. “If he doesn’t, is it the end? No. It’s not.” Behind the scenes, senior advisers cautioned the president that firing Powell would likely spark a market slide and an extended court battle, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was among those who warned of fallout, the people said, though the Treasury Department declined to comment. Under the Federal Reserve Act, governors — including the chair — may be removed only “for cause,” a standard courts have generally limited to serious misconduct or failure to perform basic duties. Powell has told associates he does not think the president can legally remove him and would contest any attempt to do so. Even so, Trump’s public attacks have been frequent. Last week, he told reporters, “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” and on Monday, he renewed his criticism online. Those comments have pumped fresh volatility into markets already unsettled by the trade dispute with Beijing. Trump may reduce tariffs on Chinese goods In Tuesday’s Oval Office exchange, Trump also addressed tariffs , calling the existing 145 percent rate on Chinese goods “very high.” He added, “It won’t be that high. It will come down substantially. But it won’t be zero. It used to be zero.” Analysts said any suggestion of softer trade terms and a steady hand at the Fed was enough to halt the previous day’s sell-off. U.S. equity futures rose in pre-market trading, the greenback firmed, and bullion prices retreated from their all-time highs. Still, economists cautioned that firing Powell would probably raise borrowing costs for households, companies, and the government if investors doubted the Fed’s freedom to set rates. “He got the hint. Firing Jay would be a catastrophic own goal,” said Mark Spindel, an investment manager who co-authored a history of Fed independence. He added that turning the Fed into a political captive carries “any number of bad outcomes, none of which helps the president or the country.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The court has dismissed the financial regulator ASIC’s suit to impose penalties on the digital asset platform. Per a Tuesday judgment , the court found that the discontinued ‘Earner’ product was a loan, not a managed investment scheme. The Earner product was offered from March to November 2022, allowing customers to ‘loan’ specified crypto in return for interest paid at a fixed rate. Block Earner wins appeal against ASIC, with the Full Court of the Federal Court finding it did not require an AFSL for its Earn product. #CryptoLaw https://t.co/MXLAAl8N3S pic.twitter.com/Nu8BjdTqQ1 — Aaron Lane (@AMLane_au) April 22, 2025 ASIC Loses Block Earner Suit The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) initiated the case , alleging violations of corporation laws by both Block Earner’s ‘Access’ and ‘Earner’ products. Per the announcement , the “ASIC is seeking declarations, injunctions, and pecuniary penalties from the Court.” The Australian Federal Court issued a ruling in February 2024 , imposing penalties over the ‘Earner’ product. According to Judge Ian Jackson’s order at the time, the products were deemed to require an AFSL license. However, another ruling in June 2024 relieved Block Earner from paying a penalty in the local financial regulator’s legal action, as the crypto firm has “acted honestly and not carelessly when it offered the Earner product.” The regulator believed that Block Earner should pay a penalty of as much as $350,000, the Tuesday judgement read. Justices David O’Callaghan, Wendy Abraham and Catherine Button have dismissed the ASIC’s appeal made last year. Further, the trio had ordered ASIC to cover all legal costs from both the original trial and the appeal. Source: ASIC Per the regulator’s recent press release , ASIC noted that it is “considering this decision” of the Federal Court. No Plans to Re-Introduce ‘Earner’ Products Despite the legal victory, Block Earner noted that it has no plans to re-launch its ‘Earner’ products for Australian customers. Speaking to local media , Block Earner co-founder James Coombes said the Earner product was voluntarily closed in November 2022. Further, he stressed that there is no intention to reintroduce it. “This case highlights the importance of ensuring regulations evolve alongside technology,” he said. “Without modernised guidance, Australia risks losing fintech innovation to offshore markets more supportive of responsible crypto entrepreneurship.” Additionally, Block Earner co-founder Charlie Karaboga said that the ruling “brings closure to a long and difficult process.” The post Australian Federal Court Dismisses ASIC Appeal, Favoring Crypto Lender Block Earner appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Australia|Block Earner,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-23 05:46:36

The agency has charged the man behind PGI Global, Ramil Palafox, for running a massive $198 million scam through his company, PGI Global, which falsely claimed to be a crypto and forex trading platform. As per the SEC’s press release, from January 2020 through October 2021, Palafox promised investors massive returns through ‘membership packages’ and also offered them multi-level marketing-like referral incentives in order to encourage them to recruit new investors. Over $57 Million Investor Funds Misused Palafox misappropriated over $57 million in investor funds to fund his lavish lifestyle like buying Lamborghinis, items from luxury retailers and for other personal expenses. Further, he also used up the left investor money to pay other investors their returns and referral bonuses, like a classic Ponzi scheme, until it collapsed in 2021. “ As alleged in our complaint, Palafox attracted investors with the allure of guaranteed profits from sophisticated crypto asset and foreign exchange trading, but instead of trading, Palafox bought himself and his family cars, watches, and homes using millions of dollars of investor funds ,” said Scott Thompson, Associate Director of the SEC’s Philadelphia Regional Office. Laura D’Allaird, Chief of the Commission’s new Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit added that Palafox fooled investors by pretending to be a crypto expert with advanced AI trading technology. SEC Seeks Penalties and Recovery of Funds The SEC has charged Palafox with violating anti-fraud and securities laws, seeking permanent bans, the return of ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. Palafox also faces criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. These actions show the SEC’s ongoing efforts to hold individuals and companies accountable for fraudulent activities in the crypto sector.

Investors remain cautious amid fears of prolonged talks and potential recession risks, as finance leaders gather in Washington for IMF and World Bank spring meetings. Gold prices eased to around $3,340 per ounce on Wednesday, extending its retreat after briefly hitting a record high of $3,500 in the previous session. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) traded firmly above $93,000 on Wednesday after rallying about 10% over the previous two sessions Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.87% to around 34,980 while the broader Topix Index jumped 2.3% to 2,590 on Wednesday, with Japanese shares hitting a three-week-high. The Japanese yen traded around 142 per dollar on Wednesday after losing over 1% in the previous session, weighed down by a rebound in the dollar. In Japan, fresh data added a domestic boost, showing private sector activity returned to growth in April after a contraction in March . The recovery was led by a robust expansion in the services sector. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.17% to around 3,310 while the Shenzhen Component climbed 0.4% to 9,909 on Wednesday, extending recent gains amid hopes for de-escalation in the US-China trade war, and the offshore yuan steadied around 7.30 per dollar on Wednesday amid signs of a potential easing in US-China trade tensions. President Trump signaled a softer stance on the U.S.-China trade war, saying the current 145% tariffs on Chinese imports will come down ""substantially"" after a deal is reached. ""It will come down substantially, but it won't be zero,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. His remarks came shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the current tariff standoff with China as “unsustainable,” fueling hopes for a de-escalation in trade tensions. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2025 GDP projections for China and Japan to 4% and 0.6%, respectively, down from its January forecasts of 4.6% and 1.1%.

Additionally, preliminary data showed that India's private sector grew in March at the fastest pace in eight months. The HSBC India Manufacturing PMI rose to 58.4 in April 2025 from 58.1 in the previous month, according to preliminary estimates. However, the IMF's revised forecast for India's GDP growth capped gains, with the agency lowering its economic outlook for the country to 6.2% from 6.5% for FY2025- 26. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 1.48% to above 7,900 on Wednesday, reaching a three-week-high. The Australian dollar climbed to around $0.64 on Wednesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, as signs of easing US-China trade tensions lifted market sentiment. April figures showed Australia's private sector activity expanded for the seventh consecutive month , driven by strong gains in both manufacturing and services sectors.

Stablecoin absence may limit Bitcoin upside Thielen explained that a measured move from the falling wedge pattern, which traders perceive as a potential bullish reversal signal, shows that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may reclaim $99,000. He added, however, that “the absence of strong stablecoin inflows raises questions about follow-through.” Markus Thielen is watching the stablecoin minting indicator before confirming the Bitcoin uptrend is sustainable. Source: 10x Research Bitcoin was trading at $93,133 at the time of writing, up 11.42% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. Thielen told Cointelegraph that stablecoin inflows “tend to correlate strongly with stickier money, while an increase in futures leverage could simply mean that fast traders are taking advantage of a quick move higher.” Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge, a true “demand-led rally” It comes as spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US posted inflows of $912.7 million on April 22, the highest level since Jan. 17, according to Farside data. Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph that the inflows suggest “this is a true, demand-led rally. Not just a hot flash of excited futures traders moving price.” “If the news headlines finally quieten, we could break new highs sooner than everyone thinks. A fast track to $100,000 looks plausible, but things change quickly in a Trump presidency.” Thielen said if uncertainty continues to decline, “a further acceleration could provide the liquidity needed to support a more sustained rally.” Related: Bitcoin risks 10%-15% BTC price dip after key rejection near $89K The crypto market has experienced volatility and broader financial markets since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs in early February . However, Trump’s recent comments have traders speculating that he’s softening his stance on the trade war , with some seeing this as bullish for markets. Thielen said the $95,000 price level is a key resistance level for Bitcoin and a “potential trigger point for short-stop liquidations.” He said it could push Bitcoin’s price higher if market strength continues.

The figures reflect ongoing uncertainty among investors, with notable variations in sentiment both across regions and among individual crypto assets. Despite a relatively stable start to the week, broader macroeconomic data, particularly from the US, had a visible impact on fund flows. Related Reading: Ethereum Attempts Breakout From Multi-Month Downtrend, But Can ETH Hold $1,600? US Crypto Outflows Lead the Week, While European Sentiment Remains Positive CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, noted that the release of “stronger-than-expected “US retail sales data mid-week coincided with a significant capital outflow. As a result, although there were early inflows, mid-week saw a pullback of $146 million, erasing much of the earlier gains. Regional trends were particularly mixed. The United States led the weekly outflows, with investment products domiciled in the country seeing a net withdrawal of $71 million. By contrast, European markets maintained a more positive outlook. Switzerland saw inflows of $43.7 million, Germany followed with $22.3 million, and Canada added $9.4 million, highlighting regional divergence in crypto investment behavior. Bitcoin remained the focal point of fund movement throughout the week. Intra-week flows signaled conflicting views among investors, ultimately concluding with minor outflows totaling $6 million. Short Bitcoin products also saw continued reductions, with $1.2 million in outflows last week. This marks the seventh consecutive week of outflows for short positions, bringing the cumulative withdrawal from these products to $36 million. According to CoinShares, this now accounts for approximately 40% of total assets under management (AUM) in short Bitcoin investment vehicles. Ethereum Sees Continued Pressure, While XRP Maintains Upward Trend Ethereum faced ongoing outflows, continuing an eight-week trend. The asset experienced a further $26.7 million in withdrawals last week, bringing total crypto outflows since the start of the recent streak to $772 million. Despite this consistent pressure, Ethereum still holds the second-highest position in year-to-date (YTD) fund flows, recording $215 million in net inflows so far in 2024. This indicates that while recent sentiment has cooled, longer-term interest remains comparatively strong. In contrast, XRP recorded notable weekly inflows of $37.7 million. This recent performance has elevated the token to third place in YTD fund flows, just behind Ethereum, with a total of $214 million in net inflows since the beginning of the year.

Ether ( ETH ) has surged almost 15% over the past 24 hours, topping $1,800 on April 23. It has outperformed Bitcoin, which notched a 6% gain, and the wider crypto market, which has climbed almost 5% to reclaim a total market value of $3 trillion. Ether has now managed to recover almost 30% since its April 9 crash to $1,400, leading some analysts to suggest that the worst may be over for the world’s second-largest crypto asset. “You can hate Ethereum all you want, but when it has a big day, the entire crypto ecosystem goes up,” crypto trader and analyst “Income Sharks” commented to their 640,000 X followers. Market analyst “Ash Crypto” said ETH was “about to explode,” drawing comparison from the current chart pattern for Ether to that for Bitcoin’s performance in late 2024. BTC vs ETH performance and prediction. Source: Ash Crypto Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at the crypto exchange BTSE, was not conviced Ethereum was moving idependently, and told Cointelegraph that Ether’s gain “was largely due to it tracking the price of Bitcoin and the overall market,” and that that Paul Atkins’ confirmation as chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission had boosted overall market sentiment. Earlier this month, ETH had fallen back to bear market prices and had seen its market share dwindle amid a wide market downturn marred by fears of a trade war. On April 22, analyst “Rekt Capital” said that ETH’s market dominance has fallen back to all-time lows but “managed to protect 2019 all-time lows as support.” ETH dominance fell to its September 2019 low of 7% on April 22, according to TradingView. However, its subsequent price pump has seen that share bounce off this critical support level and return above 7.5% on April 23. ETH dominance lows.

XRP, which is up by a more modest 7.5% daily, could see another 20% increase, which could drive it to $2.7. What’s In Store for XRP? $XRP appears to be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, potentially setting the stage for a bullish breakout toward $2.70. pic.twitter.com/LnhRA0zUqV — Ali (@ali_charts) April 23, 2025 Let’s begin the analyst’s prediction with the largest of the bunch. Ripple’s price slumped hard just two weeks ago during the tariff madness to $1.6. However, it quickly bounced off and reclaimed the crucial $2 support, which managed to defend the asset on several occasions. XRP then entered a consolidation period, but there were multiple signs , such as the squeezing Bollinger Bands, that a major breakout in either direction was just around the corner. That move transpired over the past 36 hours or so, as XRP jumped from under $2.1 to a multi-week peak of $2.25. According to Martinez, that’s just the beginning, and he doubled down on his $2.7 target for Ripple’s cross-border token. Aside from the inverse head and shoulders pattern suggesting further price increases for XRP, major positive news, such as the potential approval of a Ripple ETF, could also serve as a catalyst for more gains. In contrast, the asset can retrace if Ripple’s legal woes in the States worsen . Dogecoin, Cardano Chart Double-Digit Gains DOGE and ADA have outperformed XRP on a daily scale, registering massive 13% and 11.5% increases, respectively. Consequently, their prices have risen to $0.182 and almost $0.7. Dogecoin’s surge past the key resistance at $0.17 was particularly important as the asset risked dumping by 65% if it failed to do so. Now, Martinez updated that it is breaking out of an ascending triangle, which can send it to $0.195. #Dogecoin $DOGE appears to be breaking out of an ascending triangle, with a potential upside target of $0.195! pic.twitter.com/P7dkmIiQ9B — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 Dogecoin also awaits news on the US ETF front , but its chances for approval this year are lower than XRP’s, at least according to Polymarket (52% vs. 79%). Cardano’s odds on Polymarket to have its own exchange-traded fund are slightly higher than Dogecoin’s, sitting today at 57%. Its price has also surged impressively over the past few days and now aims at $0.77, Martinez noted. #Cardano $ADA is breaking out. $0.77 next! https://t.co/f8jr43lPOi pic.twitter.com/3FcMcR7ysT — Ali (@ali_charts) April 22, 2025 The post XRP, ADA, DOGE Prices Breaking Out: Here Are The Next Targets appeared first on CryptoPotato .",ADABTC|ADAUSD|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|DOGEBTC|DOGEUSD|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Cardano (ADA) Price|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ADA|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-23 06:10:57

That mountain of paper gives Warren a grip on 4.89% of the full T-bill pie, which hit $6.15 trillion at the end of March 2025. Warren controls nearly one in every twenty dollars floating around in the T-bill system. The full breakdown in the report shows that Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on $14.4 billion worth of Treasury bills categorized as cash equivalents—those with under three months left to maturity. On top of that, $286.47 billion more is tied up in short-term investments, all of them directly pegged to Treasury bills. That adds up to the $300.87 billion total. No stocks. No junk. No crypto. Just old-school government debt. This report comes from Berkshire Hathaway’s filings, and it shows how deep Warren is digging into safety and liquidity. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Monthly Statement of the Public Debt, the entire Treasury bill market stood at $6.15 trillion by the end of March. That’s where the 4.89% number comes from. Warren Buffett with late best friend Charlie Munger, who was the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Source: Robyn Twomey/Redux/laif Berkshire piles higher than the Federal Reserve Warren now holds more Treasury bills than the Federal Reserve itself, which currently owns just over $195 billion. That puts Berkshire Hathaway in a bigger T-bill position than the most powerful central bank on Earth. It’s not a flex. It’s just the reality of sitting on more than $334 billion in cash, with 90% of that cash now stored in Treasury bills alone. The yields are the real draw. As of April 2025, T-bills are paying around 4.359%, and that kind of return, backed by the U.S. government, is better than what Warren sees in the stock market. He hasn’t made a major acquisition in over two years. His reason is simple: everything’s too expensive. Even with Berkshire owning chunks of businesses across insurance, energy, railroads, and consumer goods, Warren sees no good targets at current prices. He’s not buying because he doesn’t like overpaying. That’s it. Even tech giants like Apple are playing the T-bill game, though on a much smaller scale. Apple holds about $30 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Half of that—$15.5 billion—sits in Treasuries. But that’s nothing compared to the pile Warren has built. Buffett waits as the market tanks Everyone’s watching to see when Warren moves again. Stocks have bled trillions in value this year. Indexes are nowhere near their peaks. But while others panic, Warren is just chilling on his cash fortress, holding off for what he’s called the “fat pitch.” “He’s getting real-time information,” says Mead, referring to the way Warren receives constant updates through Berkshire’s massive group of businesses. But that doesn’t mean a crash is coming. It just means he’s not seeing any assets worth buying. “He knew when to sell,” Mead said. “Deciding when, and what, to buy has become much harder.” Alex Morris, the author of Buffett and Munger Unscripted , said Warren’s size limits his options. “His opportunity set is pretty small,” Morris said. Berkshire’s market value is over $1 trillion, which means even billion-dollar deals barely register. Back in 2009, Warren bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26 billion. It was the biggest deal he ever made. Today, that same number is just 2.5% of what Berkshire is worth. Morris threw out two possible moves: take the rest of Coca-Cola or American Express private. The cost? $280 billion or $130 billion. Still, it wouldn’t make a serious dent in Warren’s war chest. The kind of lifelines Warren extended to Goldman Sachs, Dow Chemical, and Bank of America during the last crash would have to be massively bigger today just to matter. “They’d have to be significantly larger to make a dent,” Morris said. So while the market begs for movement, Warren is just sitting in his pile of T-bills, letting it pay him to wait. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

BANKEX alleges that two former employees, Alexandr Vlasov and Petr Korolev, misappropriated company assets to form Matter Labs, according to a lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court on March 19. The lawsuit alleges that the two developers secretly transferred and built upon BANKEX’s blockchain technology and founded Matter Labs, a rival entity that has since raised more than $450 million in venture funding and established a prominent position in the blockchain space. The lawsuit names BANKEX CEO Igor Khmel and the BANKEX Foundation as plaintiffs. The lawsuit states that in 2017, BANKEX was approached by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to develop operational software for Plasma, an innovative solution aimed at reducing transaction costs on Ethereum. Vlasov and Korolev, both BANKEX employees at the time, were assigned to work on the project. Related News: BREAKING: US President Donald Trump Makes Statement on Cryptocurrencies However, the complaint alleges that the duo secretly diverted company resources to develop Matter Labs and maintained and used BANKEX’s codebase and infrastructure. Vlasov currently serves as head of R&D at Matter Labs, while Korolev is the founder of blockchain security firm OXORIO. In addition to Vlasov and Korolev, the lawsuit also names Matter Labs co-founder Alex Gluchowski, venture capital firm Dragonfly and investor Chris Burniske of Placeholder Capital, alleging that they were either complicit in or aware of the alleged intellectual property theft. In response, a Matter Labs spokesperson said: “We believe these allegations are completely without merit. The gist of the complaint is that Matter Labs built ZKsync on top of code originally developed at BANKEX. This claim is absolutely false. ZKsync is original technology that is not based on or derived from any code developed by BANKEX. We stand by the integrity of our work and look forward to addressing these baseless allegations in court once they are served on us.” *This is not investment advice.

Speaking to reporters , Trump labeled it now the “perfect time” for the Fed to act. While he attempted to squash rumors about Powell’s dismissal, he didn’t hold back his criticism. “I’m not firing Powell,” Trump said, blaming the media for fueling speculation. Still, he added that the Federal Reserve should move faster in cutting interest rates, pointing to global central banks already easing their policies. “He should act early or on time, not late.” — Trump on Powell Markets Stay Steady as Trump Ramps Up Pressure Despite Trump’s direct messaging, the markets stayed cool. Bitcoin surged past $90K , riding the optimism sparked not only by Trump’s comments but also by U.S. Treasury Secretary’s remarks labeling the trade war with China as “unsustainable.” Treasury yields saw only modest movement, with short-term rates edging up to 3.82% following weak demand at a bond auction. The U.S. dollar held steady , reflecting cautious investor optimism over easing trade tensions. Analysts suggest that Trump’s public push may be more about managing expectations — and assigning blame — than any real threat to Powell’s leadership. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K , FED in Holding Pattern as Pressure Mounts The Federal Reserve , meanwhile, remains cautious. While Powell’s job is safe for now, the central bank continues to assess the impact of Trump’s policies on trade, taxes, and immigration. With inflation stubbornly above the 2% target for the fourth year in a row, most Fed officials believe current interest rate levels are justified. Still, economists warn that the ripple effects of tariffs could weigh on growth later this year — possibly forcing the Fed to revisit its stance. “FED rate cuts may not be off the table — even if Powell resists political pressure for now.” With Wall Street bouncing back and Trump intensifying his calls for action, one thing is clear: The Trump vs. Powell rate debate isn’t going away anytime soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The renewed optimism across digital assets has prompted speculative buying in lower-market-cap tokens, with meme coins benefiting from the influx. Their performance reflects the heightened enthusiasm among retail traders following Bitcoin’s breakout and widespread gains across major altcoins. The increase of interest in meme coins bodes well for early-stage project CartelFi . CartelFi , the new cartel-themed yield farming protocol, has already raised over $1 million in its presale. Why the broader market is rallying The cryptocurrency market surged over 6% on Wednesday, buoyed by gains across major digital assets. Bitcoin rallied past the $93,000 mark for the first time since March 6, while Ethereum, XRP, and Solana advanced 13%, 8%, and 9%, respectively. The broader rally extended to niche segments, with meme coins jumping over 15% and other sectors such as AI and real-world assets also registering gains. The shift in market sentiment appears to have been driven by renewed optimism on the geopolitical front. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signaled a possible easing of tensions in the US-China tariff dispute, calling the current trajectory of the trade conflict “unsustainable” and indicating a de-escalation may be on the horizon. President Donald Trump also told reporters that he intends to reach an agreement with China to reduce tariffs, describing the current 145% levy as excessively high and unlikely to persist. Why CartelFi is grabbing attention CartelFi is emerging as a transformative force at the intersection of meme culture and decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing a persistent dilemma in the cryptocurrency space: the conflict between the high-risk, high-reward potential of meme coins and the stability offered by yield-generating DeFi protocols. By introducing specialized liquidity pools tailored for meme coins, CartelFi is revolutionizing how typically idle speculative assets can be harnessed for productive capital. This innovative model allows investors to maintain exposure to the significant upside potential of meme coins while simultaneously earning yields traditionally associated with more stable DeFi assets, effectively bridging the gap between speculation and stability. A standout feature of CartelFi’s protocol is its automatic buyback and burn mechanism, which is funded by up to 100% of collected fees. This creates a deflationary pressure designed to support the token’s value while fostering long-term growth potential. By addressing the inefficiency of billions of dollars in meme tokens sitting dormant in wallets, CartelFi is positioning itself to unlock this untapped capital. With its forward-thinking approach, CartelFi is setting out to prove that meme coins can evolve beyond their speculative nature. CartelFi presale is running hot The CartelFi presale has already raised over $1 million from early participants, reflecting steady initial traction for the project. Structured across 30 stages with a 5% token price increase at each phase, the presale incentivizes early involvement while creating momentum through built-in pricing pressure. At its current level of $0.0352, the token is positioning early backers for notable gains ahead of CartelFi’s public market debut. The project’s pitch — converting idle meme coin holdings into productive, yield-bearing assets — marks a differentiated entry in the crowded DeFi space. Billed as the “first DeFi project turning memes into money printers,” CartelFi is targeting a long-ignored inefficiency in crypto’s speculative corners.

It’s a breakout that coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing $93,000 and a broader altcoin surge . IMX price skyrockets 44% As Ethereum, XRP and Solana all eye key levels, IMX leads the top 100 by market with a parabolic spike to highs of $0.69, its highest level since March 28. The token’s market capitalization has climbed to $1.2 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $406.8 million.

Why did Immutable price go parabolic today? Several factors could be behind IMX’s parabolic rise. A major driver might be the anticipation amid a multi-billion-dollar partnership hinted to by Immutable’s co-founder, Robbie Ferguson.

Denis Beau, first deputy governor of the Banque de France , warned that the Donald Trump administration’s recent executive order promoting dollar-backed stablecoins poses “concrete adverse consequences” for Europe’s financial sovereignty and called for urgent progress on a digital euro . In a speech last week, Beau noted that the dxecutive order , signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in late January, prohibits all work related to the development of a new form of central bank digital currency, promotes the development of dollar-backed stablecoins, and encourages citizens and businesses to use public blockchains. He warned that “without a central bank money-based payment solution,” private, non-European alternatives could dominate tokenized finance. “If the tokenisation of financial assets were to gather pace, the lack of a central bank money payment solution in euro might therefore threaten the role of central bank money as the anchor of the euro area’s monetary architecture, with concrete adverse consequences.” Denis Beau You might also like: The United States is unfocused on CBDCs | Opinion The first deputy governor of the Banque de France linked this trend to an increase in counterparty and liquidity risks, increased fragmentation of settlement, and ultimately a “loss of sovereignty and a weakening of financial stability.” Beau added that Trump’s new political direction “reinforces the need for Europe to preserve its monetary sovereignty, which means developing its payment sovereignty.” He also noted that Apple Pay and Google Pay have already established a strong foothold in Europe, while European payment systems remain fragmented and are steadily losing market share.

In an Apr. 23 Substack article , Hayes pointed to the Treasury’s plan to issue new debt to repurchase older, less liquid bonds, commonly called off-the-run Treasuries. These bonds don’t trade as frequently, so buying them back could help smooth out the bond market while offering arbitrage opportunities for institutional investors. Hayes points out that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will probably rely more on bond issuance and buybacks to maintain market stability, given the widening U.S. deficits and declining tax revenue. According to Hayes, this mechanism will function similarly to quantitative easing, which is a strategy used by central banks to boost the money supply and stimulate the economy. However, in this instance, liquidity conditions are being essentially eased by the U.S. Treasury rather than the Federal Reserve. He argues that by lowering the yields on older bonds, this buyback strategy will encourage investors to look for higher returns in riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies. You might also like: Binance Research: U.S. Treasury issuance is a key macro area to watch At the same time, when bond markets become less volatile, investors will feel safer borrowing money to make bigger bets. This extra buying power can lead to larger price swings in riskier assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), pushing prices up faster when as markets rise. Hayes points out that this pattern is similar to what occurred in late 2022 when a strong Bitcoin rally was fueled by growing market liquidity. He believes most investors are too focused on when the Fed will cut interest rates, overlooking the fact that the central bank has already slowed its quantitative tightening, which means it’s easing conditions behind the scenes. If liquidity keeps flowing, Bitcoin could reach $110,000 and then surge toward $200,000, Hayes predicted. And once BTC breaks that level, altcoins may see an even bigger surge as investors rotate into higher-risk assets.

Here’s What’s Fueling the Surge,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today-heres-whats-fueling-the-surge/,"The post Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Here’s What’s Fueling the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Price today has soared nearly 11.7% over the past week and 5.9% in the last 24 hours , defying broader market turmoil. While U.S. stock prices have plummeted due to escalating tariff tensions and a weakening dollar, Bitcoin is rallying , alongside gold, sparking fresh debate about its role as a safe-haven asset . Bitcoin Price Surges as Stocks Sink: What’s Driving the Divergence? Since April 19 , Bitcoin has climbed over 10.7% , while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have fallen 5.25% and 4.27% , respectively. This sharp contrast points to a potential decoupling between crypto and equities. Bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 currently stands at 0.65 , indicating a partial break from traditional market trends. The rally was triggered by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s recent statement suggesting that the ongoing tariff standoff with China is unsustainable , encouraging risk-on sentiment in the crypto market . Weakening US Dollar and Fed Pressure Fuel the Rally The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped by 4.81% this month, including a 0.77% fall on April 21 alone . This decline comes amid President Trump’s pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. A weaker dollar has historically boosted Bitcoin, and that’s exactly what the market is witnessing now. Since April 21, BTC has surged nearly 9.93% , reaching $93,637.39 . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Up Today? Bitcoin Price Surge Past $93K , Bitcoin Mirrors Gold: Is It Becoming a Safe-Haven Asset? Interestingly, Bitcoin’s price action is now moving in tandem with gold .

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exists in phase 4 of its presale stage at $0.025 per token which has sparked strong investor demand. The decentralized lending approach with strategic tokenomics technologies positions Mutuum Finance among the top choices in the cryptocurrency marketplace. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical uses from its platform which promises a remarkable 16,490% ROI return during six months while effectively surpassing Dogecoin’s anticipated profit rates. Smart investors become more urgent as phase 4 of the project speeds up because early entry windows become shorter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches Its Robust Lending Structure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates its own space in decentralized finance through the peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer dual lending models. Bankers who invest into ETH liquidity pools gain mtTokens like mtETH which develop worth throughout time. The borrowing process requires users to present assets worth more than their loan value for security purposes. The process of acquiring $5,000 USDT necessitates a collateral amount of $7,000 ETH which protects the lender. A Certik audit on the smart contracts is nearly complete and the team plans to reveal the findings to their social media audience to enhance user trust. Dogecoin’s speculative characteristics stand in stark contrast to the secure and user-focused system of Mutuum Finance which calls for analyzing the Dogecoin outlook. Dogecoin’s Fading Rally Dogecoin currently exists at $0.15 price while its trading activity has plunged by 22% within a consolidation range. Recent whale activity involving 570 million DOGE shows a concept of optimistic behavior without a noticeable price surge. Market analysts predict Dogecoin will reach $1 by 2025 to generate a 566% increase yet the technical indicators display negative trends around $0.17 resistance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors structured expansion through its investment approach. The phase 4 tokens of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sell for $0.025 before providing investors with a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price and potential gains of $4.15 post-launch which generates a 16,490% return on investment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges from this comparison favorably when considering its market advantage ahead of performing its tokenomics evaluation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Tokenomics Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates substantial investor interest through token sales underway during phase 4 at the price of $0.025. Phase 5 expands the MUTM token value to $0.03 while providing current owners with a 20% increase in their investment. MUTM token purchases with platform earnings function as a distribution mechanism that provides buy pressure for mtToken holders by reallocating bought MUTM tokens. The platform displays top holding positions of 50 users while giving bonus tokens to those who defend their rank statuses thus stimulating continued competition. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes sustainable token economics to protect its value structure while Dogecoin depends on market sentiments so Dogecoin fails to establish itself as the leading choice for potential growth. Final Thoughts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) spends its time as the sole under-$0.5 altcoin that could generate a 16,490% ROI in half a year surpassing Dogecoin’s foreseeable gains. The platform anticipates great growth due to its lending system integration with tokenomic features and near-finished audit by Certik. Phase 4 holds its price point at $0.025 before Phase 5 launches with a 20% price increase scheduled to happen soon. The initial value of tokens purchased by investors ensures a gain of 140% from the initial purchase with a projected future worth of $4.15.

Cantor chair Brandon Lutnick, the son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is aiming to replicate Strategy’s success as a public company investing heavily in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on April 23. The investment structure involves a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Cantor Equity Partners that raised $200 million in January and plans to go public. The Big Boys Betting on Bitcoin Tether would contribute $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, while SoftBank and Bitfinex would contribute $900 million and $600 million, respectively, reported the FT. Tether and Bitfinex are owned by the same parent company. 21 Capital will also raise a $350 million convertible bond and a separate $200 million private placement of equity to buy additional Bitcoin. Eventually, SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex would see their BTC investments converted into shares in 21 Capital at $10 per stock and value the asset at $85,000. The crypto consortium is the first in a “potential wave of SPAC deals led by Cantor Fitzgerald,” according to the FT, citing people familiar with the matter. “This time, it looks like the bet from one of big tech’s most infamous risk takers can’t be unwound so easily,” commented Van Eck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel.

What started as an ambitious vision is now an expanding reality. With a clear philosophy — transforming blockchain from a speculative tool into a real driver of change — LinkedNation has been delivering on its promise from day one: launching free educational initiatives, directly supporting public schools, and organizing high-level networking events. Early Actions, Early Impact In just a few weeks, LinkedNation has already provided free access to high-quality training for hundreds of people worldwide. Courses on blockchain, finance, entrepreneurship, and leadership are available at no cost, truly democratizing knowledge. Additionally, the project has begun actively investing in public schools — a tangible first step toward its goal of community impact. Purposeful Networking & Strategic Alliances LinkedNation’s exclusive events are already delivering results: private dinners and community gatherings have brought together politicians, entrepreneurs, and social leaders in environments where real collaborations are born. These connections not only strengthen the ecosystem but also lay the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth. Trusted Endorsements That Inspire Confidence Official endorsement from Alex Redano, State Deputy and President of the Legislative Assembly of Rondônia, has further reinforced the project’s legitimacy. And this is just the beginning: new endorsements from key figures in politics, business, and education are expected in the coming weeks — a reflection of the trust LinkedNation is building across sectors. $NATION Token Off to a Strong Start The launch of the $NATION token on the Solana network has been met with enthusiasm. The community is already actively participating in governance processes, staking, and supporting projects that deliver real-world impact. “From the very first moment, the response exceeded all our expectations,” said a LinkedNation spokesperson.“We’re showing that blockchain can be a powerful and measurable force for social good.” Join the Movement LinkedNation invites investors, educators, entrepreneurs, and changemakers to become part of this community — one that’s not just talking about impact but actively creating it.This is your opportunity to join an ecosystem where technology meets purpose, and the digital meets the real. 🔗 Learn More & Get Involved: 🌐 Website (English): linkednation.io 🌐 Website (Portuguese): linkednation.com.br 📄 Docs: docs.linkednation.io 📢 Telegram (Global): t.me/LinkedNation 🇧🇷 Telegram (Brazil): t.me/LinkedNationbr 📌 Linktree: linktr.ee/linkednation Press Contact: LinkedNation Communications 📧 Email: contact@linkednation.io Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

BTC jumped 6.5%, with Solana’s SOL, XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB all adding 8%. Major memecoins dogecoin ( DOGE ) and shiba inu (SHIB) climbed more than 11%, with Sui Network’s SUI surging 30% to lead gains among midcaps. Overall market capitalization rose 4.4% to $3.03 trillion. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) advanced 5%, indicative of the average jump among majors. The gains came after President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will substantially reduce his tariffs on China while also clarifying that he would not attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. While the tone shift gave investors much-needed relief, it also raised concern over the administration's ability to maintain consistency and reliability, which has fueled the recent increases in the price of gold and U.S. Treasury yields, traders said. “Bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' seems to be overtaking its correlation with US markets, as BTC pumped during both negative and positive news related to Trump's tariffs and Powell comments, showcasing its potential to reach new all-time highs,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. Bitcoin's resilience relative to U.S. equities has strengthened its store-of-value narrative among some market observers. “There is strong potential for bitcoin to lose its long-running correlation with US equities and may now turn to its digital gold narrative as the price of gold has reached an all-time high,” Jupiter Zheng, partner of research at HashKey Capital, said in an email. “We remain positive that investors will evaluate BTC as a long-term store of value.” Some market watchers said that gold's advance and the decoupling of bitcoin from equities seems to be concentrated in Asian morning hours. “Data shows that gold has been deriving most of its rally during the Asian hours, suggesting possible central bank and official flows getting out of USD into alternative safe havens,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “The USD decoupling does seem to be more pronounced than previous episodes. “One of the possible ramifications of the US decoupling is a revisit to the long-term BTC bull case as a store of value. While we have also been critiquing BTC as a levered Nasdaq proxy over the past year, it has finally started to show some signs of its own decoupling away from equity markets,” Fan said.",Markets|Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Equities|News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-23 07:32:38

Throughout the past few days, the token has managed to maintain its rising streak, having gone up by 41.4% in the past seven days. SUI crypto is currently trading hands at $2.94, nearing the $3 threshold. However, it is still 45% below its all-time high of $5.35 from early January this year. SUI’s market cap stands at $9.3 billion, just $700 million shy of $10 billion. SUI ranks in 13th place on the overall crypto leaderboard by market cap, falling just below Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) and Lido Staked Ether ( STETH ). Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has reached $2.3 billion, representing a 169% rise compared to the previous trading day ago and signaling a rise in market activity. SUI crypto’s current price rally is largely due to the increasing meme coin activity on its network.

Altcoins are riding the wave too, with most of the top 10 recording strong gains. Sentiment across the crypto space is shifting, and a key development came on Tuesday, April 22, as SEC Chair Paul Atkins pledged to protect investors from fraud, keep politics out of financial regulation, and lay a solid foundation for digital asset oversight. Investors are now hopeful that Atkins will help bring an end to the long-running Ripple case by dropping the SEC’s appeal. XRP Shoots Up Over 6% XRP jumped over 6% on April 22, reaching a high of $2.25, driven by growing curiosity around Ripple’s legal battle and a spike in crypto ETF applications. These factors could help XRP reach its all-time high of $3.55, though prices might still swing between $1.70 and $3 due to volatility. Furthermore, 12 XRP ETF applications are being reviewed. Big names like BlackRock and Vanguard haven’t filed yet. Analysts believe the SEC could approve several XRP ETFs at once, similar to how it handled Bitcoin ETFs.

Crypto analyst Dark Defender believes that XRP is almost nearing the end of its Wave 4 correction and could be on the verge of a strong bull run. He explained that XRP recently hit a key target of $2.1937 as expected and bounced back, hinting that the wave structure is playing out. He urges traders to watch $1.8815 as a critical support level, while $2.22 and $2.40 are the key resistance points to break for a bigger move upward. The analyst believes that XRP’s long consolidation is now over and it is closer to an extreme bull run. XRP is currently trading at $2.24, up over 7.8% in the past day. Popular analyst Ali Martinez also shared that XRP may be forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which could lead to a bullish breakout to $2.70. Another analyst Diana predicts that XRP could hit $25 as early as January 2026 pointing to the strong historical price trends and the positive catalysts. She has three possible scenarios for XRP depending on how key factors turn out. In a slow-growth case, it could rise to $10, with a 300% gain. If conditions are more favorable, it could soar 600% to $17.50. And in the most bullish scenario, it could surge to $27.50, a massive 1,000% increase.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 07:37:59

A familiar pattern is catching attention: when gold surges, Bitcoin often follows about 100 days later. It’s a move driven by investor psychology. In times of stress, gold usually attracts safe-haven buyers first. But once gold feels too expensive, other options like Bitcoin step into the spotlight. Why Bitcoin Could Be Next Lately, Bitcoin has been outperforming stocks and acting more like a safety net against political and financial risk. Some market watchers believe Bitcoin could one day rival gold’s massive $23 trillion market value. If that ever happened, Bitcoin’s price could jump to over $1 million per coin. For now, the focus is on whether Bitcoin can break past $100,000 — a milestone that’s starting to look more realistic as its market behavior shifts. Gold’s Price Outlook for 2025 Gold’s recent rally has surprised even seasoned analysts. Jeffrey Christian, Managing Director at CPM Group, revealed that the firm has raised its average gold price forecast for 2025 to $2,956 per ounce — up about $250 from the estimate six months ago. Gold started 2025 at $2,662 per ounce, climbing from $2,000 at the beginning of 2024. It’s currently trading close to $3,400. While Christian expects prices might cool slightly over the next few months, he also predicts a rebound later in the year as market worries continue. Why Gold Is Climbing So Fast A mix of global tensions, economic uncertainty, and market volatility is driving more investors toward gold. What’s unusual this time is how gold has broken its old habits — rising alongside falling stock markets, climbing bond yields, and a weaker U.S. dollar. Normally, those factors move in the opposite direction. A turning point came on April 2, when former President Donald Trump announced plans for aggressive new tariffs. The bold proposal rattled markets, raising fears of more economic trouble ahead. That added fresh fuel to gold’s rally as investors rushed to lock in a safe store of value. What Happens Next If the pattern holds, Bitcoin might be next in line for a major price move. With its growing reputation as a hedge against uncertainty, Bitcoin is well-positioned to ride the wave. A push toward $100,000 could come faster than many expect — especially if gold’s momentum holds.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-23 07:38:58

Klienti pasūta paku, nezinot, ko tieši tā satur, un tas arī rada uztraukumu un prieku. Viens no pazīstamākajiem šo paku veidiem ir Shein Mystery Box “parakstītais noslēpumainais piedāvājums” kas īpaši uzrunā modes un tendenču cienītājus. Pārbaudiet JemLit piedāvājumu Shein Mystery Box fenomena izplatība Pēdējos gados pārsteiguma kastes ir piedzīvojušas uzplaukumu visā pasaulē, un zīmols Shein, kas ir pazīstams ar savu orientēšanos uz pieejamu un mūsdienīgu modi, ir ātri pārņēmis šo konceptu. Shein Mystery Box apvieno populārākos spontānas iepirkšanās, pārsteigumu un izdevīgu piedāvājumu elementus, kas padara to par pievilcīgu iepirkšanās veidu plašai pircēju grupai, jo īpaši jaunākās paaudzes pārstāvjiem. Šāda formāta popularitāte turpina pieaugt līdz ar sociālo plašsaziņas līdzekļu nozīmes palielināšanos, kur lietotāji dalās ar tā sauktajiem ”izpakošanas“ video, atsauksmēm un autentiskām reakcijām uz paku saturu. Līdz ar to tādas platformas kā TikTok, Instagram un YouTube ir ievērojami veicinājušas šīs tendences izplatību un izveidojušas ap to spēcīgu fanu kopienu. Interneta lietotāji, kuri, meklējot izdevīgus piedāvājumus, ieraksta Google meklētājā vaicājumu “Mystery box Latvia” un nolemj pasūtīt Shein Mystery Box, iegūst piekļuvi plašam jaunāko un lētāko produktu klāstam, kas pārsteidz ar negaidītiem atklājumiem, vienlaikus neradot lielu finansiālu slodzi. Lai gan tas ir akls pirkums, bieži vien tieši neparedzētais rada prieku vai vismaz ziņkārību, kas motivē veikt vēl vairākus pirkumus. Kāpēc izmēģināt Shein Mystery Box? Interese par Shein Mystery Box nav saistīta tikai ar pārsteiguma jautrību – šim iepirkšanās veidam ir arī praktiskas priekšrocības, kas piesaista arvien vairāk pircēju. Tiem, kas vēlas atjaunot savu garderobi ar jauniem elementiem bez ilgstoša izvēles procesa, noslēpumainā kaste var būt ideāls risinājums. Lūk, galvenie iemesli, kāpēc to izmēģināt: Jaunas modes detaļas bez liekas piepūles Shein Mystery Box ērtums ir viens no galvenajiem klientu ieguvumiem, jo viņiem nav jāpieņem lēmums par izvēli starp simtiem produktu – piegādātājs visu izdarīs viņu vietā. Tas ietaupa laiku un arī ļauj klientam atklāt jaunus stilus, kurus viņš parasti nebūtu izvēlējies. Daudzi klienti šo pieeju raksturo kā atsvaidzinošu, jo pārsteiguma kaste bieži vien satur praktiskas un jaunas lietas, kas paplašina modes redzesloku. Iespējams, Mystery box ļauj ietaupīt naudu Kastes satura cena bieži vien ir zemāka nekā atsevišķu produktu cenu summa, ja tie tiktu nopirkti atsevišķi. Tas nozīmē, ka klientam ir reāla iespēja saņemt vairāk produktu par mazāku cenu. Šis potenciālais ietaupījums ir viens no galvenajiem iemesliem, kāpēc cilvēki apsver šāda veida pirkumu. Tomēr ir svarīgi piebilst, ka apmierinātība ir atkarīga no saņemto preču kvalitātes un atbilstības – arī tāpēc ir labi izvēlēties pārbaudītus pakalpojumu sniedzējus. Vai Shein Mystery Box ir krāpšana, vai tas ir tā vērts? Tiklīdz kaut kas kļūst virāls, neizbēgami rodas jautājumi par uzticamību. Shein Mystery Box nav izņēmums. Internetā valda dažādi viedokļi – no lieliskām atsauksmēm līdz brīdinājumiem, ka tā ir krāpšana. Kur ir patiesība? Kam jāpievērš uzmanība Ir svarīgi atšķirt Shein oficiālo noslēpumaino kasti (piemēram, akcijas ietvaros) no pārsteiguma kastēm, ko piedāvā ārējie mazumtirgotāji, apgalvojot, ka tās satur Shein produktus. Tieši pēdējās var sagādāt vislielāko neapmierinātību. Daži klienti norāda, ka ir saņēmuši nekvalitatīvas vai neatbilstošas preces, bieži vien bez iespējas tās atgriezt vai iesniegt sūdzību. Kas var darboties labi No otras puses, ir vairāki pakalpojumu sniedzēji, kas piedāvā godīgas pārsteigumu kastes ar atbilstošu saturu un saprātīgām cenām. Galvenais ir izvēlēties pārbaudītu pārdevēju un izlasīt citu klientu atsauksmes par Shein Mystery Box. Ja vien cilvēks vadās pēc sabiedrības pieredzes un viņam ir reālistiskas cerības, noslēpumainā kaste var būt jautrs un ērts veids, kā paplašināt savu garderobi. Viena no šādām platformām ir JemLit . Reāla pieredze Ņemot vērā pieaugošo Shein Mystery Box popularitāti mūsdienās, ir viegli atrast desmitiem atsauksmju par Shein pārsteigumu kastēm gan no regulārajiem pircējiem, gan no populāriem Latvijas influenceriem . Šī pieredze bieži sniedz vērtīgu ieskatu par to, ko sagaidīt no šādas pakas – un no kā būtu jāuzmanās. Rezultāti var būt ļoti atšķirīgi. Shein Mystery Box pārskats Pozitīvo atsauksmju vidū atrodami sajūsmas pilni stāsti, kuros klienti saņēmuši pakas ar modes aksesuāriem un sezonas hitiem. Dažas kastes pārsteidz ar daudzveidību, citas – ar kvalitāti, kas pārsniedz cerēto, ņemot vērā noteikto cenu. Lietotāji sociālajos plašsaziņas līdzekļos bieži dalās ar savu “ izpakošanas” pieredzi – šie ieraksti kalpo ne tikai kā reklāma, bet arī kā iedvesma un pārbaudītu pakalpojumu sniedzēju avots. Un, ja jums nepaveicas… Saraksta pretējā galā ir atsauksmes, kas brīdina par sliktu kvalitāti, atkārtotiem priekšmetiem vai saturu, kas neatbilst aprakstam. Bieži neapmierina arī preces, kas neatbilst izmēram, slikti pieguloši apģērbi vai novecojušas modes tendences. Ievērojiet šos noteikumus Lai jūsu pārsteiguma kaste radītu pozitīvu iespaidu, nevis izraisītu neapmierinātību, ieteicams ievērot dažus vienkāršus noteikumus: Izlasiet atsauksmes par konkrētiem pārdevējiem un meklējiet reālu pircēju fotogrāfijas. Izvēlieties pārbaudītus avotus – vislabāk tieši no Shein vai partneru mazumtirgotājiem. Pārbaudiet noteikumus un nosacījumus – jo īpaši atgriešanas politiku. Saglabājiet reālistiskas cerības – Mystery box nav personalizēts pakalpojums, tas ir pārsteigums. Shein noslēpumu kastes var būt jautras, pieejamas un motivējošas – ja vien izvēlaties tās ar skaidru izpratni un informētu pieeju. Shein pārsteiguma kaste JemLit vietnē Viens no populārākajiem un uzticamākajiem Shein Mystery Box pakalpojumu sniedzējiem neapšaubāmi ir JemLit.com platforma. Šis mazumtirgotājs ir izpelnījies klientu atzinību, pateicoties caurspīdīgai pieejai attiecībā uz laimestu iespējām un tam, ka tas piedāvā tikai oriģinālus Shein produktus. Katrā JemLit piedāvātajā Mystery box var atrasties stilīgi modes elementi, piemēram, kleitas, rokassomas vai aksesuāri, vai arī Shein dāvanu karte no 50 līdz 1000 eiro vērtībā. Liels pluss ir tas, ka klienti precīzi zina, kādas ir viņu izredzes – nekādu slēptu nosacījumu vai maldinošu solījumu. Satura vērtība bieži vien pārsniedz pašas kastes cenu, kas padara to par pievilcīgu izvēli attiecībā uz cenas un vērtības attiecību. Turklāt sortiments ir daudzveidīgs, pielāgots dažādiem budžetiem un modes vēlmēm, un ar piegādes iespējām visā pasaulē, tostarp arī Latvijā. No otras puses, ir daži ierobežojumi, ar kuriem jārēķinās. Kad klients ir pasūtījis kasti, to nevar atgriezt. Atsevišķu kastu saturs var ievērojami atšķirties, kas var nebūt piemērots tiem, kam ir precīzs priekšstats par to, ko viņi vēlas. Lai gan vērtīgākas balvas ir diezgan lielas, nevar gaidīt, ka katrā kastē būs vērtīga dāvanu karte. Turklāt daži populāri Mystery box varianti mēdz tikt ātri izpārdoti, tāpēc jums jārīkojas ātri. Pārbaudiet JemLit piedāvājumu Secinājums par Shein Mystery Box: Modes pārsteigumi Shein Mystery Box ir jautrs, bet vienlaikus pieejams veids, kā atjaunot savu garderobi un piedzīvot pārsteigumus. Lai gan ne vienmēr ir garantēts, ka saturs precīzi būs atbilstošs jūsu gaumei, pateicoties tādiem pārredzamiem mazumtirgotājiem kā JemLit un arvien pieaugošajam atsauksmju skaitam, neveiksmīga pirkuma risku var samazināt līdz minimumam.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,OTHER,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-04-23 07:39:34

Despite Ripple’s partial legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the broader acceleration of digital asset ETF products in the U.S. market, BlackRock has remained notably absent from any XRP-related ETF initiatives. The commentary attributes this inaction to strategic, regulatory, and market-based considerations. 🚨🔥 WHY HASN’T BLACKROCK FILED AN XRP ETF? The Silence Speaks Volumes. Despite Ripple’s SEC victory and growing ETF momentum, the world’s largest asset manager is still sitting out. Here’s why. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/h5OfjVPtbW — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 20, 2025 Bitcoin and Ethereum Success Drives Conservative Strategy The analyst begins by contrasting BlackRock’s aggressive positioning in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets with its total absence in XRP. The iShares Bitcoin Trust recently surpassed $30 billion in assets under management (AUM), and the firm’s Ethereum ETF exceeded $1 billion in AUM within just two months of launch. According to the post, these numbers signal a deliberate strategy of focusing on assets with a clear institutional profile and dominant market share, rather than spreading risk across less established or more controversial digital assets. Lingering Regulatory Concerns Over XRP Classification Though Ripple secured a partial win in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC, the tweet emphasizes that regulatory uncertainties continue influencing institutional behavior. The legal classification of XRP as a non-security in certain contexts has not led to full regulatory clarity. For firms like BlackRock, reputational and compliance risks remain a significant deterrent. The tweet argues that institutional caution, particularly concerning the SEC’s position towards XRP, continues to shape product strategies. Demand, Liquidity, and Legal Clarity Define ETF Eligibility “All Things XRP” asserts that BlackRock’s internal criteria for launching crypto ETFs revolve around three core elements: demand, liquidity, and legal certainty. While XRP is approaching the threshold on these fronts, it is not yet considered a definitive fit. The company’s executives have publicly stated that only Bitcoin and Ethereum currently satisfy their framework for product approval. Other assets, including XRP, are being monitored, particularly through the actions of firms such as Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, who may be more willing to take the first steps into potentially contentious territory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Patience Guides BlackRock’s Market Entry The tweet also references the 2023 incident involving a false XRP ETF filing, which briefly circulated in the market and caused widespread speculation. BlackRock was compelled to issue a public denial, an episode that may have further solidified the firm’s cautious stance. According to the analyst, the public relations fallout from that episode served as a reminder of the volatility and reputational risks tied to premature or unofficial announcements in the digital asset space. Beyond regulatory concerns, market structure and volume are central to BlackRock’s decision-making process. Bitcoin and Ethereum account for most of the total crypto market capitalization and enjoy significantly higher liquidity. In contrast, XRP’s relatively smaller market share means lower institutional trading volume, increasing execution and pricing risk. For BlackRock, launching a new ETF requires a demonstrable institutional need, something the firm apparently has not yet observed regarding XRP. The final points made by “All Things XRP” suggest that BlackRock’s strategy is not to lead but to dominate when it enters a market. With over $11 trillion in AUM, the company can wait until all regulatory, legal, and market-based conditions align. When BlackRock eventually files for an XRP ETF, it will likely do so to command the segment, not merely participate. While some in the crypto community interpret BlackRock’s inaction as reluctance or disinterest, the analysis offered by “All Things XRP” portrays a more calculated approach. According to this view, the asset manager waits for definitive signals of clarity and demand before making a move. If or when it does enter the XRP ETF space, it will be on BlackRock’s terms — and likely at a moment engineered for maximum institutional impact.

Cantor Fitzgerald, currently headed by the son of US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, plans to set up a $3 billion Bitcoin investment venture alongside SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex, the Financial Times reported. At this point, Cantor Fitzgerald has partnered with SoftBank, Tether, and Bitfinex on the Bitcoin initiative. Cantor Chairman Brandon Lutnick has moved to launch a new public company, 21 Capital, inspired by his Bitcoin investment firm Strategy. 21 Capital aims to create a “public alternative” similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin investment approach, led by Michael Saylor, the company said. Cantor plans to purchase $3 billion worth of BTC for 21 Capital as part of a partnership between Softbank, Tether, and Bitfinex. While the BTC investment initiative received an investment of $200 million in January, it was stated that this money will be used to establish a new firm called 21 Capital, which will buy $3 billion worth of Bitcoin. While it was stated that Tether will contribute $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, it was stated that SoftBank and Bitfinex will contribute $900 million and $600 million respectively. The report also stated that Cantor's Bitcoin investment vehicle will raise $350 million in convertible bonds and $200 million in private equity investments for additional Bitcoin purchases. The FT added that the deal is scheduled to be formally announced in the coming weeks, but could be revised or cancelled. Billionaire Howard Lutnick, who served as Cantor's CEO for 40 years, resigned last month to become President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, while his sons Brandon and Kyle Lutnick took over the Cantor board. *This is not investment advice.

They include USD, GBP, and AED-backed stablecoins. Issuing the new stablecoins on Concordium will help expand the payment finance (PayFi) ecosystem on the Layer 1 blockchain. Layer 1 blockchain Concordium , known for providing an enterprise-focused platform, has announced that four leading stablecoin platforms will issue their assets natively on its chain. The companies issuing the stablecoins are Noon (USN), Deep Blue (DBUSD), Agant (GBPA), and AEDX (AEDX). The companies will leverage Concordium Protocol-Level Token technology to power their stablecoins and join its growing PayFi ecosystem. Concordium CEO, Boris Bohrer-Bilowitzki, was delighted with the partnership, stating the projects will help grow the blockchain ecosystem. Adding to his statement on the issued stablecoins, Bohrer-Bilowitzki stated: “Not only do these partnerships reflect the success of our platform and its ability to support smart contract-less execution, but it underline the real-world impact of web3 technology, particularly when it comes to stablecoins. We look forward to working more closely with Agant, Noon, Deep Blue, and AEDX and to welcoming more innovative projects into our ecosystem.” Additionally, the stablecoins on Concordium will benefit from being natively issued and held directly in wallets with no smart contracts. This eliminates common attack vectors that are present on smart contract chains such as Ethereum and Solana, significantly reducing risk. The first stablecoin to be added is GBPA, a stablecoin pegged to the British pound at a 1:1 ratio. The coin is issued by Agant, a UK-based firm that is also a member of the Digital Pound Foundation and Stablecoin Standard. USN, a USD-pegged stablecoin issued by Noon Capital, will also be issued on the Concordium blockchain. The stablecoin is minted by depositing collateral in the form of Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC), with collateral then deployed into delta-neutral strategies to generate yield. Recently launched, the stablecoin has gradually grown to a $33 million market cap. Thirdly, the DBUSD offered by Deep Blue and backed by USD reserves is Jersey’s first-ever stablecoin, a mark of the Crown dependency’s progressive approach to fintech innovation. Speaking on the latest issuance of its stablecoins on Concordium, Julien Bahurel, CEO and co-founder of Deep Blue, said: “Launching DBUSD on Concordium is an important milestone in our roadmap, and a reflection of our vision to bridge traditional finance and Web3. We are looking forward to redefining how stablecoins can power cross-border finance with trust and efficiency in the years ahead.” Finally, the AEDX is offered by a company of the same name, is pegged to the UAE Dirham (AED), and is integrated with major financial and commercial entities, particularly in the MENA and CIS markets. The stablecoin is dubbed “the stablecoin for a better world” and will launch its pilot phase with 5 million AEDX tokens expected to be issued. In the future, AEDX plans to scale to 1 billion over the next 3-5 years based on market acceptance and demand. The stablecoins poised to be deployed on Concordium are pegged to three different fiat currencies in USD, GBP, and AED, supporting global adoption. Their introduction reinforces Concordium’s reputation as a leading L1 for stablecoin issuance and extends the opportunities available to users within its growing PayFi ecosystem.

Charlie Eriksen, a researcher at Aikido Security who first spotted the problem, said a hidden issue was added to recent versions of a new toolkit used to build apps that work with the XRP Ledger. “A developer's NPM access token was stolen by the threat actors,” Aikido said on X. “It is unclear how right now. It is also unclear who the threat actors are right now (although we have a hunch we are trying to confirm).” The issue only affects versions of Node Package Manager (NPM), a site where developers share reusable code for projects. Major XRP-related services, like Xaman Wallet and XRPScan, said they were unaffected in separate X posts. This flaw could let attackers steal users’ private keys, possibly accessing their crypto wallets in theory. ""At 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0, our system, Aikido Intel started to alert us to five new package version of the xrpl package. It is the official SDK for the XRP Ledger, with more than 140.000 weekly downloads,"" Eriksen said in a security update. ""This package is used by hundreds of thousands of applications and websites making it a potentially catastrophic supply chain attack on the cryptocurrency ecosystem,"" Eriksen noted. He added that only third-party apps or services that installed the flawed versions during a brief period could be at risk. As such, the XRP Ledger Foundation team quickly fixed the issue by releasing updated versions of the tool to replace the faulty ones. The affected versions (v4.2.1-4.2.4 and v2.14.2) were deprecated. ""To clarify: This vulnerability is in xrpl.js, a JavaScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger. It does NOT affect the XRP Ledger codebase or Github repository itself. Projects using xrpl.js should upgrade to v4.2.5 immediately,"" the foundation posted separately. A JavaScript library is a collection of pre-written code to simplify tasks in web development.

The world of crypto gambling is experiencing a boom of unprecedented scale, generating a staggering $81.4 billion in gross gaming revenue (GGR) in 2024 alone. This figure, reported by the Financial Times based on research from Yield Sec, represents a fivefold increase compared to just two years prior, in 2022. What makes this surge even more remarkable? It’s happening despite widespread bans and restrictions in major global markets. Understanding the Surge in Crypto Gambling Revenue The headline number of $81.4 billion in crypto gaming revenue paints a clear picture: this is a sector rapidly gaining traction. While traditional online gambling has been established for decades, the integration of cryptocurrencies brings new dynamics and opportunities that are clearly resonating with a significant user base. This isn’t just a niche market anymore; it’s a multi-billion dollar industry challenging conventional regulatory frameworks. Yield Sec’s research highlights the speed of this growth. A fivefold increase in GGR within two years is exceptional in any industry, let alone one facing significant legal headwinds. This suggests strong underlying demand and effective strategies by platforms to reach their target audience. How Are Crypto Casinos Bypassing Global Bans? One of the most striking aspects of this growth is its resilience in the face of adversity. Major jurisdictions like the United States, the European Union, China, and the United Kingdom have implemented various forms of bans or strict regulations on online gambling, and increasingly, on crypto-related activities. Yet, the revenue numbers show these restrictions are not stopping the industry’s expansion. So, how are these platforms operating and attracting users? The report indicates several methods used by players to access these sites: VPNs (Virtual Private Networks): These tools mask a user’s true location, making it appear as though they are accessing the site from a country where it is permitted. Mirror Links: These are alternative URLs that replicate the content of the main site, often used when the primary domain is blocked by regulators or internet service providers. URL Redirection: Similar to mirror links, this involves directing users from one web address to another that hosts the platform’s content. These technical workarounds, combined with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies themselves, make it challenging for traditional regulatory enforcement methods to be fully effective against dedicated users and operators. Leading the Pack: Key Crypto Casino Platforms The crypto casino landscape includes several prominent players. Platforms like Stake, Rollbit, and Roobet are frequently cited as leaders in this space. These sites offer a wide range of casino games, sports betting, and unique crypto-centric games, all powered by various cryptocurrencies. Their operational base is often located in jurisdictions known for more favorable or less stringent regulatory environments for online gaming and cryptocurrency businesses. Curaçao and Malta are frequently mentioned as key locations where these platforms obtain licenses, allowing them to operate globally, albeit in a complex and often grey legal area regarding specific user locations. The scale of these individual platforms is also significant. Stake, for instance, reportedly generated $4.7 billion in GGR last year alone. This single platform’s revenue is comparable to that of many established, publicly traded traditional online gambling companies, underscoring the immense financial activity within the crypto sector. Why the Appeal? The Benefits of Blockchain Gambling Beyond simply bypassing regulations, the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrency and blockchain gambling offer distinct advantages that attract users. These benefits contribute significantly to the sector’s growth: Anonymity and Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, transactions using many cryptocurrencies offer a higher degree of privacy compared to traditional banking methods, which appeal to users concerned about their gambling activities being linked to their personal identity or credit history. Faster Transactions: Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are often processed much faster than traditional fiat methods, which can involve bank delays, processing fees, and identity verification bottlenecks. Lower Fees: Transaction fees for cryptocurrencies can be lower, especially for international transfers, compared to traditional payment processors or banks. Provably Fair Gaming: Many blockchain-based games utilize algorithms verifiable on the blockchain, allowing players to independently confirm the fairness and randomness of game outcomes. This builds trust, a crucial factor in online gambling. Accessibility: For individuals in regions with underdeveloped banking infrastructure or strict financial controls, cryptocurrency can offer a more accessible way to participate in online activities like gambling. Integration with Crypto Ecosystems: Users who already hold cryptocurrency find it convenient to use their existing digital assets for entertainment. These technological and user-experience benefits create a compelling alternative to traditional online gambling , driving adoption even in the face of regulatory challenges. The Scale of the Crypto Casino Market The report by Yield Sec, as cited by The Daily Hodl, estimates the sheer scale of the crypto gambling ecosystem. We are talking about tens of thousands of individual crypto casino platforms operating worldwide. This vast number suggests a low barrier to entry for operators, enabled by readily available software solutions and the global reach of the internet and cryptocurrencies. Serving this multitude of platforms are tens of millions of users globally. This indicates a broad and diverse user base, spanning different continents and demographics, all connected by their willingness to use cryptocurrency for online entertainment and betting. Challenges and Risks in the Crypto Gambling Space While the growth is undeniable, the crypto gambling sector is not without its challenges and risks. The very factors that enable its growth – decentralization and operating in regulatory grey areas – also create potential pitfalls: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent international regulation means both operators and users face legal risks. What is permissible today might be banned tomorrow, leading to instability. Consumer Protection Issues: In less regulated jurisdictions, consumer protection standards might be lower than in traditional regulated markets. This can leave players vulnerable in disputes over winnings, platform fairness (despite ‘provably fair’ claims), or data security. Risk of Scams and Fraud: The ease of setting up online platforms, combined with the pseudonymous nature of some crypto transactions, can attract malicious actors running fraudulent sites or pyramid schemes disguised as gambling platforms. Cryptocurrency Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile. Winnings (or losses) in crypto can change significantly in value against fiat currencies very quickly, adding another layer of financial risk. Problem Gambling: The speed and accessibility of crypto gambling can exacerbate issues related to problem gambling, potentially making it easier for individuals to lose significant amounts quickly. Addressing these challenges requires a complex interplay between technological solutions, responsible operator practices, and evolving regulatory approaches. What Does the Future Hold for Crypto Gaming Revenue? The trajectory of crypto gaming revenue suggests continued growth, at least in the short to medium term. The innovation in platform features, the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies globally, and the persistent demand for online entertainment indicate a strong market. However, regulatory pressure is likely to intensify. As the sector grows, it becomes harder for governments to ignore. We may see more sophisticated attempts by authorities to block access, target payment processors handling crypto-to-fiat conversions for gambling sites, or even pursue legal action against operators or high-volume users. Simultaneously, the industry might evolve, with some platforms seeking licenses in more established jurisdictions or adopting stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures to gain legitimacy and access larger markets legally. The development of Web3 technologies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could also introduce new models for ownership and governance in gambling platforms. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Gambling Boom The rapid rise of crypto gambling offers insights for various stakeholders: For Regulators: The current approach of outright bans is proving ineffective. A more nuanced approach might involve understanding the technology, focusing on harm reduction, and potentially exploring licensing frameworks that address the unique aspects of crypto while protecting consumers and preventing illicit activities. For the Crypto Industry: The high transaction volume and user engagement in gambling demonstrate a strong use case for cryptocurrencies, but also highlight the need for greater clarity on regulatory compliance and responsible use. For Players: While the benefits are attractive, users must exercise caution. Researching platforms, understanding the risks of volatility and potential scams, and practicing responsible gambling are crucial. For Investors: The sector presents potential investment opportunities, but due diligence is essential given the regulatory uncertainty and competitive landscape. Summary: A Market Defying Expectations The $81.4 billion generated by crypto casinos in 2024 is a testament to the power of technological innovation and user demand in overcoming traditional barriers. Despite facing bans in major markets, the sector, fueled by platforms operating from regulatory havens and users employing technical workarounds, has achieved remarkable growth.

Canada’s crypto innovation explained,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-spot-solana-etfs-with-staking-canadas-crypto-innovation-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What are spot Solana ETFs and why are they important? A spot Solana ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds Solana ( SOL ) tokens directly, providing investors real-time exposure to the asset’s market price. Rather than using complex trading platforms or crypto wallets , you can access Solana via a regulated financial product traded on a traditional stock exchange. The value of Solana ETFs is directly tied to the open market price of SOL, offering a simple way to gain exposure to the blockchain’s performance without directly holding the asset. Unlike futures-based ETFs that use derivative contracts to speculate on Solana’s future prices, a spot ETF tracks the performance of the actual asset. This distinction is significant because futures products may face pricing inefficiencies, leading to performance mismatches over time. Spot ETFs are more transparent and directly reflect SOL's real-time supply and demand on the Solana blockchain. Spot Solana ETFs mark a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. These products enable retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem while operating within the bounds of securities regulations. Like spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , spot Solana exchange-traded funds are expected to expand market access and serve as another entry point to decentralized finance (DeFi) for traditional investors. Did you know? Spot ETFs aim to mirror an asset’s current price by directly holding the asset, while futures ETFs use derivative contracts to speculate on future price movements. Launch of spot Solana ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange On April 16, 2025, four spot Solana ETFs started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). With this, Canada became the first country to launch spot SOL ETFs with staking . The OSC granted approval to the spot Solana ETFs of four asset managers: 3iQ, Purpose, Evolve and CI Financial. Unlike products that only track Solana’s price, these funds hold SOL tokens, giving investors direct ownership of the asset. The funds are secured via institutional-grade cold storage custody. Each fund tracks a distinct Solana-related index, offering diverse strategies with onchain asset backing. Despite their structural differences, these ETFs are all designed for long-term investment, reflecting the issuers' strong belief in Solana's future in DeFi. By incorporating staking, these spot Solana ETFs provide an active way for investors to earn returns in the cryptocurrency market, all within a regulatory framework and secure, institutional-grade custody services. These ETFs enable staking through a partnership with TD Bank, allowing the SOL they hold to actively support and secure the Solana network. In return, the network issues staking rewards, which can be passed on to investors. Since Solana typically offers higher staking yields than Ethereum, this structure may translate into greater potential returns for investors. How does staking boost returns for Solana ETF investors? By offering staking, these spot Solana ETFs may boost returns for investors by an estimated 2%-3.5% annually, in addition to the performance of the underlying SOL. The ETFs generate yield by working with staking partners that delegate up to 50% of the fund’s assets for staking. Staking rewards generated by the ETF are typically shared between shareholders and the fund manager, with the specific allocation varying depending on the ETF issuer. Management fees of these spot Solana ETFs vary from 0.15% to 1%, with some providers offering fee waivers during the initial launch phase. After two days of trading, the combined assets under management for the four ETFs total about $73.5 million. Staking Solana may yield higher returns than staking Ether ( ETH ). The ETFs intend to pass these additional rewards on to investors, potentially reducing the long-term cost of owning the ETF. Here is a comparison between the various spot Solana ETFs with staking approved in Canada: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest has incorporated staked Solana into its ARKW and ARKF ETFs, with both funds now holding shares of Canada’s 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ). Did you know? Altcoin ETFs track the prices of one or more cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin ( BTC ). They diversify investor exposure within the cryptocurrency market, as various altcoins exhibit different price behaviors and underlying strengths. How Canada’s spot Solana ETFs unlock passive income opportunities Canada offering spot Solana ETFs with staking is an innovative step. Existing SOL investment products, such as the crypto ETFs in Europe and the futures-based ETFs in the US do not offer an opportunity to earn staking yield. Incorporating yield into a regulated crypto ETF structure addresses a long-standing demand from investors and asset managers interested in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Solana and Ethereum . As staking is central to these tokens’ value, its inclusion enables SOL ETFs to offer a passive income component, making them more appealing to traditional investors seeking income-generating opportunities. The OSC’s approval of the staking feature for spot Solana ETFs may boost SOL’s position. However, staking carries risks, such as potential losses from validator penalties (slashing) or network disruptions, which could affect returns. Nonetheless, this approval reinforces Canada’s pioneering role in crypto ETF innovation, having launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in 2021, ahead of many other jurisdictions. By allowing staking rewards in spot Solana ETFs, Canadian regulators have signalled a growing acceptance of crypto-powered finance. Did you know? ETFs aren’t without risks. Market fluctuations can lead to losses, and tracking errors can cause an ETF'’s performance to differ from its benchmark index, affecting investor outcome. What Canada’s launch of Solana ETFs with staking means for pending SEC applications Canada’s decision provides alternative cryptocurrency investment choices for its investors and may serve as an example for other countries considering spot ETFs for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Despite a subdued global macroeconomic climate — partly shaped by trade tensions during Donald Trump’s presidency — Canada’s regulators have taken a proactive stance, embracing innovation in the digital asset space. The greenlighting of Solana ETFs with staking reflects a maturing approach to crypto policy and signals confidence in alternative layer-1 networks. Meanwhile, in the United States, anticipation is building. The launch of Solana futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on March 17, 2025, is seen as a stepping stone toward a US spot ETF. The SEC is currently reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications as of April 21, covering a spectrum of assets from major altcoins like XRP ( XRP ) to memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), including proposals for leveraged and derivative products. As of April 21, 2025, the SEC is reviewing 72 crypto-related ETF applications, including derivatives. The filings range from major cap altcoins to memecoins and include leveraged products and options. The outcome of Canada’s pioneering approach may offer valuable insights to regulators and could potentially influence the SEC’s decisions regarding these filings. However, the SEC’s stance may differ significantly from Canada’s due to structural and regulatory complexities within the US financial system. Unlike Canada's more unified regulatory framework, the US divides oversight between multiple agencies — including the SEC, CFTC, and state regulators — creating friction in crypto policymaking. Canada’s trailblazing move could nonetheless offer a valuable case study for US regulators. As markets await the SEC’s decisions, the key question remains whether Washington will follow Ottawa’s lead — or chart its own course and a slower timeline for non-Bitcoin spot ETFs.",Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-23 08:05:00

The surge comes amid renewed optimism about easing U.S.-China trade tensions and growing political acceptance of digital assets. Trump and Bessent Spark Investor Confidence U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have ignited a market rally with comments suggesting the ongoing tariff war with China may soon see relief. Calling the current tariffs “unsustainable,” Bessent hinted that policy adjustments are being considered—triggering upward movement in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Trump has dispelled rumors about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell , a move that reassured markets concerned about inflation and monetary policy uncertainty. Brandon Lutnick’s $3B Bitcoin Bet: 21 Capital Is Here Amid this optimistic backdrop, Brandon Lutnick—the son of U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick—has announced the formation of a new Bitcoin-focused investment firm, 21 Capital . As reported by the Financial Times , the public company will give investors stock market access to Bitcoin, much like Strategy’s BTC strategy . The venture is making waves not only because of Brandon’s bold move but also due to his family ties. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is a key player in the finance world and is known for managing a substantial portion of Tether’s U.S. Treasury holdings. While Howard has voiced concerns about Tether’s liquidity during Senate hearings, his son’s Bitcoin bet signals strong conviction in the crypto industry’s long-term value. Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank Fuel $3B Bitcoin Push The launch of 21 Capital is being powered by a heavyweight coalition: Tether : $1.5 billion Bitfinex : $600 million SoftBank : $900 million Additional funding : $550 million through bonds and private investors .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today?

Interestingly, the group has fixed Bitcoin’s valuation at $85,000 per coin for the investment—underscoring high confidence in BTC’s price trajectory in the near future. This move marks a turning point where legacy finance, crypto powerhouses, and political families converge. As institutional adoption accelerates, 21 Capital could play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between Wall Street and Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

We’ve got some important news coming out of the XRP Ledger ecosystem that requires your immediate attention, especially if you’re a developer or user of applications built on the XRPL. A significant XRP Ledger vulnerability has been identified, specifically impacting certain versions of the popular xrpl.js JavaScript library. This isn’t a flaw in the core ledger itself, which is great news, but it’s a crucial reminder about the importance of vigilance in the broader crypto development landscape. Understanding the xrpl.js Security Concern So, what exactly happened? The vulnerability was discovered by Charlie Eriksen, a security researcher at Aikido Security. He found a serious flaw lurking within specific versions of the xrpl.js package distributed via NPM, a common package manager for JavaScript. The affected versions include: 4.2.1 4.2.2 4.2.3 4.2.4 2.14.2 The concern here is related to xrpl.js security . This library is widely used by developers to build applications, wallets, and services that interact with the XRP Ledger. If a developer used one of these vulnerable versions in their project, that project could potentially be compromised. What is a Supply Chain Attack Crypto Risk? The disclosure from the XRP Ledger Foundation highlights the potential for a supply chain attack crypto scenario. Let’s break down what that means in this context: Software Dependencies: Modern software development relies heavily on using pre-written code packages or libraries (like xrpl.js ) to save time and effort. These are dependencies. The Chain: When you use a library, you’re relying on a ‘supply chain’ of code – from the library’s authors to the platform it’s distributed on (like NPM), and finally to the application you’re building or using. The Attack: A supply chain attack targets a weak link in this chain. In this case, the vulnerability was within the xrpl.js library itself, meaning any application that pulled in a vulnerable version automatically inherited the risk. The Impact: An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially compromise applications using the flawed library, even if the developers of those applications did nothing wrong themselves. This type of attack vector is increasingly common and poses a significant challenge across the entire software industry, including crypto development. Are My Private Keys Safe? The Critical Private Key Protection Angle This is the most pressing question for users. The vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to access private key protection mechanisms or even the private keys themselves, *if* those keys were processed or handled by an application built using one of the compromised xrpl.js versions. It’s crucial to understand the distinction: The XRP Ledger Core: The fundamental blockchain infrastructure of the XRP Ledger is not affected by this vulnerability. Your assets stored directly on the ledger are safe from this specific flaw. Applications/Wallets using xrpl.js: If you use a wallet, exchange interface, or application that integrated one of the vulnerable xrpl.js versions, there is a potential risk that interacting with that specific application could expose your private keys to an attacker exploiting the flaw in the library it uses. This underscores the importance of using reputable applications and staying informed about the software they rely on. Actionable Insights: What Should Developers and Users Do? The good news is that a fix is available, and the XRP Ledger Foundation acted quickly to disclose the issue and provide a solution. For Developers Using xrpl.js: If you are using any of the affected versions ( 4.2.1 , 4.2.2 , 4.2.3 , 4.2.4 , or 2.14.2 ) in your project, the most critical action is to: Upgrade Immediately to Version 4.2.5 (or higher). This version contains the patch that resolves the vulnerability. You can typically do this using your package manager: npm install xrpl@^4.2.5# oryarn upgrade xrpl --latest After upgrading, it’s wise to re-test your application to ensure everything is working as expected. For Users of XRPL Applications: While you might not know which library versions a specific application uses, here are some general best practices and things to consider regarding crypto security vulnerability risks: Use Trusted Applications: Stick to well-known and reputable wallets, exchanges, and services that have a track record of security diligence. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, using a hardware wallet (like Ledger or Trezor) provides an extra layer of security, as your private keys never leave the device. Be Cautious with New/Untrusted Apps: Exercise caution when using new or less-established applications that interact with your crypto assets. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from projects you use and the broader crypto community regarding security issues. Minimize Exposure: Don’t keep more funds than necessary in hot wallets connected to various applications. Why This XRP Ledger Vulnerability is a Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security This incident, while contained to a specific library version and not the core ledger, serves as a stark reminder of the challenges inherent in crypto security vulnerability management. The interconnected nature of software development means that a flaw in one component can have ripple effects. Key takeaways regarding the broader security landscape: Dependency Management: Developers must be diligent in managing their project’s dependencies, regularly updating libraries and monitoring for security advisories. Audits: Regular security audits of both core protocols and commonly used libraries are essential. Responsible Disclosure: The process followed here – discovery by a security researcher, disclosure to the foundation, development of a fix, and public announcement – is a positive example of how vulnerabilities should be handled. User Education: Users need to be aware that security isn’t just about the blockchain itself, but also the applications and interfaces they use to interact with it. This event reinforces the need for continuous vigilance and proactive security measures throughout the entire crypto ecosystem, from the base layer to the end-user applications. Summary: Addressing the xrpl.js Security Flaw In conclusion, a significant XRP Ledger vulnerability was found in specific versions of the xrpl.js library, posing a potential supply chain attack crypto risk that could compromise private key protection in applications using those versions. The core XRP Ledger is safe. Developers must urgently upgrade to xrpl.js version 4.2.5 or later to mitigate this risk. This incident highlights the ongoing importance of xrpl.js security and general crypto security vulnerability awareness for both developers and users alike. Stay safe and stay updated!

That’s the exciting possibility being discussed among crypto enthusiasts and analysts, particularly following recent insights derived from in-depth On-chain data analysis . The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently navigating key price levels, and breaking through a specific barrier could pave the way for an impressive ETH price rally . What Does IntoTheBlock’s Data Reveal About the Path Ahead? According to the crypto market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which specializes in leveraging on-chain data for market insights, a critical juncture lies just ahead for Ethereum. Their analysis, shared on X (formerly Twitter), points to a relatively clear path for ETH once a particular price point is surpassed. IntoTheBlock noted, “On-chain data points to only modest resistance ahead, with the largest potential sell wall near $1,860.” This statement is crucial because it highlights where the most significant selling pressure is anticipated based on current on-chain metrics – specifically, the distribution of ETH holdings and potential sell orders placed around that price. If Ethereum can successfully cross this $1,860 level, IntoTheBlock’s analysis suggests a substantially higher likelihood for the token to advance towards the psychologically significant $2,000 mark. This potential move is heavily predicated on the idea that clearing the $1,860 hurdle removes the most substantial immediate obstacle based on their IntoTheBlock ETH analysis. Understanding Crypto Resistance Levels and Sell Walls In the world of technical analysis and market dynamics, Crypto resistance levels are price points where an upward trend is expected to pause or reverse due to concentrated selling pressure. Think of it as a ceiling that the price struggles to break through. A “sell wall” is a term often used in market depth analysis, particularly on exchanges. It refers to a large number of sell orders placed at or near a specific price level. When analysts like IntoTheBlock talk about a “sell wall” based on on-chain data, they are often inferring potential selling pressure by looking at metrics such as: Concentration of Holders: How many addresses acquired ETH at or near certain price points? Those who bought around $1,860 might be looking to sell as the price approaches their cost basis or a slight profit. Unrealized Gains/Losses: Analyzing which price levels hold the largest volume of ETH currently in profit. Holders with significant unrealized gains at a certain level might decide to take profits, creating selling pressure. Exchange Inflows: Increased movement of ETH to exchanges around specific price levels can indicate an intent to sell. IntoTheBlock’s methodology combines these and other on-chain signals to identify where significant selling pressure is likely to emerge. Their identification of $1,860 as the largest potential sell wall suggests that this is the price point where the confluence of these factors is strongest, making it the primary obstacle for a sustained upward move. Why is $2,000 Such a Significant Target? While $1,860 is identified as a technical resistance level based on data, the $2,000 level carries immense psychological weight in the market. Round numbers often act as significant price targets for traders and investors. Breaking above $2,000 would represent: A return to a key historical price point. A strong bullish signal, potentially attracting more buyers. Confirmation of significant upward momentum. A boost in overall market sentiment towards Ethereum. Successfully reaching and holding above $2,000 could fuel further upward movement as market participants gain confidence and potential sellers who were waiting for that level execute their orders, clearing the path for the next set of targets. Putting On-Chain Data Analysis into Context On-chain data analysis provides a unique perspective compared to traditional technical analysis, which primarily relies on price and volume charts. By examining the transactions occurring on the blockchain, analysts can gain insights into the behavior of market participants, including whales (large holders), retail investors, and miners. Key on-chain metrics include: Holder Distribution: Analyzing the number of addresses holding ETH and how much they hold at different price points. Transaction Volume: Tracking the amount of ETH being moved on the network. Exchange Balances: Monitoring the amount of ETH held on centralized exchanges, which can indicate potential buying or selling pressure. Network Activity: Looking at the number of active addresses and new addresses interacting with the network. IntoTheBlock specializes in packaging this complex data into actionable insights, providing traders and investors with tools to understand underlying market dynamics that might not be immediately apparent from price charts alone. Their current Ethereum price prediction based on this data is a prime example of how on-chain analysis can inform potential price movements. What Happens If ETH Breaks $1,860? Potential Scenarios If Ethereum successfully breaks above the $1,860 resistance level, the scenario painted by IntoTheBlock is one of reduced friction towards $2,000. Here’s a potential breakdown of what could follow: Event Potential Market Reaction Next Key Level Break above $1,860 with conviction (high volume) Increased bullish sentiment, potential for rapid upward move as sell orders at $1,860 are absorbed. Psychological $2,000 level becomes primary target. Consolidation just above $1,860 Testing the level as new support. Could precede a push towards $2,000 or a retest of $1,860 from above. Eyes on $2,000, but also monitoring $1,860 as support. Failure to break $1,860 after multiple attempts Increased bearish sentiment, potential pullback to lower support levels as buyers exhaust. Previous support levels below $1,800 become relevant. A clean break, ideally accompanied by increasing trading volume, would be the most bullish signal that the market has absorbed the selling pressure at $1,860 and is ready to push higher. The move to $2,000 might not be instantaneous, but the path, according to IntoTheBlock’s data, appears clearer beyond $1,860. Challenges and Risks on the Road to $2K While the Ethereum price prediction based on IntoTheBlock’s data is optimistic about the path beyond $1,860, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile and influenced by numerous factors. Challenges and risks that could impede an ETH price rally include: Overall Market Downturn: A significant drop in Bitcoin’s price or negative macroeconomic news can drag the entire crypto market down, regardless of ETH’s individual on-chain metrics. Failure to Sustain Breakout: ETH might briefly touch or move slightly above $1,860 but fail to find sufficient buying support to hold the level, leading to a retracement. Unexpected Selling Pressure: While IntoTheBlock identifies the largest sell wall, other unforeseen events or large individual sell orders could emerge. Regulatory Uncertainty: Negative news or developments regarding crypto regulation in major markets can dampen sentiment and pressure prices. Therefore, while on-chain data provides valuable insights, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Traders and investors should consider a holistic view of the market. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Potential Move Given IntoTheBlock’s analysis, what should market participants consider? Here are some actionable insights (not financial advice): Monitor the $1,860 Level Closely: This is the immediate key level to watch. Observe price action around this point. Does it break with conviction? Does it get rejected? Look for Volume Confirmation: A strong breakout above $1,860 is ideally supported by an increase in trading volume, indicating genuine buying interest. Understand the $2,000 Target: Recognize that $2,000 is a psychological target. There might be increased selling pressure as ETH approaches this level from traders looking to take profits at a round number. Combine Analysis Methods: Don’t rely solely on on-chain data. Look at technical indicators (like moving averages, RSI), market sentiment, and fundamental news related to Ethereum and the broader crypto space. Manage Risk: If trading the potential breakout, consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the move fails. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. The insights from IntoTheBlock offer a compelling look at the potential path forward for Ethereum, highlighting the importance of the $1,860 level as a gateway to $2,000. However, staying informed about all market dynamics is key. Conclusion: Is Ethereum Primed for $2K? The latest analysis from IntoTheBlock provides a focused perspective on Ethereum’s immediate price potential. By zeroing in on On-chain data analysis , they’ve identified the $1,860 price point as the most significant resistance, largely due to a concentrated “sell wall” at that level. Clearing this hurdle, according to their data, significantly improves the odds of an ETH price rally towards the widely watched $2,000 mark. This Ethereum price prediction underscores the value of looking beyond traditional charts and into the blockchain’s transparent data. While the path isn’t guaranteed and Crypto resistance levels can be challenging to overcome, IntoTheBlock’s insight offers a data-driven reason for optimism about Ethereum’s short-term prospects if it can gain traction above $1,860. As always, navigating the crypto market requires careful consideration of multiple factors and a robust understanding of the risks involved. The coming days will reveal whether Ethereum has the momentum to tackle the $1,860 resistance and embark on the potential rally towards $2,000 suggested by this insightful IntoTheBlock ETH analysis.

43700032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151792,1745396208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,TRON USDT Sees Massive $70 Billion Issuance Surge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tron-usdt-issuance-soars/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for some eye-popping numbers from the world of stablecoins. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON (TRX), recently shared a significant milestone on X: the total issuance of Tether (USDT) on the TRON network has officially surpassed a staggering $70 billion . Yes, you read that right – $70,000,000,000 worth of USDT is now circulating on TRON. This isn’t just a big number; it’s a powerful indicator of TRON’s growing dominance in the stablecoin landscape and the immense popularity of TRON USDT . Why is TRON USDT So Popular? Understanding the TRON Network Advantage So, what makes the TRON network such a hotbed for USDT activity? It primarily boils down to two critical factors that resonate deeply with everyday crypto users: Speed: Transactions on TRON are incredibly fast. We’re talking seconds, not minutes or hours, which is crucial for moving value quickly. Cost: This is perhaps the biggest draw. Transaction fees on TRON are notoriously low, often just a few cents or even fractions of a cent, especially when compared to networks like Ethereum, where gas fees can skyrocket during periods of high congestion. Think about it: if you’re sending stablecoins to friends, family, or using them for payments or trading, lower fees mean more of your money stays in your pocket. This practical benefit has driven massive adoption, making TRON USDT a go-to choice for many users globally, particularly in regions where high transaction costs on other chains are prohibitive. The Significance of the $70 Billion USDT Issuance Milestone Hitting the $70 billion issuance mark is far more than just a headline number. It signifies several key trends: Market Dominance: This positions TRON as a leading network for stablecoin activity, often rivaling or even surpassing Ethereum in terms of daily USDT transaction volume. User Trust and Adoption: Such a high issuance figure indicates widespread trust and active use of USDT on the TRON chain by millions of users and various crypto platforms. Network Effect: As more users and applications adopt TRON USDT, the network becomes even more valuable and attractive for new entrants, creating a positive feedback loop. This massive figure underscores the fact that while other networks exist, TRON has carved out a significant niche for high-frequency, low-cost stablecoin transfers. Why Tether Prefers the TRON Network for Stablecoin Issuance? Tether, the issuer of USDT, isn’t just picking networks at random. Their decision to issue such a massive amount of the Tether stablecoin on TRON is strategic. Tether aims for USDT to be the most accessible and widely used stablecoin. By leveraging TRON’s efficiency, Tether makes USDT more practical for everyday use cases, remittances, and trading on exchanges that support the TRC-20 standard. The low operational cost for Tether and its partners, combined with the broad user base attracted by TRON’s low fees, makes it an economically sound choice for expanding USDT’s reach. It’s a symbiotic relationship where Tether benefits from TRON’s network effects, and TRON benefits from the immense liquidity and activity brought by USDT. TRON’s Growing Role Among Crypto Stablecoins In the broader landscape of crypto stablecoins , USDT on TRON has become a major player. While USDT also exists on Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and other chains, the TRON version (TRC-20 USDT) often sees the highest daily transaction counts. This highlights TRON’s success in positioning itself as the go-to network for value transfer using the world’s largest stablecoin. This growth isn’t just about sending money. The presence of such a large volume of USDT fuels activity within the TRON ecosystem, supporting Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, exchanges, and other dApps built on the network. It provides essential liquidity that underpins various financial activities within the TRON universe. Benefits and Considerations for Using TRON USDT Thinking about using TRON USDT? Here’s a quick look at the pros and cons: Benefits: Extremely Low Fees: As mentioned, this is the main selling point. Fast Transactions: Near-instantaneous transfers. Wide Support: Many major exchanges and wallets support TRC-20 USDT. Accessibility: Easier for users in developing regions due to lower costs. Considerations: Centralization Concerns: Both Tether (the issuer) and TRON (the network) have faced criticism regarding centralization, which goes against the decentralized ethos of crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Tether, in particular, has been subject to regulatory reviews regarding its reserves. Network Reliability: While generally reliable, reliance on a single network for such large volumes introduces a single point of failure risk compared to a multi-chain approach. For many users, the practical benefits of low fees and speed outweigh the decentralization concerns for everyday transactions. However, it’s crucial to be aware of these factors. What Does This Mean for the Future? The continued growth of USDT issuance on TRON suggests this trend is likely to continue. As long as TRON maintains its low-fee structure and efficiency, it will remain attractive for stablecoin transfers. This could further solidify TRON’s position as a dominant player in the stablecoin market and potentially attract more development and users to its ecosystem. However, competition is increasing. Other networks are also working on scaling solutions and lower fees. Regulatory environments around stablecoins are also evolving rapidly. The future will depend on how TRON and Tether navigate these challenges and opportunities. Actionable Insight: Using TRON USDT If you want to use TRON USDT, here’s what you typically need to do: Get a wallet that supports the TRON network (TRC-20 tokens). Many popular wallets do. Acquire TRON (TRX) to cover the minimal transaction fees (bandwidth/energy). Receive or send TRC-20 USDT to and from supported addresses or exchanges. Always double-check the network when sending or receiving USDT, as sending USDT on the wrong network (e.g., sending TRC-20 to an ERC-20 address) can result in permanent loss of funds. Conclusion: TRON’s Stablecoin Powerhouse TRON reaching over $70 billion in USDT issuance is a monumental achievement. It highlights the network’s success in attracting users and volume through its focus on low costs and high speed. While challenges like centralization and regulation exist, the sheer scale of USDT activity on TRON underscores its vital role in the global stablecoin economy. This milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to TRON’s strategic positioning and the massive demand for efficient stablecoin transactions.
