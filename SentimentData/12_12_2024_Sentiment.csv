In 2027, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $15.15 with an average of $13.23. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $47.13 in 2030. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2024-2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $10.52 Market Cap $16.11B Trading Volume $1.33B Circulating Supply 1.53B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $11.21 24-hour Low $10.04 Polkadot Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Price Prediction $ 20.40 (97.40%) Volatility 29.62% 50-Day SMA $ 5.75 14-Day RSI 82.02 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 19/30 (63%) 200-Day SMA $ 5.70 Polkadot price analysis: DOT sees resilience amid market fluctuations Key takeaways Polkadot price analysis shows a downtrend Polkadot had surged 56% in 30 days, stabilizing at $8.48 Resistance at $9.00 and support at $7.50 are critical for DOT Polkadot DOT price analysis on December 11 shows that the cryptocurrency has experienced significant volatility, reaching a peak of $10.19 before settling at a current trading price of around $8.48. Over the last 30 days, DOT has surged by 56%, marking an impressive gain amidst broader market dynamics. The U.S. president-elect’s recent nomination of a crypto-friendly leader for the SEC has injected optimism into the market. However, in the last two days, we have seen a general bearish trend in the crypto sphere. DOT and TON have recorded double-digit losses over the past week. Today’s market activity for Polkadot reflects a mixed sentiment among traders. Following an overall recovery in the market, Polkadot’s price briefly rallied but encountered resistance at $5.50, prompting caution among traders. The daily trading volume and a market cap of $15.52 billion indicate significant investor interest and participation in DOT transactions. For Polkadot, resistance levels around $5.50 have added to the hesitancy among traders, even as broader crypto recovery trends remain supportive Daily chart analysis: Bears gear for a move below $8.0 The daily chart for Polkadot reveals significant volatility as the coin consolidates after its recent upward rally. The price trades near the 20-day EMA at $8.772, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, it remains above the 50-day ($7.214) and 100-day EMAs ($6.225), signaling a longer-term bullish outlook. The RSI currently reads 52.70, placing DOT in a neutral zone with room for upward or downward movement. DOT/USD chart The MACD indicator on the daily timeframe displays a bearish crossover, with the signal line positioned above the MACD line. This suggests declining momentum in the short term, although the histogram shows reduced bearish activity, hinting at potential stabilization. Support levels at $7.50 remain critical for maintaining upward momentum, while resistance around $9.00 will be closely monitored by traders seeking bullish confirmation. 4-Hour chart analysis: DOT stumbles to remain above $8.0 The 4-hour chart highlights Polkadot’s efforts to stabilize following its recent dip. The SMA at $8.353 acts as a critical support level, with the price oscillating around this point. The MACD on this timeframe remains in bearish territory, with the signal line slightly above the MACD line. However, the histogram reflects weakening bearish momentum, indicating a potential shift in sentiment. DOT/USD chart The Average Directional Index (ADX) reads 41.62, signalling a strong directional trend. While the current trend favours the bears, a breakout above $9.00 could reverse this dynamic. Short-term traders are likely watching the RSI on this timeframe for signs of oversold or overbought conditions, as these could trigger rapid price movements. After peaking, DOT has corrected significantly but is now showing signs of stabilization around the $8.50 mark. The SMA on the 4-hour chart at 8.353 acts as a short-term support level, with the price oscillating around this point. The MACD on this timeframe is slightly bearish, with the histogram displaying increased bearish momentum, while the ADX at 41.62 signifies a strong directional trend, which currently favours the bears. What to expect from Polkadot price analysis Polkadot’s recent performance reflects a broader trend of increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Despite significant selling pressure, the coin’s ability to sustain its gains underscores its resilience. Technical indicators suggest that DOT’s future movements will depend on its ability to maintain key support levels while overcoming resistance around $9.00 and $10.0.With the growing adoption of Polkadot’s ecosystem and continued development in the blockchain space, the coin remains a focal point for traders and investors. Market analysts are closely watching the $9.00 resistance level, as overcoming this hurdle could be critical for Polkadot’s short-term price trajectory. The interplay between the RSI and MACD suggests that while the immediate outlook may lean bearish, the underlying bullish trend from the past month could reassert itself if market conditions align favourably. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 8.46 BUY SMA 5 $ 8.89 BUY SMA 10 $ 8.70 BUY SMA 21 $7.74 BUY SMA 50 $ 5.75 BUY SMA 100 $5.05 BUY SMA 200 $5.70 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 7.41 BUY EMA 5 $6.50 BUY EMA 10 $ 5.54 BUY EMA 21 $4.93 BUY EMA 50 $ 4.66 BUY EMA 100 $4.90 BUY EMA 200 $ 5.48 SELL What to expect from Polkadot price analysis Overall, Polkadot price analysis shows a descending pattern in DOT’s market as sellers remain in control over buyers. The technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, but buying pressure could resurface if support near $10.04 holds. The resistance at $11.21 must be broken for a higher price push.

Polkadot historic price sentiment Looking at the Polkadot price action over the past years, Polkadot’s price has been heavy since the beginning of 2021. After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In the year 2024 December, Polkadot has shown signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4, as of the current data.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-11 22:21:26

Users are then manipulated into installing malware that compromises crypto wallet data. Scammers Moving Beyond Simple Phishing Scams According to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer, the scammers comment on legitimate posts, enticing users with offers of exclusive investment insights and “alpha” tips. Once individuals join these Telegram groups, they are immediately prompted to undergo a verification process via a bot called OfficiaISafeguardBot. The bot creates a false sense of urgency and pushes users to quickly complete the verification. However, this seemingly harmless step is a trap – by completing the verification, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code into the user’s clipboard. When executed, the code downloads malware designed to compromise the system and steal sensitive data, including crypto wallet information. Scam Sniffer said that the malware has been flagged by VirusTotal as harmful, and previous instances of similar attacks have resulted in private key theft, leading to significant financial losses. “This represents a new evolution in crypto scams – moving beyond simple phishing to combine social engineering with malware. Stay vigilant and share this to protect others.” Rampant Scams Last month, Casa CEO Nick Neuman shared a harrowing tale of a phishing scam that targeted him. In a post on X, Neuman described a call he received from a scammer pretending to be a Coinbase support agent. The scammer claimed that Neuman’s password change request had been canceled and encouraged him to click on a link in a suspicious email. When Neuman started questioning the scammer, they dropped the act and revealed the operation’s true nature. The scammer bragged about having recently stolen $35,000 from a victim and made it clear that the scam targets only rich crypto investors. More recently, a crypto user under the pseudonym “LeftsideEmiri,” reported losing $300,000 due to a social engineering attack. According to the user, the attack began when they received a message containing a link to a KakaoTalk conversation, which was supposedly for a partnership meeting. Although the link seemed broken, the user clicked on it, believing it to be harmless. In hindsight, they suspect that clicking the link triggered the installation of malware, which compromised their Ethereum and Solana wallets, along with several other wallets. The user made it clear that they had not approved or signed any transactions, indicating that the attack was covert and took advantage of social engineering techniques to steal funds.

Table of Contents CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M AVAX: Low fees and high throughput Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Conclusion As December progresses, the cryptocurrency market teems with fresh opportunities. Amid countless digital currencies, three obscure altcoins are drawing attention for their exceptional growth potential. These hidden gems could see their values surge by nearly 9,000% this bull market. CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain marketplace, is approaching a pivotal moment with its Token Generation Event (TGE). Following a fast presale that raised $7 million and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is set to list on Gate.io and other major exchanges on December 14th. During the presale, CYBRO experienced a 450% price surge, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s listing at $0.06 has already generated immense demand, with many experts predicting a potential 1000% growth as it enters the open market, driven by strong momentum and solid fundamentals. CYBRO seamlessly combines advanced AI with a user-friendly DeFi platform, providing tools for staking, farming, and lending that cater to both cautious beginners and experienced investors. Its presale accomplishments highlight its quick development and transformative features: CYBRO app: Offering over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to match a variety of investment strategies. Blast Index: A one-click investment solution that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Robust platform foundation: Creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for investors. CYBRO’s plans extend through 2025, including advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and smarter AI tools. These developments aim to solidify its position as a transformative player in the decentralized finance space. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, the momentum from its presale and novel features position it as a token to watch. Interested investors can still join CYBRO before the listing . AVAX: Low fees and high throughput AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and efficient transactions. Avalanche can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, using a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Classical and Nakamoto principles. Avalanche has three chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. These chains handle different operations like transactions and smart contracts. The platform also allows users to create custom blockchains called subnets. AVAX has utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. It allows blockchain applications to interact with external data sources, APIs, and systems securely. Chainlink uses a reputation system to ensure data accuracy and reliability. By bridging blockchain and external data, it enhances the capabilities of smart contracts.

Chainlink also combines on-chain and off-chain components for efficient data processing. The LINK token is central to the Chainlink ecosystem, rewarding data providers, supporting staking for security, and serving as payment for services. This design promotes a reliable and decentralized system. Conclusion In the current bull market, AVAX and LINK offer growth prospects but may have limited short-term potential.

The advanced DeFi platform will use AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to enhance earnings. It will also provide attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. CYBRO users will enjoy seamless deposits and withdrawals, ensuring a smooth experience.

What if this week could be your golden ticket to catching the next big thing in crypto? With meme coins taking the stage, the buzz around Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) and Moo Deng (MOODENG) has hit a fever pitch. GOAT is riding waves of market momentum, and MOODENG is making headlines with its Coinbase listing and viral cultural roots. But the real showstopper? BTFD Coin (BTFD), with a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a presale that’s already smashing records. The opportunities here aren’t just good—they’re game-changing. BTFD Coin is rewriting the playbook for meme coins. It’s in its 11th presale stage, has already sold over 50 billion coins, and raised a whopping $3.4 million. With staking rewards and a thriving community of over 4,400 holders, this project is set to be a headline-maker. And the timing couldn’t be better—BTFD’s P2E game beta version is live now, giving you a chance to enjoy while the market prepares for its next big move. Let’s dive into why BTFD and its competitors are the best meme coins to invest in this week. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution That’s Changing the Game Imagine snagging an investment that feels like being at the start of a bull run. That’s what BTFD Coin promises, with its presale currently in its 11th stage, setting the stage for what could be the next big meme coin explosion. The BTFD Revolution and Live P2E Game At its heart, BTFD represents the “ Buy the Dip ” mantra, turning market downturns into opportunities. But this isn’t just another coin with a catchy slogan. BTFD’s live P2E game is here. It’s not just a game; it’s a gateway to BTFD’s ecosystem, where earnings can be staked for even greater returns. The project is built on Ethereum, guaranteeing security, liquidity, and scalability. With over 5,000 active nodes, Ethereum’s network ensures transparency, making BTFD an ideal investment for those seeking stability in the meme coin space. Presale Highlights and Growth Potential Here’s the kicker: the BTFD presale has already raised over $3.4 million, selling more than 50 billion tokens to over 4,400 investors. Starting at just $0.000004, the presale price is now $0.00012, with a projected listing price of $0.0006. Early adopters stand to gain massive returns—if you invest $1,500 in this stage, your holdings could be worth $7,500 once the coin hits its listing price. With 173 billion tokens in total supply, BTFD ensures scarcity and demand. Add to that a staking APY of 90%, and you’ve got a recipe for steady growth. If you’ve missed out on past bull runs, BTFD offers a second chance to ride the wave. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): Meme Meets Market Momentum GOAT is the meme coin that’s been shaking up the crypto scene, blending humour with serious potential. Recently, it gained 15%, reaching $0.86 before stabilising at $0.69. Its association with the AI bot Truth Terminal and OpenAI’s $1.5 billion SoftBank deal added an unexpected boost. Challenges and Opportunities Despite the price rally, GOAT faces hurdles. Truth Terminal’s treasury migration raised concerns among investors, affecting its price trajectory. But analysts suggest that if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hits 30, indicating an oversold market, GOAT could bounce back. Its all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024 shows the coin’s potential for recovery. As an investor, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on these developments. GOAT’s journey may be volatile, but its resilience makes it a strong contender in the meme coin space. Moo Deng (MOODENG): From Viral Sensation to Crypto Success MOODENG takes meme coins to a whole new level with its origin story—a baby pygmy hippo from Thailand that went viral. Its cultural impact, combined with strategic moves like a Coinbase listing, has made MOODENG a hot topic. Cultural Hype Meets Market Gains When Coinbase announced its plans to list MOODENG, the coin surged by 80%, hitting $0.57 before stabilising at $0.5159. Its current price of $0.00010463 might seem modest, but with a market cap of $350.94 million, the coin has solid footing. Investors are closely watching key support at $0.5006 and resistance at $0.6531. MOODENG’s largest whale recently added 11.8 million tokens, a clear sign of confidence in the coin’s potential. Conclusion From Goatseus Maximus’s resilience to Moo Deng’s viral fame, and the groundbreaking BTFD presale, these coins are rewriting the rules of meme investing. Based on market trends and their unique offerings, BTFD stands out as the best meme coin to invest in this week. Its presale performance, staking rewards, and live P2E game are unmatched.

Analysts at Bernstein say this growth will come from the possibility of MicroStrategy being added to the Nasdaq 100 index and the positive signals from the new Trump administration, which is expected to support cryptocurrency strongly. MicroStrategy to Experience Mind-Blowing Growth Likewise, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, in a post on X, predicts that MicroStrategy will join the Nasdaq 100 on December 23. This addition could greatly increase the company’s visibility and lead to significant buying activity. Seyffart estimates that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the index will buy at least $2.1 billion of MicroStrategy shares. This purchase would account for about 20% of the stock’s daily trading volume, which Seyffart considers a conservative estimate. Notably, MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100 index would be a significant achievement for the company, highlighting its growing role in technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, this potential increase comes as the market expects more supportive policies for crypto under the Trump administration. With clearer regulations and support for innovation, crypto-focused companies like MicroStrategy will likely benefit from this positive trend. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Bet Deepens MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy continues to draw attention as Bernstein analysts project the firm’s holdings could swell to 4% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply by 2033. The research firm updated its price target for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) to $600 by the end of 2025, citing its unprecedented treasury model and increasing global capital inflows. Notably, this report highlights MicroStrategy’s success in raising $3 billion in convertible debt and $6.6 billion in equity, putting the company ahead of its $42 billion capital-raising plan. The analysts view this as a pivotal factor in MicroStrategy’s ability to sustain its long-term Bitcoin acquisition strategy . MicroStrategy, a Pacesetter in the Crypto Industry The tech giant has emerged as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency industry , primarily through its bold investment strategy focused on Bitcoin. The company has been recognized as one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has set a precedent for other companies considering similar Bitcoin acquisition moves. However, naysayers mentioned that MicroStrategy’s strategy is no longer unique and mentioned Metaplanet, which also holds significant Bitcoin reserves . They also said that other major industry players and countries are signaling interest in the digital asset, which potentially hints at future shifts in market dynamics.

The change follows his departure from Consensys, where he played an important role in advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem. Given Resnick’s strong ties to Ethereum and growing enthusiasm for Solana, this unexpected decision has sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bet For Amazon? 5% Stake Proposal Raises Eyebrows Resnick wrote a blog post outlining his motivation for joining Solana, emphasizing his wish to become knowledgeable about the protocol’s main components, including consensus processes and fee markets. He clarified, “I want to get up to speed on the implementation details as soon as possible,” adding that his work might open the door for others to eventually help Solana flourish. Last week was my last week at Consensys. Today is my first day at @anza_xyz. I’m taking my talents to Solana.

He applauded Anza’s behind-the-scenes efforts, namely its contributions to network enhancements. “Those of you in Eth land may not have heard much from them, but they’ve been quietly shipping major improvements to the network over the past year,” Resnick pointed out. Resnick hasn’t completely given up Ethereum despite his transformation. Working as a Research Fellow at Consensys, he will keep providing advise and support. Resnick’s dual function suggests that he aims to cross knowledge between two important blockchain environments, therefore benefiting both communities over time. Solana Price Momentum Positive confidence has helped Solana’s market performance to progressively get better. SOL has risen 5.9%, to $225 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin has surged sharply since early November, surpassing levels of crucial resistance. SOL’s value jumped 215% during the past year, suggesting rising investor confidence. The slow rise in price suggests stronger technical structure and more market use. Analysts predict Solana’s momentum will keep on, especially with well-known people like Resnick on its development team. #Solana $SOL will hit $4,000, based on this cup and handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/dXZLI9urOh — Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2024 Related Reading: HBAR To Hit $100? Analyst Points To Utility And Market Cap Potential Differing Price Forecasts Still, forecasts of Solana’s eventual price vary widely.

This optimistic framework suggests that a breach above $260 would cause exponential increase. On the other hand, asset management Bitwise has set a more conservative price target of $750, citing macroeconomic variables and broader market patterns.

The Bitcoin enthusiast will now be part of the Trump administration that endorsed the crypto industry during the presidential election campaigns earlier this year. Following her recent appointment, pro-crypto Lana Negrete will serve the U.S. government as the mayor of Santa Monica. Her appointment means California will have its first-ever pro-Bitcoin Mayor.

In July, Negrete, who was the vice mayor at the time, led the campaign that established the office. During the Santa Monica City Council meeting held on July 9, the council unanimously approved 7-0 to establish a Santa Monica Bitcoin Office program at zero cost to the city. Lana Negrete highlighted that establishing the office was not about the asset itself or the commodity but about promoting Bitcoin education in the city and exploring industry partnerships, unemployment creation, and economic recovery. The office was set up by the now-appointed mayor in collaboration with Proof of Workforce, which manages the office from a non-profit perspective. Lana has joined a pro-crypto administration headed by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump appoints pro-crypto candidates in his administration Trump has already made several appointments involving pro-crypto candidates in major regulatory offices to form part of his administration. The appointments come as preparation made by the president-elect to deliver on the promises he made for the crypto community. Perhaps the most notable nomination was the one involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairperson. The president-elect announced on Truth Social that he had appointed Paul Atkins to be the next chair after Gary Gensler, who has officially resigned. Trump’s running mate and soon-to-be Vice President, JD Vance, is also renowned for being a crypto enthusiast. The 40-year-old has Bitcoin holdings worth between $250,000 and $500,000, according to CBS News . Trump also recently appointed former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks to serve as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” The appointment marked another significant step towards transforming U.S. policies in the technology space. The role will involve regulatory oversight of the crypto industry. Sacks reportedly owns digital assets such as Solana. His venture capital fund, Craft, has also exposed itself to the cryptocurrency space by investing in crypto companies Bitwise and BitGo. Trump also named Elon Musk the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, a department he created to control government spending and reduce wastage of resources. Musk is a well-known cryptographic figure. He is known to endorse the popular memecoin Dogecoin and once accepted crypto payments from Tesla buyers. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, his companies, Tesla and SpaceX , own 9,720 Bitcoin and 8,285 Bitcoin, respectively. Musk will work hand in hand with Howard Lutnick, who is also a major player in the crypto ecosystem. His firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, has managed Tether’s U.S. Treasury and bond portfolios since 2021.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 22:45:00

Here's Why This New Crypto Is Set To Outshine Shiba Inu,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/dogecoin-rally-heats-up-heres-why-this-new-crypto-is-set-to-outshine-shiba-inu,"A Dogecoin rally is reigniting excitement among crypto enthusiasts as DOGE signals bullish patterns ahead of the anticipated Santa rally. Dogecoin eyes a potential 300% surge this December, but a new crypto quietly positions itself to outshine even Shiba Inu. Combining tangible utility with market-defying growth, this emerging contender could redefine the GambleFi landscape. A New Crypto Challenges the Meme Coin Giants While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rally on historical patterns and ecosystem updates, a new cryptois quietly emerging as a force to be reckoned with. Leveraging innovative utility and a unique value proposition, this rising star is poised to disrupt the crypto markets globally. This project, built on a GambleFi ecosystem, delivers immediate rewards through weekly profit distributions. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, this new crypto doesn’t rely on speculative sentiment but offers tangible returns. With its presale already raising over $7 million and tokens priced at just $0.041, early investors are seizing the opportunity. Deflationary tokenomics, which burn 60% of repurchased tokens while redistributing 40% to stakers, ensure sustainable growth and consistent returns. These features set the stage for this new crypto to not only compete with but potentially outshine meme coin giants. Dogecoin’s Momentum Points to a December Breakout Analysts draw comparisons between this Dogecoin rally and its remarkable 2017 December surge of over 300%. Currently trading at $0.404, DOGE has seen an impressive 60% rise over the past month. If the price breaks above $0.44, analysts believe it could pave the way for a move to $0.50, with the $1 mark potentially within reach by early 2025. December has historically been a favorable month for Dogecoin, with an average gain of 24.3%. This trend further supports optimism for the weeks ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE currently stands at 63, signaling continued bullish momentum. Additionally, analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s performance as a critical factor; the break above $100,000 for BTC could amplify enthusiasm across the crypto market, benefiting Dogecoin significantly. Adding to this optimism are whale activities and growing speculation about a potential DogecoinETF in 2025. Shiba Inu Builds Strength Amid Ecosystem Updates A bullish triangle pattern fueled a rise for SHIB and the anticipated Shibarium update promises to further bolster its ecosystem. On-chain data reveals that a significant portion of SHIB holders remain profitable, indicating strong investor confidence. This minimizes the likelihood of panic selling, even in the face of market fluctuations. Analysts highlight $0.000035 as a crucial resistance level, with a potential breakout unlocking further price growth. Meanwhile, the Shibarium update, designed to enhance security and scalability, positions SHIBas a competitive force in the meme coin sector. Despite its recent rally, overbought conditions—reflected in an RSI of 73—suggest a possible consolidation phase before the next upward movement. Balancing Speculation and Utility The Dogecoin rally and Shiba Inu’s bullish momentum highlight the meme coin sector's enduring appeal. However, the rise of this new crypto introduces a fresh dimension—combining immediate financial rewards with long-term value. For investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, the current market offers a spectrum of opportunities: Dogecoin for historical momentum, Shiba Inu for ecosystem growth, and this new crypto for innovative utility. Together, these projects define the evolving dynamics of the crypto market, offering both speculative gains and sustainable returns.

In a post on X, Martinez reported that 342 new wallets holding more than 100 BTC were created as Bitcoin dipped from $104,000 to around $90,000. According to Martinez, whales are buying every dip as a sign of their strong bullishness about Bitcoin. He added that the price correction is merely a test of investors’ resilience, and those who took advantage are best positioned to ride the next wave. He said : “This correction is a test of resilience, and if you play it right, you’ll be positioned to ride the next wave. This is how the 1% operates—buying fear while the rest of the market hesitates.” Meanwhile, whales’ acquisition during the dip is not completely surprising. Crypto analyst Mac_D observed that Coinbase Premium surged while the Bitcoin price fell. Coinbase Premium describes the percentage difference between the price of BTC on Coinbase Pro and Binance, usually indicating the time when US institutional investors are buying. The rebound in the Premium implies that US investors buy heavily when there are massive sell-offs on Binance. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium surged as price fell – (Source: CryptoQuant) The analyst noted: “This rebound suggests that when excessive panic selling occurs on Binance, which has a higher proportion of small investors, U.S. institutional investors are likely to adopt an aggressive buying strategy.” Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only asset investors bought because of its dip. Onchain data also show that whales bought more than 100 million XRP as the token price fell due and retail sold in panic. Analysts predictions come true as crypto prices rebound Meanwhile, the dip now appears to be over for now, as almost every crypto asset has seen a surge in price over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin which fell as low as around $94,000 is now back above $101,000 after over 6% increase in its value. With the rise in Bitcoin price, every other major cap token has followed, with XRP seeing the most gains in 24 hours at 18%, according to CoinMarketCap. SOL also increased by 10%, while BNB, DOGE, and ADA added 5%, 8%, and 13%, respectively. Most analysts who predicted the rebound were not surprised. According to Santiment analysts on December 10, the FUD among traders who expect Bitcoin to drop below $90,000 is a positive sign of incoming retail capitulation. This is a good sign, as prices tend to move against market expectations. They wrote: “FUD is beginning to appear amongst traders. With some calls for $80K-$89K appearing across social media from the crowd once again, take this as a positive sign that retail capitulation is returning. Prices move the opposite direction of crowd expectation, meaning fear is generally necessary for prices to rebound.” However, Cryptoquant founder Ki Young Ju explained the quick rebound, noting that price corrections for BTC will be relatively small in this bull cycle. He attributes this to steady demand from institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has been the least volatile Bitcoin bull cycle (Source: Glassnode) Glassnode data also supports this, with analysts noting that the average drawdown since 2022 is -7.68% compared to -16.24% overall. The maximum drawdown for this cycle is only -26.25%, far smaller than the -71.15% between 2011 and 2013. This shows that this cycle has been the least volatile for Bitcoin. Bitcoin bull cycle expected to last longer as distribution continues With Bitcoin returning to over $100,000 again, there are already some concerns about how long the good times will last. Experts at Glassnode believe the bull cycle is still in the mid-to-late stage with the potential for more price increases. They noted that cyclical long-term holders (LTH), excluding the ultra LTH who have held for over seven years, now have less than 50% of the BTC supply. Generally, these LTHs hold the majority of BTC at the beginning of the bull cycle, and by the peak, their supply has dropped, and short-term holders (STH) have around 70% – 80%. Although the ETFs have changed the dynamics to some extent, STH still only holds around 50%, far below the over 80% they had when the market peaked in 2021. However, the level of distribution has increased over the last 30 days, with the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio dropping to 3.78, which is the lowest it’s been this cycle. The decline in the Mean Investment Age suggests the Bull Cycle is still on – (Source: Santiment) Meanwhile, Santiment data shows that the Mean Dollar Invested Age has been declining. This metric, which determines how long a wallet has held an asset, has fallen 31% in 60 weeks for Bitcoin, 22% in 14 weeks for XRP, and 31% in eight weeks for Dogecoin. The fact that coins in wallets are getting younger means that there is distribution, and historically, a bull market only ends when the mean age starts increasing.

Table of Contents XRP price rally: 24,544% ROI in the horizon PropiChain: The hidden altcoin that could outshine XRP’s 24,544% gains PropiChain presale: Limited time offer Analysts have predicted that the XRP price surge could jump to 24,544% ROI, creating excitement in the crypto space. That’s not all; experts predict that the XRP price could increase, potentially reaching a new all-time high of $589. However, a new altcoin is also capturing investor interest. PropiChain promises to double on XRP’s gains and offers revolutionary features to redefine the trillion-dollar real estate industry. As PropiChain gains momentum, the stage 1 presale has already sold out 94% of its tokens, setting the stage for an explosive future. You might also like: PropiChain’s token presale surges as investors seek 10,000x gains XRP price rally: 24,544% ROI in the horizon A recent analysis by Crypto expert Cryptobilbuwoo0 signals a strong rally for XRP price driven by the token’s impressive performance since early November. XRP price has jumped through several critical levels, including $0.64, $0.915, $1.13, and $1.612, signaling an upward trajectory. Similarly, experts forecast that XRP price could reach an ambitious target of $6.25 and $26.6 shortly. Predictions show that the XRP price could jump further to $50, $113.13, and even $589 if it maintains the bullish momentum. This prediction has boosted investor confidence in the future potential of XRP price. Regulatory clarity could further boost the XRP price performance. Consequently, if the XRP’s SEC litigation is resolved, a similar growth will follow, making XRP a great player in the crypto market. The XRP price is $2.25 at press time, just 35% of its all-time high. If the token breaks out beyond this level, XRP price could surge even higher, cementing XRP’s place in the current crypto bull run. PropiChain: The hidden altcoin that could outshine XRP’s 24,544% gains While the XRP price is undeniably impressive, PropiChain is garnering investor attention with the potential to deliver double the returns of XRP. PropiChain is breaking barriers in the blockchain space with its unique solutions for the trillion-dollar real estate market. By addressing real-world problems in property investment and management, PropiChain stands out in the crypto market. At the heart of PropiChain’s value proposition is fractional property ownership, which democratizes access to the lucrative real estate market. PropiChain users can purchase a fraction of high-end properties to diversify their portfolios and access lucrative investments without hefty capital requirements. Again, PropiChain stands out for its automated valuation models that offer accurate valuation of properties. This enables investors to buy or sell properties at fair market value. Accurate property valuations reduce risks to buyers and sellers. Also, PropiChain integrates artificial intelligence to help investors make informed decisions. The platform provides real-time market analysis and property valuations, which makes it easy for investors to jump on emerging opportunities. Adding to its appeal, PropiChain integrates with the Metaverse to create a futuristic immersive experience for users. Using the Metaverse, investors can take virtual tours of potential investment properties and walk through them from their homes. This breaks down geographical barriers while giving investors a firsthand view of a prospective asset. Security and trust is the cornerstone of PropiChain’s architecture. Similarly, BlockAudit has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract to confirm it’s free from vulnerabilities. Similarly, investors are assured that the platform adheres to high-security standards. Again, the recent listing of PropiChain on CoinMarketCap enhances the credibility and accessibility of the token. Similarly, for the token to be listed on a prominent platform like CoinMarketCap is a great milestone, which shows that the best is yet to come. PropiChain presale: Limited time offer As the XRP price prepares for a historic rally, PropiChain emerges as a token that can double those gains. With a groundbreaking approach to real estate and unmatched ROI potential, PropiChain is the next big thing in crypto. The PropiChain presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, with 94% of tokens already sold out, raising over $1.3 million in the first round. The tokens are priced at $0.004, the lowest it will ever be, signaling the perfect time for you to secure a position in this revolutionary project. If someone invests an initial investment of $1,000, their investment will be worth almost $500,000 upon hitting the target price. As the demand increases and the Stage 1 presale nears completion, this rare opportunity to invest at such a low price quickly slips away.

XRP Price: Analyst Predicts Surge To $7 Amid Recent Rally And Whale Activity Recently, the XRP price witnessed a major rally, leading to speculations of a $7 target by a Wall Street analyst. Over the past month, the XRP price has increased by over 300% on the monthly charts, marking a high for XRP since its last rally in 2021. Based on the Wall Street analyst, a win against the SEC could see the XRP price increase over $7, passing the all-time high XRP price of $3.84 in January 2018. Moreover, recent whale transactions suggest the potential for a new all-time high in this bull run. According to data from CoinGecko, Ripple’s XRP has a market cap of $137 billion with a daily trading volume of $13 billion. As of the time of this writing, XRP price is trading at $2.40. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale For Outstanding Gains WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently carrying its ICO, with its native token selling for a low price of $0.0241 .

In a new filing, the regulatory agency says it’s seeking comments from the public on Bitwise’s new exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would hold a combination of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), to advance its application. “Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the [law].” In a thread on the social media platform X, Bitwise stated its goal with the dual ETP was to simultaneously give traders easy access to the two biggest digital assets by market cap. “NYSE Arca filed to list a Bitwise ETP that would hold both spot Bitcoin and Ether, weighted by market cap. The goal: give investors balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in the world in an easy-to-access format.” Spot market ETFs allow investors to expose themselves to specific assets, such as precious metals or crypto, without the need to actually purchase them. In the filing, the SEC notes that the new ETP “will operate in materially the same manner as the Spot Bitcoin ETPs and Spot Ether ETPs previously approved by the Commission.” Bitwise first announced its plan to launch a BTC and ETH ETF in November when it filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC. BTC and ETH are trading for $100,786 and $3,890 at time of writing respectively.

The decision came just weeks after the court heard Nvidia’s appeal and days after China announced an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker. Source: supremecourt.gov Crypto Crash Fallout: Nvidia Faces Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Misstatements On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would no longer decide on a lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misrepresenting its reliance on the cryptocurrency mining industry. In a brief unsigned opinion, the court dismissed the case as “improvidently granted,” indicating it was a mistake to take up the matter. No justices dissented from the decision. This dismissal upholds a prior appeals court ruling, which allowed most of the case against Nvidia to proceed. The lawsuit dates back to 2018, when a Swedish investment firm filed the complaint after a downturn in cryptocurrency profitability caused Nvidia’s revenue to fall short of expectations. This led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock value. Investors allege that Nvidia downplayed its reliance on crypto-related revenue, misleading the market. The plaintiffs argue Nvidia misrepresented its reliance on the crypto market, inflating its stock value. Nvidia argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a law designed to curb baseless securities complaints. The company argued that the plaintiffs failed to meet two key requirements: identifying specific false statements and providing sufficient evidence that company officials knowingly misled investors. While a district court initially dismissed the case, a federal appeals court later reinstated it. The Biden administration supported the plaintiffs, further raising the case’s profile. The Supreme Court’s decision avoids setting a precedent on how the 1995 law should be applied, leaving the appeals court’s interpretation as the guiding standard for now. As a result, the case against Nvidia will proceed. China’s Antitrust Investigation: Will Nvidia’s Growth Face New Roadblocks? The decision resembles a similar move in November when the Supreme Court dismissed a securities fraud case against Facebook. That case centered on allegations that Facebook failed to disclose a data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to collect user information. Like the Nvidia case, the dismissal upheld an appeals court ruling, enabling the lawsuit to proceed. In 2022, Nvidia paid the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a $5.5 million fine to settle charges of failing to disclose that crypto mining was a key driver of revenue growth for its gaming graphics cards. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Despite the legal challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the technology sector. Its stock price has surged by 180% this year, driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence market. Nvidia’s chips are essential for training and running AI systems, making it a crucial player in the industry. Adding to Nvidia’s challenges, China recently launched an antitrust investigation into the company. The probe raises questions about potential violations of Chinese antimonopoly laws, intensifying scrutiny as Nvidia continues its rapid growth. This lawsuit is part of a broader trend of high-profile class-action cases against tech companies. The Supreme Court recently dismissed another appeal by Meta, Facebook’s parent company, which sought to block a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit over privacy breaches related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

According to a Proof of Workforce X post, the Kenya National Fire Brigades Association (KENFIBA) has completed setting up its Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. That move makes KENFIBA the country’s pioneering workers’ body to have BTC on its balance sheet. It may also be the first labor union to hold a BTC reserve in Africa. BTC reserve will enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity KENFIBA pulled off that feat courtesy of “get off zero” funding by Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit that helps workers and their unions invest in BTC. The donor said the crypto fund would help enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity. The X post read: KENFIBA, The Kenya National Fire Brigades Association, adds Bitcoin onto their balance sheet, becoming the first labor union in Kenya to hold Bitcoin! Potentially, the first labor union on the continent to hold Bitcoin. ~ Proof of Workforce But, one X user, James Otudor challenged Proof of Workforce’s second statement. He held that the Academic Staff Union of a renowned Nigerian University had a BTC reserve before KENFIBA. We couldn’t independently verify Mr Otudor’s claims. What will KENFIBA gain from setting up a BTC reserve? Proof of Workforce’s advisor, Magdalena Gronowska, explained the significance of the collaboration. She said that through it, KENFIBA would enhance its hiring process, member sign-up, and emergency responses. She added that the two institutions had discussed how workers could gain from holding BTC. Also, the deal will see KENFIBA management accessing visionary Bitcoin developers in the country. These BTC developers are local Kenyans who will provide the union and its membership with tools, education, and resources to run the reserve. Africa is making big strides in adopting blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI technology. That’s evidenced by the growing number of the continent’s governments setting up structures to support the uptake of these evolving technologies. Countries like Egypt, Senegal, Algeria, Rwanda, Benin, and Mauritius have officially sanctioned AI programs. Meanwhile, Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria, South Africa, are among many that have instituted policies to spur developments in those technological fields.

Exec Fostered Altcoin Slush Fund, Prosecutors Explain The younger Kim appealed the verdict at the High Court. But his legal team failed to convince the court to change his sentence. He was found guilty of conspiring with Arowana Tech, an IT startup that had received substantial Hancom backing, to create a slush fund using the former’s Arowana (ARW) tokens. The District Court found the younger Kim guilty of breach of trust violations under the Specific Economic Crime Aggravated Punishment Act. A branch of the Suwon District Court. (Source: Yonhap TV News/YouTube/Screenshot) The same court also sentenced a 48-year-old Arowana Tech executive surnamed Jeong to two and a half years in prison. iNews24 reported that the Suwon High Court’s Criminal Division dismissed appeals from the younger Kim and Jeong’s legal teams on December 11. It also dismissed counterarguments from the prosecution, who asked the court to extend the jail sentences. Prosecutors had also also asked the High Court to impose further fines on the duo.

The prosecution service also accused Hancom With, Hancom’s blockchain arm, of conspiring with Arowana Tech to “manipulate” ARW prices. Prosecutors claimed that the defendants traded Arowana tokens between 2021 and 2022 to raise money for the “slush fund.” The coin rose in value suddenly on April 20, 2021, after it was listed on domestic crypto exchanges. It has since been delisted, but its meteoric x1,075 rise drew immediate suspicion from investigators. The token’s price shot up from $0.035 to just under $38 within the space of just 30 minutes after it was listed. The prosecution has argued that the younger Kim “and others” had “the authority” to “withdraw” ARW tokens.

The prosecution is also hopeful of bringing the senior Kim to trial. In July, the service applied for an arrest warrant . But a court dismissed the application.

Qubetics Surpasses 305M Tokens Sold While Cardano And Fantom Make Noise,https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-for-2025-qubetics-surpasses-305m-tokens-sold-while-cardano-and-fantom-make-noise/,"Are you keeping up with the latest buzz in crypto? Cardano and Fantom have been making noise with exciting developments, and everyone’s asking: which are the best altcoins to buy for 2025? But wait—there’s a new player in town. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project already raising eyebrows with its innovative tech and presale tally of over $5.5 million. While established players like Cardano are streamlining blockchain ecosystems and Fantom is chasing life-changing gains, Qubetics offers something fresh—a solution to privacy concerns and scalability issues with its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Could this be the one that redefines decentralised tech? Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out. Qubetics: The Rising Star Solving Real-World Problems Qubetics is creating waves for all the right reasons. The project, now in its 12th presale stage, has already sold over 305 million $TICS tokens, with a growing community of more than 8,400 token holders. At a presale price of just $0.0311, this could be a golden opportunity for early adopters. So, why is Qubetics special? It tackles one of the most pressing issues in today’s digital landscape: online privacy. Centralised VPNs often compromise user security and restrict data access. Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) that offers secure, private, and unrestricted internet usage. Think about it—how often have you worried about your data being exploited or your privacy being breached? Qubetics ensures you don’t have to. For better guidance, please watch this video . Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer Blockchain scalability has always been a headache. Qubetics’ infrastructure ensures seamless transaction processing without bottlenecks, something many predecessors failed to achieve. Blockchain apps can feel like rocket science to newcomers. Qubetics simplifies this with intuitive tools like the QubeQode IDE, making blockchain tech accessible to developers and users alike. Crypto analysts have set high expectations for Qubetics, with potential prices of $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. For perspective, a $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.0311 could net over $300,000 if these predictions hold true. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a practical solution to real-world problems. And with its presale success, it’s clear the market sees its potential. Cardano: The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Leader Cardano, often called the “green blockchain,” has been a market favourite for years. Its unique Proof-of-Stake mechanism offers an energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin’s energy-hungry Proof-of-Work system. But that’s not all—Cardano’s smart contract functionality continues to attract developers, making it one of the most versatile platforms out there. Recent updates suggest a bright future. According to Binance, Cardano’s developments include faster transaction speeds and enhanced decentralisation. Analysts predict a potential rally that could make ADA a hot pick for 2025. But will it outperform Qubetics? Only time will tell. Fantom: The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Fantom has been making waves with its high-speed, low-cost blockchain solutions. Known for its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, Fantom provides near-instant transaction finality, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. Crypto-News-Flash recently highlighted Fantom’s potential to deliver 100x gains, especially with the growing interest in DeFi and AI integrations. However, scalability remains a challenge for Fantom, and projects like Qubetics could steal the spotlight with more comprehensive solutions. Conclusion While Cardano and Fantom offer compelling features, Qubetics is carving a niche by solving fundamental issues like online privacy, scalability, and accessibility. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) and user-friendly QubeQode IDE set it apart in a crowded market. The presale numbers speak for themselves—over 305 million tokens sold and counting. With analysts predicting prices of $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, there’s undeniable potential for life-changing gains. A $1,000 investment today could redefine your portfolio by 2025. So, are you ready to secure your slice of the future? Don’t miss out—join the Qubetics revolution before the presale ends. Invest in Qubetics Today and be part of the next crypto success story!

Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, added these tokens to its platform on December 11, 2024. The listing has brought newfound attention to these meme coins, with their prices surging amid broader market gains. Kraken’s move to list FWOG, GOAT, and SPX marks a growing trend of meme coins being adopted by major exchanges. This development also signals increasing mainstream interest in Solana-based tokens. As more exchanges add meme coins to their offerings, many crypto enthusiasts view these listings as a bullish signal for the broader market. Kraken’s Addition of FWOG, GOAT, and SPX The Kraken exchange announced that it would begin supporting spot trading for FWOG, GOAT , and SPX on December 11. These tokens join a growing list of meme coins available on the platform, expanding Kraken’s cryptocurrency offerings. The exchange had previously included FWOG, GOAT, and SPX in its listing roadmap, with the goal of enabling users to trade these tokens. FWOG and GOAT are native to the Solana blockchain, while SPX is another meme token also now available for trading on Kraken. As of press time, GOAT has seen a 24.25% increase in value, FWOG is up by 12.95%, and SPX has risen by 7.81%. The price surges of these coins are likely tied to the Kraken listing, although a market-wide rise in meme coins may have contributed to these gains as well. Meme Coin Surge Driven by Broader Market Trends The price increases of FWOG, GOAT, and SPX align with a general rise in meme coin values across the market. Meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Floki have experienced similar growth as major exchanges have added them to their listings. While the Kraken listing might have sparked some of the recent price increases, broader market trends in the meme coin sector likely played a significant role in driving these tokens’ values higher. Concurrently, some analysts believe the surge in meme coin prices could be linked to increased attention on the market after U.S. political events, including the re-election of former President Donald Trump. This event has been credited with encouraging the wider adoption of digital assets in the U.S. market. However, users in several countries, including the Netherlands (NL), Spain (ES), Ireland (IE), Belgium (BE), Italy (IT), and Germany (DE), are currently unable to access these tokens on the Kraken platform. Market Sentiment Around Meme Coins Subsequently, Kraken’s listing of these Solana-based tokens follows similar actions by other major platforms like Coinbase. Recently, Coinbase also added tokens such as Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and MOG COIN, both of which are part of the growing meme coin trend. Despite the price rallies, some in the cryptocurrency industry remain cautious about the growing popularity of meme coins. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has voiced concerns about the proliferation of meme coins, urging a focus on developing practical blockchain applications instead of pursuing purely speculative tokens. In an X post, CZ stated, “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” while acknowledging that meme coins are becoming increasingly unpredictable.

Key support is holding strong at $10.88, while resistance looms at $12.99. Sustained bullish sentiment could drive the price toward the $13.00 level. Internet Computer (ICP) has shown a modest bullish movement on December 11, closing at $12.81, reflecting a 2.97% increase over the past 24 hours. The price action reveals a recovery after dipping to an intraday low of $10.88 before steadily climbing toward the current level. The ICP indicates strong buying interest near the $12.57 level, with a breakout above the $12.99 mark acting as a bullish trigger. The overall market sentiment suggests the potential for further upside if ICP maintains support above $10.88. The resistance level is around $12.99, and selling pressure could intensify. If the bulls sustain momentum, a breakout could lead ICP toward the $13.00 mark in the near term, signaling a continuation of the recovery trend. Internet Computer 1-day price chart: ICP displays resilience amid bullish rebound Internet Computer (ICP) shows signs of recovery, trading at $12.81 with a 2.97% gain over the last 24 hours. After retracing from a recent high near $12.71, the token found support around $10.88 and rebounded, indicating renewed buying interest. The current candlestick pattern suggests bullish momentum as ICP attempts to consolidate above the $12.00 level. However, a decisive breakout above the $12.99 resistance is required for sustained upward movement. ICP displays resilience amid bullish rebound The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 54.74, recovering from a brief dip into neutral territory and signaling that bullish momentum is regaining strength. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line (0.909) above the MACD line (1.192), reflecting mild selling pressure that could limit immediate gains. A close watch on these indicators is essential as ICP moves within a critical consolidation zone, potentially setting the stage for a breakout or further sideways movement. Internet Computer 4-hour price chart: ICP seeks stability amid gradual recovery Internet Computer (ICP) is trading at $12.81, up 2.97% in the past 4 hours, signaling a gradual recovery after recent price dips. The token has rebounded from a key support level near $10.88, approaching minor resistance around $12.99. The price action suggests cautious optimism as bulls attempt to regain control, though the lack of strong momentum could limit immediate gains. ICP seeks stability amid gradual recovery The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.12, climbing from oversold levels near 31.90 but still reflecting neutral-to-bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, the MACD shows signs of narrowing bearish momentum, with the MACD line (-0.499) edging closer to the signal line (-0.583), suggesting a potential bullish crossover. If buying pressure increases, these indicators could support further upside; however, continued caution is warranted in the short term.

Its recent recovery suggests strong buying interest, with support levels holding near $10.88 and resistance at $12.99. Bullish sentiment is driving momentum, and a breakout above the resistance level could lead to testing the $13.00 level in the near term. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies.

The analyst made this prediction based on his wave analysis, which showed that XRP is still bullish. XRP Price To Hit New ATH At $5.85 In an X post, Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price could reach a new ATH of $5.85 based on his ABC wave analysis. The analyst stated that XRP set the ABC wave when the crypto was at Wave A. He further noted that XRP has bounced back from the $1.88 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next With this development, the analyst is confident that the XRP price rally to $5.85 has begun. The analyst recently revealed that a bull flag appeared on XRP’s weekly chart, which showed that the crypto could reach as high as $11 by early 2025. Based on his Elliot Wave theory, the analyst had also previously predicted that the XRP market top could be around $18. In the meantime, the goal is for the XRP price to surpass its current ATH of $3.80 and reach $5.85, as Dark Defender has predicted. XRP has witnessed a price correction following its parabolic rally of over 200% last month. However, the crypto looks well primed for its next leg up. From a fundamental perspective, the XRP price boasts a bullish outlook, especially following New York’s approval of the RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that exchange and partner listings are set to follow and that RLUSD will launch soon. This development caused the price to experience a significant bounce. Meanwhile, crypto analyst TheXRPguy listed the RLUSD launch as one of the events that market participants wait for before they consider selling their coins. The stablecoin launch would inject more liquidity into the XRP ecosystem, which could spark a significant surge in the XRP price. The Stars Are Aligning For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said that the stars are aligning for a massive bull run for the XRP price. He made this statement while alluding to the fact that experts predict that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could dismiss its appeal against Ripple when the new administration comes in.

As such, dismissing the appeal could boost investors’ confidence in the crypto, providing a bullish outlook for the XRP price. CrediBULL Crypto suggested that XRP could reach as high as $10 in this bull run while stating that there should be more than one wave of upside remaining. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.34, up over 8% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Inspired by the animated Netflix series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, the game will debut on Arbitrum. Ubisoft, known for publishing popular franchises like Assassin’s Creed and Just Dance, has featured a cast of characters from its previous titles, including Far Cry: Rayman, Assassin’s Creed, Blood Dragon, Beyond Good and Evil, The Crew, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Watch Dogs. Ubisoft has a free NFT mint for the game While gamers await the launch in a week, a free NFT mint is happening today. Niji Warrior, the games’ NFT collection, is launching today on the Magic Eden Marketplace . The NFT allows holders to make inputs into game mechanics, map designs, and storylines. Holders of these tokens will have access to exclusive perks and the leeway to participate in community governance. They could also evolve their NFTs based on how deeply they engage. Ubisoft’s Technical Director and Executive Producer, Didier Genevois, spoke on the project: This project represents a new frontier in collaborative game development, where players become co-creators. ~ Didier Genevois All the 10,000 Niji warrior NFTs portray a pixel of a robot or creature. The art is similar to the artwork for Warlords NFTs, released earlier by Ubisoft’s Champions Tactics last year. Web3 gaming continues to gain momentum The Web3 gaming space has taken an upward trajectory, and there are signs that it’s not stopping anytime soon. Non-fungible token sales have also been growing steadily since October. The first week of November was pleasing, as the sale volumes settled at $187 million. While NFTs are regaining attention, the Beam Foundation is preparing to launch a $150 million fund to improve Web3 gaming in Abu Dhabi. Although the NFT sector has been struggling for years after the 2021 NFT boom, Web3 gaming, and leisure-based apps have continued to show a bullish nature as we move towards 2025. Ubisoft’s entry into web3 gaming has been smooth due to how organized they were while venturing. The French firm included alpha and beta tests, which allowed users to give feedback, thus ensuring that game mechanics were well-balanced.

If you missed the FLOKI Inu hype train back in the day, here’s your shot at redemption. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is not just another meme coin; it’s attracting the bulls with its lucrative presale, already raising over $3.4 million and selling more than 50 billion coins to over 4,400 holders. At just $0.00012 in its 11th presale stage, BTFD promises massive gains for early investors. But why is BTFD creating such a buzz? For starters, it’s all about turning market dips into opportunities. With features like staking, a P2E game, and an incredibly loyal Bulls Squad community, BTFD is carving its place in the meme coin hall of fame. Let’s dive into why BTFD is set to dethrone FLOKI as the meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin: The Rise of the Dip-Seizing Movement The phrase “Buy the F***ing Dip” (BTFD) is a rallying cry in the crypto world, and BTFD Coin embodies this ethos like no other. Born from the concept of turning price dips into opportunities, BTFD Coin is designed for savvy investors who want to grab low-priced coins before the next market surge. The presale started at $0.000004 and has already climbed to $0.00012, showing an 11th-stage presale momentum that’s hard to ignore. With a total supply of 173 billion coins, BTFD is primed for scarcity-driven price growth. Imagine investing $1,800 today at $0.00012 per coin. You’d snag 15 million coins. By the time the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment will be worth $9,000. That’s a 400% gain without even factoring in potential bull-run profits. BTFD isn’t just about flipping coins; it’s about community and innovation. The Bulls Squad—a core group of crypto enthusiasts—drives engagement through memes, market insights, and community support. Plus, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is live. While rewards aren’t active yet, players are raving about the immersive experience and potential for future earnings. Staking is another big draw. With an average APY of 90%, BTFD rewards holders who play the long game. Stake $10,000 BTFD, and in a year, you could see your holdings nearly double. Combine that with the upcoming listing on major exchanges, and it’s clear why analysts are bullish on BTFD hitting $0.002 by late 2025. How to Buy BTFD The presale process is straightforward. For $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. If you’re holding Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, or Solana, you’re in luck. Just one Ethereum gets you 30,507,083 BTFD coins, while a single Bitcoin lands you over 813 million coins . The entry points are accessible, and the rewards are potentially massive. With over $3.4 million raised so far and only a few presale stages left, now’s the time to act. Don’t let FOMO keep you from securing your stake in the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale. FLOKI Inu: The Meme Coin You Wish You Hadn’t Missed FLOKI Inu emerged in 2021 as part of the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin frenzy. Named after Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu, FLOKI combined the power of internet culture with a solid community-driven approach. Early adopters saw astronomical returns, with FLOKI’s price skyrocketing by over 10,000% in its initial run. FLOKI’s roadmap has been anything but ordinary. From launching FlokiFi, its DeFi ecosystem, to developing Valhalla, a blockchain-based metaverse game, FLOKI has consistently delivered on its promises. Today, it’s trading at $0.00003456, boasting a market cap of $325 million. While the price may seem small, the returns for early investors were anything but. A modest $100 investment during FLOKI’s infancy could’ve turned into a small fortune. But as they say, hindsight is 20/20. Despite its success, FLOKI hasn’t been without challenges. The crypto market’s volatility and competition from newer meme coins have tempered its growth. Still, FLOKI remains a strong contender in the meme coin space, particularly with its push into NFTs and metaverse gaming. Why BTFD Could Be the Best Overall While FLOKI has already established itself, BTFD is just getting started. Its presale price offers incredible upside, and the project’s innovative features —from staking to its P2E game—are already generating buzz. With FLOKI, the ship might’ve sailed for 1,000x returns, but with BTFD, the journey is just beginning. The Verdict: Don’t Miss Out Again Cryptocurrency is about timing, and if FLOKI taught us anything, it’s that early birds truly get the worm. BTFD Coin’s presale is shaping up to be the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale of 2024, with analysts predicting explosive growth. Whether you’re looking to play the P2E game, stake your coins for long-term rewards, or simply ride the next meme coin wave, BTFD has something for everyone. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Sign up today and secure your stake before the presale ends. Your financial future might just thank you.

37523514,https://coingape.com/?p=228908,1733962797,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Stablecoin Market Hits Record $200B Milestone, $400B by 2025?",https://coingape.com/stablecoin-market-hits-record-200b-milestone-400b-by-2025/,"The stablecoin market has crossed a significant threshold, with its total market capitalization reaching $200 billion for the first time. This growth marks a sharp rise signaling the increasing adoption of these digital assets across various sectors. According to data from CCData and DefiLlama, the stablecoin market has added $10 billion in value in just two weeks, surpassing the $190 billion peak seen during the 2022 crypto market rally. Stablecoin Market Surpasses $200B, Poised to Double to $400B in 2025, Experts Say According to DefiLlama , the stablecoin market cap has surpassed $200 billion, driven by the ongoing crypto rally and increasing use cases beyond digital currencies. The growth of stablecoins has been fueled by a rise in crypto trading and the increasing adoption of non-crypto applications such as payments, remittances, and savings. This shift is particularly noticeable in regions with fragile financial systems and high inflation. Tether’s USDT has seen its market value soar to a record $139 billion. This represents a 12% increase in just one month, according to data from DefiLlama. Moreover, over 109 million on-chain wallets are holding USDT by Q4 2024, making it one of the most widely held digital assets. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, has also grown, reaching nearly $41 billion in market value, up by 5% in the same period. Key Factors Driving Growth Several factors are contributing to the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market. One of the main drivers is the increasing integration in everyday financial systems, including remittances and peer-to-peer payment platforms. Stablecoins offer an alternative means of transferring value, especially in countries with depreciating local currencies. In addition, stablecoins are gaining traction as a yield-generating investment vehicle. New products like Ethena’s USDe token, which uses a strategy of shorting Bitcoin and Ether, have been increasingly popular. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has been recognized as an Accepted Virtual Asset by Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This milestone allows licensed entities to offer USDT-related services, supporting the UAE’s vision to become a global digital finance hub. Future Outlook: Market Could Reach $400B by 2025 Additionally, experts predict that the stablecoin market could grow even further, potentially reaching $400 billion by 2025. A report from asset manager Bitwise suggests that U.S. legislation could be a major catalyst for this growth. If the U.S. Congress passes clear regulatory frameworks, it would encourage more businesses and consumers to adopt them. This regulatory clarity will enable traditional financial institutions, like banks, to enter the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon recently signaled the firm’s potential cryptocurrency expansion, dependent on regulatory shifts. The bank has built a digital asset infrastructure but remains constrained by legal limitations. Solomon indicated readiness to engage with Bitcoin and Ethereum if the regulatory environment is favorable. In addition, fintech companies are increasingly integrating stablecoins into their services, following the example set by PayPal with its PYUSD token. The use case expansion of global payments will continue, as it offers a stable alternative to volatile cryptos and traditional financial services. More so, reports from Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets suggest that stablecoins could eventually make up 10% of the U.S. money supply and foreign exchange transactions. This represents a substantial increase from the current 1% share.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-12 00:42:35

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 97,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the phase of the cycle when it pauses before skyrocketing to new record highs. The trader shares a chart suggesting that DOGE is mirroring its price action during the 2017 and 2021 market cycles while trading in a large ascending channel. “Check out where we are in the Dogecoin DOGE bull cycle! Very early, right? For that reason, I’m thankful for the dip and will buy more between $0.40-$0.30. The target remains $3, and if things go wild, $18!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.391, down nearly 5% on the day. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), Martinez says that the altcoin can find support at the $1 level based on the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric. IOMAP classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ADA. According to the metric, 41,720 addresses have accumulated over one billion ADA at $1. Source: Ali Martinez/X Zooming out, Martinez says Cardano appears to be following its 2020 price action when it witnessed a period of retracement before soaring to fresh highs. “Cardano is doing the same as it did in 2020, which is why I’m buying! Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is trading at $1.

Cornerstone Of A Financial Revolution Eric believes that Bitcoin being traded at $1 million per coin may happen soon, describing the crypto as the “cornerstone of a financial revolution.” COMMENT: Eric Trump is confident that Bitcoin will hit $1M. https://t.co/iFb5cmzpFz — BSCN (@BSCNews) December 10, 2024 Trump’s son made the fearless forecast as he talked to the attendees of the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, delivering his prediction to the audience without any taint of doubt on the capability of Bitcoin to hit that milestone. “I can tell you a hell of a lot more eyes are going to be opened when Bitcoin hits $1 million. And I’m confident it’s going to hit $1 million. I think we’re all confident in this room that it’s going to hit a million,” Eric stated. According to Eric, he sees Bitcoin as a “global asset”, pointing out the global significance of the crypto in a time wherein the threat of inflation, political instability, and natural disasters is rampant. For the Trump Organization’s vice president, the future of finance is Bitcoin, arguing that the crypto is a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies because of its decentralized quality and fixed supply of 21 million coins. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” he added. More Accessible Financial Tool Eric noted that what makes Bitcoin successful as a global asset is its accessibility, adding that crypto does not need intermediaries such as banks or brokers in its transactions. Trump’s son stressed the global appeal of cryptocurrency and how user-friendly is the digital asset as compared to traditional real estate investments. “Unlike real estate, Bitcoin is not tied to geography. It’s global, instantly liquid. You can buy or sell it while having dinner with your spouse,” Eric explained. Moreover, Eric emphasized that Bitcoin could empower people in developing nations. “Bitcoin gives everybody the opportunity around the world to participate in ways they never otherwise would have thought, no matter their wealth, no matter their location,” he remarked.

According to the on-chain analytics firm DefiLlama, traders’ interest and liquidity in the SOL chain appear to be rising. Data shows that SOL’s daily trading volume has skyrocketed from $2.91 billion on December 7, 2024, to $6 billion on December 11, 2024, reaching its highest level since November 2024.

Zignaly (ZIG) and Stacks (STX) are making headlines for their recent activity, including Stacks’s struggles with price declines amidst major upgrades and Zignaly’s innovative new features. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with its revolutionary approach to crypto payments and digital asset management, showing massive potential to reshape the industry. For all the hype surrounding these coins, Qubetics stands out as a solution-oriented project tackling issues others have ignored. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, users can finally manage crypto as easily as fiat, simplifying payments and cross-border transactions. Plus, with its smart contract conversion mechanism, Qubetics aims to make crypto a mainstream payment method without the headache of volatility. Add to that its stellar presale performance (over $5.5M raised and counting), and it’s easy to see why early investors are jumping in. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin trying to ride the wave—it’s rewriting the playbook. At its core is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, designed to make crypto payments as intuitive as swiping a card. Whether you’re team Apple Pay or Google Pay, this wallet lets you make everyday transactions with crypto just as easily. One of Qubetics’ coolest features? Its smart contract conversion mechanism. Picture this: you’re at a coffee shop, paying for your latte with Ethereum, but the shop only accepts USD. With Qubetics, your crypto converts to fiat automatically, instantly, and securely—no fuss, no extra fees. Let’s break it down. Take Josh, for example—a small business owner who wants to accept crypto but doesn’t want to deal with market volatility. With Qubetics, Josh gets paid in his preferred currency, hassle-free. Now imagine Clara, a digital nomad working abroad. She uses Qubetics for cross-border transactions, avoiding hefty transfer fees and long delays. Currently, $TICS is in Presale Phase 12, priced at $0.0311. Over 8,400 holders have snapped up 305M tokens, raising more than $5.5M so far. With a 10% price hike every week and a post-presale target price of $0.25, early investors are looking at a potential 900% ROI. If you’ve been waiting for the perfect crypto play, now’s the time to jump on board. Zignaly (ZIG): Empowering Everyday Investors Zignaly has always been about leveling the playing field for crypto traders, and their latest moves are no exception. Zignaly’s social investing platform allows users to follow expert traders and copy their strategies—a huge win for newbies who don’t have time to deep-dive into charts. But what’s the real kicker? Zignaly’s profit-sharing model means you only pay a fee if your chosen trader earns you money. That’s transparency and accountability rolled into one! This month, Zignaly has been ramping up with new features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its reach. Imagine this: Lisa is a college student dabbling in crypto. She uses Zignaly to follow seasoned traders, growing her portfolio while focusing on her studies. The platform’s hands-free approach is perfect for folks who want to get into crypto without becoming full-time traders. With its focus on user-friendly investing and continued innovation, Zignaly is shaping up to be a strong contender for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. As its user base grows and its ZIG token gains more utility, this one’s worth watching closely. Stacks (STX): Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential While Bitcoin is the granddaddy of crypto, it’s not exactly known for its flexibility. That’s where Stacks comes in. Built on the Bitcoin network, Stacks uses smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to bring new functionality to the OG blockchain. The big news? Stacks recently rolled out the Nakamoto Upgrade, which reduces transaction times and boosts scalability. This upgrade is a game-changer, making Stacks faster and more efficient. However, the price of STX has faced headwinds recently, partly due to market-wide corrections and competition in the Layer-2 space. Take Emma, a digital artist who’s started selling her NFTs on a Stacks-powered dApp. She loves how the platform lets her keep full control of her work and earn royalties automatically. Meanwhile, businesses are exploring Stacks’s smart contracts to streamline supply chains and other operations. Despite its current challenges, Stacks’s tech advancements make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. If Stacks can overcome short-term market hurdles, its future looks bright. Your Move, Crypto Investor So, what’s the takeaway? Qubetics ($TICS) is a trailblazer, turning crypto payments into something even your grandma could use. Zignaly (ZIG) is empowering regular folks to grow their wealth with minimal effort. And Stacks (STX) is unlocking new possibilities for Bitcoin, even as it weathers some market turbulence. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Zignaly (ZIG), and Stacks (STX) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024.

Here’s Why Qubetics Could Be Your Ticket to the Next Big Crypto Jackpot!,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-ethereums-rise-heres-why-qubetics-could-be-your-ticket-to-the-next-big-crypto-jackpot/,"Ethereum has been making headlines yet again. As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has proven it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. With its continuous upgrades, expanding ecosystem, and adoption by big players, it’s no surprise Ethereum has cemented its place as a giant in the crypto world. But let’s be real: if you didn’t jump on the Ethereum train early, those massive gains feel like a distant dream. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary project that’s turning heads with its presale success and unique focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWA). While Ethereum paved the way for decentralized apps and smart contracts, Qubetics is stepping up to solve real-world problems, creating opportunities for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday people. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Your Second Chance at Crypto Gold Missed the Ethereum craze? No sweat. Qubetics is here to give you another shot at life-changing gains. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just riding the crypto wave—it’s making waves of its own. Focused on bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds, Qubetics enables users to tokenise real-world assets. Imagine transforming your property, artwork, or intellectual property into blockchain-based tokens. It’s not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. Here’s the exciting part: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0311. Over 305 million tokens have already been sold, and the presale has raised a whopping $5.5 million. With over 8,400 holders on board, the buzz around Qubetics is impossible to ignore. And with each phase increasing the token price by 10%, this is the moment to act. By the time the presale ends, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, offering early investors a staggering 900% ROI. But Qubetics isn’t just about numbers. It’s about impact. Whether you’re a small business owner tokenising assets for funding or an artist selling digital creations globally, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. It’s not just another crypto project—it’s a solution for the real world. Ethereum: The Trailblazer There’s no denying Ethereum’s place in the crypto hall of fame. Known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum revolutionized the blockchain world when it launched in 2015. It introduced a whole new way of thinking about cryptocurrency—not just as a store of value, but as a programmable network. Ethereum’s journey hasn’t been without challenges, from high gas fees to network congestion. However, its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, improving scalability and reducing energy consumption. Ethereum remains the go-to platform for developers, with countless projects building on its robust infrastructure. But here’s the catch: much like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s early days of astronomical returns are behind us. While it remains a strong investment for those seeking stability, the kind of explosive growth that made millionaires overnight is harder to come by. For investors looking for the next Ethereum-sized opportunity, it’s time to look elsewhere. Why Qubetics Offers What Ethereum Once Did Remember when Ethereum was the new kid on the block, promising transformative technology and massive returns? That’s exactly where Qubetics is right now. Just like Ethereum disrupted the way we think about crypto, Qubetics is doing the same by tokenising real-world assets. Here’s the kicker: while Ethereum’s ecosystem is vast, its primary focus is on digital applications. Qubetics, on the other hand, is grounded in real-world utility. It’s not just for developers or tech enthusiasts—it’s for everyone. From entrepreneurs raising capital to artists protecting their creations, Qubetics is opening doors that Ethereum never could. And let’s not forget the presale advantage. Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the rewards, but most of us missed that boat. With Qubetics, you’re getting in at the ground floor, with massive growth potential still ahead. Analysts predict $TICS could climb well beyond its post-presale price, making it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone chasing significant returns. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Makes an Impact Let’s put it into perspective. Imagine a struggling small-town bookstore owner tokenising their rare collection to attract investors and keep the doors open. Or picture a freelance designer in Chicago using Qubetics to turn their portfolio into a tokenised asset, enabling them to sell rights without losing ownership. It’s not just about profits—it’s about empowerment. For businesses, professionals, and individuals alike, Qubetics offers a lifeline. It’s about taking assets that were once illiquid and turning them into opportunities. This isn’t just crypto—it’s the future of finance. And with the presale still ongoing, there’s no better time to secure your stake in this revolutionary project. Conclusion Ethereum showed us what’s possible in the world of blockchain. It built a foundation, set the standard, and changed the game. But if you missed out on its meteoric rise, you don’t have to dwell on what could’ve been. Qubetics is your chance to get in on the next big thing, a project with the potential to surpass expectations and deliver life-changing gains. With its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, accessible presale pricing, and incredible growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . Don’t sit on the sidelines and watch another opportunity pass you by. Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of a revolution. The future is calling—are you ready to answer?

Stacks (STX) is making waves with its recent upgrades, despite a dip in price, while Kaspa (KAS) continues to impress with its bullish momentum and innovative tech stack. Both coins are trending among top performers, drawing attention from investors and traders alike. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a presale campaign that’s smashing records, solidifying its reputation as a game-changer in the digital payments space. While Kaspa and Stacks are each carving out their niche in the crypto space, Qubetics is tackling some of the most persistent problems in crypto. With its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and a suite of innovative features, Qubetics is simplifying how people use and manage digital assets. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics has raised $5.5M from over 8,400 holders, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve a spot on your watchlist for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Giant Leap for Crypto Payments Qubetics is here to shake up how we handle digital payments. At the heart of the project is its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, designed to make crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card . Whether you’re a die-hard Apple Pay user or swear by Google Pay, Qubetics has you covered. Here’s the real kicker: Qubetics integrates a smart contract conversion mechanism that automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale . This feature is a game-changer for businesses and consumers alike. Say goodbye to price volatility and complicated conversions. Imagine you’re at a local café that only accepts USD, but you want to pay in Bitcoin. Qubetics handles the conversion instantly, so your coffee gets paid for without any extra steps. Take Sarah, for instance. She runs a boutique and loves that Qubetics ensures her customers can pay with any crypto while she receives her earnings in dollars, free of market swings. Or think about Jake, a freelance designer working with clients across the globe. He uses Qubetics to get paid quickly without dealing with wire transfer fees or delays. Currently, $TICS is priced at $0.0311, with a 10% price increase set to kick in soon. With over 305M tokens sold, investors are eyeing the post-presale price of $0.25, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for a crypto project with real-world utility and explosive growth potential, Qubetics should be your top pick. Stacks (STX): Building on Bitcoin’s Foundation Stacks (STX) is taking Bitcoin to the next level by enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on its blockchain. This innovation adds layers of functionality to Bitcoin’s rock-solid foundation, making it more than just a store of value. The recent Nakamoto Upgrade is a big deal. It decouples Stacks’ block production from Bitcoin’s block times, making transactions faster and more scalable. This upgrade couldn’t have come at a better time, as demand for efficient blockchain networks continues to grow. However, despite the tech advancements, STX’s price has faced challenges recently, mirroring broader market trends. Let’s take Emma as an example. She’s a digital artist using a Stacks-powered dApp to sell her NFTs. The upgrade means her transactions are faster, and she gets paid almost instantly. Meanwhile, large corporations are tapping into Stacks’ smart contracts to automate supply chains, cutting costs and boosting efficiency. While short-term volatility might worry some investors, Stacks’ long-term potential makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. With the Nakamoto Upgrade setting the stage for broader adoption, STX could be poised for a major comeback. Kaspa (KAS): The Underdog Turned Contender Kaspa has been quietly gaining momentum and is now stepping into the spotlight. Known for its blockDAG architecture, Kaspa offers faster and more secure transactions, solving scalability issues that plague many other cryptocurrencies. Recently, Kaspa’s price surged, fueled by growing adoption and a bullish sentiment in the market. According to a recent analysis, KAS has the potential to climb even higher in 2024, supported by its strong fundamentals. The community is buzzing about Kaspa’s innovative approach to blockchain, which prioritizes speed and efficiency without compromising decentralization. Think about Alex, a developer who’s been frustrated with slow transaction times on other networks. Kaspa’s tech allows him to build apps that process transactions in seconds, creating a better experience for users. Meanwhile, traders are loving Kaspa’s price action, with many predicting it could break new all-time highs in the coming months. If you’re on the hunt for an up-and-coming project with solid tech and a passionate community, Kaspa deserves a spot in your portfolio. Its unique approach to scalability and security makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Your December 2024 Crypto Watchlist To wrap it up, all three projects—Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS)—bring something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing how we use crypto for everyday transactions, while Stacks is enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities with smart contracts. Kaspa, on the other hand, is tackling scalability issues with its cutting-edge blockDAG architecture. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a crypto newbie, these projects have the potential to deliver massive returns. Don’t wait—this could be your ticket to the next big bull run!

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

The collection was trading at 27 ETH, equivalent to $102,600, outranking Bitcoin’s price of $101,000. Pudgy Penguins has been upbeat since it reached its highest point last week, trading at almost $62,000. After the NFT hit a record high, the project team said that Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem token, PENGU , will shortly be released on Solana. The coin would benefit the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem and other stakeholders. Generally speaking, the floor price is the lowest price an asset sold on an NFT marketplace can fetch. Lil’ Pudgys and Pudgy Rods (also known as Rogs), two of the NFTs’ companion collections, have increased by over 90% in the past seven days, indicating a significant uptick in the Pudgy ecology. Pudgy Penguins is the second Largest NFT after CryptoPunks With the floor price rising above $100,000, Pudgy Penguins has become one of the largest NFT collections. It only plays second to CryptoPunk, the NFT powerhouse with a floor price of 39.5 ETH, translating to ($150,000). The Pudgy Penguins collection has 8,888 distinctive NFTs, which have experienced widespread buying sprees. CoinGecko says its price has grown to 194% over one month. It is unclear why the price of the NFT is rising this fast, but analysts are citing the announcement of PENGU as the reason. Although the release dates for PENGU tokens have not been mentioned, they will likely be launched before the year ends. The PENGU token supply will be capped at 88,888,888,888, leading to a significant cross-chain expansion for Pudgy Penguins. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs will remain on Ethereum, while the PENGU will be based on Solana. This move indicates the project is committed to leveraging different networks for opportunities. PENGU tokenomics are here already According to Pudgy Penguins’ official post on X, there is clarity on tokenomics. For starters, 25.9% of the token will be shared with the Pudgy Penguins community, and 24.12% will be set aside for the other communities and new members. 17.8% of the tokens will be allocated to current and future team members, subject to a one-year cliff and three-year vesting period. The company will remain holding 11.48% under the same vesting conditions. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs was launched in 2021. However, it faced several hurdles, and some people gave up. As of today, it prides itself on being a prominent NFT collection, extending its reach beyond digital assets.

Whale Dumped 146.6 Million DOGE Recently, Whale Alert , a whale transaction tracker, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that an unknown wallet had transferred a significant 146.6 million DOGE worth $56.5 million to the cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood. 61,160,251 #DOGE (23,493,325 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Robinhood https://t.co/tVZiVALBCQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 10, 2024 In the realm of cryptocurrency, the transfer of assets from wallets to exchanges is often seen as a negative sign. It indicates that these assets are being transferred with the intention of being sold, which can create selling pressure and lead to price declines. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish as it has formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern at the crucial resistance level of $0.42. Additionally, it has also begun to show downside momentum, which partially confirms this bearishness. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical price momentum, if DOGE remains below the $0.42 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 20% to reach $0.35 in the coming days. However, this bearish thesis is only valid as long as DOGE is trading below the $0.42 level, otherwise, it may fail. Despite this bearish outlook, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on a daily time frame indicates that it is in an uptrend. Traders Bearish Outlook However, this bearish outlook is further supported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from DOGE’s long/short ratio indicates that short sellers are currently dominating. Source: Coinglass t press time, this ratio currently stands at 0.78, a record low since the beginning of November 2024.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Table of Contents Bluntz makes bullish Shiba Inu price forecast Early buyers of DTX Exchange see 500% gains with more ahead Analyst remains optimistic on Ethereum SHIB vs. DTX vs. ETH: Evaluating the first to skyrocket Bluntz recently boldly stated that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to soar high, which has excited many traders. In an environment where the crypto market looks ready to shine, DTX Exchange (DTX) and Ethereum (ETH) are also gaining traction. While ETH shows green price charts with technical indicators suggesting bull control, DTX is ranking among the top new ICOs. The phase six presale star has provided early buyers with a 500% return and further gains are expected. Bluntz makes bullish Shiba Inu price forecast Shiba Inu is among the best meme coins. Data shows that the price of Shiba Inu increased nearly 10% in the past 30 days. Its value fluctuated between $0.000020 and $0.000030. Crypto analyst Bluntz remains optimistic about Shiba Inu. In a recent X post, he said that the meme coin currently looks very strong. He noted that a parabolic break is coming soon, which may see SHIB reach $0.000080. This positive Shiba Inu price forecast is supported by its technical analysis. The meme coin is currently trading above its 30-day EMA of $0.000026 and its 50-day EMA of $0.000024, suggesting a continued uptrend. Early buyers of DTX Exchange see 500% gains with more ahead The DTX Exchange has also been making headlines, with many traders gravitating to it as it ranks among the hottest presales. The DTX token price has jumped 500% from its beginning, and its ICO event is now in phase six, this percentage will soon increase. The hype for DTX Exchange is growing since it could transform online trading. It aims to launch a hybrid trading platform with the best of CEX and DEX. Users will get access to over 120k asset classes, including bonds and crypto coins, at up to 1,000x leverage and no sign-up KYC checks. This will allow users to easily and anonymously tap into many markets, like the $133T bonds market. Those who own the DTX token will get governance voting rights, a percentage of the trading fee revenue made by DTX Exchange, and more. Currently, DTX is worth $0.12, but phase seven will bring a price jump to $0.14. A Tier-1 crypto exchange listing could also trigger a rally to $0.20, a 66% spike from its current price.

In the past 30 days, the Ethereum price surged from around $3,200 to over $4,000, a near 20% increase. Market analyst Captain Faibik made a bullish Ethereum price forecast. In a new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin could reach $10,000 soon. The technical analysis for Ethereum supports this prediction. ETH is trading above its 20-day EMA of $3,637 and its 30-day EMA of $3,495. Its bull-bear power sits at -86 in the buy zone, suggesting that bulls could push this value up. SHIB vs. DTX vs. ETH: Evaluating the first to skyrocket Experts believe SHIB, DTX, and ETH are all altcoins to watch as they could see big price increases soon. However, many think that DTX Exchange stands out. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers, which means potential faster price growth with less money.

A CryptoQuant analyst, Mignolet, specifically provided a detailed analysis of Bitcoin’s market, shedding light on the role of major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance in the ongoing bull cycle. Related Reading: Anthony Scaramucci Foresees China Bitcoin Strategic Reserve In 2025 Shifting Liquidity Dynamics And Exchange Roles In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform titled “Coinbase Dominance Remains Low,” Mignolet examined the trajectory of Coinbase’s influence on Bitcoin’s price movements. The analyst highlighted that while Coinbase played a crucial role in the initial stages of this year’s Bitcoin rally, its dominance has since diminished. This shift indicates a broader distribution of liquidity across the market, with Binance emerging as a significant player in sustaining the bullish momentum. Coinbase dominance remains low “However, just before the rise in September-October, Coinbase dominance actually declined and has not significantly increased even now (red box).” – By @mignoletkr More details 👇https://t.co/nmnPGuz3WK pic.twitter.com/mBSImH8MwD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 11, 2024 Mignolet’s analysis points to a critical observation: Coinbase’s dominance in spot trading has notably declined during the second phase of Bitcoin’s current rally. His analysis revealed that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved earlier this year, spurring a surge in Coinbase’s trading activity. This influx of liquidity was instrumental in driving Bitcoin prices upward and disrupting the traditional halving cycle expectations. However, as the rally progressed, Coinbase’s influence waned. The analyst emphasized that while Coinbase remains a pivotal source of liquidity, Binance has assumed a more prominent role in the current market phase. Mignolet wrote: Let me reiterate: I’m not saying that Coinbase liquidity is unimportant or insignificant. It’s incredibly important. What I am highlighting is that there’s an even more critical source of liquidity at play. = Binance Notably, Binance’s growing dominance suggests that liquidity flows from a wider array of participants, contributing to a somewhat decentralized and strong market structure. This redistribution could indicate broader institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin as traders and investors diversify their platforms.

The current chart for XRP remains largely unchanged and the primary outlook suggests that XRP could be in the later stages of a bullish structure. The question now is whether this is the breakout to new all-time highs or if the price will test the previous all-time high around $3.30. Key Support and Resistance Levels A reaction has been observed at the previous breakout point, which occurred at the 2021 high. The green line on the chart, representing this breakout point, was tested from above yesterday. It’s possible that XRP is still in wave three, with one more potential high before the market moves forward. Even if the price dips below the green line, indicating short-term weakness, there is a Fibonacci support zone between $1.5 and $1.7. However, the smaller-time frame support levels are more critical for the short term. Larger Time Frame Outlook The outlook remains that XRP is in the third wave of the cycle. This remains the case until the market shows significant deviation from this pattern. If this scenario plays out, after the completion of wave four, wave five could potentially take the price into the $5-$10 range. Critical Support Levels For the bullish scenario to hold, the price should ideally maintain the $1.99 level, which represents the 78.6% retracement of yesterday’s rally. In a more bullish case, the price should not dip below this level. Additional support levels are found between $2.20 and $1.99, including levels at $2.14, $2.07, and $1.99. This is the key zone where the price should hold before potentially pushing higher. While there is no guarantee that the pullback will happen, it’s also possible that waves A or one will form another high, leading to a five-wave move upwards. If the pullback occurs, the critical support area is where buyers should ideally step in.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 03:09:44

Floki Inu’s launch of physical and virtual debit cards in 31 European countries has cemented its growing reputation for utility-driven innovation. Meanwhile, Brett is making waves as a key player on the Base Chain ecosystem, capturing attention with its cultural impact. But let’s not forget the elephant in the room— BTFD Coin has smashed through the $3.4 million presale milestone, delivering unmatched excitement with its Beta Game launch and lucrative staking rewards. Ready to explore why these three coins are the best meme coins to join this month? Let’s dive in. Own the Dip with BTFD Coin’s $3.4 Million Presale Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, one of the best meme coins to join this month. Standing for “Buy the F***ing Dip,” BTFD has captivated the crypto community with its aggressive growth and utility-driven features. With over $3.4 million raised in its presale and 50 billion tokens sold, this coin isn’t just riding the wave—it’s creating one. The Beta Game launch is the latest feather in BTFD’s cap. While the Beta version doesn’t yet reward players, it’s paving the way for an innovative play-to-earn ecosystem that promises big gains in the future. Combine that with 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got one of the most compelling meme coin investment opportunities on the market today. Now, let’s crunch some numbers. Imagine investing $3,000 in BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00012. That would get you 25 million tokens. Once the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment would soar to around $15,000—a stunning 400% ROI. With staking and gaming potential layered on top, BTFD is proving it’s not just a coin—it’s a movement. The Bulls, as the BTFD community is affectionately called, are running strong, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing. With the Beta Game live and staking rewards unmatched, now is the perfect time to join the dip. Floki Inu: Turning Utility into a Meme Coin Superpower Floki Inu has come a long way from being just another dog-themed cryptocurrency. This month, it took a giant leap forward by introducing debit cards in 31 European countries, including powerhouses like Germany, France, and Italy. The cards, which support both physical and virtual formats, allow users to spend cryptocurrencies such as FLOKI, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana at millions of merchants worldwide that accept Visa or Mastercard. What makes this launch even more impressive? Zero transaction and exchange rate fees—a true game-changer for users. While virtual cards are accessible globally, the rollout of physical cards is gradually expanding, setting the stage for Floki’s utility to grow even further. For a coin that started as a community-driven meme, Floki has redefined expectations by seamlessly blending fun with functionality. Is Floki shaping up to be the ultimate utility meme coin? With this launch, it’s certainly making its case. Brett: The Meme Star of Base Chain If you thought meme coins were all about quirky names and dog mascots, Brett is here to prove you wrong. Dubbed as “Pepe’s best friend,” Brett has emerged as one of the most talked-about tokens on the Base Chain. As the ecosystem rapidly expands, Brett is riding the wave of new projects and applications being built on this blockchain platform. In the past month, Brett’s value has surged by 59%, with analysts predicting its price could reach $0.50 by 2025 and $1.31 by 2030. This coin’s rise isn’t just about market performance—it’s a cultural icon representing the growing popularity of the Base Chain. As new projects continue to enrich the ecosystem, Brett’s position as a symbol of meme coin innovation is only solidifying further. Will Brett be the face of Base Chain’s meme revolution? It’s already making a strong argument. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Floki’s utility-driven innovation, Brett’s cultural impact, and BTFD Coin’s explosive presale make this trio standout among the best meme coins to join this month. If you’re seeking a blend of functionality and fun, Floki is leading the charge. Brett’s rise on Base Chain signals a bright future for ecosystem-focused meme coins. But for those looking for unparallelled growth potential and community-driven energy, BTFD Coin is the ultimate choice. Don’t miss the chance to own the dip.

The price is trading below $3,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,720 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

But it’s not just about Ethereum or Bitcoin. A revolutionary new blockchain protocol is stealing the spotlight and positioning itself as a game-changer for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape. Enter Lightchain Protocol AI —a blockchain powered by AI that boasts groundbreaking technologies like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). Ethereum whales—the biggest holders of ETH—have been making moves, and their confidence in Lightchain is fueling the excitement. But what’s behind the buzz and why could it shake up DeFi? Let’s explore. Ethereum Whales Are Betting Big Before we get into why Lightchain is grabbing attention, it’s important to understand Ethereum’s role in DeFi. Known as the backbone of decentralized applications, Ethereum has long reigned supreme in the blockchain ecosystem. However, challenges such as gas fees and scalability have left room for innovation—and that’s where Lightchain comes in. Reports from blockchain data analysts suggest that Ethereum whales have quietly started diversifying their holdings into the upcoming Lightchain Protocol AI’s token sale . These savvy investors are known for spotting disruptive blockchain technologies early—and betting on their long-term value. 💡 Here’s why this matters Whale activity often indicates strong belief in a project’s viability, and Lightchain is delivering the kind of innovation that gets these heavyweight investors excited. What Makes Lightchain a DeFi Game-Changer? Lightchain isn’t just another blockchain. It’s a leap forward in how AI meets decentralized technology. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain is tackling the inefficiencies some DeFi platforms have struggled with for years. Here are four reasons why Lightchain could transform the DeFi space: 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A Smarter Consensus Forget Proof of Work (energy-intensive) and Proof of Stake (exclusivity-dependent). Lightchain’s PoI rewards nodes not just for security tasks, but for performing valuable AI computations such as model training and optimization. This creates a more efficient system that incentivizes meaningful contributions while maintaining blockchain integrity. 2. AI Virtual Machine (AIVM): A Seamless Frontier One of Lightchain’s crowning features is the AIVM, a computational layer built to execute AI-specific tasks on the blockchain. Developers creating DeFi applications can now harness the power of AI to optimize user experiences, enhance security, and automate processes—all while benefiting from blockchain decentralization. This is innovation at its finest. 3. Decentralized Governance Built for Intelligence Token holders in the Lightchain ecosystem actively participate in governance decisions. Unlike traditional systems, Lightchain integrates AI to streamline these processes, making decision-making fair, transparent, and community-driven. 4. Privacy Meets Scalability Numbers matter in DeFi, and Lightchain balances the need to scale with the fundamental value of user privacy. By combining AI with blockchain, it ensures both are well-protected as the network grows. Why the Hype Matters The crypto space has seen its fair share of ambitious claims and projects. What sets Lightchain apart—and fuels its hype—is the credibility of its roadmap and the backing of industry leaders. Ethereum whales have recognized Lightchain’s potential to overcome Ethereum’s existing challenges (high gas fees and scalability bottlenecks). Adding to the excitement are key features that align with the future needs of DeFi users, whether they’re individuals or entire enterprises. 🌐 Lightchain’s Revolutionary Potential Experts predict Lightchain could enable the next wave of DeFi innovation, catalyzing projects that integrate AI into lending, staking, and liquidity pools. Imagine smarter algorithms determining optimal interest rates or LP strategies in real-time? Lightchain is making that future possible. December Presale Token Opportunity Timing is everything. Lightchain’s presale is officially live , giving both everyday investors and seasoned cryptocurrencies enthusiasts an opportunity to secure discounted tokens.

It reflects the growing market confidence in the altcoin and its amazing role in the Solana ecosystem. Source : Dune Raydium now controls almost half of all Solana DEX volumes . In a single week, from December 2 to December 9, it processed $23 billion in trades. That’s more than what all its competitors—Orca, Pumpfun, Meteora, and Lifinity—achieved combined. This boost wasn’t random. The sudden spike in meme coin trading brought massive attention and activity to the platform. Breaking Records and Building Momentum Raydium isn’t just leading in volume. Over the past month, it generated $226 million in fees, outpacing giants like Uniswap and even Solana itself. Only Ethereum and Tether have done better. These numbers show the platform’s profitability and its growing importance in the DeFi space. Source : Tradingview But it’s not just about revenue. RAY’s technical indicators reveal strong buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for RAY shot up from 26 to 70 in just two days. While that level suggests a possible price correction, it also confirms the intense market momentum behind the token. What to Expect It looks like Raydium still got some fuel and the bullishness might not be over yet. If it could hold to its trend, RAY might hit $6.46 soon, however the resistance levels at $5.85 and $6.46 could be challenging. On the opposite side, if the momentum falls and price sinks, support levels between $5.26 and $5.19 can be very helpful. Source : Tradingview All eyes are on RAY to see if it can climb back to its ATH of $16.93 and break it. This is a long journey without any doubt, however with growing Solana ecosystem and memecoin hype, there are still hopes for a new All Time High. What’s next for RAY? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain—it’s a token you can’t ignore.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|RAY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 03:30:36

A planned vote by the Senate Banking Committee was postponed after Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown delayed the vote just minutes before it was set to occur on Wednesday morning, after the committee’s GOP members had arrived. Republican senators blocked Brown’s request to waive procedural rules and hold the vote later in the day, according to a Senate aide. The delay pushed Crenshaw’s vote into the afternoon, conflicting with a Senate rule that restricts committees from meeting after the Senate has been in session for two hours or past 2:00 p.m. EST. A waiver could have allowed the vote to proceed, but Republicans, under the direction of Ranking Member Senator Tim Scott, blocked the waiver. As a result, Brown will need to reschedule the vote, though it is unclear when this will happen. The request for comment is pending. As reported by Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, Brown said, “This is why people hate Washington. Corporate special interests have run a disgusting smear campaign against Caroline Crenshaw, an Army reservist and public servant who has been nominated and confirmed by a Republican President and Republican Senate. She has been thoroughly vetted and has gone through every step in the nomination process. Republican Senators are doing the bidding of corporate special interests and standing in the way of her confirmation.” Crenshaw literally advocated for ignoring the Court of Appeals that oversees the SEC. As a party, you can’t constantly state that we are a nation of laws and then ignore the law when you don’t like it or disagree with it. What she did was a disgrace and it dishonored the oath she… — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 11, 2024 In response to Brown’s statement, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton criticized Caroline Crenshaw’s actions, accusing her of advocating for ignoring the Court of Appeals that oversees the SEC. Deaton argued that as a member of the SEC, Crenshaw cannot claim to uphold the rule of law while disregarding it when it doesn’t align with her views.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-12 04:02:00

The price is up over 10% and might aim for a move above the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.25 zone. The price is now trading above $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.215 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.475 resistance. XRP Price Starts Fresh Increase XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.20 level, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move above the $2.25 and $2.30 resistance levels. During the increase, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.215 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair was able to surpass the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.64 swing high to the $1.899 low. However, the bears are active below the $2.475 level. It coincides with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.64 swing high to the $1.899 low. The price is now trading above $2.350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.45 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.4750 level. The next resistance is $2.50. A clear move above the $2.50 resistance might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.880. Another Pullback? If XRP fails to clear the $2.475 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level. The next major support is near the $2.20 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.20 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.080 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone.

""It would be irresponsible for the City of Vancouver to not look at the merits of adding bitcoin to the City’s strategic assets to preserve the City’s financial stability,"" reads the motion. The motion calls for City staff to report back to the Council on the feasibility of a ""bitcoin-friendly city"" strategy by the end of the first quarter of 2025. This motion marks a significant change in City policy towards BTC, as Vancouver's prior Mayor, Kennedy Stewart tried to outright ban bitcoin ATMs within city limits in 2019 (Vancouver was home to the world's first bitcoin ATM).

The motion was approved on Wednesday to explore Bitcoin’s municipality use cases, such as accepting it as a payment method or directly investing in the asset. One of Canada’s largest cities, Vancouver, is considering exploring Bitcoin’s municipal use cases. On Wednesday, the Vancouver City Council passed a motion to make the city a Bitcoin-friendly municipality. Although the motion seeks to explore the regulatory acceptance of BTC, it may mean something other than the municipality accepting BTC as a payment method or directly investing in the asset anytime soon. However, it could pave the way for the municipality to accept tax payments in BTC or convert part of the city’s reserves into Bitcoin.

Sim also donates $10K in Bitcoin to the city. 🚀💰 But concerns over volatility,… pic.twitter.com/6cajLVMbZg — Crypto Spy Fox 🦊🪙 (@CryptoSpyFox) December 12, 2024 Mayor Ken Sim initiated and championed the proposal and later supported by his ABC Vancouver councilors, while two Green councilors opposed it. Ken Sim said during a phone interview that he had longed to initiate the proposal for a while but felt the public needed more time to be ready to have the conversation. Ken Sim mentioned that he decided to be more vocal about his pro-crypto stance after seeing the recent developments in the United States and other nation-states showing signs of embracing Bitcoin’s utilities. Sim announced the motion in late September titled “Preserving the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial Reserves—Becoming a Bitcoin-Friendly City.”. The motion states that integrating BTC into Vancouver’s finances could shield the city from the volatility, debasement, and inflationary pressures of fiat currencies and preserve its purchasing power. It also highlights that embracing Bitcoin is a pro-innovation agenda that supports emerging technologies. Since then, Sim has been vocal about Bitcoin and its underlying technology. He called the asset the “greatest invention” in the history of mankind and stated that fiat currency would depreciate to zero. The official believes Bitcoin is undervalued and currently only worth a fraction of its future worth but emphasized that he was not in a position to give financial advice. Ken Sim promises to donate 10,000 in Bitcoin to Vancouver In an interview with Global News, Ken Sim said he used to be skeptical about BTC and digital currencies until he spent 10,000 hours researching the topic. He said he changed his mind, and digital assets are now part of his family’s investment portfolio. The mayor’s financial disclosure revealed he has investments in Coinbase Global, a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange, and the Canadian Bitcoin exchange-traded fund Purpose BTC ETF. Before the vote, the official promised to donate $10,000 in BTC to the city regardless of the council’s outcome. Although most of the council voted in favor of the motion, some, like Green Coun. Pete Fry expressed their criticism, citing BTC’s potential use as a money laundering tool, which is a major problem that underpins Vancouver’s drug and housing turmoil. The West Coast Canadian city is considered one of the crypto hubs worldwide. The city claims the title of having the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, which was installed back in 2013.

This approval gives RLUSD a high regulatory standard, and the transparency offered by audits will be appealing to users. Experts believe stablecoins will play a key role in cross-border payments and solve many of the problems with traditional payment methods. Stablecoins are fast, available 24/7, borderless, and transparent, which makes them a strong option for the future of payments. XRP Meme Tokens: Could Listings Be Coming Soon? On the other hand, XRP is starting to see increased activity with meme tokens, raising questions about whether these tokens might eventually be listed on platforms. Nancy Beaton, President of Uphold U.S., confirmed that Uphold has already listed several meme tokens. On The Paul Barron Network, she explained that Uphold has a thorough process for listing tokens. They actively seek out tokens in the market, and people can also submit their tokens for review. However, only around 30% of the tokens they review get approved for listing. Beaton also encouraged meme token creators to reach out to Uphold so they can begin the due diligence process and potentially make their tokens available to Uphold customers. XRP’s Higher Token Launch Costs Could Reduce Scams An X user pointed out that creating a meme coin on XRP requires 123 XRP, and as the price of XRP increases, it will become more expensive to launch a token. For example, if XRP hits $10, it would cost $1,230 to create a token. This increase in cost could reduce the number of scams and promote more legitimate projects. In comparison, launching a token on Solana is much cheaper, which has led to many low-quality and scam tokens. The user believes that while there may still be some bad projects on XRP, the higher cost will likely reduce scams and contribute to a more trustworthy market.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 05:11:23

Following Coinbase’s announcement of plans to list $PNUT for trading, the token skyrocketed 19% in just an hour, hitting $1.27 with a market cap of $1.27 billion. Inspired by the internet-famous squirrel Peanut, the coin has gained extra attention after the squirrel’s controversial euthanization by New York authorities. After an X post from Elon Musk, the Peanut meme coin (PNUT) skyrocketed, with its market cap leaping from $3 million to $140 million in just 24 hours. While its price saw steady growth since mid-November, it recently dipped 9.7%, now trading at $1.11. This drop appears to be part of a broader market downturn rather than specific to PNUT. While Bitcoin is circling the $100K mark with recent ups and downs investors are taking a chance with new coins especially the low-cap assets to divert the portfolio to minimize risk. We have seen many such pumps in the memes and altcoins sector in the last few weeks. Yet Another Meme Rises with “Coinbase Effect” The memes saw a massive surge in the crypto space after Donald Trump’s win. Leading the pack is Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) which pumped with effect from Coinbase’s plans to list it, echoing the exchange’s newfound focus on meme tokens like Mog Coin (MOG) and Turbo (TURBO). Recently GIGA hit an all-time high of $0.077, while TURBO jumped 15% after its listing was announced. Known as the “Coinbase Effect,” such announcements often spark price surges, with PNUT gaining 19% recently. Risky Yet Rewarding Despite its highs, PNUT is still 45% below its November peak of $2.44, achieved after a Binance listing. However the Binance officially listed PNUT, it went up by 320% surge in its value. The listing cemented its position as the top meme coin on Solana’s Pump.fun platform, where over four million meme tokens have been created. While meme coins like PNUT can deliver massive gains—one trader turned $16 into $3 million—they remain highly volatile and risky, often swinging wildly in value. On the global scale, Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 mark, dragging major altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana into the green. The crypto market’s rebound follows data showing U.S. inflation rising at expected levels, fueling optimism among investors. In this market rally, PNUT a low cap memecoin is beating the bigger coins making a perfect scene for a meme rally in Q1 of 2025. PNUT is currently trading at $1.34 with a market cap of $1.34 billion.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

The SEC's solicitation of public comments on Bitwise's proposed Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF signals a growing interest in diversified crypto investment products, while BlackRock and Fidelity's recent $500 million ETH purchase show the increasing role of institutional capital in shaping the market. Ethereum Surges as BlackRock and Fidelity Acquire $500M in Ether Through Spot ETFs Financial titans BlackRock and Fidelity have collectively purchased $500 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) over the past two days. The acquisitions, executed primarily through Coinbase and its institutional service platform Prime, were reported by the crypto data tracking platform Arkham. The massive purchases coincide with record-breaking inflows into BlackRock's Ethereum spot ETF (ETHA) and Fidelity's equivalent, FETH. On Dec. 10 alone, ETHA and FETH reported trading volumes of $372.4 million and $103.7 million, respectively. These ETFs have cemented their positions as market leaders, contributing significantly to the all-time high inflows witnessed on Nov. 30. The momentum is partly fueled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of eight Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. The regulatory green light, granted on May 23, marked a pivotal moment in legitimizing cryptocurrency investments for institutional players. Ethereum’s Price Action Reflects Growing Demand Ethereum's price surged over 6% to $3,931.16 in the last 24 hours, with trading volumes surpassing $39.3 billion during the same period. The cryptocurrency’s robust performance signals strong market confidence, driven by the massive institutional inflows. BlackRock and Fidelity's combined $500 million purchase represents a strategic investment in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The acquisitions are a strong indicator of the increasing adoption of digital assets by traditional financial institutions. The ripple effect of these transactions extends beyond Ethereum. The influx of institutional capital often bolsters market sentiment, attracting retail investors and further driving demand. Ethereum’s ecosystem, known for its robust DeFi and NFT frameworks, stands to benefit significantly from this increased liquidity. The broader cryptocurrency market also saw gains, with major indices reflecting a positive trend. For instance, the GMGM Top Gaming Tokens index rose by 17.78%, while the GMSMALL Small Caps index jumped 12.13%, signaling renewed optimism across the digital asset space. Ethereum ETFs like ETHA and FETH have revolutionized how institutions and retail investors access Ethereum. These funds offer a regulated, simplified avenue to invest in the cryptocurrency without the need for direct custody, addressing key concerns around security and compliance. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Fidelity, a global financial services powerhouse, have been at the forefront of this transformation. Their aggressive positioning in the Ethereum ETF market suggests they have a long-term confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential as a store of value and a key driver of decentralized applications. Overall, the $500 million Ethereum acquisition by BlackRock and Fidelity marks a significant milestone in the evolution of institutional crypto investment. As Ethereum’s price and trading volumes continue to climb, the cryptocurrency solidifies its status as a cornerstone of the digital economy. With record-breaking inflows into spot ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity, Ethereum’s future appears brighter than ever. The backing of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity not only validates the asset’s potential but also paves the way for further adoption in traditional financial markets. As 2024 draws to a close, Ethereum’s ascent showcases the maturing relationship between cryptocurrencies and institutional finance. SEC Seeks Public Input on Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Listing In other ETF news, United States regulators are advancing the application process for the listing of a proposed Bitwise ETF holding both BTC and ETH. According to a Dec. 10 filing , the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is soliciting public comments on NYSE Arca’s request to list the innovative ETF, signaling progress in the regulatory review process. Bitwise, a prominent crypto asset manager, first submitted the ETF proposal alongside NYSE Arca on Nov. 26. The fund aims to offer investors “balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in the world in an easy-to-access format,” Bitwise noted in a post on X. The ETF would operate as a spot cryptocurrency index fund, providing direct exposure to BTC and ETH rather than relying on derivatives or futures contracts. This design aligns with a growing demand for transparent and straightforward investment vehicles in the digital asset market. The Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF enters a market increasingly crowded with similar products. Industry analysts highlight that crypto index ETFs are becoming the next frontier for issuers, building on the momentum of funds holding single assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which launched earlier this year. “The next logical step is index ETFs because indexes are efficient for investors — just like how people buy the S&P 500 in an ETF. This will be the same in crypto,” said Katalin Tischhauser, head of investment research at crypto bank Sygnum, in an August interview. In addition to the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, NYSE Arca has filed to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which would include a broader selection of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Grayscale, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton have also submitted proposals for similar index funds, intensifying the race to dominate the burgeoning market. Regulatory Developments: A Changing Landscape The SEC’s request for industry comments signals a shift toward increased engagement with stakeholders regarding cryptocurrency ETFs. Under current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the agency has taken a stringent approach to crypto regulation, launching more than 100 enforcement actions since 2021. However, this regulatory climate is poised for significant change with the incoming US administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who assumes office on Jan. 20, 2025, has promised to make the United States the “world’s crypto capital.” Trump is reportedly assembling a crypto-friendly leadership team to oversee key financial regulatory agencies. Gensler, whose term has been marked by friction with the crypto industry, confirmed his departure once Trump takes office. This transition could herald a more accommodating regulatory environment for cryptocurrency products, spurring optimism among issuers. The timing of Trump’s pro-crypto platform has coincided with a flurry of ETF applications, ranging from spot crypto funds to staking-based ETFs, reflecting growing confidence in a supportive regulatory future. If approved, the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF would mark another milestone in the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream financial markets. ETFs offer a regulated, user-friendly gateway for retail and institutional investors, addressing common concerns about custody and compliance. Moreover, the approval of index ETFs could revolutionize how investors approach cryptocurrency portfolios. By diversifying holdings across multiple assets, these funds lower risk and simplify exposure to the broader digital asset market, mirroring traditional index strategies like those seen with the S&P 500. Despite optimism, challenges remain. The SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs due to concerns about market manipulation and insufficient regulatory oversight of underlying assets. The solicitation of public comments represents a step forward, but ultimate approval will depend on whether issuers can address these longstanding issues. Competing ETF proposals also highlight the competitive nature of the market. With major players like Grayscale, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton vying for approval, Bitwise will need to demonstrate clear advantages in terms of fund structure, transparency, and investor benefits.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-12 05:23:38

He said his firm only allowed its clientele to put up to 10% of their total assets into crypto. Peterffy believes that everyone without Bitcoin should find ways of owning some, but not too much, due to the associated risk of price fluctuations. He was, however, concerned that cryptocurrencies were just as worthy as paper currencies since they carried no intrinsic value. Having grown up in a socialist society, Peterffy was convinced that a free market economy was the only way to run a society efficiently. Peterffy believes everyone should invest a little in Bitcoin but remain cautious Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire founder of retail brokerage Interactive Brokers Group, said investors should own some Bitcoin though limit their holdings given the asset’s volatility. https://t.co/CJdDesLYbg — Bloomberg (@business) December 11, 2024 Peterffy, the chair of the retail brokerage firm Interactive Brokers, said investing a small portion in Bitcoin was advisable. He, however, cautioned against having too much exposure to cryptocurrencies in general because it was ‘dangerous’. Peterffy, who was initially critical of Bitcoin, argued that Bitcoin should be separated from the ‘real economy’ as the CME prepared to launch Bitcoin futures. The Interactive Brokers chair went on to predict that Bitcoin could bring down the whole economy. Peterffy was surprised that the rapid implosion of the FTX crypto empire in November did not cause a steeper Bitcoin correction. He also forecasted a market downturn, although he predicted it would not be ‘very violent’ or ‘go very far’. Speaking with Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak from the Goldman Sachs Inc. conference, Peterffy revealed that he had invested ‘just a little’ in crypto since July 2021. He added that there was a small chance of crypto emerging as a dominant currency back then. “Even I myself have put a little bit of money into crypto, because even though chances are, I think, that this is not going to be a viable market, I think that there’s a small chance that this will be a dominant currency, so you have to play the odds.” – Thomas Peterffy Peterffy remained unsure about Bitcoin’s worth, saying that its price could either spiral down to zero or skyrocket to a million dollars. ‘I have no idea,’ he said. He, however, advised investors to use crypto as a hedge against plummeting fiat currencies. Peterffy claimed that his platform was the most efficient for crypto trading, other than Robinhood.

These 3 Projects Continue To Rally,https://timestabloid.com/is-the-2024-bull-run-over-these-3-projects-continue-to-rally/,"The recent pause in the crypto market has many investors wondering if the 2024 bull run is over. However, experts are pointing out that crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) and meme coins Floki (FLOKI) and Pepe (PEPE) continue to rally. Rollblock’s project is catching the most attention as it races toward the conclusion of its crypto presale. This top altcoin recently had its 2025 growth estimates increased to over 100x after its successful listing on CoinMarketCap. Floki’s GameFi Expansion Promises Further Explosive Growth The Floki price is actually trailing in the meme coin sector this bull run, with only 90% growth last month. However, this week saw the Floki price rocket ahead with almost 30% in GameFi-driven growth. Floki just began offering its flagship play-to-earn game, Myr, in the enormous Indian market. The rapid success of this play-to-earn expansion has led to explosive demand for Floki tokens. Experts believe that this is just the beginning for Floki’s rally, as it combines GameFi and meme coins into viral success. Whale Activity Sends Pepe Soaring Toward Top 10 Tokens Pepe is another meme coin that continued to charge ahead this week despite the downturn in the overall market. The Pepe price added another 35% this week, bringing its monthly return to over 150%. This sudden surge in the Pepe price has been caused by a significant increase in whale activity. Pepe saw over $300 million worth of its tokens taken off crypto exchanges this month, which usually indicates enormous whale purchases. Pepe has already seen over 1,500% growth so far in 2024, and experts think it could break into the top 10 tokens by 2025. CoinMarketCap Listing Puts Millions of Investors’ Eyes on Rollblock’s Astronomical Potential Rollblock made an even bigger splash than Floki and Pepe this week when it cracked an over 300% total return over the course of its crypto presale so far. This top altcoin’s fresh listing on the famous CoinMarketCap platform sent it racing through the final tokens in the eighth stage of its crypto presale and saw a significant increase to its post-ICO growth estimates. A listing on the CoinMarketCap platform means millions of potential crypto investors will now be able to find Rollblock in their research. This listing was one of the last targets in Rollblock’s ambitious white paper, and now it is almost ready for its big ICO. Rollblock also recently added a sports betting platform to its offering of over 7,000 of the industry’s top provably fair games. This expansion gave Rollblock full coverage of the $500 billion gambling industry and set the stage for its current astronomical growth estimates. Experts are most excited about Rollblock’s plans to share its profits through weekly buybacks funded by the casino’s own revenue. These buybacks will either be burned to maintain market pressure on RBLK or used as staking rewards to further incentivize holders. Rollblock’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap sent most growth estimates for its post-ICO price to 100x or higher from its current $0.041. This ICO could occur as soon as January of 2025, with only three stages remaining in Rollblock’s crypto presale. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

In a bull market, common strategies include holding long-term potential cryptos or taking advantage of high volatility for short-term trading profits. This often leads to a surge in DeFi activities, increased liquidity staking, and a more active lending market. Crypto users aim to maximize their funds and profits. Against this backdrop, HTX’s newly launched Flexible Crypto Loans has gained popularity and is poised to spark a lending trend in the bull market. Crypto Loans: A Powerful Tool to Unlock Asset Liquidity HTX’s Crypto Loans is a flexible financial loan product that lets users pledge digital assets to borrow other cryptos such as USDT, BTC, and ETH, for various funding needs. For example, a user anticipating a token’s price can pledge BTC to borrow USDT for investment without selling their holdings. If the token’s price rises as expected, they can sell, and repay the loan and their BTC. HTX launched its highly-anticipated Flexible Crypto Loans, adding to its suite of fixed-term products. This new offering allows fee-free, flexible borrowing and repayment, making it an ideal tool for efficient fund utilization. Impressive Data: Growth in Both Scale and User Base With ultra-low interest rates, flexible terms, and a great user experience, HTX’s Flexible Crypto Loans has seen significant growth in both user base and lending volume. In less than 10 days, the lending volume exceeded 30 million USDT. Compared to before the launch, HTX’s overall lending volume has quintupled, and the number of borrowers has tripled. This achievement demonstrates users’ trust in HTX’s products and indicates growing market acceptance of the Crypto Loans model. Prize Pool Doubles and Ultra-Low Interest Rates Continue for an Upgraded User Experience HTX has launched the second phase of the “Borrow & Earn” event. From December 12 02:00 (UTC) to December 18 15:59 (UTC), users who borrow USDT via Flexible Crypto Loans can share a 5.4 billion $HTX prize pool. The first phase offered a 2.7billion $HTX prize pool, and this phase doubles that. HTX’s Flexible Crypto Loans remains committed to low interest rates, helping users to maximize returns with affordable borrowing. This highlights the popularity of Crypto Loans and HTX’s commitment to offering Flexible Crypto Loans. HTX plans to introduce more promotions and innovative features to enhance user experience. If the lending volume for Flexible Crypto Loans reaches 50 million USDT by the end of the second phase, the next phase’s prize pool will double to 10.8 billion $HTX.

Satoshi Nakamoto Predicted 15 Years Ago,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-quantum-computers-crack-bitcoins-password-satoshi-nakamoto-predicted-15-years-ago/,"Concerns about the security of Bitcoin’s private keys have resurfaced following developments in quantum computing, particularly discussions about the capabilities of the quantum chip “Willow.” However, cybersecurity expert Yu Xian, founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist, assured the crypto community that there is no immediate cause for alarm. Quoting crypto researcher Jeffrey Scholz, Yu Xian said, “Current tens of gates in quantum computing are at least millions of gates away from being able to crack Bitcoin private keys. Quantum gates are incredibly difficult to scale, as higher gate counts result in higher noise and error rates, rendering the machine useless in real-world scenarios.” “Don't worry about Satoshi Nakamoto's private key, at least not for the next few decades,” he added. The renewed focus on quantum computing has drawn attention to comments made by Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010 regarding the robustness of Bitcoin’s cryptographic hash algorithm, SHA-256. Satoshi had said: “SHA-256 is very strong. It’s not like a gradual step from MD5 to SHA1. It can last for decades unless there’s a major breakthrough attack.” Related News: After Today's CPI Report, Former FED Member Mester Shares Prediction on Rate Cuts Satoshi also outlined contingency plans for a possible cryptographic breakthrough, emphasizing the adaptability of the Bitcoin protocol. He suggested an orderly switch to a new hashing algorithm in case SHA-256 is compromised. Despite advances in quantum computing, researchers agree that the technology is far from a credible threat to Bitcoin. Current quantum computers are limited in scale and face significant hurdles, such as error correction and noise reduction, before they can tackle complex cryptographic problems like cracking Bitcoin’s private keys. *This is not investment advice.

This change would apply to prominent digital assets such as XRP, ADA, ALGO, and HBAR, as their issuing companies are headquartered in the U.S. By contrast, non-American crypto assets could face up to a 37% tax on gains, putting them at a distinct disadvantage in the U.S. market. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? Shawn’s analysis highlights the potential for this policy to drive significant investment into American crypto projects. He noted that this would make all profits Americans make on holding cryptocurrencies tax-free. He further suggested that the proposed framework would incentivize non-U.S. crypto projects to relocate their operations to the U.S. to benefit from the tax exemption. This initiative appears to align with a broader strategy by the Trump team to establish the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. As Trump stated earlier in the year, the U.S. will become the “ crypto capital of the world ” If enacted, this policy could cause a migration of blockchain and fintech companies to the U.S., fostering economic growth and innovation while creating a competitive edge for American digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Widespread Support From the Community The proposed policy has garnered support within the crypto community. Shawn started a poll on the matter, receiving over 14,000 votes, with 88% of participants expressing support. Many see this as a long-overdue correction to what they perceive as unfavorable cryptocurrency policies under the Biden administration. This policy could provide a dramatic boost for assets like XRP. The digital asset has faced regulatory challenges recently, including its high-profile legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A tax-free environment could enhance its appeal to U.S. investors and help drive adoption. Moreover, this policy could spur innovation in blockchain technology by increasing competition among U.S.-based projects. It could also stimulate broader adoption of cryptocurrencies, as investors are drawn to the financial incentives associated with holding tax-free digital assets.

Analyst Cites Cup And Handle Formation",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-on-track-for-275000-analyst-cites-cup-and-handle-formation/,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $94,500 yesterday after Microsoft shareholders decisively rejected a Bitcoin treasury proposal to allocate 1% of the company’s total assets to buy BTC as an inflation hedge. However, analysts are still confident of further appreciation of the BTC price. Bitcoin May Surge As High As $275,000 According to data from Coinglass, over $478 million worth of contracts – primarily long positions – were liquidated in the past 24 hours following the plunge in BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, liquidation volumes were higher in altcoins compared to Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resets Open Interest, Targets $100,000 After Holding Key Support – Details However, some analysts view this price dip as a buying opportunity. Seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez took to X to highlight a long cup and handle pattern forming on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. For those unfamiliar, the cup and handle pattern is a bullish technical formation that resembles a rounded “cup” followed by a brief consolidation period or “handle.” It typically signals the potential for a continuation of an uptrend, often leading to significant price gains. Martinez noted that the pattern suggests Bitcoin could surge as high as $275,000, based on its technical structure. However, he also urged traders to exercise caution and avoid overleveraging their positions. On the other hand, prominent crypto analyst @Trader_XO warned that Bitcoin must maintain its support at $90,000 to avoid further downside. Should BTC lose this critical level, it could drop as low as $85,000. Conversely, holding above $90,000 would allow the cryptocurrency to rebound and resume its uptrend. BTC Takes Another Jab At Breaking Through $100,000 Despite yesterday’s dip, Bitcoin recovered swiftly, trading near $100,000 at the time of writing. The flagship cryptocurrency has remained in an overall uptrend, likely bolstered by today’s US inflation data for November, which largely aligned with market expectations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Peak In 200 Days, Before US Recession In Mid-2025, Report Says Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $103,679, according to data from CoinGecko. However, its price has fluctuated above and below the pivotal $100,000 mark, leading to over $1.5 billion in liquidations in the past week. Several factors could drive Bitcoin’s price to a new ATH. For instance, BTC reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have hit multi-year lows, reflecting rising demand for the digital asset. American financier and former investment banker Anthony Scaramucci recently predicted China might establish its own Bitcoin reserve if the US proceeds with its strategic Bitcoin reserve plans. National BTC reserves are expected to reinforce Bitcoin’s supply scarcity narrative, potentially driving prices higher. At the same time, BTC adoption among corporations continues to rise, as Canadian video-sharing firm Rumble became the latest company to unveil a BTC treasury strategy. BTC trades at $100,453 at press time, up 4.1% in the past 24 hours.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the Trump team has recently interviewed Quintenz for the top job at US CFTC. Brian Quintenz Is the Top Choice for US CFTC Chair As per a Bloomberg report , former Republican CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz was interviewed for the top position in the regulatory body. He is currently leading the crypto policy division at the digital asset wing of VC giant Andreessen Horowitz, a16z Crypto. President-elect Donald Trump’s team has been actively conducting interviews for the US CFTC chair position, with an announcement likely in the coming days. Republican CFTC Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Caroline Pham have also been in the race for the same. Last month, reports suggested that Crypto Dad Chris Giancarlo could be the top boss at CFTC, however, he dispelled the rumors. If chosen to lead CFTC, Brian Quintenz could bring a new perspective that bridges traditional finance (TradFi) and digital assets. During his previous tenure as CFTC Commissioner under the Donald Trump administration, Quintenz advocated for the agency to embrace innovative financial services, that included crypto derivatives and event contracts. In a crypto blog last month, co-authored with a16z, Quintenz shared his perspective on the election’s implications for the future of crypto. He wrote: “While we’ll likely have greater flexibility to experiment, we can’t forget that the fundamental regulatory principles applicable to blockchain systems remain unchanged. There will still be valid scrutiny from regulators and policymakers of certain aspects of the industry irrespective of progress on new legislation or a re-calibrated regulatory environment”. Since joining venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Quintenz has continued championing progressive regulatory approaches for these industries. Quintenz’s extensive experience positions him to navigate the agency through significant policy changes under the Biden administration. Furthermore, recent reports suggest that the Donald Trump administration is considering giving US CFTC the oversight of the $3 trillion crypto market. The proposal focuses on digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, classified as commodities under current law. If implemented, it would grant the CFTC authority to oversee spot markets and exchanges. US Crypto Policy to Undergo Key Changes Crypto market analysts hope for a major US crypto policy shift under the Trump administration, with Brian Quintenz as CFTC Chair expected to play a key role. The appointment of pro-crypto Paul Atkins as the next US SEC chair already hints at this possibility and a conducive environment for crypto innovation. The crypto industry has been demanding clarity on crypto policy from the US Congress and regulators on which products and services fall under the jurisdiction of the US CFTC or the US SEC. During his election campaign, Donald Trump pledged to make America the Crypto Capital of the world.

After juggling below the levels for a couple of days, the token raised, squashing the bearish possibility This shook up the entire market, while positive rounds around the popular tokens like ETH, LINK, & AAVE attracted double-digit gains. As per the reports, the company owned by the new president-elect Donald Trump, World Liberty Financial, swapped over $5 million USDC for Ethereum, Chainlink, & Aave. With this, the ETH holdings reached $55 million, and LINK & AAVE reached above $1 million each. Soon after this, the prices of LINK & AAVE triggered a massive upswing, attracting over 15% gains; meanwhile, the ETH price continues with its consolidated gains. The LINK price has attained levels not seen since January 2022, suggesting a strong influx of bullish volume onto the token. Donald Trump’s win had triggered the markets and the round of LINK accumulation is expected to elevate the LINK price rally towards new highs. The LINK price rally has surpassed the crucial resistance zone between $27.32 and $28.26 with huge backing from the bulls. While the weekly RSI surged above the upper threshold, the MACD shows the rise in the buying volume. Moreover, the token underwent a bullish ‘Golden Cross’ that may offer more momentum. The next level to watch is around $34.39, which may clear the path to $40 if the zone between $37 & $37.5 is cleared. The current trade set-up suggests the Chainlink price has just entered a bullish range and a bullish yearly close above $40 could trigger a massive bullish wave towards a 3-digit figure. On the other hand, AAVE, in which Trump’s company holds over $1 million, also demonstrated a similar rise, suggesting a huge confidence of traders over the token. The AAVE price is about to reach the neckline of the parabolic recovery curve that could further push the price towards the final resistance zone between $516 and $566. With this, the weekly RSI has surpassed the upward threshold for the first time since inception. Moreover, the token may experience the very first weekly Golden Cross that could push the price beyond the current ATH at $668. Once these levels are reached, then the AAVE price is expected to surge and reach the milestone at $1000 during the upcoming Altseason.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ETH|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 06:04:33

Two of his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., are ""web3 ambassadors,"" while Barron holds the title of ""DeFi visionary."" Data shows the project purchased $10 million in ether (ETH), and $1 million each in aave (AAVE) and Chainlink’s LINK tokens early Thursday. ETH prices surged 7% in Asian morning hours after the purchases, while AAVE and LINK prices surged 30% on the bullish sentiment.

The project made huge moves in the crypto world by buying millions of dollars worth of Ethereum, Chainlink and AAVE. These purchases not only got the ecosystem interested but also helped the prices to soar. Let’s dive into the details to see what they are doing. Ethereum’s Big Day WLFI spent a whopping $10 million in USD Coin (USDC) to buy 2,631 Ether (ETH). At the time, Ether was priced at an average of $3,801 per token. This massive purchase caused the price to have a sudden spike of 2.36%. By the end of the day, ETH had already jumped by 6.86%. This gives a clear idea of how just one big transaction can send ripples throughout the market. Source : Arkham Intelligence But that wasn’t all. WLFI’s move boosted investor confidence, proving how much influence this DeFi project has on the crypto scene. Chainlink and AAVE Get Their Moment It wasn’t just Ethereum feeling the love. WLFI dropped another $1 million USDC to snag 41,335 Chainlink (LINK) tokens at $24.2 each. This caused LINK’s price to shoot up by 20.56%, reaching $26.72 in just 24 hours. That’s a serious surge, even for a volatile market. AAVE didn’t miss out either. WLFI spent $1 million on 3,357 AAVE tokens at $297 each. While the market impact wasn’t as dramatic as with LINK, it still cemented WLFI’s role as a heavy hitter in the DeFi space. Justin Sun’s Big Bet Adding to the excitement, Justin Sun, founder of Tron, announced a $30 million investment in WLFI . This makes him the project’s largest investor. He’s also taken on an advisory role, bringing his years of blockchain experience to the table. Exciting Announcement!

Speaking about Uphold’s innovative approach, Beaton highlighted the use of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, as a prime example of the exchange’s commitment to flexibility and user convenience. In a video shared on X by blockchain researcher and crypto enthusiast Collin Brown (@CollinBrownXRP), Beaton described Uphold’s “anything to anything” trading model, which allows users to directly exchange a wide range of assets without being restricted by conventional pairings. She pointed out that RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, can be easily swapped for Bitcoin, gold, or other financial instruments. This model aims to streamline the trading experience, offering users greater autonomy over their transactions. Seamless Trading Across the Market Uphold’s unique pairing system is part of a broader strategy to enhance transaction efficiency and bridge traditional financial tools with digital assets. By simplifying the trading process, Uphold has positioned itself as a leader in improving the accessibility of cryptocurrency markets for both experienced traders and newcomers. The launch of RLUSD aligns with Uphold’s goal of expanding asset choices while catering to users seeking stability amid volatility in the cryptocurrency market. The stablecoin has been a focal point for many crypto traders as it recently received final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

XRP is the primary bridge asset for transactions on the XRPL, facilitating rapid and cost-effective exchanges between different assets. The synergy between RLUSD and XRP adoption is expected to have far-reaching implications. With RLUSD’s integration, XRP’s usage for fees, liquidity, and network operations is expected to grow, further solidifying its position in the broader blockchain space. In his post, Brown stated, “With XRP as the auto-bridge asset, the future is looking GOLDEN!” With RLUSD’s launch approaching, its potential impact on the cryptocurrency landscape is becoming increasingly apparent. Uphold executives have previously shown support for RLUSD and its role in global finance, and this forward-thinking approach positions the exchange as a key driver of innovation within the industry, paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.

Interestingly, FTT, the cryptocurrency of bankrupt company FTX, has gained more than 50% in value in the last month. Related News: Two Metrics in Bitcoin Hit Critical Levels - What Happens Next?

Not only that, but trading volume has also jumped 35%, hitting $225 billion, signaling strong momentum for December. Altcoins aren’t left behind either, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin all experiencing impressive gains of 5% to 9%. CPI Report Boast BTC To $100K Bitcoin, the leader of the market, has bounced back above $100,100, reflecting a rise of 3%. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s rise is the release of the U.S. November Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed a 2.7% increase, just as expected. This data suggests that inflation is under control, which has led to growing speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon cut interest rates. A rate cut would make riskier investments, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive, further driving demand for Bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs record $439.5m inflows In addition to positive economic data, institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing. On December 11, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States marked their 10th consecutive day of inflows, with total net inflows surpassing $34 billion.

Although the XRP price is seemingly consolidating since this notable run , analysts continue to anticipate another remarkable run-up that would eventually see it breaking into new all-time highs. According to an analysis on the TradingView platform, the XRP price is well on track to reach double digits in the coming years. Particularly, the analyst emphasized the role of the Supercycle Elliott Wave counts in predicting XRP’s price trajectory and suggested that the cryptocurrency might never drop below the $1 mark until the onset of the next bear market. XRP Price Chart Exhibits Supercycle Elliot Waves According to the analysis , XRP’s recent surge has seen the cryptocurrency breaking out of a consolidation pattern that has been in play for over 5.5 years. This consolidation, which started sometime around January 2018, has been highlighted by a series of lower highs and higher lows, resulting in the XRP price trading in an increasingly tightening range. Interestingly, this consolidation pattern followed a series of Elliot waves in the Elliott Wave Theory. The consolidation pattern played out a lesser a, b, c, d, and e movement, essentially completing the five-impluse wave pattern. However, these five impulse waves are subwaves of a larger corrective impulse wave on the XRP Supercycle. Notably, the minor five-impulse wave movement corresponds to the fourth wave in the supercycle, which is a phase considered corrective in Elliott Wave Theory. Since 2014, XRP’s price chart has exhibited a clear supercycle wave structure, with this fourth wave representing a period of market correction and consolidation. Therefore, its conclusion has now paved the way for the start of the fifth wave in the supercycle. Ambitious Double-Digit Targets For XRP Price As it stands, the XRP price is in the process of playing out the bullish fifth impulse wave in the large supercycle. According to Eliot Wave theory, Wave 5 is going to be the last major bullish wave before another bear market sets in. Looking ahead, the analyst dubbed 2025 a “legendary year,” predicting swift transitions between these market phases. Wave 3 was highlighted by a 113200% move from $0.003 until it reached its current all-time high of $3.40. If the current Wave 5 follows a similar trajectory, XRP’s price could ascend well into double-digit territory . Using the Fibonacci extension indicator, technical analysis suggests an XRP price target exceeding $60 in the coming years. This price target, although very ambitious, plays into the current bullish sentiment surrounding the XRP price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.33",Altcoins|Rebuff|XRP|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-12 07:11:56

Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with degen culture, iDEGEN has captivated traders and investors alike. With a dynamic pricing model that fosters volatility and an innovative approach to community engagement, this token has become a standout contender in the crypto landscape. A dynamic pricing model designed for traders iDEGEN’s presale employs a unique dynamic pricing mechanism that creates a fast-paced and exciting trading environment. Prices are adjusted every five minutes based on market activity, offering three potential scenarios. If at least one purchase occurs within a five-minute interval, the price remains steady for the next cycle. Consecutive purchases across two intervals trigger a 5% price increase, rewarding consistent demand. Conversely, inactivity during an interval results in a 5% price drop, providing opportunities for bargain hunters. This dynamic approach appeals to traders seeking volatility and quick gains, driving significant interest in the presale. Since its launch on November 26, 2024, iDEGEN has raised over $4.2 million and sold more than 943 million tokens, demonstrating strong market enthusiasm. The presale will conclude on January 1, 2025, and the token’s listing price will be 10% higher than the final presale value, adding further incentive for early adopters. AI-powered community engagement Besides the dynamic presale pricing model, the other thing that sets iDEGEN apart is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to foster community engagement and adapt its development. Dubbed the “fatherless AI” born from a mix of a degen’s sock and an Nvidia chip, iDEGEN embraces a humorous yet innovative identity. Its AI actively learns and evolves by absorbing data from tweets directed at it. This interaction-driven model enables iDEGEN to respond to every tweet and post hourly updates without moderation or training guardrails. This highly interactive approach has cemented iDEGEN’s place as a community-centric project. By leveraging X (formerly Twitter), iDEGEN ensures its development aligns with user feedback and the ever-changing dynamics of the crypto space. The slogan “AI Born. Degen Raised.” encapsulates its ethos, combining technological innovation with the chaotic spirit of crypto degen culture. As the presale nears its end, all eyes are on its listing in January 2025, where its value is expected to climb even higher. For investors seeking a mix of cutting-edge technology and high-risk, high-reward opportunities, iDEGEN offers a compelling proposition.

ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB fund and Grayscale’s GBTC also contributed significantly, with inflows of $52.67 million and $20.13 million, respectively. Additionally, Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, Biwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL funds received more modest inflows of $15.74 million, $12.16 million, and $2.87 million, respectively. However, Valkyrie’s BRRR fund was the only outlier, reporting outflows of $2.44 million on the day.

These inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s recent rally, which saw the crypto asset surpass $100,000, reaching a high of approximately $102,000.

While some might dismiss these quirky coins as mere jokes, the right picks can deliver jaw-dropping returns, especially in the short term. Today, we’re diving into three of the best meme coins to buy and hold for the short term: BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Neiro. Leading the pack, BTFD Coin has smashed through the $3.4 million meme coin presale mark, selling over 50 billion coins and attracting more than 4,400 Bulls to its growing community. Mog Coin’s massive $1.5 billion market cap has firmly planted it in the meme coin hall of fame, while Neiro continues to soar, cementing its status as the spiritual heir to Doge. Whether you’re looking for short-term gains or want to ride the meme wave, these coins deserve your attention. BTFD Coin: $3.4M Raised, Beta Game Launch, and a Bright Future If FOMO had a mascot, it would be BTFD Coin. Short for Buy the Dip, this cheeky yet ambitious coin is taking the crypto world by storm. With its presale tally crossing $3.4 million and over 50 billion coins already sold, the project is gathering serious momentum. Here’s the big news: BTFD Coin’s Beta game is now live! It’s your first chance to dive into the Bulls’ universe—a vibrant, gamified ecosystem featuring the beloved Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull). While the Beta version doesn’t offer rewards just yet, it’s the perfect way to explore what’s coming in the full Play-to-Earn release. But let’s break down the numbers for today, shall we? At its current presale price of $0.00012, a $1000 investment in BTFD Coin would get you 8,333,333 tokens. If the coin hits its projected post-launch price of $0.0006, your investment could skyrocket to $5,000—a 5x return. That’s the kind of dip-buying action we can get behind! Unlike many meme coins, BTFD Coin offers more than just hype. Its roadmap includes staking with an average APY of 90% , a full-scale game release, and a robust community-driven approach. With its playful branding and solid utility, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as a meme coin with staying power. Mog Coin: A $1.5B Market Cap and Meme King Status It feels like Mog Coin is the undisputed heavyweight champion of the meme coin world right now. Boasting a jaw-dropping $1.5 billion market cap, Mog Coin has transcended meme status to become a major player in the crypto space. The meme coin even overtook Popcat’s market cap, which means it’s set to grow even further. In other words, it’s your chance to get your hands on a bunch of Mog tokens before they skyrocket. Mog Coin has captured the imagination of internet culture. Its rapid ascent is fueled by a mix of meme-based marketing, celebrity endorsements, and a dedicated fanbase. But it’s not all hype—Mog Coin has a robust liquidity pool, ensuring stability in a notoriously volatile market. Analysts suggest that Mog Coin’s recent partnerships with prominent NFT artists and upcoming plans to integrate utility within Web3 platforms could provide even more short-term investment opportunities. While its explosive growth might slow down, there’s still plenty of room for gains, especially for those who jump in early. Neiro: A Moonlit Launch and Community-Driven Revival Last but not least, we have Neiro, the Doge-like underdog with a backstory straight out of a feel-good movie. Launched on Ethereum during the August 2024 New Moon, Neiro has quickly risen to fame thanks to its community-driven ethos and a sprinkle of Vitalik Buterin magic. Shortly after Neiro’s launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated over $500,000 to an animal welfare fund in honour of the project. This marked only the second time Vitalik had publicly interacted with a meme coin, adding an undeniable layer of credibility to Neiro’s mission. Today, Neiro stands as a testament to resilience, with plans for charitable donations, Ethereum-first innovation, and long-term growth. Its live price is $0.05682, showing potential for growth by early 2025 (analysts forecast an impressive 222.27% rise by January). Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out In a world where memes fuel million-dollar market caps, the opportunities for short-term gains are endless. BTFD Coin, with its $3.4 million presale tally and Beta game launch, offers an exciting entry point for investors ready to buy the dip. Mog Coin continues to dominate with its $1.5 billion market cap, while Neiro proves that even the underdog can shine. Ready to dive in? Don’t let these opportunities pass you by—join the BTFD Coin presale today and explore the Bulls world while it’s still early. Short-term gains are just a dip away!

The Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange, Bit Trade, has been fined AUD 8 million (around $5.2 million) for unlawfully issuing a credit facility to more than 1,100 customers, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a Thursday press release , Dec. 12. The Federal Court ruled that the company failed to follow Australian laws requiring financial products to have a target market determination to ensure they are sold to the right customers. From October 2021, Bit Trade offered a margin extension product that “provided for margin extensions to be made and repaid in either digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or national currencies such as U.S. dollars,” the regulator says. However, the product was marketed without a required target market determination, a key regulatory document meant to ensure financial products are offered only to suitable customers.

Customers were charged fees and interest exceeding $7 million, with trading losses surpassing $5 million, the regulator claims. One investor reportedly lost nearly $4 million using the margin extension product. Justice Nicholas, in his ruling, described Bit Trade’s actions as “serious and motivated by a desire to maximize revenue,” adding that the company failed to address compliance requirements until flagged by ASIC. Commenting on the ruling, ASIC Chair Joe Longo called it a “significant outcome,” adding that “it is ASIC’s first penalty against an entity for failing to have a TMD and a reminder for digital assets firms to consider their regulatory compliance obligations.” In addition to the fine, Bit Trade was ordered to cover ASIC’s legal costs.

The bullish sentiment followed the US CPI inflation data release on Wednesday. Thus, heading into FOMC next week, market analysts are hopeful of a new BTC all-time high. Will FOMC Be A Bullish Catalyst for Bitcoin Price? The US CPI inflation report on Wednesday fueled optimism across the US equity and the global crypto market. As the CPI numbers were in line with expectations, investors are hopeful of a modest 25 basis points interest rate cut during the FOMC meeting next week. Experts estimate a 96-97% chance of rate cuts, which could be a catalyst to the thriving U.S. and global economy. Given the strong correlation between crypto and equity markets, the Bitcoin price has seen a quick surge above $100K. During the Bitcoin consolidation at around $96,000 levels, the BTC whales have done heavy accumulation. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, 342 wallets holding more than 100 BTC were created as Bitcoin’s price fell from $104,000 to $90,000. The data suggests that large-scale investors are seizing the opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices . Source: Ali Charts On the other hand, inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also continued at a good pace over the past week. For the last nine trading sessions, the US Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed net positive inflows with BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) hitting a fresh milestone crossing over $35 billion in net inflows since inception. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has issued a bold prediction for Bitcoin, forecasting a potential rise to $275,000. Martinez’s target is based on a “cup and handle” pattern formation. The analyst advised investors to “buy the dip” but warned against overleveraging. Source: Ali Charts What’s Next for BTC After Recent Breakout? Bitcoin price surged past the $94,500 to $98,000 trading range following U.S. inflation data that met expectations, according to 10x Research . Source: 10xResearch Analysts noted that Bitcoin price often rallies after declining ahead of inflation reports, as stable data tends to subside market concerns about inflation spikes. While Bitcoin’s price may grind higher through year-end, 10x Research expects limited market fireworks as many investors close their books following the FOMC meeting. However, it notes that altcoins are showing greater relative strength over Bitcoin. Even today, the altcoin sector is seeing a strong surge led by an Ethereum price surge of over 7%, currently trading at the crucial resistance of $3,920. XRP, BNB, SOL, and DOGE have registered modest gains of 4-5% each.

Aave (AAVE) broke through the $300 mark for the first time in over three years, reigniting interest in the altcoin, so much so that analysts have set their sights on a bold $1000 target.

This rebound has been attributed to rising confidence in the digital currency sector’s future regulatory environment under President-elect Donald Trump. Bitcoin Price Nears Record Peaks The regulatory landscape is poised for significant changes, particularly with Brian Quintenz emerging as a strong candidate to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Quintenz, currently the head of policy at a16z Crypto—Andreessen Horowitz’s digital asset division—and a former Republican CFTC commissioner, is seen as a favorable choice for the crypto community. Related Reading: XRP Price Defies Bearish Crypto Trend, Rallies 6%: Key Drivers Revealed This follows the recent selection of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving him the ability to turn the regulatory agency 180 degrees after years of leading a regulation-by-enforcement crusade led by its retiring chair Gary Gensler. Trump’s recent efforts to reverse a Biden administration crackdown on crypto have contributed to Bitcoin’s recovery, which reached an all-time high of $104,00 on December 5. Since then, Bitcoin has fluctuated around the six-figure mark, indicating sustained interest from investors. Alongside regulatory optimism, expectations for a potential reduction in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have also bolstered investor sentiment. Bullish Sentiment Grows Following reports that US consumer-price inflation met forecasts, speculators have increased their bets on a new interest rate cut. This shift in monetary policy expectations has had a positive impact on markets, propelling the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index to a record high. Henry Elder, a principal at UTXO Management, noted, “The market likes seeing inflation come in within expectations,” adding that traders are currently assessing whether $100,000 will act as a ceiling or a floor for BTC prices. Trump has not only indicated a willingness to foster a more favorable regulatory environment but has also supported the concept of a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile. While the feasibility of this idea remains debated, Eric Trump recently expressed on Bloomberg Television that his father would be “an unbelievable ally to the industry.” Related Reading: Solana Price At $4,000? Cup And Handle Pattern Shows Why This Is Possible Since Trump’s election victory on November 5, Bitcoin has surged nearly 50%, buoyed by approximately $11 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Technical expert Ali Martinez has added to the positive view for the flagship cryptocurrency by stating that whales are aggressively buying dips. Notably, 342 wallets with more than 100 BTC were created when prices dropped from $104,000 to $90,000. This accumulation by major holders fuels the positive mentality, with Martinez projecting the Bitcoin price will hit $275,000 based on a cup-and-handle formation on its one-week chart.

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING.

Here’s What They Did,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-bots-are-back-heres-what-they-did/,"The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed a sharp downturn which has many in the community speculating. XRP was affected by this, losing the $2 support level briefly. Among the discussions surrounding XRP’s performance, a recent post on X by Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode), a crypto expert, caught the community’s attention. Van Code highlighted a series of unusual trading patterns involving XRP/USDT, suggesting the involvement of automated bots. Van Code shared an image displaying repetitive XRP/USDT transactions of three XRP each, executed within milliseconds. These trades, numbering about 200, occurred shortly after a large order was processed. The #XRP bots are back at it, this string of 3 XRP orders executed when on for about 200 trades. These are not market makers, I think designed to pull price down, they happen every time after a large order is executed. pic.twitter.com/fvu3xZkc2x — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 10, 2024 He speculated that such activity might be designed to pull the price down, distinguishing it from standard market-making operations. While such patterns are not uncommon in cryptocurrency markets, they often raise questions about market manipulation and its impact on asset prices. The Market’s Recent Decline This unusual trading activity coincided with a broader market crash, which was covered in detail in a recent report by Times Tabloid . Experts attributed the crash to liquidations triggered by a significant sell-off on Coinbase. The cascading effect resulted in $2 billion in liquidations within 24 hours, marking the largest event of its kind since 2021. The market’s thin liquidity worsened the volatility, particularly for assets like XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The widespread decline was not limited to XRP. Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw sharp losses, with retail and institutional investors scrambling to cut their losses. XRP’s downturn is particularly noteworthy due to its unique challenges. The asset had gained significant momentum, reaching its highest level since 2018, the decline discouraged many investors who were hopeful for a continued resurgence. However, XRP showed resilience. Despite the bot activity shared by Vincent Van Code, its price is recovering, currently trading at $2.44, up 5% over the past 24 hours. The crash also cleared out speculative positions, providing a path for the market to recover. Ethereum showed similar resilience, bouncing back after a sharp decline. What’s Next for XRP? Despite the challenges highlighted by Van Code and the broader market analysis, XRP remains a vital player in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its ability to weather regulatory storms and market volatility positions it as a top contender in the crypto space. Despite the recent crash, experts are bullish on the digital asset, with a former regulated fund manager recently describing it as one of the greatest opportunities for generational wealth . While questions about trading irregularities linger, XRP’s long-term potential remains intact. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

More than anything, the growing correlation between BTC and the seemingly endless procession of alts reflects the broader landscape of interoperability and scaling solutions. At this juncture, multiple networks and tokens can happily thrive alongside Bitcoin rather than compete with it. Which is just as well, since Bitcoin – at least at present – has no competition. It is the blue-riband asset of the crypto world, the undisputed heavyweight champ. And its value has only been cemented by the growth of protocols and services built on its Proof-of-Work (PoW) network. Here are just a handful of examples. Lightning Network: Turbocharging Bitcoin’s Capabilities Launched in 2018 by Lightning Labs, the Lightning Network is a second-layer solution that has transformed Bitcoin’s utility by enabling near-instantaneous transactions at minimal cost. By implementing smart contract functionality for off-chain transfers, the decentralized network has theoretically enabled Bitcoin to process millions – or even billions – of transactions per second. Over the last six years, Lightning has become synonymous with bitcoin microtransactions and everyday payments, turning ‘digital gold’ from a dependable store of value to a viable medium of exchange. It’s also popular with hardcore bitcoiners, who appreciate that it upholds the chain’s core principles. In fact, as long as chains support the same cryptographic hash function, it’s possible to use Lightning to make transactions across networks without placing trust in a third-party custodian. EOS: Building Bridges to Bitcoin One of the original big beasts of the blockchain world, EOS has demonstrated admirable foresight in its approach to Bitcoin integration through exSat, a sophisticated ‘Docking Layer’ designed to enhance interoperability between Bitcoin and various Layer-2s. For evidence of the integration’s success, look no further than EOS’s steadily growing Total Value Locked (TVL) which has risen to a cool $259 million. Launched earlier this year, exSat extends Bitcoin’s consensus mechanisms, favoring a combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, all while maintaining its security and scalability. By letting users bridge BTC to EOS’ expanding DeFi playground, it has also opened fresh opportunities for investors to trade, swap, save, lend and borrow. Rootstock (RSK): Smart Contracts Meet Bitcoin As one of the earliest Bitcoin Layer-2s, Rootstock has established itself as a vital bridge between Bitcoin and the world of smart contracts. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) makes it attractive to developers who can leverage existing Ethereum development tools and knowledge to build apps on Satoshi’s chain. Recent data from Messari underscores Rootstock’s growing adoption, with new accounts increasing by 111.9% quarter-over-quarter and active accounts growing by 61.0%. The total accounts now exceed 90,000, with users drawn in by a broad range of DeFi apps, DEXs, stablecoins, wallets, and bridges in the Rootstock ecosystem. Users appreciate the value of a platform combining Bitcoin’s security with smart contract functionality. ZeroSync If Bitcoin has an Achilles heel, it’s where privacy is concerned: all BTC transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the network. Step forward ZeroSync , the world’s first zero-knowledge (ZK) light client for Bitcoin. With such a light client, it’s possible to run a full Bitcoin node on a smartphone.

Nonetheless, there are major challenges on this front as blockchains still operate as digital islands, proving a major barrier to unlocking the full potential of Web 3 protocols, mainly DeFi platforms. Luckily, new developments in the space such as Orchestration are providing solutions to the blockchain interoperability conundrum, enabling decentralized applications to interact seamlessly and transfer assets across blockchains without hassle. By unlocking the power of interoperability, the Orchestration could enable an interconnected on-chain economy that maximizes liquidity, provides universal access to users, and realizes greater efficiencies and cross-chain collaboration. In this piece, we discuss the challenges that suppress blockchain interoperability, the solutions to these challenges – Orchestration, and projects that build a more efficient blockchain ecosystem for the future. Understanding The Blockchain Interoperability Challenge The DeFi ecosystem is a sum of hundreds (maybe thousands) of platforms and protocols hosted on different blockchains, each with its own set of laws and regulations. The diversity in the space has seen the market grow into a $126 billion industry , leading it to become one of the most important pillars of blockchain technology’s rapid adoption rates. However, these networks operate in isolation and are unable to communicate and share data, limiting their potential applications and benefits. The lack of cohesiveness between these protocols leads to the fragmentation of decentralized applications (DApps). This could be detrimental to user experience, mass adoption of the technology, and even stifling innovation in the space. Interoperability issues also limit liquidity movements across DeFi protocols and blockchains, making it more difficult for users to locate the assets they require. In addition, the inability of DeFi protocols and blockchains to communicate with one another limits their efficiency. Transactions may be slower and more expensive, and determining the optimal price for assets may be more challenging. Finally, the lack of compatible protocols and blockchains also hinders innovation and creativity in the space, whereby developers lack the incentive to build products or protocols that are not compatible with newer or older blockchains. Enter Orchestration: A Seamless Interaction Across Blockchains Orchestration is a growing framework that solves blockchain interoperability challenges. It enables decentralized applications and Web3 businesses to interact seamlessly, driving composability and enhancing interoperability. By providing tools to coordinate actions across multiple chains, orchestration creates a connected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. For example, it allows users and DApps to freely move digital assets from one chain to another, unlocking liquidity and enabling developers to build more complex cross-chain applications. Additionally, orchestration fosters composability, the seamless integration of decentralized protocols across blockchain networks. This empowers developers to combine the strengths of different blockchains, leading to the creation of innovative and futuristic DApps. These advancements are critical for the future of DeFi, which has faced a slowdown in innovation over the past few years. Orchestration offers a simplified user experience, reduces liquidity fragmentation, and minimizes complexities for both new and experienced DeFi users. It could reignite interest in DeFi and act as a stimulus for mainstream adoption. This transformative approach is already being embraced by platforms like Agoric, Arcana Network, and Guru Network, which are leveraging orchestration tools to streamline cross-chain interactions and redefine the blockchain landscape. The Rise of Orchestration in Blockchain One of the pioneers in the world of Orchestration is Agoric , a Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos ecosystem. Known for its composable and interoperable decentralized applications (DApps), Agoric leverages its Orchestration API to simplify cross-chain interactions while enhancing scalability and usability. Using Hardened JavaScript, Agoric makes blockchain development more accessible to a broader audience, enabling millions of JavaScript developers to build secure and robust smart contracts. Agoric’s orchestration tools are designed to handle the complexities of multi-chain workflows. For instance, Interchain Accounts (ICAs) allow developers to manage accounts across multiple chains from a single interface, streamlining operations and reducing technical overhead. Additionally, the platform’s asynchronous execution model and on-chain timers empower developers to automate recurring actions such as scheduled transactions and dynamic staking strategies across chains. The platform has already demonstrated its capabilities through strategic collaborations. For example, Agoric partnered with Native, a Bitcoin L2 solution, to integrate native BTC into the Cosmos ecosystem, eliminating the need for traditional bridging or wrapping methods. Similarly, its collaboration with Union connects Cosmos to EVM-enabled chains, expanding cross-chain functionality and liquidity opportunities. Platforms like Elys Network also utilize Agoric’s orchestration tools to improve cross-chain liquidity and staking, showcasing how these innovations can redefine DeFi by simplifying workflows and reducing barriers to user adoption. Beyond simplifying cross-chain transactions, Agoric’s approach to orchestration improves scalability. The platform’s long-lived smart contracts, supported by its native $BLD token, enable applications to persist autonomously over extended periods, facilitating seamless cross-chain operations. While Agoric focuses on enabling long-lived smart contracts and seamless cross-chain operations, other platforms like Arcana Network , address usability by simplifying gas fee management. Imagine you own $ETH and wanted to stake them on Avalanche. First, you would need to download an Avalanche wallet compatible with $ETH and ensure you own some $AVAX to pay the gas fees needed. This could prove complex and users as you would first need to convert the $ETH TO $WETH, then some $ETH to AVAX to pay for the gas fees on Avalanche. Arcana Network solves this by presenting users with a unified balance on their existing wallet, allowing them to spend this balance on any chain without switching wallets or holding gas fees of a specific chain. Users can pay their gas fees on Avalanche using $USDT, $ETH or any other coin they hold in their wallet. Meanwhile, Guru Network , a multi-chain Web3 automation and AI compute layer, takes Orchestration to the next level by introducing AI. The Layer 3 network allows DApps and retail users to natively embed multi-chain Web 3 automation and orchestrated AI Agents into their routines and earn network participant rewards. By providing these solutions, platforms like Agoric, Arcana, and Guru are actively reshaping the blockchain landscape. Their contributions bridge isolated ecosystems, unlock liquidity, and pave the way for the next generation of decentralized applications. Future Outlook: A Unified DeFi Landscape As alluded to, Orchestration has the potential to reshape the DeFi landscape by fostering a more unified and interoperable ecosystem. As DeFi protocols become more interconnected and composable across blockchains, liquidity will become less fragmented and usability more simplified, which could lead to higher adoption rates across the ecosystem. In addition, the technology could lead to the creation of more sophisticated and efficient financial applications that leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains. For instance, a user could seamlessly borrow assets on one chain, swap them for another asset on a different chain, and then deposit them as collateral on a third chain, all within a single, streamlined transaction. This level of interconnectivity could unlock new opportunities for yield farming, arbitrage, and other DeFi strategies, ultimately driving greater liquidity and capital efficiency across the entire ecosystem. This could lead to a broader user base for DeFi, accelerating its mainstream adoption and driving further innovation in the space. With the crypto bull run heating up, the DeFi space could easily become a global phenomenon once again, with our estimates predicting a doubling in value for the industry in the next two to three years. Conclusion Orchestration is a transformative solution to blockchain interoperability challenges that currently hinder DeFi’s growth. By enabling seamless communication and asset transfers across blockchains, it unlocks liquidity, enhances user experiences, and fosters innovation. This technology has the potential to redefine decentralized finance and extend its benefits across the broader Web3 ecosystem. By facilitating interoperability and composability, orchestration could serve as the foundation for a truly interconnected and scalable blockchain future. The future of DeFi and Web3 depends on overcoming the barriers of fragmentation and inefficiency, and orchestration will do that. As adoption picks up, it promises to revolutionize how users, developers, and businesses interact with blockchain technology, unlocking new opportunities and shaping the next generation of decentralized applications.

Gox-Linked Wallet Transfer 2,300 Bitcoin, Is a Massive Sell-Off Looming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin just regained the $100K mark, and defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox is back in the spotlight with over 2,300 BTC moving out of its wallet. This sudden transfer has sparked curiosity about the reasons behind these large transfers—are creditor repayments finally on the way, even with the deadline pushed back. Mt. Gox-Linked Wallet Transfer 2,300 BTC On December 12, a wallet associated with Mt. Gox moved 2,324 BTC, roughly worth $234 million, to an unidentified address. This move came after Bitcoin’s reclamins, the $100K mark, driven by optimism surrounding potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts . Interestingly, this transfer followed another significant move the previous day. On December 11, 2,623 BTC (worth approximately $255 million) was transferred from Mt. Gox-linked wallets to various addresses. These movements appear to be part of a series of large Bitcoin transfers made this month, including one on December 4, when the exchange sent $2.8 billion worth of Bitcoin to an unknown wallet. Possible Repayment to Creditors While the exact reason for these transfers remains unclear, historical trends suggest that they could signal the beginning of creditor repayments. Mt. Gox had previously announced in July that it was starting to repay creditors in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The repayment process involves creditors verifying their accounts and registering with certain crypto exchanges like Bitstamp and Kraken to receive their funds. Deadline Extension Originally, repayments were expected to be completed by 31 October 2024. However, due to incomplete procedures and some technical issues, including a system error leading to “double deposits,” the repayment deadline was extended to October 31, 2025. Crypto Sell-off Could Happen? Mt. Gox’s history with large Bitcoin transactions has raised concerns about potential market disruptions. Some fear that the movement of these Bitcoin funds could lead to a significant sell-off. As of now, Bitcoin is trading near the $100K level, showing strong momentum with a market cap hitting $2 trillion. With the U.S. government expected to adopt a more pro-crypto stance in January 2025, Bitcoin may continue its bullish trend, potentially hitting new ATH soon.",News,EN,0,0,BCH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 07:59:22

The skills and knowledge you’ve accrued throughout your lifetime give you specific capabilities that distinguish you from the planet’s other 8 billion inhabitants. But you can only split your time and skill set in so many ways. You can’t be everywhere at once, no matter how highly motivated you are. From training up junior colleagues to mastering new skills to further your professional development, the grind never ends. Have you ever joked that if only you could clone yourself you could get more done and free up time in which to enjoy life? Well, it turns out that now you can. While the era of human cloning is still some way off, machines are easy to replicate. And thanks to advancements in AI, it’s now easier than ever to create a digital clone that contains many of your best attributes – your wisdom, personality, and deep knowledge – without the need to go on standby for eight hours a night. What a time to be alive. Seeing Double One of the greatest challenges facing organizations today is the skills gap: the discrepancy between the expertise demanded by modern industries and the capabilities that are readily available in the workforce. Over time, key employees inevitably move on, whether due to retirement, career changes, or new opportunities. When they leave, they take with them not only their unique abilities but also the institutional knowledge and personal insights they’ve gained along the way. This loss can create significant operational hurdles, especially in fast-paced industries where training new hires and ensuring business continuity is paramount. Enter the era of AI twins : digital counterparts designed to capture and preserve the accumulated knowledge and expertise of individuals. Built using advanced artificial intelligence models, these replicas encapsulate a person’s proficiency, problem-solving, and even elements of their communication style. By doing so, they serve as a perpetual resource, offering companies a way to maintain their competitive edge long after their star performers have moved on. But an AI twin is about more than merely leaving a legacy: it also allows you to be in more places at once, with your human form complemented by a digital counterpart that can handle the grunt work, freeing you to focus on more important tasks. Twinning Is Winning An AI twin can be thought of as a digital mentor working around the clock. Newly onboarded team members can consult this virtual advisor to learn industry best practices, historical decisions, and nuanced trade-offs that were once understood only by those with years of experience. Because AI twins are accessible at any time and can be scaled to support multiple employees simultaneously, they redefine training and mentorship, turning what was once a bottleneck into a frictionless, continuous learning process. Moreover, AI twins ensure that specialized knowledge isn’t confined to a single point of failure. If a seasoned data scientist leaves a biotech firm, for example, her AI twin can continue to guide research teams, explain past experimental methodologies, and even troubleshoot challenges that arise in ongoing projects. This not only preserves the valuable intellectual capital she accumulated but safeguards against the productivity slowdown that often follows the departure of key personnel. You don’t need to suffer from a narcissus complex to appreciate the benefit of creating an AI twin in your likeness. But what does this process resemble in reality, and what does it take to create your own AI clone? Copy From the Best One of the leading developers of AI twinning technology, Twin Protocol , enables individuals to create digital versions of themselves equipped with their expertise, knowledge, and unique perspective. By training these AI twins through recorded calls, documents, questionnaires, and real-world interactions, users can craft digital mentors. Employers, in turn, can rely on these digital counterparts to train new hires, fill gaps left by departing team members, and support ongoing projects, all while maintaining a consistent standard of guidance and quality. As the benefits of AI twin creation start to propagate, just as they have with other artificial intelligence verticals such as AI agents, expect to see plenty of other developers enter this emerging field. The technology has the potential to foster a more resilient and versatile workforce that isn’t overly reliant on any single expert or vulnerable to the institutional memory loss that occurs with turnover. Instead, organizations can embed expertise into the very fabric of their operations, ensuring that valuable insights are easily transferable and continually accessible. At the same time, individuals benefit by having their knowledge recognized, preserved, and even monetized, enabling a new form of passive income as others tap into their stored expertise. AI twins offer a compelling avenue for bridging the skills gap. They can help businesses future-proof their human capital by turning temporary tenures into permanent reservoirs of knowledge. This will ensure that hard-earned knowledge won’t vanish with the next wave of departures but will remain permanently accessible, ready to drive innovation and growth for years to come. Five years ago, the notion of creating a digital clone of yourself would have been unthinkable. Five years from now, the prospect of not having an AI twin may be equally unthinkable.

In a speech in the United Arab Emirates this week, the Bridgewater Associates founder pointed to debt levels in the US, China and all other major economies except for Germany, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports . “It is impossible for these countries to be able to not have a debt crisis in the years ahead that will lead to a great decline of [money] value.” Dalio said that belief is leading him towards alternative investments. “I believe that there would likely be a pending debt money problem. I want to steer away from debt assets like bonds and debt, and have some hard money like gold and Bitcoin.” In his speech, the billionaire investor also outlined five factors that will drive his investment choices in the future, including 1) Debt, money and the economy; 2) Countries’ internal political orders; 3) External geopolitical order; 4) Acts of nature, like natural disasters; and 5) Disruptive technology. Explains Dalio, “Don’t get too caught up on the twists and turns of the day-to-day headlines, and instead, think more about the big forces. Think strategically as well as tactically, taking a global perspective while recognizing that what you don’t know about the future is more than what you do know.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With RLUSD, Ripple is positioning itself at the forefront of the rapidly expanding stablecoin market, projected to grow from over $200 billion to over $3 trillion within a few years. In the interview, Long highlighted the transformative potential of stablecoins in reshaping global payment systems. She noted that large players in the payments industry, such as Stripe, have already begun integrating stablecoin technology into their operations, evidenced by Stripe’s recent acquisition of Bridge. BIG BREAKING Monica Long: #RLUSD ’s $3 Trillion Market Use Case Will Boost Demand and Flow Seamlessly Through $XRP for Faster Transactions #XRPHolders #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/LpjWsKSeat — Xaif | (@Xaif_03) December 11, 2024 These developments reflect a growing demand for efficient and scalable solutions in digital payments, a demand Ripple aims to meet with its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD. RLUSD – Ripple’s Answer to Payment Industry Demands RLUSD is an important part of Ripple’s strategy. It is a stablecoin designed to facilitate high-speed, low-cost transactions globally. RLUSD will address critical inefficiencies in traditional payment systems while meeting the demands of businesses and institutions increasingly turning to digital assets for payments. Ripple has already proven its capability in this space. Long revealed that the company has processed over $70 billion through its digital asset platforms. She emphasized that this expertise positions Ripple to become a leading provider of stablecoin solutions, with RLUSD poised to play a pivotal role in the $3 trillion market opportunity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD has been ready for some time, with Long noting in her interview that the asset was “operationally ready.” After an extended regulatory process, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) recently approved the stablecoin , and the company has plans to launch it soon. Long stressed the importance of regulatory oversight, viewing it as essential to fostering trust and adoption among institutional clients, and this approval is a major step for Ripple. Expanding Market Horizons Long dismissed the idea of competition with existing stablecoins. Instead, she expressed confidence in the market’s capacity to grow exponentially. Ripple views stablecoins as an evolving solution to meet increasing global demand for efficient payment methods and not as a competitive space. The company sees RLUSD as a complementary asset that will drive the stablecoin market forward rather than directly competing with incumbents. The $3 trillion potential market is fueled by industries seeking faster, more reliable cross-border payment solutions. By addressing these needs, RLUSD is expected to enhance the utility of the XRP Ledger. This will put a major spotlight on XRP while expanding Ripple’s role in the global financial ecosystem.

As a result, ETH jumped by 8%, Aave gained 33%, and Chainlink price shot up 30%. This strategic investment comes at a time when the crypto market is experiencing renewed optimism, potentially signaling further bullish momentum for these crypto. World Liberty Financial Bet on ETH, LINK, and AAVE Lookonchain reported on December 12th that Trump’s World Liberty Financial has significantly expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio. The company’s multisig wallet actively purchased Ethereum (ETH), Aave, and Chainlink (LINK), spending a total of $12 million in USDC as per Etherscan . This move signals a growing bet on these major blockchain projects as the firm increases its crypto investments. In detail, the wallet spent $10 million in USDC to acquire 2,631 ETH at $3,801. Additionally, it invested $1 million each to purchase 41,335 Chainlink (LINK) at an average price of $24.2 and 3,357 AAVE at $297.8. This investment comes as ETH and other top crypto are experiencing significant gains. World Liberty Financial’s buying spree is sparking discussions about whether other institutional players will follow suit. As more influential investors like the Trump family embrace digital currencies, the outlook for ETH and LINK is becoming increasingly positive. This could drive further price rallies, especially with the solid performance of these crypto in the market. Ethereum and Chainlink Price Performance Ethereum (ETH) price showed impressive growth, trading at $3,940 with an 8% increase. Analysts believed Ethereum could rally to $5,000 in the near term, driven by its strong ecosystem and integration into various decentralized applications. Chainlink (LINK) price also posted significant gains, rising 30% to $29.29. As a leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink price remained a critical infrastructure for blockchain applications. With continued adoption, analysts predicted Chainlink could reach $100 during the bullish market cycle. Similarly, AAVE price surged by 33% in the last 24 hours, reaching $356. Over the past three months, the price increased by 150%, reflecting growing interest in decentralized lending. As more users engaged with the protocol, innovative features like flash loans and collateral management attracted increasing attention.

The DEX launch is blistering hot, with $PEPU soaring 145% to a $185 million market cap as FOMO buys begin to roll in. Pepe Unchained’s IDO demand surpasses some of the market’s favorite meme coins, such as Coinbase-listed Mog Coin and Murad-based SPX6900. Its launch-day trading volume currently sits at $21.51 million. $PEPU currently available to buy via Uniswap, Best Wallet, or on the project’s website. However, $PEPU will also be listed on other platforms later, opening the token to more new buyers and growth opportunities. The team has locked liquidity for one year, underlining its commitment to Pepe Unchained’s long-lived success. Pepe Unchained Is 1.9% The Size Of Pepe But Has Its Own Blockchain Pepe is finally unchained. The launch of Pepe Unchained is a huge milestone for the meme coin sector, which now has a dedicated layer 2 blockchain on top of Ethereum. Pepe Unchained’s presale soared to unprecedented heights on excitement for its Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, which will facilitate transactions at a lower cost and 100x faster speed than the Ethereum main network. By bringing in the memetic allure of Pepe, the project has the best of both worlds. Its gains thus far are impressive – but with a $185 million market cap, the potential for further growth remains high. Based on Pepe’s market cap of $9.5 billion, Pepe Unchained has just 1.9% the valuation. Right now, Elon Musk is shifting his attention from Dogecoin memes to Pepe memes. For some undisclosed reason, the world’s richest man has developed a new fascination with Pepe the Frog, and Pepe’s price is pumping as a result. It’s up 80% in the past month. Grok image generation just got a major upgrade https://t.co/oOJ3qEjedW — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2024 However, since the launch of Pepe Unchained, Pepe has begun to retrace, down 5.8% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, $PEPU is blazing ahead. Could it be that investors are selling Pepe tokens for Pepe Unchained, riding the Pepe the Frog hype wave while betting on $PEPU’s market-leading utility? Indeed, that’s what analyst Austin Hilton thinks. The high-profile trader urged his 350K YouTube subscribers to not miss the Pepe Unchained presale. However, Hilton has doubled down following its homerun DEX launch, saying the growth will only continue in the months ahead. Pepe Pump Pad To Launch Next – Let The Gains Begin Pepe Unchained’s meme coin launchpad, Pepe Pump Pad, is set to open to the public soon. Anyone will be able to launch a meme coin in two clicks and without coding, fast-tracking Pepe Unchained’s journey to become the leading blockchain for meme coins. It also comes with “Anti-rug protection.” By default, liquidity is locked so developers can not withdraw funds, ensuring every meme coin launched has a strong chance of success. Pepe Pump Pad is Pepe Unchained’s version of Pump.fun, the Solana-based meme coin generator that spawned some of the ecosystem’s most viral tokens, such as Goatseus Maximus, Peanut the Squirrel, and Moo Deng. Pump.fun has generated over $150 million in fees in the past six months, underlining the high demand for this type of platform. Now, Pepe Unchained is bringing it to the Ethereum ecosystem with lower fees and faster speeds. Claim and trade Pepe Unchained now Alongside the Pepe Unchained DEX launch, presale participants can now claim their tokens from the project’s website, or Best Wallet if purchased there. And for those who are yet to buy, this might be the best time to act. With the Pepe Chain set to launch soon, alongside Pepe Pump Pad and a slew of other market-shaking developments, there’s a strong possibility that this is the lowest price we’ll ever see $PEPU trading at.

According to a Dec. 11 statement , IcomTech founder David Carmona, along with four promoters of the scheme, namely Juan Arellano Parra, Moses Valdez, and David Brend, for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations. The court ordered them to jointly pay over $1 million in restitution to defrauded customers and imposed a $1 million civil monetary penalty on each of the four individuals. Additionally, Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa, who admitted to his role in the scheme, was issued a consent order requiring him to pay restitution jointly with the others, bringing the total penalties to over $5 million. Further, the accused also faces a permanent ban from registering with the CFTC and trading in any CFTC-regulated markets. IcomTech was touted as a Bitcoin mining and trading company that offered periodic returns of up to 100%. The scheme was active for a little over a year between 2018 and 2019 and managed to defraud hundreds of victims by promising daily returns between 0.9% and 2.8%. The scheme fell apart in 2019 when the company couldn’t keep up with withdrawal requests. Instead, they handed out a token called “Icoms” as a so-called solution, but it turned out to be practically worthless, leaving investors with even bigger losses.

Instead of using the funds for trading as advertised, the defendants misappropriated the money, leaving victims with significant losses. Meanwhile, the funds were used to bankroll lavish lifestyles and host extravagant expos to lure more unsuspecting victims into their scheme. The CFTC initially filed a civil enforcement action in May 2023, leading to significant legal fallout, including jail sentences and penalties for those involved. Carmona and Brend have each been sentenced to 10 years in prison for their roles in the IcomTech Ponzi scheme, while Ochoa, who admitted his involvement, received a lighter sentence of 5 years. Together, Carmona and Ochoa have also forfeited over $1.2 million in illicitly obtained funds, with Carmona surrendering $329,450 and Ochoa forfeiting $914,000, the statement noted, adding that Brend was fined $40,000 as part of his sentencing. In March this year, Gustavo Rodriguez, who managed an online portal for IcomTech, was convicted of his role in setting up fraudulent investment packages and manipulating daily returns.

This time, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana are taking the stage. Some crypto people might be thinking why prices are up despite slow activities, Let’s try to understand why this is happening. Bitcoin Steady, Ethereum Gains, Solana Keeps Climbing Bitcoin (BTC) is sitting comfortably at $101,088. It’s just a little below its recent peak of $101,356. Prices are strong, but the trading volume isn’t following the same path. In fact, it’s down 17.31%, now at $67 billion. Even with the drop, Bitcoin’s market dominance is undeniable—55.08% share and a market cap near $2 trillion. That’s massive. Source : Tradingview Ethereum (ETH) is doing its own thing. It’s trading at $3,913, which is slightly up from $3,875. Over the past week, Ethereum has climbed an impressive 17%. That’s a big win for traders who stayed optimistic. But like Bitcoin, its trading volume isn’t keeping pace. It’s dropped by 29.33% to $24 billion. Even so, the bullish vibes around Ethereum seem stronger than ever. Then there’s Solana (SOL), which keeps grabbing attention. It’s now priced at $230.01, continuing its upward streak. Enthusiasm for Solana is real, but its trading volume also took a hit—down 32.28%, leaving it at $3.4 billion. Still, Solana’s consistent growth shows how much potential people see in it, especially with its role in decentralized finance (DeFi). XRP is definitely a crypto token worth talking about. Despite a sharp drop in trading volume – 45.24%, XRP reached $2.44. The current recorded trading volume is $12.96 billion. What’s Driving the Price Hikes? It might feel strange at first—prices rising as volumes fall. But the reasons behind this trend are clearer when you dig a little deeper. Institutional investors are stepping in more than ever. Bitcoin ETFs have seen massive inflows, with Fidelity alone adding $121 million. These funds make it easier for large investors to join the market, driving up prices even when overall trading looks quieter. Even the retail investors are not stopping to invest in. As the economic conditions are stable, they are getting the courage and seeing crypto as a smart investment. As the U.S. inflation is at 2.7%, the digital currencies are becoming a hedge against the uncertainty. Source : Farside Trading habits are changing in interesting ways. Instead of seeing lots of frequent, smaller trades, the trend is leaning toward fewer but larger transactions. This shift seems to be driven mainly by institutional investors, who are playing a bigger role in the market. It’s part of why trading volumes are down, even though prices keep climbing. You could see it as a sign of the market maturing—moving toward long-term investments rather than short-term speculation. Technology is having a big impact too. Ethereum and Solana are gaining from improvements in decentralized finance and scalability. These upgrades make them more attractive for people looking at the bigger picture. Even meme coins are bringing some excitement back into the market. Take Solana-based PNUT, for example. It jumped 35% recently, thanks to getting listed on major exchanges. It shows there’s still plenty of energy and interest in crypto. And don’t overlook the bigger economic backdrop. With inflation easing and markets stabilizing, riskier assets like cryptocurrencies are becoming more appealing. Many investors now see crypto as a way to protect themselves from future uncertainty. This growing confidence, from both everyday investors and big institutions, is a major reason why prices are holding strong. What to Expect So, what’s next for the crypto market? If things stay on this path, we might see prices going even higher. Institutional investors seem likely to keep driving growth, especially if the economy remains stable. Crypto could become even more established as a go-to investment option, attracting both seasoned traders and curious newcomers. That said, the market is unpredictable as ever. Prices can change quickly, and unexpected factors could shake things up. For now, though, the focus seems to be shifting toward long-term value rather than quick wins. With all the ongoing developments in technology and adoption, the market feels like it’s heading into an exciting new phase. Who knows what’s around the corner but it is now clear why prices are up despite the low trading volume. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana—they’re all part of a story that’s far from over. The question isn’t whether things will change. It’s how soon and how much. Stay tuned because this space never stays quiet for long.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 09:13:35

The President-elect has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, breaking 150 years of tradition. Reports claim that multiple sources have confirmed the unprecedented invitation, which could set the tone for a new chapter in US-China relations. This invitation is bold, especially considering Trump’s campaign rhetoric. He promised to slap a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and has threatened another 10% if Beijing doesn’t curb fentanyl exports to the US. Folks are wondering if this is a strategic olive branch or a calculated power play. A first in US-China history State Department records show no foreign leader has attended a US presidential inauguration since at least 1874. Typically, such ceremonies are reserved for ambassadors and diplomatic envoys. The Chinese foreign ministry has yet to comment, but all eyes are on Beijing. Xi’s last US visit was for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November 2023, where he held talks with outgoing President Joe Biden. Relations between the two nations remained tense during Biden’s term, with no state visit to China largely due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Historically, leaders from both countries alternated visits, making it Trump’s turn to visit Beijing under usual protocols. The presidents haven’t met in person since June 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan . Although Trump recently confirmed communication with Xi during an NBC interview, he declined to share details of their conversation. The invitation could signify an attempt to reset relations as the US and China prepare for what many fear could be another period of economic and political standoff. China, on the other hand, isn’t backing down. Xi has emphasized his “four red lines,” which include no interference in the Communist Party’s control, no push toward democracy, no efforts to contain China’s economic rise, and no support for Taiwan’s independence. This rigid stance shows Beijing’s determination to defend its sovereignty, even as it remains open to dialogue. In a speech earlier this week, Xi reiterated that trade and technology wars yield “no winners.” Meanwhile, Beijing has escalated tensions by restricting the export of high-tech materials with military applications. Unprecedented preparation Historically, China has avoided sending heads of state to such events. When Biden was inaugurated in 2021, Beijing confirmed that the Chinese embassy had received an invitation but sent no high-ranking officials. The same approach was taken during Trump’s first inauguration in 2017. Hua Chunying, then a foreign ministry spokesperson, emphasized that the US traditionally only invites diplomatic envoys to such ceremonies. This makes Trump’s direct invitation to Xi all the more extraordinary. For now, the ball is in Beijing’s court. Whether Xi accepts the invitation or opts for a more cautious approach, the decision will likely be felt across global markets and economies .

The blockchain firm has moved 380 million XRP, worth more than $915 million, to a wallet, fueling discussions over its potential impact on the asset’s value. In addition, it also comes just after the firm received NYDFS approval for its stablecoin RLUSD. XRP News: Ripple Moves $915M Coins Sparking Speculations In the latest XRP news, Ripple has conducted a massive transfer of its native coin, sparking speculations in the market. According to a recent report by the on-chain transaction tracking platform, Whale Alert, the blockchain firm has moved 380 million XRP, worth $915.17 million, to an unknown wallet “rP4X2….sKxv3”. Notably, the firm has also made similar transfers previously, which has further fueled speculations. While many see this transfer as a selling move by the blockchain firm, others have argued it to be an internal transfer. According to XRPScan data, the address was activated by Ripple (50). Meanwhile, some other large XRP transfers were also noted recently, which has fueled discussions in the market. For context, the same address was noted transferring a 200 million XRP, valued at around $485.37 million, to an unknown wallet “rJqiM…La8nE”. However, XRPScan showed that this address belongs to a Ripple (50) account. In addition, another transfer of 60 million tokens, worth about $145 million, was noted between two unknown wallets, further fueling discussions. It’s also worth noting that both these addresses belong to the “Top accounts by XRP balance” list on XRPScan. Speculations Soar Amid RLUSD Optimism The transfers have fueled discussions in the broader crypto sector, with a flurry of market enthusiasts looking for the potential reason behind the transfer. However, it appears that most of the transfers were internal movements, which is less likely to impact the prices. Notably, Ripple has also previously made similar internal transactions. Besides, the market sentiment appeared to have remained high despite the recent transfers, as evidenced by the current price chart. As of writing, XRP price was up more than 5% and exchanged hands at 2.43, and its one-day trading volume slipped 45% to $13 billion. The crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $2.48 while noting monthly gains of 265%. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose 11%, indicating strong market confidence towards Ripple’s native crypto. Besides, a top market expert has recently predicted the crypto rally to $5, if it holds above a key support level. Meanwhile, this rally comes as Ripple Labs secured approval from NYDFS for its RLUSD stablecoin. The development was lauded by the broader crypto community, especially amid soaring optimism towards pro-crypto regulation in the US with Donald Trump’s election win.

After achieving fresh highs, the token does not appear to halt its rising trend, as the bulls are eyeing much higher targets well above $5 or $6. The Sui network platform is becoming increasingly popular as it has expanded its real-world use cases with multiple integrations with financial platforms. With this, the Sui network shows an unstoppable momentum, with the chart signalling more gains ahead. Given that the immediate target at $5 seems to have been activated, whether the bulls make it to the double-digit figure above $10? The historical price action of the token suggests a breakout from a huge bullish pattern and as a result, a steep ascending trend could be fast approaching. The token broke out of the double-bottom pattern and after a small retracement, it has begun to swell. The technicals are currently extremely strong, which supports the bullish narrative. Hence the token is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend as the RSI has made it to the overbought zone. As the levels are not displaying any possibility of a bearish divergence, the SUI price is expected to maintain a healthy upswing. Besdies, the rising on-balance volume or OBV, supports the bullish narrative, which suggests the rally to be in a progressive stage. The token has already reached the 1.2 FIB at the current highs and the next level to watch is around $5.34, which is at 1.414 FIB. However, the major target remains at around 2 FIB at $2 and securing these levels could attract some bearish action, which may halt the steep ascending trend. If the market continues to possess strong bullish momentum, then the SUI price rally may revamp a strong rebound and proceed towards the $10 milestone that could be the peak of the prevailing bull run.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 09:21:54

The non-fungible token set became the world’s second most-valued NFTs on Wednesday, with the minimum — or floor — price for any of the 8,888 comic penguins topping $100,000 and flipping the collections' value above its comic monkey forerunner, the Bored Apes Yacht Club. That means buying a single NFT now costs more than a bitcoin, which currently trades at just over $100,000. The floor price has jumped 76% in the past seven days to over 26 ether (ETH), or just above $105,000. Bored Apes and CryptoPunks — the most valued NFTs — both fell 12% in the same period. Demand for the NFTs surged after a CoinDesk exclusive on Pudgy Penguin’s plans to release a PENGU token on the Solana blockchain later this month. The token allocation strategy includes a substantial share for existing NFT holders, which may have incentivized current owners to hold or increase their investments, driving up demand. Nearly a quarter — 23.5% — of the 88 billion PENGU tokens will be reserved for owners of the project's NFT collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys and Pudgy Rods. A further 22% will be available to the Solana and Ethereum communities, and 12% will be set aside to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. In the NFT market, the floor price is the cheapest cost of an NFT within a specific collection. It is fixed by the NFT's owner based on market forces such as demand or rarity of traits in the collection. The floor remains in place until a lower one is set. This is different from the general token or stock market, where demand and supply automatically change prices every second, instead of a single holder deciding the minimum price for an asset. Pudgy Penguins came into existence in 2021. Each penguin is hand-drawn and features distinctive traits such as backgrounds, body, face, head and skin. The collection has successfully expanded its presence beyond just digital collectibles into physical products and mainstream branding. Parent company Igloo last year introduced Pudgy Toys, a toy line based on the digital art collection. It has since sold more than $10 million in collectible igloos and plushies through major retailers including Walmart, Target, Amazon and Walgreens.",Markets|NFT|Pudgy Penguins,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-12 09:24:12

On the other hand, declining network growth and fewer large transactions suggest possible downward pressure. Is SHIB Gearing up for a New Rally? The second-largest meme coin has performed quite well in the last three months, registering a price increase of over 100%. It reached a local peak on December 7, but shortly after, it dipped substantially amid the latest market correction. In the past 24 hours, there has been a fresh resurgence, with SHIB currently trading at around $0.00002918 (per CoinGecko’s data). SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko One popular analyst touching upon the asset’s recent price fluctuations is the X user JAVON MARKS. The market observer claimed that SHIB has confirmed a bullish pattern, which could be followed by “another major upside move.” JAVON MARKS reiterated their prognosis that the valuation could spike by almost 180% and reach $0.000081: “With this target at $0.000081 continuing to be in play, we could be soon witnessing a more than 180% climb unfold in front of our eyes, and it may just already be in-effect as we speak.” Some important on-chain metrics support the bullish forecast. An example is the SHIB exchange netflow which has been predominantly negative in the last week. This signals a potential shift from centralized platforms toward private wallets, which in turn , reduces the immediate selling pressure. Another factor is Shibarium’s progress. The layer-2 scaling solution, whose ultimate goal is to foster the development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently reached another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total number of wallet addresses surpassed two million. Prior to that, the total transactions processed on the network crossed 600 million. Something for the Bears, too Despite the aforementioned bullish elements, there are some metrics suggesting that SHIB’s price may head south soon. According to IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu’s Net Network Growth (a momentum signal “that gives a pulse of the true growth of the token’s underlying network”) is down 0.76% on a daily scale , entering the bearish zone. Large Transactions (a momentum indicator showing the number of transactions greater than $100,000) have also declined in the past 24 hours. The “InTheMoney” metric (which measures the change in the number of SHIB investors currently sitting on paper profits) has plunged, too. Currently, around 69% of those invested in the asset are in the green, while 24% remain underwater.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency almost crossed $102,000 after reaching an intraday high of $101,819 before retreating to its current level. The move past $100,000 comes after BTC spent several days between $94,000 and $98,000. Other cryptocurrencies also registered substantial increases over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) is up over 7% in the past 24 hours and is on the verge of going above $4,000. Ripple (XRP) also recovered from its recent slump up 4%. Solana (SOL), which had seen a substantial decline, has also recovered and is up almost 6%, trading at $230. With the markets posting a strong recovery, the crypto market cap is up nearly 6% and currently sits at $3.65 trillion. Crypto Markets Recover Bitcoin (BTC) climbed above $100,000 for the first time since it set a new all-time high of $103,900. BTC’s rally also pulled up other altcoins, with most registering substantial gains. Crypto stocks also registered a sharp jump, with Coinbase and MicroStrategy registering gains of 3% and 9% respectively. The crypto markets got a boost thanks to the November consumer price index numbers, which came in as expected. The consumer price index numbers registered an increase of 0.3% from October and a 2.7% increase from a year ago. However, despite the recent price jump, investors expect BTC to struggle around the $100,000 mark in the short term but remain optimistic that its value could double by the end of the year. US Bankers Remain Cautious On BTC US bankers remained cautious about Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies when speaking at the Reuters NEXT conference held in New York earlier this week. The cautious tone comes despite the expectation of a crypto-friendly administration under the incoming Trump administration. Trump secured the backing of major players from the crypto ecosystem by promising to be a “crypto” president and end the Biden administration's crackdown on the sector. However, despite the assurances, banks remain cautious about dealing with an inherently volatile asset and market. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive, David Solomon, stated, “The regulatory framework has to evolve, and everyone’s speculating as to how that regulatory framework will evolve, but it's still unclear. But, for now, our ability to act in these markets is extremely limited.” Solomon added that if the rules change, Goldman Sachs will evaluate dealing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). BNY recently began offering custody of crypto assets held by exchange-traded products. The bank is also investing in an array of digital assets. However, its CEO believes anything new must be done with appropriate guard rails and tested through a few macroeconomic cycles. During the Biden administration, regulators made it difficult for lenders to hold crypto tokens. They also issued accounting guidance, making it costly for banks to offer crypto custody services. However, that is expected to change once Trump enters the White House, with the crypto industry pushing for several policies to promote the adoption of digital currencies. Trump announced he would make former PayPal executive David Sacks the White House Crypto Czar and nominate pro-crypto attorney Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a strong rebound from a low of $95,821 as markets recovered after November’s consumer price index numbers came along expected lines. The numbers raised expectations of another Federal Reserve rate cut, boosting crypto prices. BTC has surged considerably since Trump’s election victory. The President-elect has also made significant moves to undo crackdowns imposed by the Biden administration and outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. BTC surged to an all-time high of $103,900 in the first week of December before dropping to trade between $94,000 and $98,000. It struggled to regain the $100,000 mark as traders booked profits. However, the latest inflation numbers are boosting the price again. Bitcoin (BTC) experienced significant volatility last Thursday as it sent a new all-time high before dropping to an intraday low of $92,285, briefly dipping below the 20-day SMA before settling at $97,093. However, it recovered on Friday, rising by almost 3% and settling at $99,695, falling just short of the $100,000 mark. BTC remained positive over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising by 1.32% on Sunday to climb above $100,000 and settle at $101,043. Source: TradingView BTC’s foray above $100,000 was short-lived, as sellers returned to the market on Monday. The crypto market’s sudden crash on Monday saw BTC dip to an intraday low of $94,177 as it slipped below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $97,434, ultimately registering a drop of 3.57% and settling above the 20-day SMA. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC fell to a low of $94,307 before settling at $96,914. The price recovered on Wednesday as markets rallied following the release of November’s consumer price index numbers. As a result, BTC registered an increase of over 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,900. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to push it below $100,000. If sellers retain control, BTC could slip below $100,000 and drop to $97,000, where the 20-day SMA could prop up the price. On the other hand, if buyers regain the upper hand, BTC could climb to $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is looking to go above the resistance at $4,000 as it makes a strong recovery from Tuesday’s low of $3,521. ETH experienced significant volatility on Thursday as it rose to an intraday high of $3,957 and fell to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787, registering a decline of 1.48%. However, it recovered on Friday, registering an increase of almost 6% to climb above $4,000 and settling at $4,003. ETH registered a marginal drop on Saturday, slipping below $4,000 and settling at $3,999. However, it reclaimed $4,000 on Sunday after a marginal increase pushed the price to $4,007. Source: TradingView ETH could not remain above this level as bearish sentiment intensified on Monday after a sudden crash in the market. As a result, ETH dropped over 7% to an intraday low of $3,504 before recovering to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,716. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price dropped to a low of $3,521 before settling at $3,630 after a drop of 2.32%. ETH made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rising almost 6% and moving to $3,834. The current session sees ETH up nearly 3% as buyers look to push it above $4,000. A move above this level could see ETH push towards $4,400. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has rebounded strongly from a low of $203 as it looks to move above the 20-day SMA and the resistance at $240. SOL faced considerable volatility almost all of last week as it attempted to move above the 20-day SMA but was repeatedly pushed back. SOL reached an intraday high of $244 last Thursday as it briefly went past the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and SOL fell back, dropping to $236 and registering an increase of 2.84%. Friday saw SOL push above the 20-day SMA again, but it fell back to $237, registering only a marginal increase. Source: TradingView With resistance persisting at this level, SOL could only register a marginal increase on Saturday before dropping on Sunday to settle at $237 after a drop of 0.48%. Bearish sentiment intensified considerably on Monday as SOL plummeted 8.55%, driven by a broader market crash. As a result, the price dropped to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped 1.47% and settled at $213. However, it recovered on Wednesday, rebounding from the 50-day SMA to register an increase of 6.38% and settle at $227, going beyond the immediate resistance at $220. The current session sees SOL up by 1.41% as buyers look to move above the 20-day SMA and reclaim $240. A move above these levels could see SOL retest the resistance at $250. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) registered a sharp decline last week despite starting on a bullish note. By Thursday, XRP had dipped from a low of $2.90 to $2.24 as bearish sentiment intensified its grip significantly. Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, XRP recovered on Friday, registering an increase of over 8% and settling at $2.42. Buyers retained control on Saturday as XRP jumped by 7.55% to move past $2.50 and settle at $2.61. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as buyers lost momentum. As a result, XRP registered a marginal drop to slip to $2.60. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified significantly on Monday as markets crashed. As a result, XRP fell almost 15%, plummeting to a low of $2.02. However, buyers prevented a further decline and propped the price up to $2.21. XRP faced considerable selling pressure on Tuesday as sellers drove it to a low of $1.90. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of over 7% to reclaim $2 and settle at $2.37. XRP saw increased volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand, and XRP registered an increase of 0.91% and settled at $2.39. The current session sees XRP up just over 2% as it attempts to reclaim $2.50. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) faced a substantial drop last week, falling from an intraday high of $17.24 on Thursday to $14.38 before settling at $15.04. The price recovered on Friday as it surged almost 17% to go above $17 and settle at $17.58. Buyers retained control over the weekend as UNI registered an increase of 2.43% on Saturday and 3.30% on Sunday to settle at $18.61. However, sentiment changed abruptly on Monday as UNI fell sharply, registering a drop of almost 14%, falling to an intraday low of $13.99 before recovering to climb above support levels and settle at $16.05. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as UNI dropped over 5% to $15.24. Sellers had driven the price to a low of $14.04. Source: TradingView However, it recovered on Wednesday, rising over 12% and settling at $17.15. The current session sees UNI up almost 8% as it looks to move past the resistance at $19. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis Chainlink (LINK) started the previous week with a staggering increase of over 33.16% as it surged past $20 and settled at $25.22. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level as LINK registered a drop of 4.35% on Tuesday and settled at $24.12. Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as LINK reached an intraday high of $26.52. However, it fell back after reaching this level and registered a marginal drop to settle at $24.10. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as LINK fell almost 4% to $23.12. However, it recovered on Friday, surging nearly 12% to go above $25 and settle at $25.88. Source: TradingView LINK had a mixed weekend as it registered a drop of over 4% on Saturday and rose by 5.23% on Sunday to settle at $26.10. However, sentiment changed dramatically on Monday as LINK plummeted from an intraday high of $27.36 to an intraday low of $19.78. LINK ultimately settled at $22.31 after registering a drop of 14.53%.

LINK recovered on Wednesday as it rebounded from an intraday low of $21.16, registering an increase of 8.16% and settling at $24.06. Bullish sentiment has intensified significantly during the current session, with LINK up a staggering 21% as it looks to go above $30. Algorand (ALGO) Price Analysis Algorand (ALGO) has been experiencing significant volatility since reaching an intraday high of $0.613 last Tuesday. The price plummeted after reaching that level and had dropped to $0.45 by Thursday. Despite the prevailing selling pressure, ALGO recovered on Friday, rising almost 11% to $0.499. The price moved past $0.50 on Saturday, rising to $0.509 despite considerable selling pressure. Sellers re-established control on Sunday as ALGO fell below $0.50 after a drop of just over 2% and settled at $0.498. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as ALGO plummeted over 16%, falling to a low of $0.352 before settling at $0.417. The price dropped to an intraday low of $0.370 on Tuesday as sellers sought to retain control. However, ALGO recovered from this level to register an increase of 1.52% and settle at $0.423. ALGO continued to push higher on Wednesday and registered a rise of 7.04% to settle at $0.453.

The watchdog alleged that the exchange illegally issued a credit facility to more than 1,100 Australian customers. The Federal Court found breaches of design and distribution obligations (DDO). ASIC Chair Joe Longo stated that “TMDs are vital to protect investors from inappropriate products. This outcome reminds digital asset firms of their compliance obligations under current law.” Kraken’s AUS operator fined $8M According to reports , over 1,100 customers used the margin extension product which helped the exchange to generate fees and interest of more than $7 million. Users’ losses have been calculated to be more than $5 million. One customer had lost nearly $4 million while trading. ASIC flagged the lack of a required target market determination (TMD). It added that Bit Trade Pty Ltd, which operated the Kraken exchange, has been offering the “margin extension” product since October 2021. It was in August 2024 when the Federal Court found that Bit Trade’s product was a credit facility. A TMD was required by the product to offer margin extensions in national currencies. Justice John Nicholas criticized Bit Trade’s “seriously deficient compliance system” and noted its breaches were “motivated by a desire to maximize revenue.” The firm continued offering the product despite knowing it likely breached the law. ASIC intensifies crypto oversight This landmark penalty highlights ASIC’s intent to regulate digital asset firms under existing laws. The penalty comes just after the watchdog pushed for industry consultation with the digital-assets sector. The agency is seeking industry feedback on draft updates to its guidance for such products. Meanwhile, Bit Trade must also pay ASIC’s legal costs. The watchdog notes that products, offered by the exchange, are captured under the current law. This suggests that these products need to be designed and marketed properly to the right users in order to ensure that Australians receive appropriate protection. This comes in as the United States moves toward pro-crypto regulations under the Donald Trump administration. Kraken is facing legal heat from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) too. The agency urged a district court to dismiss three of the defenses made by the exchange over the allegations of operating unlawfully. The platform has suggested that there is a lack of clarity around securities laws and how they apply to virtual assets, however, the commission has rejected such claims.

This highlights one of the biggest advantages of the XRP Ledger (XRPL)—its ultra-low fees. Such cost-effective transactions are becoming a key reason why XRP is gaining more attention in the crypto world. XRP’s Lightning-Fast Transfer with Almost No Cost The recent transaction, which was highlighted by crypto analyst Leonidas, quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. The 380 million XRP transfer was made to the wallet ‘rP4X2…sKxv3 ,’ and although the recipient was labeled as “unknown,” data from Bithomp, a leading XRPL explorer, suggests that Ripple itself might be behind the wallet. Following the initial transfer, the recipient wallet moved 200 million XRP valued at $486 million to a new address, again with a minimal fee of just 0.000015 XRP. This brings the total fees for moving $1.88 billion worth of XRP to only $0.0013. The XRP Ledger’s efficiency makes it an attractive option for high-value transfers, especially when compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, where fees can reach $3.50 per transaction, or Ethereum, which charges about $1.48. Making XRP More Accessible What makes this even more impressive is the broader context. XRP’s fees are already the lowest among major blockchain networks, with an average cost of $0.005145 per transaction. Ripple is also making moves to reduce the cost of using XRPL further. Recently, the network lowered the fees to open an XRPL account by 90%, making it easier for new users to join the network. XRPL’s Low Fee Impact On XRP’s Price The XRP Ledger’s extremely low fees could play a big role in increasing XRP’s value. As more people use XRP for quick and cheap transactions, demand for the coin could rise. This growing interest could push the price of XRP higher in the long term, especially as more businesses and users realize the benefits of using XRPL over other networks with higher costs. With XRP’s value already up 7% in the last 24 hours, it seems like these low fees are helping drive interest and demand.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-12 09:40:45

A major investigation is underway into Korean crypto exchange Coinone after the price of the Movement ( MOVE ) token saw a sudden and extreme fluctuation, according to a report by Korean news outlet MTN. The Financial Supervisory Service, which is responsible for overseeing and regulating financial institutions, is reportedly looking into whether there were any unfair trades on Coinone when the price of MOVE jumped 46,000 times higher before quickly falling back down, the report reads.

On the same day, Movement’s price shot up from 215.3 won (around $0.15) to 998,500 won ($697) within minutes on Coinone, before dropping to 5,300 won shortly after, MTN claims. Now, the FSS is checking whether the exchange followed the correct procedures during this event and if there were any unusual trades. The FSS is also reviewing how exactly Coinone listed Movement as the token started trading earlier than other Korean crypto exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, raising questions about how the listing process was handled.

Notably, Sui ( SUI ) recently hit a new all-time high of $4.91, marking a 38% gain in December alone. This builds on an impressive 76% rise in November, signaling strong bullish momentum. Source: crypto.news As SUI continues to climb, its Fibonacci retracement levels suggest it could aim for $7.66, with this target possibly materializing if the broader bull market sustains into 2025. Several key factors drive this optimism. First, SUI’s recent rally confirms increasing market confidence. After reaching $4.91, the token experienced minor pullbacks but maintained critical support levels. This resilience shows strong buying momentum, even as its Relative Strength Index indicates overbought conditions. If SUI reclaims its ATH and surpasses the psychological $5 barrier, it could enter a price discovery phase. The Fibonacci retracement levels position $6.12 as the next target, with a possible upside to $6.75 and eventually $7.66. These represent the asset’s realistic milestones if the momentum continues. You might also like: 4 reasons behind Aave’s rally to 40-month highs Second, the recent integration with Backpack, a crypto exchange and wallet platform, is a major catalyst for Sui’s growth and could spur further upside. Backpack’s decision to adopt Sui’s high-performance blockchain opens significant opportunities for both platforms. With a user base spanning 150 countries and a trading volume of $60 billion in its first year, Backpack brings considerable credibility. For Sui , the partnership enhances its ecosystem by simplifying asset management and trading. Backpack users will gain seamless access to Sui’s network. This came less than a week after Phantom announced it would integrate Sui. Interestingly, this development also includes Backpack’s wallet, which supports multiple chains like Solana and Ethereum. The collaboration has already contributed to the SUI price surge. Third, Sui’s total value locked recently hit an all-time high of $1.835 billion, growing by 17% in a single day, according to data from DeFiLlama. This increase represents an additional $273 million in TVL, largely driven by its decentralized finance protocols. Suilend Protocol alone accounts for $583.61 million, with a 27% daily increase, while NAVI Protocol follows with $553.8 million after a 20.79% rise. The ecosystem also witnessed a record $466.65 million in daily decentralized exchange volume, showcasing growing user activity. Higher TVL and trading volumes demonstrate increasing trust in the network, attracting more participants and boosting SUI’s utility. These bullish metrics are capable of attracting further demand into the Sui ecosystem, potentially contributing to further price growth as 2025 nears. Sui also partnered with Franklin Templeton last month. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Over the past 24 hours, high-net-worth investors have deployed approximately $100 million to purchase ADA, suggesting a potentially bullish sentiment beneath current market conditions. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend on Thursday, citing data from Santiment. Notably, these whales, holding over 100 million ADA, have now collectively expanded their holdings to a staggering 3.27 billion coins. The latest accumulation aligns with a broader trend observed in recent weeks. Over the past seven days, Cardano whales have poured nearly $300 million into ADA, capitalizing on market dips to solidify their positions. This pattern has been evident throughout the past month, with whales strategically buying during consolidations and taking profits during price surges. Interestingly, this whale activity contrasts sharply with retail behavior. Smaller investors, particularly those holding between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of ADA, have recently reduced their exposure. This divergence underscores the confidence of larger investors in Cardano’s potential, even as smaller holders take a more cautious approach. That said, this buying spree comes as ADA consolidates after a month-long rally, during which its price surged by an impressive 260% in just three weeks. The cryptocurrency climbed from lows around $0.50 to a peak of $1.32 on Tuesday. Despite this significant rebound, ADA remains well below its all-time high of $3.16, indicating substantial potential for further growth. That said, analysts see the recent accumulation as a strong bullish indicator. Popular crypto analyst Lark Davis recently outlined key resistance levels at $1.20 and $1.60, emphasizing that breaking through these thresholds could pave the way for significant price growth. The pundit further pointed to longer-term Fibonacci-based projections, suggesting ADA could reach $4.80, $7.70, or even $10 in this market cycle. Notably, hitting the $10 milestone would position ADA with a market capitalization of approximately $370 billion, equating to a 4% dominance of the total cryptocurrency market. In a Thursday tweet, Martinez highlighted the formation of an ascending triangle on ADA’s price chart, a classic indicator of an impending breakout. The pundit projected a short-term target of $1.50 for ADA in the coming weeks. Mid-last month, the analyst predicted that ADA could climb as high as $6 by July 2025, suggesting the possibility of a repeat of the explosive growth that saw ADA climb significantly during the 2020-2021 bull market. ADA was trading at $1.16 at press time, reflecting a 14.32% surge over the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-12 09:54:20

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

With this decision, the Supreme Court effectively upheld a Ninth Circuit appellate ruling from August, which had revived the lawsuit initially dismissed in 2021 by a California district court. The class-action suit, brought forth by a group of Nvidia shareholders, alleges the company concealed over $1 billion in GPU sales tied to crypto mining during the market boom leading up to 2018. Investors claim that CEO Jensen Huang and the company downplayed the extent of sales to the cryptocurrency sector, a critical omission that came to light when the market collapsed later that year, causing Nvidia’s stock to plummet nearly 30% over two days. Nvidia had sought the Supreme Court’s intervention, arguing that the lawsuit relied on fabricated data and unsupported claims. However, the court dismissed the appeal in a one-line order without offering further explanation. Regulators and Evidence Bolster Shareholder Claims Adding weight to the shareholders’ case, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) backed the class-action group in October . The agencies pointed to evidence, including statements from former Nvidia executives and a Bank of Canada report suggesting that Nvidia understated its cryptocurrency-related revenue by $1.35 billion. In response to the Supreme Court decision, an Nvidia spokesperson expressed disappointment, stating, “We would have preferred a decision on the merits affirming the trial court’s dismissal of the case, but we are fully prepared to continue our defense.” Nvidia emphasized its commitment to maintaining consistent standards in securities litigation, which it deems essential for economic stability and shareholder protection. A History of Regulatory Scrutiny This lawsuit is not Nvidia’s first brush with crypto-related controversy. In 2022, the company paid $5.5 million to settle SEC charges over its failure to adequately disclose the impact of cryptocurrency mining on its gaming business. Nvidia resolved the matter without admitting or denying the agency’s findings. The Supreme Court’s dismissal marks a turning point, as Nvidia now faces the prospect of a prolonged legal battle that could scrutinize its internal practices and its handling of the crypto boom .

This is a major step towards integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Frax Finance Unveils AIVM Tech Stack Decentralized stablecoin protocol Frax Finance unveiled its AIVM tech stack, which runs as a parallelized blockchain within the Layer-2 Fraxtal rollup, and uses a new proof-of-inference consensus system. This proof-of-inference mechanism will leverage AI and machine learning mechanisms for validating all transactions on the blockchain network. Frax asserts that its AI tech stack will enable artificial intelligence (AI) agents to operate fully autonomously. This would eliminate single points of control and foster seamless collaboration between AI and blockchain technologies. Speaking on the development, Cesar Rodriguez, CTO at IQ said: “Launching tokenized AI agents with IQ ATP on Fraxtal’s AIVM will be unlike any other launch platform thanks to this joint venture. Sovereign, on-chain [AI] agents that are owned by token holders is a 0 to 1 moment for crypto and AI.” A Look Into the 2025 Vision Roadmap As part of its 2025 Vision Roadmap, Frax Finance has outlined ambitious strategies to solidify its position as the decentralized central bank of crypto. One of the key major highlights is the introduction of the Frax Universal Interface (FUI), designed in a way to integrate the project’s innovative tech stack. Furthermore, the roadmap includes a rebranding of the FRAX stablecoin along with a planned network upgrade via a hard fork. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian said: “Our 2025 Vision Roadmap is a bold step toward creating the infrastructure that makes DeFi intuitive, accessible, and scalable for the next billion users entering crypto”. Frax Finance previously launched its Layer 2 blockchain , Fraxtal, which features decentralized sequencers for batching transactions in a roll-up network. Fraxtal also incentivizes block space usage by rewarding users who spend gas and interact with smart contracts. The Frax Protocol stands as the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin system, offering an innovative approach to decentralized finance. Fully open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain, the protocol is currently implemented on Ethereum. Frax aims to deliver a highly scalable and decentralized algorithmic currency, positioning itself as an alternative to fixed-supply digital assets.

A key technical indicator that presaged November's price surge is positioned precisely as it was then, signaling a potential volatility explosion ahead. That indicator is the Bollinger bandwidth, a tool used to gauge impending changes in market jumpiness. For bitcoin, the bandwidth has narrowed to less than 10%, a level not seen since Nov. 4, the day before the U.S. elections. The largest cryptocurrency subsequently surged to $100,000 from $70,000 in four weeks. Bollinger bands mark levels two standard deviations above and below the 20-day moving average of an asset's price. The bandwidth refers to the spread between upper and lower bands, with rising figures representing volatility boom and vice versa. Volatility is typically mean-reverting, and historical data shows that when the daily bandwidth drops below 10%, it often leads to upturns followed by increased turbulence. It's important to note that volatility is price-agnostic, meaning it can manifest in either direction. For example, after the bandwidth dipped below 10% in early June, BTC prices dropped to $54,000 from $69,000 in three weeks. Seasoned traders wait for the market to confirm a direction by topping either of the two bands. A move above the upper band typically signals a bullish volatility explosion on the horizon, a dip below the lower band suggests the opposite. At press time, BTC is trading between the two bands, offering little guidance. That said, the prospect of renewed volatility might see savvy traders take derivative bets that profit from increased price swings in either direction.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-12 10:05:47

This was announced by Kunos Simulazioni, a specialist studio in driving simulation. This map will also accurately mirror the legendary Eifel region around the famous Nürburgring track. Kunos’ official site confirmed that Assetto Corsa EVO will launch the map by mid-2025, in the summer of the Northern Hemisphere. The franchise will introduce the open world in phases covering 1,600 square kilometers. As the map grows, new features and content will follow. According to Kunos, the map is fully laser-scanned, which means it is full of detail. Assetto Corsa EVO will launch on PC via Early Access on January 16, 2025. Console versions will follow in the future, though they will not be released until after the game completes the early access period. Assetto Corsa EVO will feature real life local business The simulation will also feature local businesses near the Nürburgring. Players will be able to rent and customize their cars at real-life outlets.

The latest voice to join the extraordinarily bullish chorus for BTC is Fundstrat’s legendary analyst, Tom Lee. Specifically, Lee estimated that Bitcoin is likely to follow its historical price action patterns and climb to $250,000 before 2025 is over. The analyst cited the impact of the April halving and the more crypto-friendly administration entering the White House in January as some of the major drivers for such a surge. Additionally, this isn’t the first time Tom Lee has been optimistic about Bitcoin. He has been a BTC bull for a long time and predicted at the very start of December that BTC would cross above $100,000 before New Year. Is a Bitcoin rally to $250,000 in 2025 guaranteed? Considering that Lee’s December prediction came true last week with a brief but strong surge toward $104,000 – and holds true at press time as Bitcoin price today stands just above $101,000 – it isn’t surprising many prominent experts, investors, and influencers have called for the $250,000 price target. Indeed, several analysts from the community have been estimating BTC would climb to $250,000 next year since August, and Cycles Theory had identified 2025 as the ‘red year’ – the year in which Bitcoin would aim for a new and significantly higher all-time high (ATH) with the ultimate target being, again, $250,000. More recently, despite acknowledging some anxiety the world’s premier cryptocurrency might go into a steep correction from $100,000, the prominent investor and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki reiterated $250,000 as his 2025 price target for the coin. For its part, Bitcoin has been on a remarkable – though not always smooth – journey in 2024. Already in March, it hit a decisive new ATH near $73,000, while – after a particularly eventful November – now, it is seeking ever-higher highs above $100,000. In the last 30 days, the cryptocurrency is up 14.40% and year-to-date (YTD), it is 139.74% in the green. Perhaps the most impressive part of the rally, however, started early in November, and between the first day of that month and press time, BTC surged 45.3%. BTC 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Tom Lee extends bullish 2025 forecast to U.S. stocks Finally, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee is not only bullish about the cryptocurrency market. Indeed, the expert who famously predicted the end to the COVID-19 downturn and correctly identified the pre-election volatility in 2024 as a ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity believes the first half of 2025 will also be very strong for U.S. stocks . To be precise, the analyst forecasted that the benchmark S&P 500 index will climb to 7,000 next year, though also cautioned there will be a significant correction in its second half to 6,600 points, for a total gain of approximately 9.4%.

The development has triggered extreme excitement among XRP enthusiasts. In the last 24 hours alone, the price of XRP has climbed by over 5.4%. However, in a recent post on X, Vincent Van Code states that the real growth is yet to come. Why could the coming months be crucial for XRP? Let’s explore! XRP’s Price Surge Post-RLUSD Approval At the start of this month, the XRP price was at $1.95. On December 2, it touched a peak of $2.7239. Between December 3 and 5, the market showed a serious correction of 17.56%- the largest since November 5. The market has not yet recovered from the correction. Though, between December 6 and 7, XRP buyers pushed the price upwards nearly 16.34%, on December 9, XRP sellers regained control, pulling the market down almost 15.14%. Nonetheless, since December 10, the XRP market has consistently surged, marking at least 10.05% growth. The recent growth coincides with the New York authority’s approval for Ripple’s RLUSD. However, Van Code asserts that the current XRP growth does not have the support of fundamentals and the real growth will happen when Automated Market Makers and Liquidity Pools are set up. AMM/LP Setup and Future Growth Van Code claims that the AMM/LP setup will allow users to earn 5% APY on-chain without counterparty risks. The expert forecasts that the setup will drive huge money inflows into XRP Ledger. RLUSD Staking and Increased XRP Utility The expert notes that cryptocurrency exchanges will capitalise on RLUSD by offering staking options. Explaining the possibilities of earning returns and boosting XRP utility, the expert adds that the exchanges will lock XRP on the XRP Ledger. He also mentions that users may swap USDT for RLUSD, enabling the purchase of XRP and LP tokens. Rising XRP Demand and Market Impacts There is no doubt that any development in the usability of RLUSD will positively influence the demand for XRP. An increase in demand for XRP will reduce the supply of the token on exchanges. A reduction in supply will lead to an increase in the price of XRP. The expert emphasises that Market Makers and price-suppressing bots may struggle with the rising demand of XRP. Timeline of XRP’s Growth Van Codes predicts that the XRP market may witness sustained growth at least until February, 2025. In conclusion, RLUSD is not only boosting XRP’s price but could also transform its ecosystem. As demand rises and utility grows, XRP may see its strongest performance in years.

According to a filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office, Byte Federal was breached on September 30 by an unknown attacker who exploited a vulnerability in GitLab, a third-party project management and collaboration software, which allowed them to compromise one of its servers. The breach affected 58,000 customers, with compromised data including names, addresses, phone numbers, government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, transaction activity, and user photographs. While no funds or user assets have been stolen, Byte Federal has urged customers to reset their login credentials and has already performed a hard reset on all customer accounts, according to a post-incident update . Further, the company is working with an independent cybersecurity team to determine the cause of the incident. At the time, the Florida-based ATM operator said they found “no evidence” of the leaked information being misused.
