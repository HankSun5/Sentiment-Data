In 2027, the DOT price can reach a maximum price of $15.15 with an average of $13.23. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $47.13 in 2030. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2024-2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $10.52 Market Cap $16.11B Trading Volume $1.33B Circulating Supply 1.53B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $11.21 24-hour Low $10.04 Polkadot Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Price Prediction $ 20.40 (97.40%) Volatility 29.62% 50-Day SMA $ 5.75 14-Day RSI 82.02 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 19/30 (63%) 200-Day SMA $ 5.70 Polkadot price analysis: DOT sees resilience amid market fluctuations Key takeaways Polkadot price analysis shows a downtrend Polkadot had surged 56% in 30 days, stabilizing at $8.48 Resistance at $9.00 and support at $7.50 are critical for DOT Polkadot DOT price analysis on December 11 shows that the cryptocurrency has experienced significant volatility, reaching a peak of $10.19 before settling at a current trading price of around $8.48. Over the last 30 days, DOT has surged by 56%, marking an impressive gain amidst broader market dynamics. The U.S. president-elect’s recent nomination of a crypto-friendly leader for the SEC has injected optimism into the market. However, in the last two days, we have seen a general bearish trend in the crypto sphere. DOT and TON have recorded double-digit losses over the past week. Today’s market activity for Polkadot reflects a mixed sentiment among traders. Following an overall recovery in the market, Polkadot’s price briefly rallied but encountered resistance at $5.50, prompting caution among traders. The daily trading volume and a market cap of $15.52 billion indicate significant investor interest and participation in DOT transactions. For Polkadot, resistance levels around $5.50 have added to the hesitancy among traders, even as broader crypto recovery trends remain supportive Daily chart analysis: Bears gear for a move below $8.0 The daily chart for Polkadot reveals significant volatility as the coin consolidates after its recent upward rally. The price trades near the 20-day EMA at $8.772, indicating short-term bearish pressure. However, it remains above the 50-day ($7.214) and 100-day EMAs ($6.225), signaling a longer-term bullish outlook. The RSI currently reads 52.70, placing DOT in a neutral zone with room for upward or downward movement. DOT/USD chart The MACD indicator on the daily timeframe displays a bearish crossover, with the signal line positioned above the MACD line. This suggests declining momentum in the short term, although the histogram shows reduced bearish activity, hinting at potential stabilization. Support levels at $7.50 remain critical for maintaining upward momentum, while resistance around $9.00 will be closely monitored by traders seeking bullish confirmation. 4-Hour chart analysis: DOT stumbles to remain above $8.0 The 4-hour chart highlights Polkadot’s efforts to stabilize following its recent dip. The SMA at $8.353 acts as a critical support level, with the price oscillating around this point. The MACD on this timeframe remains in bearish territory, with the signal line slightly above the MACD line. However, the histogram reflects weakening bearish momentum, indicating a potential shift in sentiment. DOT/USD chart The Average Directional Index (ADX) reads 41.62, signalling a strong directional trend. While the current trend favours the bears, a breakout above $9.00 could reverse this dynamic. Short-term traders are likely watching the RSI on this timeframe for signs of oversold or overbought conditions, as these could trigger rapid price movements. After peaking, DOT has corrected significantly but is now showing signs of stabilization around the $8.50 mark. The SMA on the 4-hour chart at 8.353 acts as a short-term support level, with the price oscillating around this point. The MACD on this timeframe is slightly bearish, with the histogram displaying increased bearish momentum, while the ADX at 41.62 signifies a strong directional trend, which currently favours the bears. What to expect from Polkadot price analysis Polkadot’s recent performance reflects a broader trend of increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Despite significant selling pressure, the coin’s ability to sustain its gains underscores its resilience. Technical indicators suggest that DOT’s future movements will depend on its ability to maintain key support levels while overcoming resistance around $9.00 and $10.0.With the growing adoption of Polkadot’s ecosystem and continued development in the blockchain space, the coin remains a focal point for traders and investors. Market analysts are closely watching the $9.00 resistance level, as overcoming this hurdle could be critical for Polkadot’s short-term price trajectory. The interplay between the RSI and MACD suggests that while the immediate outlook may lean bearish, the underlying bullish trend from the past month could reassert itself if market conditions align favourably. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 8.46 BUY SMA 5 $ 8.89 BUY SMA 10 $ 8.70 BUY SMA 21 $7.74 BUY SMA 50 $ 5.75 BUY SMA 100 $5.05 BUY SMA 200 $5.70 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 7.41 BUY EMA 5 $6.50 BUY EMA 10 $ 5.54 BUY EMA 21 $4.93 BUY EMA 50 $ 4.66 BUY EMA 100 $4.90 BUY EMA 200 $ 5.48 SELL What to expect from Polkadot price analysis Overall, Polkadot price analysis shows a descending pattern in DOT’s market as sellers remain in control over buyers. The technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, but buying pressure could resurface if support near $10.04 holds. The resistance at $11.21 must be broken for a higher price push.

Polkadot historic price sentiment Looking at the Polkadot price action over the past years, Polkadot’s price has been heavy since the beginning of 2021. After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In the year 2024 December, Polkadot has shown signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4, as of the current data.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-11 22:21:26

Users are then manipulated into installing malware that compromises crypto wallet data. Scammers Moving Beyond Simple Phishing Scams According to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer, the scammers comment on legitimate posts, enticing users with offers of exclusive investment insights and “alpha” tips. Once individuals join these Telegram groups, they are immediately prompted to undergo a verification process via a bot called OfficiaISafeguardBot. The bot creates a false sense of urgency and pushes users to quickly complete the verification. However, this seemingly harmless step is a trap – by completing the verification, the bot injects malicious PowerShell code into the user’s clipboard. When executed, the code downloads malware designed to compromise the system and steal sensitive data, including crypto wallet information. Scam Sniffer said that the malware has been flagged by VirusTotal as harmful, and previous instances of similar attacks have resulted in private key theft, leading to significant financial losses. “This represents a new evolution in crypto scams – moving beyond simple phishing to combine social engineering with malware. Stay vigilant and share this to protect others.” Rampant Scams Last month, Casa CEO Nick Neuman shared a harrowing tale of a phishing scam that targeted him. In a post on X, Neuman described a call he received from a scammer pretending to be a Coinbase support agent. The scammer claimed that Neuman’s password change request had been canceled and encouraged him to click on a link in a suspicious email. When Neuman started questioning the scammer, they dropped the act and revealed the operation’s true nature. The scammer bragged about having recently stolen $35,000 from a victim and made it clear that the scam targets only rich crypto investors. More recently, a crypto user under the pseudonym “LeftsideEmiri,” reported losing $300,000 due to a social engineering attack. According to the user, the attack began when they received a message containing a link to a KakaoTalk conversation, which was supposedly for a partnership meeting. Although the link seemed broken, the user clicked on it, believing it to be harmless. In hindsight, they suspect that clicking the link triggered the installation of malware, which compromised their Ethereum and Solana wallets, along with several other wallets. The user made it clear that they had not approved or signed any transactions, indicating that the attack was covert and took advantage of social engineering techniques to steal funds.

Table of Contents CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M AVAX: Low fees and high throughput Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Conclusion As December progresses, the cryptocurrency market teems with fresh opportunities. Amid countless digital currencies, three obscure altcoins are drawing attention for their exceptional growth potential. These hidden gems could see their values surge by nearly 9,000% this bull market. CYBRO aims for 1000% growth after raising $7M CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain marketplace, is approaching a pivotal moment with its Token Generation Event (TGE). Following a fast presale that raised $7 million and attracted nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is set to list on Gate.io and other major exchanges on December 14th. During the presale, CYBRO experienced a 450% price surge, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token’s listing at $0.06 has already generated immense demand, with many experts predicting a potential 1000% growth as it enters the open market, driven by strong momentum and solid fundamentals. CYBRO seamlessly combines advanced AI with a user-friendly DeFi platform, providing tools for staking, farming, and lending that cater to both cautious beginners and experienced investors. Its presale accomplishments highlight its quick development and transformative features: CYBRO app: Offering over 30 vaults with competitive APYs to match a variety of investment strategies. Blast Index: A one-click investment solution that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols. Robust platform foundation: Creating a seamless and intuitive user experience for investors. CYBRO’s plans extend through 2025, including advanced features like leverage farming, lending aggregators, and smarter AI tools. These developments aim to solidify its position as a transformative player in the decentralized finance space. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, the momentum from its presale and novel features position it as a token to watch. Interested investors can still join CYBRO before the listing . AVAX: Low fees and high throughput AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and efficient transactions. Avalanche can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, using a hybrid consensus mechanism combining Classical and Nakamoto principles. Avalanche has three chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain. These chains handle different operations like transactions and smart contracts. The platform also allows users to create custom blockchains called subnets. AVAX has utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Chainlink: Smart contracts and secure real-world data Chainlink is a decentralized network that connects smart contracts with real-world data. It allows blockchain applications to interact with external data sources, APIs, and systems securely. Chainlink uses a reputation system to ensure data accuracy and reliability. By bridging blockchain and external data, it enhances the capabilities of smart contracts.

Chainlink also combines on-chain and off-chain components for efficient data processing. The LINK token is central to the Chainlink ecosystem, rewarding data providers, supporting staking for security, and serving as payment for services. This design promotes a reliable and decentralized system. Conclusion In the current bull market, AVAX and LINK offer growth prospects but may have limited short-term potential.

The advanced DeFi platform will use AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain to enhance earnings. It will also provide attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. CYBRO users will enjoy seamless deposits and withdrawals, ensuring a smooth experience.

What if this week could be your golden ticket to catching the next big thing in crypto? With meme coins taking the stage, the buzz around Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) and Moo Deng (MOODENG) has hit a fever pitch. GOAT is riding waves of market momentum, and MOODENG is making headlines with its Coinbase listing and viral cultural roots. But the real showstopper? BTFD Coin (BTFD), with a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a presale that’s already smashing records. The opportunities here aren’t just good—they’re game-changing. BTFD Coin is rewriting the playbook for meme coins. It’s in its 11th presale stage, has already sold over 50 billion coins, and raised a whopping $3.4 million. With staking rewards and a thriving community of over 4,400 holders, this project is set to be a headline-maker. And the timing couldn’t be better—BTFD’s P2E game beta version is live now, giving you a chance to enjoy while the market prepares for its next big move. Let’s dive into why BTFD and its competitors are the best meme coins to invest in this week. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution That’s Changing the Game Imagine snagging an investment that feels like being at the start of a bull run. That’s what BTFD Coin promises, with its presale currently in its 11th stage, setting the stage for what could be the next big meme coin explosion. The BTFD Revolution and Live P2E Game At its heart, BTFD represents the “ Buy the Dip ” mantra, turning market downturns into opportunities. But this isn’t just another coin with a catchy slogan. BTFD’s live P2E game is here. It’s not just a game; it’s a gateway to BTFD’s ecosystem, where earnings can be staked for even greater returns. The project is built on Ethereum, guaranteeing security, liquidity, and scalability. With over 5,000 active nodes, Ethereum’s network ensures transparency, making BTFD an ideal investment for those seeking stability in the meme coin space. Presale Highlights and Growth Potential Here’s the kicker: the BTFD presale has already raised over $3.4 million, selling more than 50 billion tokens to over 4,400 investors. Starting at just $0.000004, the presale price is now $0.00012, with a projected listing price of $0.0006. Early adopters stand to gain massive returns—if you invest $1,500 in this stage, your holdings could be worth $7,500 once the coin hits its listing price. With 173 billion tokens in total supply, BTFD ensures scarcity and demand. Add to that a staking APY of 90%, and you’ve got a recipe for steady growth. If you’ve missed out on past bull runs, BTFD offers a second chance to ride the wave. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): Meme Meets Market Momentum GOAT is the meme coin that’s been shaking up the crypto scene, blending humour with serious potential. Recently, it gained 15%, reaching $0.86 before stabilising at $0.69. Its association with the AI bot Truth Terminal and OpenAI’s $1.5 billion SoftBank deal added an unexpected boost. Challenges and Opportunities Despite the price rally, GOAT faces hurdles. Truth Terminal’s treasury migration raised concerns among investors, affecting its price trajectory. But analysts suggest that if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hits 30, indicating an oversold market, GOAT could bounce back. Its all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024 shows the coin’s potential for recovery. As an investor, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on these developments. GOAT’s journey may be volatile, but its resilience makes it a strong contender in the meme coin space. Moo Deng (MOODENG): From Viral Sensation to Crypto Success MOODENG takes meme coins to a whole new level with its origin story—a baby pygmy hippo from Thailand that went viral. Its cultural impact, combined with strategic moves like a Coinbase listing, has made MOODENG a hot topic. Cultural Hype Meets Market Gains When Coinbase announced its plans to list MOODENG, the coin surged by 80%, hitting $0.57 before stabilising at $0.5159. Its current price of $0.00010463 might seem modest, but with a market cap of $350.94 million, the coin has solid footing. Investors are closely watching key support at $0.5006 and resistance at $0.6531. MOODENG’s largest whale recently added 11.8 million tokens, a clear sign of confidence in the coin’s potential. Conclusion From Goatseus Maximus’s resilience to Moo Deng’s viral fame, and the groundbreaking BTFD presale, these coins are rewriting the rules of meme investing. Based on market trends and their unique offerings, BTFD stands out as the best meme coin to invest in this week. Its presale performance, staking rewards, and live P2E game are unmatched.

Analysts at Bernstein say this growth will come from the possibility of MicroStrategy being added to the Nasdaq 100 index and the positive signals from the new Trump administration, which is expected to support cryptocurrency strongly. MicroStrategy to Experience Mind-Blowing Growth Likewise, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, in a post on X, predicts that MicroStrategy will join the Nasdaq 100 on December 23. This addition could greatly increase the company’s visibility and lead to significant buying activity. Seyffart estimates that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) related to the index will buy at least $2.1 billion of MicroStrategy shares. This purchase would account for about 20% of the stock’s daily trading volume, which Seyffart considers a conservative estimate. Notably, MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq 100 index would be a significant achievement for the company, highlighting its growing role in technology and cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, this potential increase comes as the market expects more supportive policies for crypto under the Trump administration. With clearer regulations and support for innovation, crypto-focused companies like MicroStrategy will likely benefit from this positive trend. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Bet Deepens MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy continues to draw attention as Bernstein analysts project the firm’s holdings could swell to 4% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply by 2033. The research firm updated its price target for MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) to $600 by the end of 2025, citing its unprecedented treasury model and increasing global capital inflows. Notably, this report highlights MicroStrategy’s success in raising $3 billion in convertible debt and $6.6 billion in equity, putting the company ahead of its $42 billion capital-raising plan. The analysts view this as a pivotal factor in MicroStrategy’s ability to sustain its long-term Bitcoin acquisition strategy . MicroStrategy, a Pacesetter in the Crypto Industry The tech giant has emerged as a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency industry , primarily through its bold investment strategy focused on Bitcoin. The company has been recognized as one of the largest corporate holders of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has set a precedent for other companies considering similar Bitcoin acquisition moves. However, naysayers mentioned that MicroStrategy’s strategy is no longer unique and mentioned Metaplanet, which also holds significant Bitcoin reserves . They also said that other major industry players and countries are signaling interest in the digital asset, which potentially hints at future shifts in market dynamics.

The change follows his departure from Consensys, where he played an important role in advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem. Given Resnick’s strong ties to Ethereum and growing enthusiasm for Solana, this unexpected decision has sparked debate in the cryptocurrency community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bet For Amazon? 5% Stake Proposal Raises Eyebrows Resnick wrote a blog post outlining his motivation for joining Solana, emphasizing his wish to become knowledgeable about the protocol’s main components, including consensus processes and fee markets. He clarified, “I want to get up to speed on the implementation details as soon as possible,” adding that his work might open the door for others to eventually help Solana flourish. Last week was my last week at Consensys. Today is my first day at @anza_xyz. I’m taking my talents to Solana.

He applauded Anza’s behind-the-scenes efforts, namely its contributions to network enhancements. “Those of you in Eth land may not have heard much from them, but they’ve been quietly shipping major improvements to the network over the past year,” Resnick pointed out. Resnick hasn’t completely given up Ethereum despite his transformation. Working as a Research Fellow at Consensys, he will keep providing advise and support. Resnick’s dual function suggests that he aims to cross knowledge between two important blockchain environments, therefore benefiting both communities over time. Solana Price Momentum Positive confidence has helped Solana’s market performance to progressively get better. SOL has risen 5.9%, to $225 within the past 24 hours. The altcoin has surged sharply since early November, surpassing levels of crucial resistance. SOL’s value jumped 215% during the past year, suggesting rising investor confidence. The slow rise in price suggests stronger technical structure and more market use. Analysts predict Solana’s momentum will keep on, especially with well-known people like Resnick on its development team. #Solana $SOL will hit $4,000, based on this cup and handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/dXZLI9urOh — Ali (@ali_charts) December 10, 2024 Related Reading: HBAR To Hit $100? Analyst Points To Utility And Market Cap Potential Differing Price Forecasts Still, forecasts of Solana’s eventual price vary widely.

This optimistic framework suggests that a breach above $260 would cause exponential increase. On the other hand, asset management Bitwise has set a more conservative price target of $750, citing macroeconomic variables and broader market patterns.

The Bitcoin enthusiast will now be part of the Trump administration that endorsed the crypto industry during the presidential election campaigns earlier this year. Following her recent appointment, pro-crypto Lana Negrete will serve the U.S. government as the mayor of Santa Monica. Her appointment means California will have its first-ever pro-Bitcoin Mayor.

In July, Negrete, who was the vice mayor at the time, led the campaign that established the office. During the Santa Monica City Council meeting held on July 9, the council unanimously approved 7-0 to establish a Santa Monica Bitcoin Office program at zero cost to the city. Lana Negrete highlighted that establishing the office was not about the asset itself or the commodity but about promoting Bitcoin education in the city and exploring industry partnerships, unemployment creation, and economic recovery. The office was set up by the now-appointed mayor in collaboration with Proof of Workforce, which manages the office from a non-profit perspective. Lana has joined a pro-crypto administration headed by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump appoints pro-crypto candidates in his administration Trump has already made several appointments involving pro-crypto candidates in major regulatory offices to form part of his administration. The appointments come as preparation made by the president-elect to deliver on the promises he made for the crypto community. Perhaps the most notable nomination was the one involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairperson. The president-elect announced on Truth Social that he had appointed Paul Atkins to be the next chair after Gary Gensler, who has officially resigned. Trump’s running mate and soon-to-be Vice President, JD Vance, is also renowned for being a crypto enthusiast. The 40-year-old has Bitcoin holdings worth between $250,000 and $500,000, according to CBS News . Trump also recently appointed former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks to serve as the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.” The appointment marked another significant step towards transforming U.S. policies in the technology space. The role will involve regulatory oversight of the crypto industry. Sacks reportedly owns digital assets such as Solana. His venture capital fund, Craft, has also exposed itself to the cryptocurrency space by investing in crypto companies Bitwise and BitGo. Trump also named Elon Musk the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, a department he created to control government spending and reduce wastage of resources. Musk is a well-known cryptographic figure. He is known to endorse the popular memecoin Dogecoin and once accepted crypto payments from Tesla buyers. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, his companies, Tesla and SpaceX , own 9,720 Bitcoin and 8,285 Bitcoin, respectively. Musk will work hand in hand with Howard Lutnick, who is also a major player in the crypto ecosystem. His firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, has managed Tether’s U.S. Treasury and bond portfolios since 2021.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-11 22:45:00

Here's Why This New Crypto Is Set To Outshine Shiba Inu,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/dogecoin-rally-heats-up-heres-why-this-new-crypto-is-set-to-outshine-shiba-inu,"A Dogecoin rally is reigniting excitement among crypto enthusiasts as DOGE signals bullish patterns ahead of the anticipated Santa rally. Dogecoin eyes a potential 300% surge this December, but a new crypto quietly positions itself to outshine even Shiba Inu. Combining tangible utility with market-defying growth, this emerging contender could redefine the GambleFi landscape. A New Crypto Challenges the Meme Coin Giants While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rally on historical patterns and ecosystem updates, a new cryptois quietly emerging as a force to be reckoned with. Leveraging innovative utility and a unique value proposition, this rising star is poised to disrupt the crypto markets globally. This project, built on a GambleFi ecosystem, delivers immediate rewards through weekly profit distributions. Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, this new crypto doesn’t rely on speculative sentiment but offers tangible returns. With its presale already raising over $7 million and tokens priced at just $0.041, early investors are seizing the opportunity. Deflationary tokenomics, which burn 60% of repurchased tokens while redistributing 40% to stakers, ensure sustainable growth and consistent returns. These features set the stage for this new crypto to not only compete with but potentially outshine meme coin giants. Dogecoin’s Momentum Points to a December Breakout Analysts draw comparisons between this Dogecoin rally and its remarkable 2017 December surge of over 300%. Currently trading at $0.404, DOGE has seen an impressive 60% rise over the past month. If the price breaks above $0.44, analysts believe it could pave the way for a move to $0.50, with the $1 mark potentially within reach by early 2025. December has historically been a favorable month for Dogecoin, with an average gain of 24.3%. This trend further supports optimism for the weeks ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for DOGE currently stands at 63, signaling continued bullish momentum. Additionally, analysts emphasize Bitcoin’s performance as a critical factor; the break above $100,000 for BTC could amplify enthusiasm across the crypto market, benefiting Dogecoin significantly. Adding to this optimism are whale activities and growing speculation about a potential DogecoinETF in 2025. Shiba Inu Builds Strength Amid Ecosystem Updates A bullish triangle pattern fueled a rise for SHIB and the anticipated Shibarium update promises to further bolster its ecosystem. On-chain data reveals that a significant portion of SHIB holders remain profitable, indicating strong investor confidence. This minimizes the likelihood of panic selling, even in the face of market fluctuations. Analysts highlight $0.000035 as a crucial resistance level, with a potential breakout unlocking further price growth. Meanwhile, the Shibarium update, designed to enhance security and scalability, positions SHIBas a competitive force in the meme coin sector. Despite its recent rally, overbought conditions—reflected in an RSI of 73—suggest a possible consolidation phase before the next upward movement. Balancing Speculation and Utility The Dogecoin rally and Shiba Inu’s bullish momentum highlight the meme coin sector's enduring appeal. However, the rise of this new crypto introduces a fresh dimension—combining immediate financial rewards with long-term value. For investors seeking to diversify their portfolios, the current market offers a spectrum of opportunities: Dogecoin for historical momentum, Shiba Inu for ecosystem growth, and this new crypto for innovative utility. Together, these projects define the evolving dynamics of the crypto market, offering both speculative gains and sustainable returns.

In a post on X, Martinez reported that 342 new wallets holding more than 100 BTC were created as Bitcoin dipped from $104,000 to around $90,000. According to Martinez, whales are buying every dip as a sign of their strong bullishness about Bitcoin. He added that the price correction is merely a test of investors’ resilience, and those who took advantage are best positioned to ride the next wave. He said : “This correction is a test of resilience, and if you play it right, you’ll be positioned to ride the next wave. This is how the 1% operates—buying fear while the rest of the market hesitates.” Meanwhile, whales’ acquisition during the dip is not completely surprising. Crypto analyst Mac_D observed that Coinbase Premium surged while the Bitcoin price fell. Coinbase Premium describes the percentage difference between the price of BTC on Coinbase Pro and Binance, usually indicating the time when US institutional investors are buying. The rebound in the Premium implies that US investors buy heavily when there are massive sell-offs on Binance. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium surged as price fell – (Source: CryptoQuant) The analyst noted: “This rebound suggests that when excessive panic selling occurs on Binance, which has a higher proportion of small investors, U.S. institutional investors are likely to adopt an aggressive buying strategy.” Interestingly, Bitcoin is not the only asset investors bought because of its dip. Onchain data also show that whales bought more than 100 million XRP as the token price fell due and retail sold in panic. Analysts predictions come true as crypto prices rebound Meanwhile, the dip now appears to be over for now, as almost every crypto asset has seen a surge in price over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin which fell as low as around $94,000 is now back above $101,000 after over 6% increase in its value. With the rise in Bitcoin price, every other major cap token has followed, with XRP seeing the most gains in 24 hours at 18%, according to CoinMarketCap. SOL also increased by 10%, while BNB, DOGE, and ADA added 5%, 8%, and 13%, respectively. Most analysts who predicted the rebound were not surprised. According to Santiment analysts on December 10, the FUD among traders who expect Bitcoin to drop below $90,000 is a positive sign of incoming retail capitulation. This is a good sign, as prices tend to move against market expectations. They wrote: “FUD is beginning to appear amongst traders. With some calls for $80K-$89K appearing across social media from the crowd once again, take this as a positive sign that retail capitulation is returning. Prices move the opposite direction of crowd expectation, meaning fear is generally necessary for prices to rebound.” However, Cryptoquant founder Ki Young Ju explained the quick rebound, noting that price corrections for BTC will be relatively small in this bull cycle. He attributes this to steady demand from institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This has been the least volatile Bitcoin bull cycle (Source: Glassnode) Glassnode data also supports this, with analysts noting that the average drawdown since 2022 is -7.68% compared to -16.24% overall. The maximum drawdown for this cycle is only -26.25%, far smaller than the -71.15% between 2011 and 2013. This shows that this cycle has been the least volatile for Bitcoin. Bitcoin bull cycle expected to last longer as distribution continues With Bitcoin returning to over $100,000 again, there are already some concerns about how long the good times will last. Experts at Glassnode believe the bull cycle is still in the mid-to-late stage with the potential for more price increases. They noted that cyclical long-term holders (LTH), excluding the ultra LTH who have held for over seven years, now have less than 50% of the BTC supply. Generally, these LTHs hold the majority of BTC at the beginning of the bull cycle, and by the peak, their supply has dropped, and short-term holders (STH) have around 70% – 80%. Although the ETFs have changed the dynamics to some extent, STH still only holds around 50%, far below the over 80% they had when the market peaked in 2021. However, the level of distribution has increased over the last 30 days, with the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio dropping to 3.78, which is the lowest it’s been this cycle. The decline in the Mean Investment Age suggests the Bull Cycle is still on – (Source: Santiment) Meanwhile, Santiment data shows that the Mean Dollar Invested Age has been declining. This metric, which determines how long a wallet has held an asset, has fallen 31% in 60 weeks for Bitcoin, 22% in 14 weeks for XRP, and 31% in eight weeks for Dogecoin. The fact that coins in wallets are getting younger means that there is distribution, and historically, a bull market only ends when the mean age starts increasing.

As PropiChain gains momentum, the stage 1 presale has already sold out 94% of its tokens, setting the stage for an explosive future. You might also like: PropiChain’s token presale surges as investors seek 10,000x gains XRP price rally: 24,544% ROI in the horizon A recent analysis by Crypto expert Cryptobilbuwoo0 signals a strong rally for XRP price driven by the token’s impressive performance since early November. XRP price has jumped through several critical levels, including $0.64, $0.915, $1.13, and $1.612, signaling an upward trajectory. Similarly, experts forecast that XRP price could reach an ambitious target of $6.25 and $26.6 shortly. Predictions show that the XRP price could jump further to $50, $113.13, and even $589 if it maintains the bullish momentum. This prediction has boosted investor confidence in the future potential of XRP price. Regulatory clarity could further boost the XRP price performance. Consequently, if the XRP’s SEC litigation is resolved, a similar growth will follow, making XRP a great player in the crypto market. The XRP price is $2.25 at press time, just 35% of its all-time high. If the token breaks out beyond this level, XRP price could surge even higher, cementing XRP’s place in the current crypto bull run. PropiChain: The hidden altcoin that could outshine XRP’s 24,544% gains While the XRP price is undeniably impressive, PropiChain is garnering investor attention with the potential to deliver double the returns of XRP. PropiChain is breaking barriers in the blockchain space with its unique solutions for the trillion-dollar real estate market. By addressing real-world problems in property investment and management, PropiChain stands out in the crypto market. At the heart of PropiChain’s value proposition is fractional property ownership, which democratizes access to the lucrative real estate market. PropiChain users can purchase a fraction of high-end properties to diversify their portfolios and access lucrative investments without hefty capital requirements. Again, PropiChain stands out for its automated valuation models that offer accurate valuation of properties. This enables investors to buy or sell properties at fair market value. Accurate property valuations reduce risks to buyers and sellers. Also, PropiChain integrates artificial intelligence to help investors make informed decisions. The platform provides real-time market analysis and property valuations, which makes it easy for investors to jump on emerging opportunities. Adding to its appeal, PropiChain integrates with the Metaverse to create a futuristic immersive experience for users. Using the Metaverse, investors can take virtual tours of potential investment properties and walk through them from their homes. This breaks down geographical barriers while giving investors a firsthand view of a prospective asset. Security and trust is the cornerstone of PropiChain’s architecture. Similarly, BlockAudit has thoroughly audited the platform’s smart contract to confirm it’s free from vulnerabilities. Similarly, investors are assured that the platform adheres to high-security standards. Again, the recent listing of PropiChain on CoinMarketCap enhances the credibility and accessibility of the token. Similarly, for the token to be listed on a prominent platform like CoinMarketCap is a great milestone, which shows that the best is yet to come. PropiChain presale: Limited time offer As the XRP price prepares for a historic rally, PropiChain emerges as a token that can double those gains. With a groundbreaking approach to real estate and unmatched ROI potential, PropiChain is the next big thing in crypto. The PropiChain presale is a golden opportunity for early investors, with 94% of tokens already sold out, raising over $1.3 million in the first round. The tokens are priced at $0.004, the lowest it will ever be, signaling the perfect time for you to secure a position in this revolutionary project. If someone invests an initial investment of $1,000, their investment will be worth almost $500,000 upon hitting the target price. As the demand increases and the Stage 1 presale nears completion, this rare opportunity to invest at such a low price quickly slips away.

XRP Price: Analyst Predicts Surge To $7 Amid Recent Rally And Whale Activity Recently, the XRP price witnessed a major rally, leading to speculations of a $7 target by a Wall Street analyst. Over the past month, the XRP price has increased by over 300% on the monthly charts, marking a high for XRP since its last rally in 2021. Based on the Wall Street analyst, a win against the SEC could see the XRP price increase over $7, passing the all-time high XRP price of $3.84 in January 2018. Moreover, recent whale transactions suggest the potential for a new all-time high in this bull run. According to data from CoinGecko, Ripple’s XRP has a market cap of $137 billion with a daily trading volume of $13 billion. As of the time of this writing, XRP price is trading at $2.40. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale For Outstanding Gains WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently carrying its ICO, with its native token selling for a low price of $0.0241 .

In a new filing, the regulatory agency says it’s seeking comments from the public on Bitwise’s new exchange-traded fund (ETF), which would hold a combination of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), to advance its application. “Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether the proposed rule change is consistent with the [law].” In a thread on the social media platform X, Bitwise stated its goal with the dual ETP was to simultaneously give traders easy access to the two biggest digital assets by market cap. “NYSE Arca filed to list a Bitwise ETP that would hold both spot Bitcoin and Ether, weighted by market cap. The goal: give investors balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in the world in an easy-to-access format.” Spot market ETFs allow investors to expose themselves to specific assets, such as precious metals or crypto, without the need to actually purchase them. In the filing, the SEC notes that the new ETP “will operate in materially the same manner as the Spot Bitcoin ETPs and Spot Ether ETPs previously approved by the Commission.” Bitwise first announced its plan to launch a BTC and ETH ETF in November when it filed an S-1 registration statement with the SEC. BTC and ETH are trading for $100,786 and $3,890 at time of writing respectively.

The decision came just weeks after the court heard Nvidia’s appeal and days after China announced an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker. Source: supremecourt.gov Crypto Crash Fallout: Nvidia Faces Investor Lawsuit Over Alleged Misstatements On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would no longer decide on a lawsuit accusing Nvidia of misrepresenting its reliance on the cryptocurrency mining industry. In a brief unsigned opinion, the court dismissed the case as “improvidently granted,” indicating it was a mistake to take up the matter. No justices dissented from the decision. This dismissal upholds a prior appeals court ruling, which allowed most of the case against Nvidia to proceed. The lawsuit dates back to 2018, when a Swedish investment firm filed the complaint after a downturn in cryptocurrency profitability caused Nvidia’s revenue to fall short of expectations. This led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock value. Investors allege that Nvidia downplayed its reliance on crypto-related revenue, misleading the market. The plaintiffs argue Nvidia misrepresented its reliance on the crypto market, inflating its stock value. Nvidia argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, a law designed to curb baseless securities complaints. The company argued that the plaintiffs failed to meet two key requirements: identifying specific false statements and providing sufficient evidence that company officials knowingly misled investors. While a district court initially dismissed the case, a federal appeals court later reinstated it. The Biden administration supported the plaintiffs, further raising the case’s profile. The Supreme Court’s decision avoids setting a precedent on how the 1995 law should be applied, leaving the appeals court’s interpretation as the guiding standard for now. As a result, the case against Nvidia will proceed. China’s Antitrust Investigation: Will Nvidia’s Growth Face New Roadblocks? The decision resembles a similar move in November when the Supreme Court dismissed a securities fraud case against Facebook. That case centered on allegations that Facebook failed to disclose a data breach that allowed Cambridge Analytica to collect user information. Like the Nvidia case, the dismissal upheld an appeals court ruling, enabling the lawsuit to proceed. In 2022, Nvidia paid the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a $5.5 million fine to settle charges of failing to disclose that crypto mining was a key driver of revenue growth for its gaming graphics cards. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Despite the legal challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the technology sector. Its stock price has surged by 180% this year, driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence market. Nvidia’s chips are essential for training and running AI systems, making it a crucial player in the industry. Adding to Nvidia’s challenges, China recently launched an antitrust investigation into the company. The probe raises questions about potential violations of Chinese antimonopoly laws, intensifying scrutiny as Nvidia continues its rapid growth. This lawsuit is part of a broader trend of high-profile class-action cases against tech companies. The Supreme Court recently dismissed another appeal by Meta, Facebook’s parent company, which sought to block a multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit over privacy breaches related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

According to a Proof of Workforce X post, the Kenya National Fire Brigades Association (KENFIBA) has completed setting up its Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. That move makes KENFIBA the country’s pioneering workers’ body to have BTC on its balance sheet. It may also be the first labor union to hold a BTC reserve in Africa. BTC reserve will enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity KENFIBA pulled off that feat courtesy of “get off zero” funding by Proof of Workforce, a nonprofit that helps workers and their unions invest in BTC. The donor said the crypto fund would help enhance Kenya’s firefighting capacity. The X post read: KENFIBA, The Kenya National Fire Brigades Association, adds Bitcoin onto their balance sheet, becoming the first labor union in Kenya to hold Bitcoin! Potentially, the first labor union on the continent to hold Bitcoin. ~ Proof of Workforce But, one X user, James Otudor challenged Proof of Workforce’s second statement. He held that the Academic Staff Union of a renowned Nigerian University had a BTC reserve before KENFIBA. We couldn’t independently verify Mr Otudor’s claims. What will KENFIBA gain from setting up a BTC reserve? Proof of Workforce’s advisor, Magdalena Gronowska, explained the significance of the collaboration. She said that through it, KENFIBA would enhance its hiring process, member sign-up, and emergency responses. She added that the two institutions had discussed how workers could gain from holding BTC. Also, the deal will see KENFIBA management accessing visionary Bitcoin developers in the country. These BTC developers are local Kenyans who will provide the union and its membership with tools, education, and resources to run the reserve. Africa is making big strides in adopting blockchain, cryptocurrency, and AI technology. That’s evidenced by the growing number of the continent’s governments setting up structures to support the uptake of these evolving technologies. Countries like Egypt, Senegal, Algeria, Rwanda, Benin, and Mauritius have officially sanctioned AI programs. Meanwhile, Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria, South Africa, are among many that have instituted policies to spur developments in those technological fields.

Exec Fostered Altcoin Slush Fund, Prosecutors Explain The younger Kim appealed the verdict at the High Court. But his legal team failed to convince the court to change his sentence. He was found guilty of conspiring with Arowana Tech, an IT startup that had received substantial Hancom backing, to create a slush fund using the former’s Arowana (ARW) tokens. The District Court found the younger Kim guilty of breach of trust violations under the Specific Economic Crime Aggravated Punishment Act. A branch of the Suwon District Court. (Source: Yonhap TV News/YouTube/Screenshot) The same court also sentenced a 48-year-old Arowana Tech executive surnamed Jeong to two and a half years in prison. iNews24 reported that the Suwon High Court’s Criminal Division dismissed appeals from the younger Kim and Jeong’s legal teams on December 11. It also dismissed counterarguments from the prosecution, who asked the court to extend the jail sentences. Prosecutors had also also asked the High Court to impose further fines on the duo. The presiding High Court judge said: “It is hard to say that the District Court’s sentencing was anything other than reasonable. And there appears to be no reason to change the sentence.

The prosecution service also accused Hancom With, Hancom’s blockchain arm, of conspiring with Arowana Tech to “manipulate” ARW prices. Prosecutors claimed that the defendants traded Arowana tokens between 2021 and 2022 to raise money for the “slush fund.” The coin rose in value suddenly on April 20, 2021, after it was listed on domestic crypto exchanges. It has since been delisted, but its meteoric x1,075 rise drew immediate suspicion from investigators. The token’s price shot up from $0.035 to just under $38 within the space of just 30 minutes after it was listed. The prosecution has argued that the younger Kim “and others” had “the authority” to “withdraw” ARW tokens.

The prosecution is also hopeful of bringing the senior Kim to trial. In July, the service applied for an arrest warrant . But a court dismissed the application. The ruling judge explained that the senior Kim did not “pose a flight risk.” Korea's rich and powerful families are facing a revolt of their own as the country reels from the political fallout over a brief martial law.

Qubetics Surpasses 305M Tokens Sold While Cardano And Fantom Make Noise,https://thecoinrise.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-for-2025-qubetics-surpasses-305m-tokens-sold-while-cardano-and-fantom-make-noise/,"Are you keeping up with the latest buzz in crypto? Cardano and Fantom have been making noise with exciting developments, and everyone’s asking: which are the best altcoins to buy for 2025? But wait—there’s a new player in town. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a project already raising eyebrows with its innovative tech and presale tally of over $5.5 million. While established players like Cardano are streamlining blockchain ecosystems and Fantom is chasing life-changing gains, Qubetics offers something fresh—a solution to privacy concerns and scalability issues with its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Could this be the one that redefines decentralised tech? Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out. Qubetics: The Rising Star Solving Real-World Problems Qubetics is creating waves for all the right reasons. The project, now in its 12th presale stage, has already sold over 305 million $TICS tokens, with a growing community of more than 8,400 token holders. At a presale price of just $0.0311, this could be a golden opportunity for early adopters. So, why is Qubetics special? It tackles one of the most pressing issues in today’s digital landscape: online privacy. Centralised VPNs often compromise user security and restrict data access. Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) that offers secure, private, and unrestricted internet usage. Think about it—how often have you worried about your data being exploited or your privacy being breached? Qubetics ensures you don’t have to. For better guidance, please watch this video . Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer Blockchain scalability has always been a headache. Qubetics’ infrastructure ensures seamless transaction processing without bottlenecks, something many predecessors failed to achieve. Blockchain apps can feel like rocket science to newcomers. Qubetics simplifies this with intuitive tools like the QubeQode IDE, making blockchain tech accessible to developers and users alike. Crypto analysts have set high expectations for Qubetics, with potential prices of $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. For perspective, a $1,000 investment at the presale price of $0.0311 could net over $300,000 if these predictions hold true. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a practical solution to real-world problems. And with its presale success, it’s clear the market sees its potential. Cardano: The Eco-Friendly Blockchain Leader Cardano, often called the “green blockchain,” has been a market favourite for years. Its unique Proof-of-Stake mechanism offers an energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin’s energy-hungry Proof-of-Work system. But that’s not all—Cardano’s smart contract functionality continues to attract developers, making it one of the most versatile platforms out there. Recent updates suggest a bright future. According to Binance, Cardano’s developments include faster transaction speeds and enhanced decentralisation. Analysts predict a potential rally that could make ADA a hot pick for 2025. But will it outperform Qubetics? Only time will tell. Fantom: The Fast and Scalable Blockchain Fantom has been making waves with its high-speed, low-cost blockchain solutions. Known for its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, Fantom provides near-instant transaction finality, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises. Crypto-News-Flash recently highlighted Fantom’s potential to deliver 100x gains, especially with the growing interest in DeFi and AI integrations. However, scalability remains a challenge for Fantom, and projects like Qubetics could steal the spotlight with more comprehensive solutions. Conclusion While Cardano and Fantom offer compelling features, Qubetics is carving a niche by solving fundamental issues like online privacy, scalability, and accessibility. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) and user-friendly QubeQode IDE set it apart in a crowded market. The presale numbers speak for themselves—over 305 million tokens sold and counting. With analysts predicting prices of $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, there’s undeniable potential for life-changing gains. A $1,000 investment today could redefine your portfolio by 2025. So, are you ready to secure your slice of the future? Don’t miss out—join the Qubetics revolution before the presale ends. Invest in Qubetics Today and be part of the next crypto success story!

According to Arkham Intelligence X’s post on Dec. 12, BlackRock and Fidelity acquired more than half of a billion dollars in Ethereum ( ETH ) in the past two days. This transaction was made through Coinbase Prime. “PAST 48 HOURS: BLACKROCK AND FIDELITY BOUGHT OVER HALF A BILLION USD OF ETH,” Arkham mentioned on post It also shows that the two ETF issuers are taking more action in their portfolio by acquiring more Ether after receiving approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) in May. iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) from BlackRock is the largest issuer, with a total inflow of up to $2.93 billion. Along with Fidelity, this crypto-product has received inflow up to 8 days in a row. Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) is the second-largest issuer, with a total inflow of up to $1.35 billion.

Kraken, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, added these tokens to its platform on December 11, 2024. The listing has brought newfound attention to these meme coins, with their prices surging amid broader market gains. Kraken’s move to list FWOG, GOAT, and SPX marks a growing trend of meme coins being adopted by major exchanges. This development also signals increasing mainstream interest in Solana-based tokens. As more exchanges add meme coins to their offerings, many crypto enthusiasts view these listings as a bullish signal for the broader market. Kraken’s Addition of FWOG, GOAT, and SPX The Kraken exchange announced that it would begin supporting spot trading for FWOG, GOAT , and SPX on December 11. These tokens join a growing list of meme coins available on the platform, expanding Kraken’s cryptocurrency offerings. The exchange had previously included FWOG, GOAT, and SPX in its listing roadmap, with the goal of enabling users to trade these tokens. FWOG and GOAT are native to the Solana blockchain, while SPX is another meme token also now available for trading on Kraken. As of press time, GOAT has seen a 24.25% increase in value, FWOG is up by 12.95%, and SPX has risen by 7.81%. The price surges of these coins are likely tied to the Kraken listing, although a market-wide rise in meme coins may have contributed to these gains as well. Meme Coin Surge Driven by Broader Market Trends The price increases of FWOG, GOAT, and SPX align with a general rise in meme coin values across the market. Meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Floki have experienced similar growth as major exchanges have added them to their listings. While the Kraken listing might have sparked some of the recent price increases, broader market trends in the meme coin sector likely played a significant role in driving these tokens’ values higher. Concurrently, some analysts believe the surge in meme coin prices could be linked to increased attention on the market after U.S. political events, including the re-election of former President Donald Trump. This event has been credited with encouraging the wider adoption of digital assets in the U.S. market. However, users in several countries, including the Netherlands (NL), Spain (ES), Ireland (IE), Belgium (BE), Italy (IT), and Germany (DE), are currently unable to access these tokens on the Kraken platform. Market Sentiment Around Meme Coins Subsequently, Kraken’s listing of these Solana-based tokens follows similar actions by other major platforms like Coinbase. Recently, Coinbase also added tokens such as Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and MOG COIN, both of which are part of the growing meme coin trend. Despite the price rallies, some in the cryptocurrency industry remain cautious about the growing popularity of meme coins. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has voiced concerns about the proliferation of meme coins, urging a focus on developing practical blockchain applications instead of pursuing purely speculative tokens. In an X post, CZ stated, “Let’s build real applications using blockchain,” while acknowledging that meme coins are becoming increasingly unpredictable.

Key support is holding strong at $10.88, while resistance looms at $12.99. Sustained bullish sentiment could drive the price toward the $13.00 level. Internet Computer (ICP) has shown a modest bullish movement on December 11, closing at $12.81, reflecting a 2.97% increase over the past 24 hours. The price action reveals a recovery after dipping to an intraday low of $10.88 before steadily climbing toward the current level. The ICP indicates strong buying interest near the $12.57 level, with a breakout above the $12.99 mark acting as a bullish trigger. The overall market sentiment suggests the potential for further upside if ICP maintains support above $10.88. The resistance level is around $12.99, and selling pressure could intensify. If the bulls sustain momentum, a breakout could lead ICP toward the $13.00 mark in the near term, signaling a continuation of the recovery trend. Internet Computer 1-day price chart: ICP displays resilience amid bullish rebound Internet Computer (ICP) shows signs of recovery, trading at $12.81 with a 2.97% gain over the last 24 hours. After retracing from a recent high near $12.71, the token found support around $10.88 and rebounded, indicating renewed buying interest. The current candlestick pattern suggests bullish momentum as ICP attempts to consolidate above the $12.00 level. However, a decisive breakout above the $12.99 resistance is required for sustained upward movement. ICP displays resilience amid bullish rebound The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 54.74, recovering from a brief dip into neutral territory and signaling that bullish momentum is regaining strength. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the signal line (0.909) above the MACD line (1.192), reflecting mild selling pressure that could limit immediate gains. A close watch on these indicators is essential as ICP moves within a critical consolidation zone, potentially setting the stage for a breakout or further sideways movement. Internet Computer 4-hour price chart: ICP seeks stability amid gradual recovery Internet Computer (ICP) is trading at $12.81, up 2.97% in the past 4 hours, signaling a gradual recovery after recent price dips. The token has rebounded from a key support level near $10.88, approaching minor resistance around $12.99. The price action suggests cautious optimism as bulls attempt to regain control, though the lack of strong momentum could limit immediate gains. ICP seeks stability amid gradual recovery The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.12, climbing from oversold levels near 31.90 but still reflecting neutral-to-bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, the MACD shows signs of narrowing bearish momentum, with the MACD line (-0.499) edging closer to the signal line (-0.583), suggesting a potential bullish crossover. If buying pressure increases, these indicators could support further upside; however, continued caution is warranted in the short term.

Its recent recovery suggests strong buying interest, with support levels holding near $10.88 and resistance at $12.99. Bullish sentiment is driving momentum, and a breakout above the resistance level could lead to testing the $13.00 level in the near term. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed. However, the market performance of ICP has been highly volatile, and its success depends heavily on the adoption of its technology and the broader market environment for cryptocurrencies.

The analyst made this prediction based on his wave analysis, which showed that XRP is still bullish. XRP Price To Hit New ATH At $5.85 In an X post, Dark Defender predicted that the XRP price could reach a new ATH of $5.85 based on his ABC wave analysis. The analyst stated that XRP set the ABC wave when the crypto was at Wave A. He further noted that XRP has bounced back from the $1.88 support level. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Here’s What The 91-Day Pattern Says Could Happen Next With this development, the analyst is confident that the XRP price rally to $5.85 has begun. The analyst recently revealed that a bull flag appeared on XRP’s weekly chart, which showed that the crypto could reach as high as $11 by early 2025. Based on his Elliot Wave theory, the analyst had also previously predicted that the XRP market top could be around $18. In the meantime, the goal is for the XRP price to surpass its current ATH of $3.80 and reach $5.85, as Dark Defender has predicted. XRP has witnessed a price correction following its parabolic rally of over 200% last month. However, the crypto looks well primed for its next leg up. From a fundamental perspective, the XRP price boasts a bullish outlook, especially following New York’s approval of the RLUSD stablecoin. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that exchange and partner listings are set to follow and that RLUSD will launch soon. This development caused the price to experience a significant bounce. Meanwhile, crypto analyst TheXRPguy listed the RLUSD launch as one of the events that market participants wait for before they consider selling their coins. The stablecoin launch would inject more liquidity into the XRP ecosystem, which could spark a significant surge in the XRP price. The Stars Are Aligning For XRP In an X post, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said that the stars are aligning for a massive bull run for the XRP price. He made this statement while alluding to the fact that experts predict that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could dismiss its appeal against Ripple when the new administration comes in. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Flash Crash To $94,000, But There’s A New Target He noted that the SEC lawsuit is the last “lone cloud” lingering above the XRP community. As such, dismissing the appeal could boost investors’ confidence in the crypto, providing a bullish outlook for the XRP price. CrediBULL Crypto suggested that XRP could reach as high as $10 in this bull run while stating that there should be more than one wave of upside remaining.

Inspired by the animated Netflix series Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix, the game will debut on Arbitrum. Ubisoft, known for publishing popular franchises like Assassin’s Creed and Just Dance, has featured a cast of characters from its previous titles, including Far Cry: Rayman, Assassin’s Creed, Blood Dragon, Beyond Good and Evil, The Crew, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, and Watch Dogs. Ubisoft has a free NFT mint for the game While gamers await the launch in a week, a free NFT mint is happening today. Niji Warrior, the games’ NFT collection, is launching today on the Magic Eden Marketplace . The NFT allows holders to make inputs into game mechanics, map designs, and storylines. Holders of these tokens will have access to exclusive perks and the leeway to participate in community governance. They could also evolve their NFTs based on how deeply they engage. Ubisoft’s Technical Director and Executive Producer, Didier Genevois, spoke on the project: This project represents a new frontier in collaborative game development, where players become co-creators. ~ Didier Genevois All the 10,000 Niji warrior NFTs portray a pixel of a robot or creature. The art is similar to the artwork for Warlords NFTs, released earlier by Ubisoft’s Champions Tactics last year. Web3 gaming continues to gain momentum The Web3 gaming space has taken an upward trajectory, and there are signs that it’s not stopping anytime soon. Non-fungible token sales have also been growing steadily since October. The first week of November was pleasing, as the sale volumes settled at $187 million. While NFTs are regaining attention, the Beam Foundation is preparing to launch a $150 million fund to improve Web3 gaming in Abu Dhabi. Although the NFT sector has been struggling for years after the 2021 NFT boom, Web3 gaming, and leisure-based apps have continued to show a bullish nature as we move towards 2025. Ubisoft’s entry into web3 gaming has been smooth due to how organized they were while venturing. The French firm included alpha and beta tests, which allowed users to give feedback, thus ensuring that game mechanics were well-balanced.

If you missed the FLOKI Inu hype train back in the day, here’s your shot at redemption. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is not just another meme coin; it’s attracting the bulls with its lucrative presale, already raising over $3.4 million and selling more than 50 billion coins to over 4,400 holders. At just $0.00012 in its 11th presale stage, BTFD promises massive gains for early investors. But why is BTFD creating such a buzz? For starters, it’s all about turning market dips into opportunities. With features like staking, a P2E game, and an incredibly loyal Bulls Squad community, BTFD is carving its place in the meme coin hall of fame. Let’s dive into why BTFD is set to dethrone FLOKI as the meme coin to watch. BTFD Coin: The Rise of the Dip-Seizing Movement The phrase “Buy the F***ing Dip” (BTFD) is a rallying cry in the crypto world, and BTFD Coin embodies this ethos like no other. Born from the concept of turning price dips into opportunities, BTFD Coin is designed for savvy investors who want to grab low-priced coins before the next market surge. The presale started at $0.000004 and has already climbed to $0.00012, showing an 11th-stage presale momentum that’s hard to ignore. With a total supply of 173 billion coins, BTFD is primed for scarcity-driven price growth. Imagine investing $1,800 today at $0.00012 per coin. You’d snag 15 million coins. By the time the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment will be worth $9,000. That’s a 400% gain without even factoring in potential bull-run profits. BTFD isn’t just about flipping coins; it’s about community and innovation. The Bulls Squad—a core group of crypto enthusiasts—drives engagement through memes, market insights, and community support. Plus, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game’s beta version is live. While rewards aren’t active yet, players are raving about the immersive experience and potential for future earnings. Staking is another big draw. With an average APY of 90%, BTFD rewards holders who play the long game. Stake $10,000 BTFD, and in a year, you could see your holdings nearly double. Combine that with the upcoming listing on major exchanges, and it’s clear why analysts are bullish on BTFD hitting $0.002 by late 2025. How to Buy BTFD The presale process is straightforward. For $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. If you’re holding Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, or Solana, you’re in luck. Just one Ethereum gets you 30,507,083 BTFD coins, while a single Bitcoin lands you over 813 million coins . The entry points are accessible, and the rewards are potentially massive. With over $3.4 million raised so far and only a few presale stages left, now’s the time to act. Don’t let FOMO keep you from securing your stake in the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale. FLOKI Inu: The Meme Coin You Wish You Hadn’t Missed FLOKI Inu emerged in 2021 as part of the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin frenzy. Named after Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu, FLOKI combined the power of internet culture with a solid community-driven approach. Early adopters saw astronomical returns, with FLOKI’s price skyrocketing by over 10,000% in its initial run. FLOKI’s roadmap has been anything but ordinary. From launching FlokiFi, its DeFi ecosystem, to developing Valhalla, a blockchain-based metaverse game, FLOKI has consistently delivered on its promises. Today, it’s trading at $0.00003456, boasting a market cap of $325 million. While the price may seem small, the returns for early investors were anything but. A modest $100 investment during FLOKI’s infancy could’ve turned into a small fortune. But as they say, hindsight is 20/20. Despite its success, FLOKI hasn’t been without challenges. The crypto market’s volatility and competition from newer meme coins have tempered its growth. Still, FLOKI remains a strong contender in the meme coin space, particularly with its push into NFTs and metaverse gaming. Why BTFD Could Be the Best Overall While FLOKI has already established itself, BTFD is just getting started. Its presale price offers incredible upside, and the project’s innovative features —from staking to its P2E game—are already generating buzz. With FLOKI, the ship might’ve sailed for 1,000x returns, but with BTFD, the journey is just beginning. The Verdict: Don’t Miss Out Again Cryptocurrency is about timing, and if FLOKI taught us anything, it’s that early birds truly get the worm. BTFD Coin’s presale is shaping up to be the Best Ongoing Meme Coin Presale of 2024, with analysts predicting explosive growth. Whether you’re looking to play the P2E game, stake your coins for long-term rewards, or simply ride the next meme coin wave, BTFD has something for everyone. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Sign up today and secure your stake before the presale ends. Your financial future might just thank you.

37523514,https://coingape.com/?p=228908,1733962797,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Stablecoin Market Hits Record $200B Milestone, $400B by 2025?",https://coingape.com/stablecoin-market-hits-record-200b-milestone-400b-by-2025/,"The stablecoin market has crossed a significant threshold, with its total market capitalization reaching $200 billion for the first time. This growth marks a sharp rise signaling the increasing adoption of these digital assets across various sectors. According to data from CCData and DefiLlama, the stablecoin market has added $10 billion in value in just two weeks, surpassing the $190 billion peak seen during the 2022 crypto market rally. Stablecoin Market Surpasses $200B, Poised to Double to $400B in 2025, Experts Say According to DefiLlama , the stablecoin market cap has surpassed $200 billion, driven by the ongoing crypto rally and increasing use cases beyond digital currencies. The growth of stablecoins has been fueled by a rise in crypto trading and the increasing adoption of non-crypto applications such as payments, remittances, and savings. This shift is particularly noticeable in regions with fragile financial systems and high inflation. Tether’s USDT has seen its market value soar to a record $139 billion. This represents a 12% increase in just one month, according to data from DefiLlama. Moreover, over 109 million on-chain wallets are holding USDT by Q4 2024, making it one of the most widely held digital assets. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin issued by Circle, has also grown, reaching nearly $41 billion in market value, up by 5% in the same period. Key Factors Driving Growth Several factors are contributing to the rapid expansion of the stablecoin market. One of the main drivers is the increasing integration in everyday financial systems, including remittances and peer-to-peer payment platforms. Stablecoins offer an alternative means of transferring value, especially in countries with depreciating local currencies. In addition, stablecoins are gaining traction as a yield-generating investment vehicle. New products like Ethena’s USDe token, which uses a strategy of shorting Bitcoin and Ether, have been increasingly popular. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has been recognized as an Accepted Virtual Asset by Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This milestone allows licensed entities to offer USDT-related services, supporting the UAE’s vision to become a global digital finance hub. Future Outlook: Market Could Reach $400B by 2025 Additionally, experts predict that the stablecoin market could grow even further, potentially reaching $400 billion by 2025. A report from asset manager Bitwise suggests that U.S. legislation could be a major catalyst for this growth. If the U.S. Congress passes clear regulatory frameworks, it would encourage more businesses and consumers to adopt them. This regulatory clarity will enable traditional financial institutions, like banks, to enter the cryptocurrency market. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon recently signaled the firm’s potential cryptocurrency expansion, dependent on regulatory shifts. The bank has built a digital asset infrastructure but remains constrained by legal limitations. Solomon indicated readiness to engage with Bitcoin and Ethereum if the regulatory environment is favorable. In addition, fintech companies are increasingly integrating stablecoins into their services, following the example set by PayPal with its PYUSD token. The use case expansion of global payments will continue, as it offers a stable alternative to volatile cryptos and traditional financial services. More so, reports from Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets suggest that stablecoins could eventually make up 10% of the U.S. money supply and foreign exchange transactions. This represents a substantial increase from the current 1% share.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-12 00:42:35

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 97,000 followers on the social media platform X that DOGE appears to be in the phase of the cycle when it pauses before skyrocketing to new record highs. The trader shares a chart suggesting that DOGE is mirroring its price action during the 2017 and 2021 market cycles while trading in a large ascending channel. “Check out where we are in the Dogecoin DOGE bull cycle! Very early, right? For that reason, I’m thankful for the dip and will buy more between $0.40-$0.30. The target remains $3, and if things go wild, $18!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.391, down nearly 5% on the day. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), Martinez says that the altcoin can find support at the $1 level based on the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric. IOMAP classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even, or losing money – to determine support and resistance levels for ADA. According to the metric, 41,720 addresses have accumulated over one billion ADA at $1. Source: Ali Martinez/X Zooming out, Martinez says Cardano appears to be following its 2020 price action when it witnessed a period of retracement before soaring to fresh highs. “Cardano is doing the same as it did in 2020, which is why I’m buying! Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is trading at $1.

For the Trump Organization’s vice president, the future of finance is Bitcoin, arguing that the crypto is a powerful hedge against the traditional financial system’s inefficiencies because of its decentralized quality and fixed supply of 21 million coins. “Bitcoin eliminates the need for tens of thousands of bankers pushing paperwork for exorbitant fees,” he added. More Accessible Financial Tool Eric noted that what makes Bitcoin successful as a global asset is its accessibility, adding that crypto does not need intermediaries such as banks or brokers in its transactions. Trump’s son stressed the global appeal of cryptocurrency and how user-friendly is the digital asset as compared to traditional real estate investments. “Unlike real estate, Bitcoin is not tied to geography. It’s global, instantly liquid. You can buy or sell it while having dinner with your spouse,” Eric explained. Moreover, Eric emphasized that Bitcoin could empower people in developing nations. “Bitcoin gives everybody the opportunity around the world to participate in ways they never otherwise would have thought, no matter their wealth, no matter their location,” he remarked.

Analyst Points To Utility And Market Cap Potential Trump Family To Support Bitcoin Eric vowed that his father and their entire family would continue to advocate cryptocurrency, pledging they would keep on playing an essential role in the global financial landscape. He remarked that his father, Donald Trump, helped fuel the recent surge in the alpha cryptocurrency, adding that he will lead the United States into the “digital revolution.” Eric Trump said that the people, governments, and institutions who embraced Bitcoin will become the biggest winners in the digital revolution.

After a sharp price decline, SOL found support at $205.5 and resumed its upward trajectory. It is poised to continue its upward momentum in the coming days. Solana (SOL) Bullish On-chain Metrics The on-chain metrics, trading volumes, and traders’ rising interest in the altcoin indicate that SOL is poised for short-term upside momentum. According to the on-chain analytics firm DefiLlama, traders’ interest and liquidity in the SOL chain appear to be rising. Data shows that SOL’s daily trading volume has skyrocketed from $2.91 billion on December 7, 2024, to $6 billion on December 11, 2024, reaching its highest level since November 2024.

Zignaly (ZIG) and Stacks (STX) are making headlines for their recent activity, including Stacks’s struggles with price declines amidst major upgrades and Zignaly’s innovative new features. At the same time, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with its revolutionary approach to crypto payments and digital asset management, showing massive potential to reshape the industry. For all the hype surrounding these coins, Qubetics stands out as a solution-oriented project tackling issues others have ignored. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, users can finally manage crypto as easily as fiat, simplifying payments and cross-border transactions. Plus, with its smart contract conversion mechanism, Qubetics aims to make crypto a mainstream payment method without the headache of volatility. Add to that its stellar presale performance (over $5.5M raised and counting), and it’s easy to see why early investors are jumping in. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionizing Digital Transactions Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin trying to ride the wave—it’s rewriting the playbook. At its core is a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, designed to make crypto payments as intuitive as swiping a card. Whether you’re team Apple Pay or Google Pay, this wallet lets you make everyday transactions with crypto just as easily. One of Qubetics’ coolest features? Its smart contract conversion mechanism. Picture this: you’re at a coffee shop, paying for your latte with Ethereum, but the shop only accepts USD. With Qubetics, your crypto converts to fiat automatically, instantly, and securely—no fuss, no extra fees. Let’s break it down. Take Josh, for example—a small business owner who wants to accept crypto but doesn’t want to deal with market volatility. With Qubetics, Josh gets paid in his preferred currency, hassle-free. Now imagine Clara, a digital nomad working abroad. She uses Qubetics for cross-border transactions, avoiding hefty transfer fees and long delays. Currently, $TICS is in Presale Phase 12, priced at $0.0311. Over 8,400 holders have snapped up 305M tokens, raising more than $5.5M so far. With a 10% price hike every week and a post-presale target price of $0.25, early investors are looking at a potential 900% ROI. If you’ve been waiting for the perfect crypto play, now’s the time to jump on board. Zignaly (ZIG): Empowering Everyday Investors Zignaly has always been about leveling the playing field for crypto traders, and their latest moves are no exception. Zignaly’s social investing platform allows users to follow expert traders and copy their strategies—a huge win for newbies who don’t have time to deep-dive into charts. But what’s the real kicker? Zignaly’s profit-sharing model means you only pay a fee if your chosen trader earns you money. That’s transparency and accountability rolled into one! This month, Zignaly has been ramping up with new features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its reach. Imagine this: Lisa is a college student dabbling in crypto. She uses Zignaly to follow seasoned traders, growing her portfolio while focusing on her studies. The platform’s hands-free approach is perfect for folks who want to get into crypto without becoming full-time traders. With its focus on user-friendly investing and continued innovation, Zignaly is shaping up to be a strong contender for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. As its user base grows and its ZIG token gains more utility, this one’s worth watching closely. Stacks (STX): Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential While Bitcoin is the granddaddy of crypto, it’s not exactly known for its flexibility. That’s where Stacks comes in. Built on the Bitcoin network, Stacks uses smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) to bring new functionality to the OG blockchain. The big news? Stacks recently rolled out the Nakamoto Upgrade, which reduces transaction times and boosts scalability. This upgrade is a game-changer, making Stacks faster and more efficient. However, the price of STX has faced headwinds recently, partly due to market-wide corrections and competition in the Layer-2 space. Take Emma, a digital artist who’s started selling her NFTs on a Stacks-powered dApp. She loves how the platform lets her keep full control of her work and earn royalties automatically. Meanwhile, businesses are exploring Stacks’s smart contracts to streamline supply chains and other operations. Despite its current challenges, Stacks’s tech advancements make it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, especially for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term dominance. If Stacks can overcome short-term market hurdles, its future looks bright. Your Move, Crypto Investor So, what’s the takeaway? Qubetics ($TICS) is a trailblazer, turning crypto payments into something even your grandma could use. Zignaly (ZIG) is empowering regular folks to grow their wealth with minimal effort. And Stacks (STX) is unlocking new possibilities for Bitcoin, even as it weathers some market turbulence. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Zignaly (ZIG), and Stacks (STX) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. These projects are innovating, growing, and setting the stage for a very bullish year ahead. Don’t wait—get in while the getting’s good!

Here’s Why Qubetics Could Be Your Ticket to the Next Big Crypto Jackpot!,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-ethereums-rise-heres-why-qubetics-could-be-your-ticket-to-the-next-big-crypto-jackpot/,"Ethereum has been making headlines yet again. As the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, Ethereum has proven it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. With its continuous upgrades, expanding ecosystem, and adoption by big players, it’s no surprise Ethereum has cemented its place as a giant in the crypto world. But let’s be real: if you didn’t jump on the Ethereum train early, those massive gains feel like a distant dream. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary project that’s turning heads with its presale success and unique focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation (RWA). While Ethereum paved the way for decentralized apps and smart contracts, Qubetics is stepping up to solve real-world problems, creating opportunities for both crypto enthusiasts and everyday people. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): Your Second Chance at Crypto Gold Missed the Ethereum craze? No sweat. Qubetics is here to give you another shot at life-changing gains. As the world’s first web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just riding the crypto wave—it’s making waves of its own. Focused on bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds, Qubetics enables users to tokenise real-world assets. Imagine transforming your property, artwork, or intellectual property into blockchain-based tokens. It’s not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. Here’s the exciting part: Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 12, with $TICS tokens priced at just $0.0311. Over 305 million tokens have already been sold, and the presale has raised a whopping $5.5 million. With over 8,400 holders on board, the buzz around Qubetics is impossible to ignore. And with each phase increasing the token price by 10%, this is the moment to act. By the time the presale ends, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25, offering early investors a staggering 900% ROI. But Qubetics isn’t just about numbers. It’s about impact. Whether you’re a small business owner tokenising assets for funding or an artist selling digital creations globally, Qubetics provides the tools to make it happen. It’s not just another crypto project—it’s a solution for the real world. Ethereum: The Trailblazer There’s no denying Ethereum’s place in the crypto hall of fame. Known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ethereum revolutionized the blockchain world when it launched in 2015. It introduced a whole new way of thinking about cryptocurrency—not just as a store of value, but as a programmable network. Ethereum’s journey hasn’t been without challenges, from high gas fees to network congestion. However, its recent transition to Ethereum 2.0 has been a game-changer, improving scalability and reducing energy consumption. Ethereum remains the go-to platform for developers, with countless projects building on its robust infrastructure. But here’s the catch: much like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s early days of astronomical returns are behind us. While it remains a strong investment for those seeking stability, the kind of explosive growth that made millionaires overnight is harder to come by. For investors looking for the next Ethereum-sized opportunity, it’s time to look elsewhere. Why Qubetics Offers What Ethereum Once Did Remember when Ethereum was the new kid on the block, promising transformative technology and massive returns? That’s exactly where Qubetics is right now. Just like Ethereum disrupted the way we think about crypto, Qubetics is doing the same by tokenising real-world assets. Here’s the kicker: while Ethereum’s ecosystem is vast, its primary focus is on digital applications. Qubetics, on the other hand, is grounded in real-world utility. It’s not just for developers or tech enthusiasts—it’s for everyone. From entrepreneurs raising capital to artists protecting their creations, Qubetics is opening doors that Ethereum never could. And let’s not forget the presale advantage. Ethereum’s early adopters reaped the rewards, but most of us missed that boat. With Qubetics, you’re getting in at the ground floor, with massive growth potential still ahead. Analysts predict $TICS could climb well beyond its post-presale price, making it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone chasing significant returns. Real-Life Scenarios: How Qubetics Makes an Impact Let’s put it into perspective. Imagine a struggling small-town bookstore owner tokenising their rare collection to attract investors and keep the doors open. Or picture a freelance designer in Chicago using Qubetics to turn their portfolio into a tokenised asset, enabling them to sell rights without losing ownership. It’s not just about profits—it’s about empowerment. For businesses, professionals, and individuals alike, Qubetics offers a lifeline. It’s about taking assets that were once illiquid and turning them into opportunities. This isn’t just crypto—it’s the future of finance. And with the presale still ongoing, there’s no better time to secure your stake in this revolutionary project. Conclusion Ethereum showed us what’s possible in the world of blockchain. It built a foundation, set the standard, and changed the game. But if you missed out on its meteoric rise, you don’t have to dwell on what could’ve been. Qubetics is your chance to get in on the next big thing, a project with the potential to surpass expectations and deliver life-changing gains. With its focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation, accessible presale pricing, and incredible growth potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy in December 2024 . Don’t sit on the sidelines and watch another opportunity pass you by. Join the Qubetics presale today and be part of a revolution. The future is calling—are you ready to answer?

Stacks (STX) is making waves with its recent upgrades, despite a dip in price, while Kaspa (KAS) continues to impress with its bullish momentum and innovative tech stack. Both coins are trending among top performers, drawing attention from investors and traders alike. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a presale campaign that’s smashing records, solidifying its reputation as a game-changer in the digital payments space. While Kaspa and Stacks are each carving out their niche in the crypto space, Qubetics is tackling some of the most persistent problems in crypto. With its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and a suite of innovative features, Qubetics is simplifying how people use and manage digital assets. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics has raised $5.5M from over 8,400 holders, and the momentum isn’t slowing down. Let’s dive into why these three projects deserve a spot on your watchlist for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): A Giant Leap for Crypto Payments Qubetics is here to shake up how we handle digital payments. At the heart of the project is its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, designed to make crypto transactions as simple as swiping a card . Whether you’re a die-hard Apple Pay user or swear by Google Pay, Qubetics has you covered. Here’s the real kicker: Qubetics integrates a smart contract conversion mechanism that automatically converts crypto to fiat at the point of sale . This feature is a game-changer for businesses and consumers alike. Say goodbye to price volatility and complicated conversions. Imagine you’re at a local café that only accepts USD, but you want to pay in Bitcoin. Qubetics handles the conversion instantly, so your coffee gets paid for without any extra steps. Take Sarah, for instance. She runs a boutique and loves that Qubetics ensures her customers can pay with any crypto while she receives her earnings in dollars, free of market swings. Or think about Jake, a freelance designer working with clients across the globe. He uses Qubetics to get paid quickly without dealing with wire transfer fees or delays. Currently, $TICS is priced at $0.0311, with a 10% price increase set to kick in soon. With over 305M tokens sold, investors are eyeing the post-presale price of $0.25, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI. If you’re looking for a crypto project with real-world utility and explosive growth potential, Qubetics should be your top pick. Stacks (STX): Building on Bitcoin’s Foundation Stacks (STX) is taking Bitcoin to the next level by enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on its blockchain. This innovation adds layers of functionality to Bitcoin’s rock-solid foundation, making it more than just a store of value. The recent Nakamoto Upgrade is a big deal. It decouples Stacks’ block production from Bitcoin’s block times, making transactions faster and more scalable. This upgrade couldn’t have come at a better time, as demand for efficient blockchain networks continues to grow. However, despite the tech advancements, STX’s price has faced challenges recently, mirroring broader market trends. Let’s take Emma as an example. She’s a digital artist using a Stacks-powered dApp to sell her NFTs. The upgrade means her transactions are faster, and she gets paid almost instantly. Meanwhile, large corporations are tapping into Stacks’ smart contracts to automate supply chains, cutting costs and boosting efficiency. While short-term volatility might worry some investors, Stacks’ long-term potential makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. With the Nakamoto Upgrade setting the stage for broader adoption, STX could be poised for a major comeback. Kaspa (KAS): The Underdog Turned Contender Kaspa has been quietly gaining momentum and is now stepping into the spotlight. Known for its blockDAG architecture, Kaspa offers faster and more secure transactions, solving scalability issues that plague many other cryptocurrencies. Recently, Kaspa’s price surged, fueled by growing adoption and a bullish sentiment in the market. According to a recent analysis, KAS has the potential to climb even higher in 2024, supported by its strong fundamentals. The community is buzzing about Kaspa’s innovative approach to blockchain, which prioritizes speed and efficiency without compromising decentralization. Think about Alex, a developer who’s been frustrated with slow transaction times on other networks. Kaspa’s tech allows him to build apps that process transactions in seconds, creating a better experience for users. Meanwhile, traders are loving Kaspa’s price action, with many predicting it could break new all-time highs in the coming months. If you’re on the hunt for an up-and-coming project with solid tech and a passionate community, Kaspa deserves a spot in your portfolio. Its unique approach to scalability and security makes it one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Your December 2024 Crypto Watchlist To wrap it up, all three projects—Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS)—bring something unique to the table. Qubetics is revolutionizing how we use crypto for everyday transactions, while Stacks is enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities with smart contracts. Kaspa, on the other hand, is tackling scalability issues with its cutting-edge blockDAG architecture. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Stacks (STX), and Kaspa (KAS) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a crypto newbie, these projects have the potential to deliver massive returns. Don’t wait—this could be your ticket to the next big bull run!

Crypto King Musk (MUSKKING), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKKING is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Crypto King Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Crypto King Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Crypto King Musk launched with over $7,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Crypto King Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Crypto King Musk by entering its contract address – v2jWiNpR1m8gHARdM39GosZ8muaxZpowpBgWgWTSCev – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKKING. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-12 01:55:00

After the NFT hit a record high, the project team said that Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem token, PENGU , will shortly be released on Solana. The coin would benefit the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem and other stakeholders. Generally speaking, the floor price is the lowest price an asset sold on an NFT marketplace can fetch.

The Pudgy Penguins collection has 8,888 distinctive NFTs, which have experienced widespread buying sprees. CoinGecko says its price has grown to 194% over one month. It is unclear why the price of the NFT is rising this fast, but analysts are citing the announcement of PENGU as the reason. Although the release dates for PENGU tokens have not been mentioned, they will likely be launched before the year ends. The PENGU token supply will be capped at 88,888,888,888, leading to a significant cross-chain expansion for Pudgy Penguins. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs will remain on Ethereum, while the PENGU will be based on Solana. This move indicates the project is committed to leveraging different networks for opportunities. PENGU tokenomics are here already According to Pudgy Penguins’ official post on X, there is clarity on tokenomics. For starters, 25.9% of the token will be shared with the Pudgy Penguins community, and 24.12% will be set aside for the other communities and new members. 17.8% of the tokens will be allocated to current and future team members, subject to a one-year cliff and three-year vesting period. The company will remain holding 11.48% under the same vesting conditions. The Pudgy ecosystem of NFTs was launched in 2021. However, it faced several hurdles, and some people gave up. As of today, it prides itself on being a prominent NFT collection, extending its reach beyond digital assets.

Whale Dumped 146.6 Million DOGE Recently, Whale Alert , a whale transaction tracker, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that an unknown wallet had transferred a significant 146.6 million DOGE worth $56.5 million to the cryptocurrency exchange Robinhood. 61,160,251 #DOGE (23,493,325 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Robinhood https://t.co/tVZiVALBCQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 10, 2024 In the realm of cryptocurrency, the transfer of assets from wallets to exchanges is often seen as a negative sign. It indicates that these assets are being transferred with the intention of being sold, which can create selling pressure and lead to price declines. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish as it has formed an inverted hammer candlestick pattern at the crucial resistance level of $0.42. Additionally, it has also begun to show downside momentum, which partially confirms this bearishness. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical price momentum, if DOGE remains below the $0.42 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 20% to reach $0.35 in the coming days. However, this bearish thesis is only valid as long as DOGE is trading below the $0.42 level, otherwise, it may fail. Despite this bearish outlook, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on a daily time frame indicates that it is in an uptrend. Traders Bearish Outlook However, this bearish outlook is further supported by on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from DOGE’s long/short ratio indicates that short sellers are currently dominating. Source: Coinglass t press time, this ratio currently stands at 0.78, a record low since the beginning of November 2024.

Coincheck Group N.V., the Amsterdam-headquartered parent company of the Japanese crypto exchange (founded in 2012 under a different name), has announced that the leading digital asset exchange is now publicly listed on Nasdaq. Coincheck is one of Japan’s first cryptocurrency exchanges, and was acquired by Monex Group after a massive $532 million hack of NEM coins in 2018. The Tokyo-headquartered exchange now runs under the ticker “ CNCK ,” with warrants of trading under “CNCKW.” The listing was made possible by a now-consummated $1.3-billion SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) deal with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV.

While some congratulated the custodial exchange, others on Japanese social media see the listing as a sign that talent is heading overseas due to the country’s high crypto taxes , and complained of high fees on the exchange.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-12 02:48:00
