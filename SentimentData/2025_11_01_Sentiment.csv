The image quickly made the rounds, until blockchain analysts stepped in and tore it apart. The Viral Claim The screenshot showed what looked like a massive sell-off: CZ supposedly dumping 35 million $ASTER tokens from his personal wallet. The timing? “This morning,” according to the image. Except… it never happened. The screenshot used real Binance hot wallet transactions from the past week but with a doctored timestamp. The image editor swapped out Binance’s official wallet address, 0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3, for a fake “CZ wallet.” That small change made it look like the transfers came directly from CZ himself. JUST IN: CZ Linked Wallet sells 35,000,000 $ASTER worth $30.42 million. pic.twitter.com/6rqiOWHCFJ — Farzad (@FarzadXBT) October 30, 2025 Analysts Call It Out Blockchain analysts @EmberCN and @lookonchain were quick to fact-check the claim, and their findings were clear. “It says here that CZ sold 35 million $ASTER, but I checked the on-chain data. There are no corresponding transfers as mentioned,” EmberCN wrote. The supposed “CZ sell” transactions? They actually corresponded to internal Binance hot wallet movements, not personal transfers. 这里说 CZ 出售了 3500 万枚 $ASTER ，不过我看了下链上数据，并没有他提到的对应链上转移。 对应到他提到的这三笔 $ASTER 转移，实际是币安热钱包之间的互转。有人把 0x889 这个币安热钱包 P 成了 CZ 的钱包。 https://t.co/IoGcVqpMOr 这里把数量设置 1000 万枚以上，就可以看到。 本文由… https://t.co/zROC2PRKAk pic.twitter.com/T6qvhw4iJg — 余烬 (@EmberCN) October 31, 2025 “Someone mistook the Binance wallet 0x889 for CZ’s wallet,” confirmed Lookonchain. Fake news! The 31.84M $ASTER ($34.53M) transfer was between #Binance hot wallets and has nothing to do with CZ( @cz_binance )'s wallet. https://t.co/mRGs56gItF pic.twitter.com/BZbBm1H3EA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 31, 2025 CZ didn’t waste time addressing the rumor. In his typical direct tone, he jumped on X to shut it down: “Fake news. Please unfollow people who spread this nonsense.” That’s about as clear as it gets. 4. Fake news! Unfollow the guys posting fake news. pic.twitter.com/Os8dF0dSjh — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 31, 2025 The Real Aster Update While FUD spread on social media, the Aster team dropped a genuine update, one that had nothing to do with CZ but could have a real impact on $ASTER’s tokenomics. In a statement, Aster announced refinements to its ongoing buyback and airdrop model as part of its effort to strengthen long-term value. Here’s the breakdown: 50% of all buybacks (S2 and S3) in the public buyback address will be burned, permanently reducing supply and reinforcing $ASTER’s market strength. The remaining 50% will move back to the locked airdrop address, effectively reducing circulating supply and allowing more allocation for future airdrops. This means more rewards for long-term holders and genuine Aster users, and less supply pressure overall. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance Aster’s token economy, we’re refining the S3 buyback and airdrop model to deliver stronger, long-term value for both users and holders: • 50% of all buybacks, including S2 and S3, in the public buyback address will be burned — reducing… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) October 31, 2025 Behind the Buyback Strategy Aster has been executing its S3 buyback plan, which focuses on strengthening its token economy after the earlier S2 round. The goal is straightforward, make $ASTER more sustainable by balancing deflationary burns with community-focused airdrops. The 50-50 split model ensures that half the tokens get permanently removed from circulation, while the rest go toward rewarding loyal users who hold and stake $ASTER. This approach not only enhances liquidity control but also creates a more resilient long-term ecosystem, especially in times of heightened speculation and fake news. Market Reactions Despite the false sell-off rumor, $ASTER remained relatively stable in trading. According to CoinMarketCap data, $ASTER was trading below $1 following the sell off saga, as investors realized the “CZ sell” story was a hoax, price is slightly recovering. The quick debunk from major analysts and the transparency from Aster’s team helped cool the panic. Still, the incident served as a reminder of how easily misinformation spreads in the fast-paced world of crypto. Lessons from the Chaos This episode highlights a growing issue in the industry, fake on-chain screenshots. With tools like Photoshop and basic blockchain explorers, anyone can craft a convincing “leak.” But as this case showed, on-chain truth always wins when verified by reputable trackers like Lookonchain and EmberCN. It also showed CZ’s consistent stance on transparency. Whether it’s a market rumor or an exchange controversy, his first response is to call out fake narratives directly, not let them fester. For Aster, the timing might have been inconvenient, but the fundamentals speak louder than FUD. With its evolving buyback and burn system, Aster is doubling down on its mission, to reward loyal holders and maintain long-term value stability. As the crypto space matures, such mechanisms, along with fast-acting transparency from leaders, are what separate real projects from noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The DeFi platform has raised a staggering $18,250,000 in funds from 17,600 investors, a 250% hike from its original price of $0.01 in Phase 1 of its presale, making MUTM the best crypto to invest in this season to achieve profits in the world of altcoins. Its phased investment strategy has enticed all investors to its side as it unlocks greater profits preceding its entrance priced at $0.06 that holds a promise of a whopping 400% return. But with 2026 on the horizon, will its price tags reach new milestones? Researchers have forecast its level to touch $1.50 come mid-year as it rides dual-market returns amidst market incentives. Presale Stages Fast-Track Investor Influx Mutuum Finance has designed its presale carefully to ensure that all investors are restricted in their allocations and that prices keep rising. Stage 6 is priced at $0.035 and has actually jumped an impressive 80% to near selling out. The number of investors sitting on a total of 17,600 has injected a total of $18,250,000 through this level and has witnessed its holdings increase a whopping 250% since its inception price of $0.01. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has kick-started the involvement through a 24-hour leaderboard system that rewards the top depositor with a prize of $500 in MUTM in a day, as long as one transaction is made before the 00:00 reset. This activity-igniting strategy has brought vitality to the pre-sale event that has turned a normal buying process into a winning experience for 17,600 token holders. Stories have emerged of how people have caught a bonus boost that cushions their holdings. In a field that is rife with passive holdings, this is a welcome respite that forces investors to think that MUTM is not only a high-quality investment platform but is a quick pulse on this vibrant defi crypto community. The scorching speed of Phase 6 leaves late bloomers grasping for air; with only 80% left and the 400% prize in sight, the $0.035 window opens and closes in a hurry to sentence latecomers to the steeper price point of Phase 7’s $0.04. To think of missing out on this opportunity while your 17,600 friends pocket 400% while you take out overpriced tickets. Money amounts reach $18,250,000. Giveaway Ignites Broader Appeal Mutuum Finance has brought some level of incentivization to this process with a prize giveaway worth $100,000 . The project has reserved MUTM tokens worth $10,000 for each of the 10 winners to take advantage of this presale frenzy. The reaction to this giveaway has not only contributed to its large number of members that stand at 17,600 but has even lifted moods as winners share their profits daily. Thus, promotions have added layers of bliss to functionality to make MUTM appear vibrant and very lucrative for beginners searching for top-notch opportunities in altcoin data. Professionals associate winning streaks with continued rally projections in 2026 due to passion for the token within communities. Yield Mechanisms Propel 2026 Targets Mutuum Finance has aggregated its platform with peer-to-peer lending contracts that auto-generate interest for ETH and USDT. The refunds are in mtTokens as a claim to capital and interest. The borrowers have unfettered access to this common reservoir. Peer-to-peer lending facilitates bespoke lending for specialized tokens. Mutuum Finance has set itself up for explosive growth as more and more people are tempted by lending that operates in the background but increases like compound interest. As of mid-2026, projections place MUTM’s price at $1.50 with a whopping 4200% surge from presale value, undergirded by DeFi’s 40% compound growth and V1’s release of its testnet in Q4 2025. The thinking is informed by security audits–CeriK level 90/100 and a bug bounty reward of a substantial $50,000—and serves as a protective imperative in its own right as its precursor, AAVE in 2020-2021. That asset initially dropped to a mere $26.03 in November 2020 but rocketed to a high of $665 in May 2021 in a mere six months as its lending platform garnered intense hype, registering a 2450% RO1 simply on lending platform hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has coupled its presale ingenuity with yield ingenuity to project a 2026 path to $1.50 in value and has outperformed stagnating altcoins through rightful DeFi activity. Strike this presale pulse—together with 17,600 members in Phase 6—acquire tokens for $0.035 and propel towards 400% returns that reshape your portfolio.

53879101,618005,1761948013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53879101.jpeg,Pundit Breaks Down The XRP Ledger: What To Know About How It Works,https://bitcoinist.com/what-to-know-about-xrp-ledger/,"A lively discussion about XRP’s true purpose and utility erupted on X after prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker posed a sincere question to his 1 million followers: what exactly is the current pitch for XRP? The token itself, not Ripple the company. His inquiry attracted different responses from both supporters and industry commentators on detailed explanations of how the XRP Ledger functions and what role XRP plays within it. The conversation drew in notable voices, including Santiago Velez and David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. How The XRP Ledger Works And The Role Of Rippling In his detailed response , crypto commentator Santiago Velez explained that XRP serves several foundational functions within the Ledger. At its core, the Ledger uses the token to prevent spam and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. Each transaction carries a small fee denominated in XRP to deter network abuse. However, its utility extends far beyond that technical safeguard. Velez also noted that XRP was designed to facilitate a process known as rippling, which allows users to exchange equivalent tokens under the same currency code through an intermediary account. This mechanism was central to the Ledger’s early design and was part of the system’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), the first of its kind in crypto history. As such, the token operates as a bridge currency that allows easy inter-currency pathfinding without relying on intermediaries or centralized issuers. According to Velez, no other large Layer-1 blockchain is built with this specific function in mind, apart from Stellar, which originated as a fork of XRP. Questions On The Long-Term Value Of The Altcoin After receiving the explanation, Melker acknowledged the Ledger’s technical sophistication, calling it an elegant and forward-thinking design that was far ahead of its time. He praised its built-in features, such as the anti-spam mechanism, native DEX, and neutral bridge function, noting that these innovations solved real-world problems in settlement and cross-border payments long before many of today’s leading blockchains were created. However, Melker posed another question about the token’s long-term economic sustainability: whether these design strengths translate into lasting demand for the token itself. He pointed out that while the ledger’s features serve technical purposes, they do not necessarily guarantee consistent price appreciation. In his view, spam prevention does not generate token demand. Pathfinding may bypass the altcoin in some cases, and stablecoins’ stability and simplicity have become more appealing to institutions than XRP. This opens the question of whether it is adopted anywhere near the scale that it’s being promoted. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, later joined the conversation to provide his perspective on the token’s value. He noted that the Ledger offers something no other blockchain can, which is an open system where users can act as their own banks, free from middlemen like stablecoin issuers that can tax transactions. According to Schwartz, the altcoin’s special place on the Ledger ensures that it captures some of the value generated by network transactions. As the only non-IOU asset accessible to every account worldwide, the asset holds a unique status that protects it from default, freezing, or clawback risks.",XRP|David Schwartz|DDos Attacks|Decentralized Exchange|Denial-of-service|DEX|ripple|ripple news|Santiago Velez|Scott Melker|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 22:00:13

All Signs Point to the Noomez ($NNZ) Presale,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-will-boom-in-2025-all-signs-point-to-the-noomez/,"In a year packed with speculation, one question dominates every crypto forum: Which crypto will boom in 2025? As investors scan the horizon for the next breakout coin, a new name is quietly gathering energy, $NNZ , the deflationary meme coin built on story, stages, and the power of the Noom Engine. While others chase hype, $NNZ is crafting a universe that unites holders through lore, token burns, and transparent presale mechanics. It’s more than a meme, it’s a movement. As 2025 approaches, the Noomverse is coming alive one stage at a time. Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025 and Why $NNZ Leads the Race Crypto analysts agree that 2025 could mark the beginning of the next major bull cycle. Yet, among the countless meme coins and utility tokens, $NNZ meme coin presale stands out for three key reasons: innovation, transparency, and community-driven growth. The Noom Engine gives $NNZ lasting utility; new projects can join its ecosystem, paying tribute to $NNZ holders through automatic token rewards. Meanwhile, its deflationary tokenomics ensure scarcity, with unsold tokens burned after each presale stage. And unlike typical short-term hype coins, $NNZ’s storytelling framework builds emotional engagement, transforming holders into “Noomies,” loyal participants in a growing universe. Understanding $NNZ’s Lunar Momentum As investors ask which crypto will boom next , $NNZ’s mechanics offer a compelling answer. The project’s design isn’t just creative, it’s strategic. 1. The Noom Gauge A glowing energy meter is divided into 28 segments, each representing a presale stage. With every stage completed, one segment lights up, signaling progress toward launch. 2. The Stage X Million Airdrop At the close of each presale stage, one lucky wallet wins a number of $NNZ tokens equal to the stage number (e.g., Stage 14 → 14M $NNZ). 3. The Noom Vault Hidden surprises await at Stage 14 and Stage 28, including massive airdrops, NFT rewards, and even strategic token burns. Together, these mechanisms keep $NNZ’s community engaged, energized, and eager for the next milestone, fueling organic buzz long before official launch day. Experts Eye $NNZ’s Deflationary Power Crypto watchers’ 2025 predictions highlight that deflationary coins with strong community roots often outperform pure speculation tokens. $NNZ fits this mold perfectly. Its fixed 280B supply , regular token burns , and locked liquidity create a stable foundation for growth. Add to that an audited contract, a KYC-verified team, and a transparent presale structure, and $NNZ’s credibility stands tall in a crowded market. For many, this combination signals not just a meme, but a movement poised for long-term success. What Crypto Will Boom in the Next 5 Years? $NNZ’s Vision Beyond 2025 For those wondering which crypto will boom in next 5 years , $NNZ delivers a clear, sustainable roadmap built for growth and longevity. Here’s how it stands apart: The Noom Engine Ecosystem: Every new partner project that joins the Noomverse contributes back to $NNZ holders. A portion of their tokens is distributed automatically; no staking or manual claiming is required. Automatic Holder Rewards: All $NNZ holders benefit from the Noom Engine’s token drops. Simply holding $NNZ qualifies you for future ecosystem rewards. Optional Staking Bonuses: While staking isn’t required, participants who do gain access to boosted yields, exclusive NFTs, and bonus multipliers — rewarding long-term loyalty. Deflationary Supply Model: With a fixed supply of 280 billion $NNZ and continuous token burns, scarcity grows over time, supporting steady price appreciation potential. Evolving Utility and Story: The $NNZ roadmap expands with each stage of the Noomverse, weaving together lore, NFT integration, and token-based partnerships to create lasting value beyond 2025.

In 2028, THETA will range between $2.03 and $2.32, with an average price of $2.18. In 2031, THETA will range between $3.49 and $3.78, with an average price of $3.63. THETA token is the native incentive of the Theta Decentralized Network, an open-source, public protocol focused on driving the next generation of content streaming platforms. Through Theta, developers and video aggregators can innovatively build, launch and deploy decentralized streaming apps on top of the blockchain. Theta’s applications focus on eSports, TV/Movies, enterprise conferencing, music, educational, and streaming content. The content-driven cryptocurrency remains one of the most undervalued coins out there right now, and I think it will continue to rise in price over time. Theta has already surpassed most older coins in the market cap, but what does this mean for its future value? Will Theta be more valuable than Bitcoin or Ethereum by 2031? This blog post will provide insights into Theta price prediction, how to buy Theta coin, and why it could surpass other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum within the next half a decade. Overview Cryptocurrency Theta Ticker THETA Current price $0.4838 Market cap $484.02M Trading volume $14.88M Circulating supply 1B THETA All-time low $0.03977 Mar 13, 2020 All-time high $15.90 Apr 16, 2021 24-hour low $0.4728 24-hour high $0.4961 Theta price prediction: Technical analysis Fear and Greed Index Value Volatility (30-day variation) 14.70% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.6769 200-day SMA $0.8201 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 29 (Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) Theta price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Theta is consolidating near $0.48 after a short-term drop. A move above $0.50 could trigger recovery toward $0.54 or higher. THETA/USD 1-day chart analysis As of October 31, Theta (THETA) is trading at $0.484, up a marginal 0.21%, as the price stabilizes near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.492. The upper band sits around $0.600, defining the broader resistance zone. The narrow squeeze of the Bollinger Bands suggests volatility has contracted, with the token consolidating after a recent sell-off. THETA/USD 1-day chart by TradingView The MACD line sits flat near zero with both lines almost overlapping, signaling market indecision and a possible pause before a directional move. The RSI at 37.98 shows Theta is still hovering near the oversold region, hinting that bearish momentum could be losing strength. If Theta manages to hold above $0.48, it could retest $0.51–$0.54 in the short term. However, a daily close below $0.47 may expose it to further downside, potentially reaching $0.45 or even $0.43. THETA/USD 4-hour chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, Theta is showing mild consolidation after multiple failed attempts to push past $0.49. The Alligator indicator lines remain spread downward, confirming the lingering bearish structure. The short-term moving averages act as resistance between $0.492–$0.499, while the upper boundary at $0.510 marks the next level for potential breakout validation. The MACD histogram remains slightly negative, while the OBV reading of 465M indicates relatively weak buying interest. A sustained move above $0.50 could trigger short-term recovery momentum, but rejection here may drag the token back toward $0.475.

Theta is attempting to stabilize after heavy selling pressure, but momentum remains weak. A firm rebound above $0.50 would confirm short-term strength. Otherwise, the token may continue to hover sideways within the $0.47–$0.50 range before a clearer direction emerges. Is Theta a good investment? Theta shows solid long-term potential with its expanding ecosystem in streaming, media, and edge computing. Its strong fundamentals and growing partnerships support future growth, but adoption is still moderate and competition remains high, making it a promising yet risky investment. Will Theta reach $5? Theta is gradually expanding its ecosystem through partnerships in media, entertainment, and edge computing, which supports its long-term growth outlook. If this progress continues alongside broader market recovery, reaching $5 is achievable over time, though it remains dependent on sustained adoption and real utility demand. Will Theta reach $10? Given Theta’s all-time high of around $15.72 in 2021, reaching $10 again is possible if market conditions turn strongly bullish and adoption improves. However, with current low trading levels and slower ecosystem growth, such a rebound would likely take significant time and renewed investor interest. Will Theta reach $50? Per the market estimates and Theta price predictions, Theta prices are unlikely to reach $50 soon. Does Theta have a good long-term future? Theta has strong long-term potential with its focus on decentralized streaming and edge computing, supported by solid partnerships and tokenomics. However, limited adoption and strong competition make it a high-risk, high-reward project.

Theta historic price sentiment Theta Price History by CoinGecko THETA, launched in 2018 as an ERC-20 token before migrating to its own blockchain, initially dropped from $0.183 to around $0.066, trading between $0.051 and $0.107 through 2019. In 2020, it gained momentum, reaching $0.428 mid-year, $0.749 by September, and $1.5 by December. Early 2021 saw a major bull run, pushing THETA from $1.9 to an all-time high of $15.72 before correcting to ~$4 by July. A second rally lifted the price to ~$8 by November. Throughout 2022, THETA fluctuated between $1.2 and $4 but declined to ~$0.7 by year-end. In early 2023, it rebounded above $1 but slipped to $0.619 by October, recovering to ~$1.4 by December. In 2024, THETA opened the year near $1, climbed steadily to about $3.4 in March, then declined through the rest of the year to around $1.02 by December. In 2025, the coin struggled to regain momentum, trading mostly between $0.50 and $1.00, and in October 2025, it is currently trading between $0.4728 and $0.4961.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|THETA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-31 22:06:46

The company behind the world’s largest stablecoin just published its Q3 2025 attestation report, confirming over $10 billion in profit for the year so far, and record exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Tether now holds $135 billion in Treasuries, making it the 17th largest holder globally. Its flagship token, USD₮, has also crossed a massive milestone, with $174 billion in circulation as of September 30. With $181.2 billion in total reserves and $6.8 billion in excess reserves, Tether is not just maintaining its lead in the stablecoin market, it’s extending it. Tether Attestation Reports Q1-Q3 2025 Profit Surpassing $10B, Record Levels in U.S. Treasuries Exposure, Accelerating USD₮ Supply Amidst World’s Macroeconomic Uncertainty Learn more: https://t.co/EH8ltqri27 — Tether (@Tether_to) October 31, 2025 A Record-Breaking Year The numbers speak for themselves. Tether’s Q3 report shows one of the most profitable stretches in its history. In just the first three quarters of 2025, the company generated more than $10 billion in profit, a figure that surpasses many traditional financial institutions. That performance is driven by Tether’s heavy exposure to U.S. Treasuries. The company’s $135 billion Treasury position now ranks it above major economies and sovereign funds in holdings. The majority of its reserves are short-term, liquid assets, a structure that provides both safety and strong returns. For a company with roughly 150 employees worldwide, the scale of these results is remarkable. USD₮ Supply Continues to Surge Tether’s attestation also shows a strong increase in USD₮ supply during Q3 2025. The total circulation jumped by $17 billion over the quarter, ending at 174.4 billion USD₮. That growth mirrors rising demand in global markets, where users continue to turn to stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. In emerging markets especially, USD₮ has become a lifeline. Today, Tether estimates over 500 million people use USD₮ worldwide, from freelancers in Asia to merchants in Africa and Latin America. It’s not just another crypto token. For many, it’s their most reliable form of digital money. $181B in Reserves, $6.8B in Cushion Tether’s balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. The company reported $181.2 billion in total assets, fully backing every USD₮ in circulation. On top of that, an additional $6.8 billion in excess reserves provides an extra safety layer, funds that go beyond the 100% liquid backing required. That surplus acts as a financial buffer, reinforcing market confidence. It’s also part of why USD₮ has remained stable through every market cycle, from bull runs to liquidity crunches. Transparency remains central to Tether’s operations. Each quarter, attestation reports confirm the composition of reserves and verify that every token is supported by equivalent assets. The 17th Largest Holder of U.S. Treasuries Perhaps the most striking number in the Q3 report is Tether’s $135 billion exposure to U.S. Treasuries. That figure officially makes Tether the 17th largest holder of U.S. government debt, larger than most central banks. This exposure has effectively tied Tether’s financial health to one of the most secure markets in the world. The interest generated from these holdings has become a key driver of the company’s profits. Tether’s Treasury-heavy portfolio shows how closely traditional and digital finance have become intertwined. The stablecoin market is now a major participant in global liquidity flows, and Tether sits at the center of that shift. Tether just released its quarterly attestation for Q3 2025. USDT has become the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity, with more than 500 million users across the emerging markets and developing countries. Highlights as of 30 September 2025: *… https://t.co/XVYeVq1u64 pic.twitter.com/nZ2V1EKZ3x — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) October 31, 2025 From Stablecoin to Global Financial Power For years, Tether has been viewed mainly as a stablecoin issuer. But 2025 marks the year that changed. With its growing profits and diversification plans, Tether is evolving into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. The company is already expanding into artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and P2P technology. These moves signal a broader vision, one that goes beyond crypto trading and into real-world infrastructure. By investing in AI and energy projects, Tether aims to support innovation and sustainability, while reducing reliance on traditional financial systems. It’s a long-term strategy that blends finance, technology, and global access. The World’s Digital Dollar The scale of USD₮’s adoption is unprecedented. In developing regions, where banking infrastructure often fails to meet demand, USD₮ fills the gap. It gives users access to digital dollars without needing a traditional bank account. From local traders in Nigeria to startups in Argentina, USD₮ enables stable transactions, remittances, and savings in markets hit by inflation or currency controls. This widespread use has made Tether a cornerstone of global financial inclusion. The company calls it “the biggest financial inclusion success story in history.” Numbers That Define 2025 Tether’s attestation lays out the picture clearly: $174.4B USD₮ issued as of Q3 2025 $181.2B in total assets and reserves $6.8B+ in excess reserves $135B+ in U.S. Treasuries $10B+ in profit across Q1–Q3 $17B USDT supply increase in Q3 alone These metrics don’t just show growth, they show dominance. The Most Profitable Company in Crypto The biggest surprise for many? The most profitable company in crypto isn’t an exchange, it’s Tether. With $10 billion in profit year-to-date, Tether has outperformed nearly every major crypto firm, including top trading platforms. Its business model, simple, transparent, and backed by liquid reserves, continues to generate consistent returns. Its ability to manage such vast holdings while maintaining full liquidity makes it one of the most efficient financial operations in the industry. With profit soaring, reserves expanding, and new investments underway, Tether is shaping itself into more than a stablecoin company. It’s becoming a global financial powerhouse, one that merges traditional stability with digital efficiency. The company’s focus on AI and renewable energy shows its intent to influence the future beyond crypto markets. Its USD₮ token continues to anchor the digital economy, while its profits and investments expand its role across sectors. As the world faces ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, demand for stability is rising. And for hundreds of millions of users, that stability comes in one form, USD₮.

XRP ($XRP): Claude AI Predicts Strong Double-Digit Growth According to Claude crypto report, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) stands out as one of the most promising breakout assets. The AI suggests the token could rally toward the $8 mark by year’s end, representing a 217% increase from its current price of $2.52. Source: Claude AI Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC earlier in the year reignited market optimism, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, the asset has climbed an impressive 380% year-to-date and 392% in the last 365 days, outperforming Bitcoin’s 55% growth and Ethereum’s 50% by nearly 7x to 8x. With the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s close contacts with the current pro-crypto US administration, Ripple has further cemented its status as a compliance-friendly digital payments provider, drawing strong investor interest in regulatory-aligned crypto solutions. Several bullish flag setups have formed across XRP’s 2025 price charts, hinting at sustained technical momentum. If additional market catalysts emerge, such as a wave of expected ETF approvals, new institutional partnerships, or the timely delivery of “Project Crypto”—an SEC initiative to provide clarity to the industry, a 12-month target of $8 could become a realistic target. Sui Network: Claude Calls This One an Easy 10X Crypto Sui Network ($SUI) continues to generate substantial buzz, positioning itself as a blockchain capable of outperforming Ethereum in speed and scalability. While the “Ethereum killer” label often depends on perspective, Sui’s standout feature is its extraordinary throughput, reportedly handling up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum’s average of just 15 TPS. In the last 24 hours, SUI has risen 3%, trading at $2.35. Claude’s report suggests the token could sustain this uptrend and potentially reach $25 next year, thanks to its sophisticated smart contract ecosystem, scalability, and interoperability. If current slow market conditions persist, Sui could feasibly touch $5 by Christmas. Technical indicators, however, support a breakout scenario, with the forming two bullish flag patterns over the last year, typically a precursor to prolonged upside potential. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Titan May Double Rapidly, Says Claude Aave ($AAVE) remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive returns through a secure, efficient platform. Renowned for its flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain accessibility, Aave has played a pivotal role in advancing the DeFi landscape. Its commitment to innovation, community governance, and growing institutional traction positions Aave not just as a survivor of the DeFi boom, but as one of its key architects. Claude AI envisions Aave’s price potentially soaring from current levels of $217 all the way up to to $1,000, a remarkable jump of 5x in 12 months. Currently, Aave’s price action is forming an expanding triangle pattern. It could actually reach the lower target of $600 early next year, which will be a strong psychological foothold on the way to $1,000. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Bold Meme Coin Presale with 4,900x Potential! Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been billed “the Dogecoin of this cycle” despite still only being in presale, and such buzz has already attracted over $3.8 million in funding from investors hoping for outsized gains. Claude’s crypto report believes his one is explosive, estimating potential returns of up to 4,900% from its current low fixed presale price of $0.0002655. If Claude’s analysis is correct, Maxi Doge could be worth $0.013275 in a year, which would still make it worth only a penny even after it has hypothetically gone to the moon. Marketed as Dogecoin’s more chaotic and high-energy relative, Maxi Doge thrives on crypto’s degen culture, leveraging viral memes, contests, and community interaction to fuel growth. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions than Dogecoin’s dated chain. Of the total 150.24 billion MAXI tokens, 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” aimed at supporting marketing efforts, strategic collaborations, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 79% APY, though yields will gradually decrease as staking participation rises. The current presale price is $0.0002655, with incremental increases set for upcoming rounds. Investors can acquire MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

October opened with “Uptober” optimism since the vast majority of Octobers in crypto’s 15 year history have resulted in serious gains However, there was no such luck this year. President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports caused one of the biggest crashes in crypto history, although old hands were unperturbed, noting that big crashes that flush out over-leveraged players often precede historic bull runs. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Wednesday has not prevented two consecutive dip days. Still, crypto has been here for 1.5 decades and it’s only growing by the day, whatever prices say. So, read on to find out why XRP, Bitcoin and Solana are three trending cryptos to jump on this halloween. Ripple (XRP): How the Global Payments Leader Became King of Trending Cryptos in 2025 Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , powers a lightning-fast, low-cost payments network designed to replace legacy cross-border systems such as SWIFT. Through partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and multiple major U.S. banks, Ripple has secured its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $150 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, marks a bold step in the crucial stablecoin sector. Over the past twelve months, XRP has jumped 381%, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-July, its first in seven years, while Bitcoin posted a comparatively modest 52% gain during the same period. Its price chart shows two bullish flag formations this summer. Pending ETF approvals and the passage of comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. could provide the final catalyst for XRP to hit the $5–$10 range this year. Bitcoin ($BTC): Gemini AI Forecasts a Climb Toward $250,000 Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s first and most recognized cryptocurrency, continues to dominate headlines after reaching a record high of $126,080 on October 6. wIf the US SEC delivers on the promise of “Project Crypto”, an initiative to modernise federal securities laws to give crypto firms clearer guidance, then Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2026. Even under normal conditions, Bitcoin could conceivably hit $150,000, given the fact that it has set multiple new all-time highs this year. Another development that could catalyse demand is Trump’s delivery of his pre-election promise for a Strategic US Bitcoin reserve. As the benchmark for the entire sector, Bitcoin attracts both institutional and retail, often viewed as a “digital gold” hedge against inflation. It currently accounts for $2.2 trillion of the global crypto’s $3.8 trillion capitalization. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its reputation as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in operation today. With a market capitalization over $102 billion and over $11 billion in total value locked , Solana is the second biggest DeFi network after Ethereum. Tuesday marked a major milestone as Grayscale and Bitwise launched spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange, a development expected to attract significant institutional investment, mirroring the inflows seen after recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Following a spring low near $100 in April, SOL has recovered to $186. A falling wedge pattern and a bullish flag formed across Solana’s support and resistance lines this year. These two formations typically precede major breakouts but they are as yet unrealized. Key technical levels show solid support near $150 and heavy resistance around $250. Should the recent ETF launches continue to drive demand, SOL could revisit its previous all-time high of $293.31, and, under strong bull market conditions, potentially advance toward $500 or even $1,000 by Christmas. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Timely Reminder that Next Year’s Trending Cryptos are in This Year’s Presales Market Finally, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) hasn’t listed yet, but it is likely to be one of the biggest trending cryptos of 2026. It merges Bitcoin’s security with high-performance Layer-2 capabilities, amplified by meme-driven community appeal. HYPER seeks to enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem through near-instant transactions, decentralized governance via a DAO framework, and native smart contract functionality powered by its proprietary Layer-2 architecture. The presale has already surpassed $25.3 million, with some analysts projecting 100x potential post-launch. Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates a high-speed Canonical Bridge that enables smooth BTC transfers and decentralized app (dApp) compatibility. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor trust in the project’s foundation. HYPER tokens form the backbone of the ecosystem, facilitating governance, staking, and transactional functions. Early investors can currently earn staking yields up to 46% APY.

Chase Early Stage Gains Before Prices Climb and Demand Goes Wild Solana Positioned for “Two Ways to Win” as Stablecoin and Tokenization Markets Expand Solana earns serious respect after Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated that the network has two powerful growth streams. First, stablecoins keep shifting to faster chains. Solana handles high transaction volumes at low cost, attracting new payment innovations. Western Union has already confirmed plans for a Solana-based stablecoin to support global money movement. Second, tokenization builds pace with institutions exploring real-world assets on the chain. Solana controls around 14 percent of this sector, leaving significant upside. If adoption continues to rise while network activity remains strong, Solana could enjoy a catch-up run similar to Bitcoin’s once-explosive rally during dual market success. Frequently Asked Questions about Solana Why are institutions interested in Solana? Institutions need fast settlement and predictable fees. Solana offers both while supporting secure token issuance for digitized assets. These strengths attract large players seeking efficient payment infrastructure and asset innovation. Is Solana a long-term investment option? Yes. Solana benefits from growing developer activity, strong liquidity, and the expansion of stablecoins. While volatility continues, the chain’s performance edge supports strong competitiveness in the long-term ecosystem race. BullZilla: Best Crypto Presales with 100x Potential Driven by Scarcity, Hype, and ROI BullZilla builds its appeal around progressive price increases and fast-moving demand that investors associate with the best crypto presales with 100x potential .

Specific exchange names, including Coinbase, are not officially confirmed yet. Listing decisions depend on compliance, liquidity, trading demand, and partner readiness. Why Staking Can Supercharge Gains in Presale Projects? Holding tokens through staking allows users to earn additional rewards and reduce selling pressure at launch. These programs help boost momentum and assist price discovery. They build loyalty and encourage longer conviction among holders. Lock Tokens Early While Massive ROI Remains in Sight Aster Sinks but Volume Remains Strong as Traders Watch for Recovery Aster recently declined by more than 17% over 24 hours, dropping to $0.86. Volatility hit the newly launched network, which now trades over 64 percent below its high. Strong volume around $688M shows traders are still active. Confidence remains because Aster still has more than 920% gains from its September lows. Investors watch whether support forms to keep growth valid. Aster continues to build adoption, which may provide stability going forward, with development momentum supporting better market reactions. Frequently Asked Questions about Aster Why did Aster drop recently? Prices corrected due to high volatility and profit-taking after significant gains. Substantial volume signals persistent interest, though recovery depends on buyers maintaining confidence as development progresses. Is Aster still promising? Yes. Despite pullbacks, Aster remains far above earlier lows. As long as utility and ecosystem activity continue to grow, the project can recover strongly and resume long-term upward momentum. Conclusion – Is BullZilla the Best Crypto Presale with 100X Potential Market news reflects two clear themes shaping the crypto environment today. Solana pushes deeper into institutional finance through stablecoin innovation and tokenization momentum, reinforcing its role as a major ecosystem contender. At the same time, Aster shows that newly launched tokens can move aggressively in either direction due to heightened volatility and increased trader attention. Participation rises as adoption expands across payment systems, smart contract networks, and tokenized real-world assets. The entire industry evolves, with more utilities supporting stronger, long-term market health overall. BullZilla, meanwhile, captures peak opportunity interest as hype accelerates and entry points disappear quickly. Its fast-climbing presale and high ROI projections make it one of the best crypto presales with 100x potential in Q4. Scarcity grows as stages advance, and staking provides lasting income strength that appeals to committed holders. Delay raises cost, which pressures users to join before the Stage 9 price increases limit upside. The next bull wave is forming, and BullZilla positions itself to lead momentum and attract significant attention.

Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Coinbase’s third‑quarter revenue surged to $1.87 billion, which came in above the $1.8 billion expectation, triggering a 9% rally on the COIN stock rose by 9% by Friday’s close. The company has been partnering with Wall Street giants like JP Morgan, Citi, and PNC, who are all using Coinbase to provide crypto access inside their platforms, calling it a foundational build, not a short‑term revenue lift. Banks adopt Coinbase infrastructure In late July, Coinbase said it would integrate its institutional Crypto‑as‑a‑Service platform into PNC, allowing its clients to buy, hold, and sell crypto directly from their existing bank environment. Later in the month, Coinbase announced multiple product offerings with J.P. Morgan. These offerings link Chase bank accounts to Coinbase wallets. Customers can move funds directly between the two. They can also transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points into Coinbase accounts. Users can also fund their Coinbase accounts with Chase credit cards. This is where Coinbase moves from being an exchange people log into separately to being a built‑in layer inside normal banking activity. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote that Coinbase is “fast becoming the AWS of crypto financial infrastructure as big banks such as JPM, Citi, PNC choose Coinbase as their crypto partner.” Chhugani refers to Amazon Web Services, which is the unseen backend behind most major tech products. This framing is being used to describe Coinbase’s position as financial systems adopt blockchain rails for processing. Analysts outline expected upside Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase with a price target of $510, which would represent 55% upside. Bernstein analysts wrote that Coinbase is “executing on its crypto dream, where blockchain rails would re‑architect capital markets, banking and payments.” They also stated that the company’s path is not based on token price cycles but on building a business that services institutional financial systems. Barclays holds an equal‑weight rating with a price target of $357, which implies 8.7% upside. Barclays analysts said its management expressed confidence in active developments across payments, exchanges, and capital formation. Needham has a buy rating and a $400 price target, implying 21.8% upside. Needham analysts wrote that management is seeing strong demand for stablecoin infrastructure. They stated that Coinbase continues to receive partnership mandates from large firms such as Citi and BlackRock while also seeing increased interest from small and medium‑sized businesses. Rosenblatt has a buy rating and a $470 price target, which implies 43.1% upside. Rosenblatt analysts wrote that over 1,000 businesses are currently using Coinbase for stablecoin payments and that another 1,000 businesses are on the waitlist. They listed partnerships with Citi, Stripe, PayPal, Revolut, Webull, and Shopify as examples of how Coinbase is now being used as the on‑chain payments gateway for companies building crypto‑based transaction flows.

The sudden decline followed an initial post-Fed volatility spike, as traders reacted to the US Federal Reserve’s 25bps rate cut and announcement of an impending end to quantitative tightening. With uncertainty still lingering, BTC briefly slipped into a risk-off spiral, testing investor conviction and flushing out leveraged positions in the process. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite the market turbulence, several analysts argue this move may represent a classic shakeout, rather than the beginning of a larger breakdown. Historically, Bitcoin has often seen sharp pullbacks immediately before renewed upside momentum, especially during early liquidity-expansion phases. For now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can stabilize and reclaim the $110K zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot throughout the past month. As markets digest the Fed’s decision, the focus turns to whether Bitcoin can wake up from this sudden sell-off and reclaim strength heading into November. PoC Becomes Critical Battleground as Market Signals Indecision According to top analyst On-chain Mind, Bitcoin’s current price structure is being defined by a major volume cluster centered around $117,000, which now serves as the Point of Control (PoC) in the local market profile. This level represents the price zone with the highest traded volume in the recent range — effectively the point where buyers and sellers have shown the strongest interest and where the market has spent considerable time balancing liquidity. In practical terms, the PoC functions as a fair value zone for market participants. When the price trades below it, bulls need to reclaim the level to regain trend strength; when the price trades above it, the zone tends to act as support. Today, BTC remains beneath the $117K PoC, signaling that the market has yet to re-establish bullish dominance after the recent shakeout. On-chain Mind notes that reclaiming $117K would likely trigger renewed momentum, opening the door for a retest of the $120K–$123K range. Until then, however, the structure remains indecisive, with price hovering in a neutral zone where neither bulls nor bears hold a clear advantage. This aligns with broader market behavior: reduced leverage, mixed sentiment, and trader caution following aggressive liquidations earlier in October. The market is digesting macro shifts, recalibrating position sizes, and waiting for a clearer signal. If Bitcoin can stabilize above recent support and begin rotating back toward the PoC, reclaiming $117K could mark the moment the next leg up begins.

The price managed to reclaim the $110K level, suggesting buyers stepped in at intraday lows around $108,500, an important local demand zone that has repeatedly supported the price since mid-October. However, the recovery remains fragile, with BTC now approaching a cluster of short-term resistance levels. The 50-period EMA sits just above the current price, and the 100- and 200-period moving averages remain overhead, stacked bearishly. This alignment indicates that momentum has not fully shifted back to the bulls yet. To regain control, BTC must break above $112,000–$113,000, where multiple moving averages converge and prior support now acts as resistance. Clearing this zone would open the path toward the critical $117,500 Point of Control — the key level bulls need to reclaim to re-establish medium-term strength.

For now, BTC remains in a neutral recovery posture, trying to build a base while navigating overhead pressure from macro uncertainty and recent leverage unwinds.

53882327,618253,1761951656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53882327.jpeg,Is Zcash Quantum-Resistant Yet? Experts Weigh In,https://bitcoinist.com/is-zcash-quantum-resistant-yet-experts/,"A debate on X this week exposed a core question for on-chain privacy: when quantum computers are able to break elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), will they be able to retroactively deanonymize every transaction ever made of privacy coins like Zcash? Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics and partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that the answer is effectively yes for most privacy coins. “For privacy coins, even if they migrate to post-quantum cryptographic schemes, all historical transactions prior to that migration can be decrypted,” he said on October 30, 2025. “So all historical txns will be stripped of privacy in >~5y. Everything is built on ECC.” Carter’s point is based on “harvest now, decrypt later.” Attackers don’t need to break you today. They just copy the data now and crack it once quantum is strong enough. On blockchains, that problem is worse because the data is already public and permanent. “Blockchains are uniquely bad for quantum because normally the quantum thing is ‘harvest now decrypt later’ so adversaries have to be preemptively harvesting traffic but blockchains just.. publish.. everything.. forever.” He warned specifically that even if a privacy coin upgrades to quantum-resistant signatures in the future, old activity is still exposed once ECC falls. “While privacy coins can adopt post quantum sigs, understand that all previously hidden addresses, relationships between addresses, etc, will be revealed once ECC is broken,” Carter said. “And obviously everything is on chain so you don’t even need to harvest traffic today.” Is Zcash Already Quantum-Resistant? That claim triggered pushback from Zcash supporters, who argue Zcash is structurally different from something like Monero. Mert Mumtaz (Helius) agreed that Carter’s warning applies to “many privacy coins like Monero ,” but said it’s “not necessarily true for zcash’s privacy, given advanced opsec.” He acknowledged that “advanced opsec is not the norm,” but said that if it is followed, Zcash users “get you certain guarantees w.r.t information leakage.” He also said “some things are in the works to make this even stronger,” pointing to research by Zcash engineer Sean Bowe. Bowe’s position is that Zcash’s fully shielded pool simply does not put critical sender/receiver information on the ledger in the first place. “There is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe said in July this year. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” His condition is clear: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” Carter partially credits that. “Zec is definitely ahead of anyone when it comes to quantum preparedness, not denying that,” he said. But he called the “already quantum-proof” framing unrealistic in practice. He argued that Zcash’s long-term privacy story depends on very strong assumptions that often break in the real world: “assumes pubkey never being known. assumes: no metadata collection, no exchange key leaks, perfect metadata privacy.” He added that Zcash’s shielded pools — Sprout, Sapling, Orchard — still “rely on ECC for key exchange, viewkeys, proof verification, which are all broken” under a powerful quantum adversary. His conclusion: “unrealistic to say zec privacy is perfectly q resistant. linkages between addrs are forever encoded on the blockchain, you and Sean know that. store now decrypt later still applies.” In other words: Zcash builders say that if you stay fully shielded, the chain itself won’t hand quantum attackers a clean map of who paid whom. Carter says that in the real world, users leak, exchanges leak, metadata leaks — and once ECC breaks, those leaks plus the permanent ledger are enough to unwind the privacy anyway. One final note: when asked directly, Carter denied holding ZEC. “Nope.” At press time, ZEC traded at $366.",Crypto News|Quantum Computing|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|WALLET|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 23:00:56

In a decision filed Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed an earlier ruling from the District of Wyoming that sided with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Source: Court Listener Tenth Circuit Upholds Fed’s Decision to Block Custodia’s Access to U.S. Payment System The judgment marks the latest setback in Custodia’s five-year effort to obtain a Federal Reserve “master account,” a critical gateway for direct participation in the U.S. banking system. “This case comes clothed in 21st Century terms: cryptocurrency, digital assets, instant wire transfers, and master accounts,” the judges wrote in the opinion. “But there is nothing new about this issue. Courts have probed the legality of our nation’s central bank and interpreted the relevant statutes since the founding.” The three-judge panel, composed of Circuit Judges Tymkovich, Ebel, and Rossman, upheld the lower court’s conclusion that the Federal Reserve acted within its authority when it denied Custodia’s application. The ruling effectively leaves the central bank’s decision intact, confirming that the Fed retains broad discretion in determining which financial institutions can access its payment infrastructure. Custodia, previously known as Avanti Bank, first applied for a master account in October 2020 after receiving a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter from the state of Wyoming. The application, typically processed within a week, languished for over 19 months without resolution. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City formally rejected the request, citing “safety and soundness” concerns tied to the bank’s focus on digital assets. U.S. digital asset-focused bank Custodia has filed a lawsuit against the FED Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City over “unlawfully” delaying its application for a master account with the FED. Read more https://t.co/8rpBp5piaM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2022 The Fed argued that Custodia’s business model relied too heavily on volatile crypto markets and lacked sufficient controls to manage illicit finance risks. It also pointed to the bank’s limited experience in traditional risk management and the potential systemic implications of granting direct access to a crypto-centered institution. Custodia sued the Federal Reserve in June 2022 , claiming an “unlawful delay” and arguing that eligible institutions are entitled to a master account under federal law. After the Wyoming court ruled in favor of the Fed in March 2024 , Custodia appealed, asserting that the decision gave the central bank excessive discretion over market access. Judge Rules Against Digital Asset Bank Custodia’s Bid for Federal Reserve Master Account Custodia Bank has been denied a U.S. Federal Reserve master account by the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. #CryptoNews https://t.co/lHtNJ69ZdW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 31, 2024 Friday’s ruling reaffirmed the lower court’s position, dealing another blow to Long’s push to integrate crypto banking into the U.S. financial system. In a statement posted to X following the judgment, Custodia said it was “actively considering” petitioning for a rehearing. Statement of @custodiabank : pic.twitter.com/6U0FPzaKCm — Custodia Bank (@custodiabank) October 31, 2025 “While we were hoping for a win at the Tenth Circuit today, we received the next big thing — a strong dissent,” the company wrote, referring to a partial dissent that raised constitutional questions about the Federal Reserve’s authority. Why Won’t the Fed Grant Crypto Firms a Master Account? A Federal Reserve master account would have allowed Custodia to connect directly to core U.S. payment systems such as Fedwire and the Automated Clearing House (ACH). Such access enables banks to settle transactions, hold reserves, and participate directly in monetary policy operations, benefits currently limited to regulated depository institutions. Crypto-focused firms have long sought similar access to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on intermediary banks. However, the Federal Reserve has not approved any master account applications from crypto-native institutions to date. The central bank has repeatedly cited the sector’s high volatility, potential for fraud, and insufficient consumer protection as reasons for caution.

Long said the initiative proved that banks could “tokenize demand deposits on a permissionless blockchain in a regulatorily compliant manner.” Despite such efforts, federal regulators have maintained a cautious stance. Speaking in March, Long said that under the current administration, no meaningful changes have been made to rules labeling digital asset exposure as “unsafe and unsound” for banks.

The US and UK have both targeted Chen this month with coordinated sanctions on 146 entities and individuals tied to Prince Group, including Chen and key associates, in what has been tagged the largest such action ever against a cybercriminal network. The US Department of Justice charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia, responsible for stealing billions in cryptocurrency from global victims. The US Treasury Department has reportedly seized over $15 billion in assets, including Bitcoin, London properties worth £100 million, and holdings in Palau, it for being linked to him in what marks the largest ever crypto seizure. He is now just as popular in law enforcement circles in Singapore, with reports claiming Singaporean police are moving against the Cambodian Prince Group. On October 31, Singaporean police revealed they had launched an enforcement operation against Chen Zhi and his accomplices on October 30, which led to the seizure of assets worth more than $115 million (approximately RMB 800 million). As part of the enforcement operation, Singapore police have issued restraining orders against a total of six properties and various financial assets registered under the names of Chen Zhi and his accomplices. These assets included bank accounts, securities accounts, and cash, with a total estimated value exceeding S$165 million. The cops also seized a yacht, 11 vehicles, and numerous bottles of alcohol. Chen acquires Cambodian citizenship, drops Chinese nationality On his company website, Chen Zhi is described as “a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist” whose “vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards.” He was raised in Fujian province in south-eastern China, and started out with a small internet gaming company that did not have much success. Then he moved to Cambodia around late 2010 or 2011, where he secured employment in the real estate sector According to BBC News, this was also around the time Chinese folks were gathering in Cambodia for various reasons, including the fact that new casinos sprang up, as well as gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. Things become bizarre when you consider the status he held in Cambodia. Not only did he become a citizen of other countries like Vanuatu and Cyprus, he also had thriving businesses linked to the Prince property arm, including five-star hotels in Sihanoukville. Chen was even awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia’s king, that of “Neak Oknha”, which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government, in 2020. Despite all this, Chen kept a low profile and was an enigma, saying little in public spaces. “Everyone I’ve spoken to who’s worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,” says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three-year-long investigation of Chen Zhi. “I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.” Since news of his sanctions was announced last week, Chen has been AWOL.

Using the Gaussian Channel, EGRAG projected that the cryptocurrency might rise as much as 244% from its present value, challenging the view held by some analysts that the bull market may already be over.

He compared the current market structure to XRP’s performance during the 2017–2018 bull run , when the token rose by roughly 3,700%, reaching around $0.39 before entering a consolidation phase. #XRP – Math, Numbers & a Touch of Sarcasm : This post for those who think logically (well… kinda ) — a mix of numbers, patterns, and a dash of mockery toward a few “TA masters” out there 1⃣ The 10% Theory: Based on the Gaussian Channel (2-week timeframe), I… pic.twitter.com/GkWlQdJZ6L — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 30, 2025 By contrast, EGRAG noted that XRP has advanced by only about 370% in the current cycle, a fraction of its previous rally. He then applied the same ratio observed in 2017’s final surge, when XRP jumped 2,440% to hit $3.30. Based on that relationship, his model suggests a potential range between $5.50 and $6.00 this time around. EGRAG also rejected the popular “diminishing returns” argument that claims each cycle produces smaller percentage gains. He highlighted XRP’s 1,700% rise during the 2021 cycle, which occurred despite regulatory pressure from the SEC lawsuit and an overall bearish market mood. He contends that advancements in technology and growing global adoption make larger gains feasible once again. According to his calculations, repeating the 2021 rally could push XRP above $5 in the coming months. Diminishing Bear Market Losses EGRAG further pointed to a pattern of shrinking losses in XRP’s historical downtrends, describing it as evidence of long-term market maturity. The first major downturn saw a 96% fall from the top, while the next dropped by 86%, showing a gradual 10% improvement. If the pattern holds, the next decline could limit losses to around 76%. This pattern also allows EGRAG to estimate potential bottoms for future cycles. If XRP reaches $5–$6 at the top of the current run, he predicts the next market low could form between $1.20 and $1.40.

Investors who accumulated below $0.50, he noted, remain well-positioned regardless of near-term fluctuations. Other analysts share EGRAG’s optimism about XRP’s long-term outlook but anticipate short-term weakness. DustyBC, for example, believes the asset may first complete a corrective phase before beginning a major third wave upward. His chart analysis places XRP between $2.00 and $2.40 to finalize the second wave before resuming its broader uptrend. Similarly, Casi Trades has identified nearby support and resistance zones that could guide XRP’s next move. After rejecting resistance around $2.68, XRP turned slightly bearish, with Casi noting support levels at $2.42, $2.03, and $1.65. A close below $2.42, she warned, could extend the decline toward $1.65, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. However, she believes this pullback would likely mark the end of the correction and prepare the asset for a sustained breakout to new highs. While the short-term picture for XRP remains mixed, EGRAG’s Gaussian Channel analysis presents a strong case for further gains, potentially lifting the asset above $5 if historical patterns persist. Though other analysts expect a temporary dip before the next upward move, the consensus remains that XRP’s broader structure continues to strengthen, signaling room for a significant rally before this cycle concludes.

His commentary shifts the focus from short-term trading and speculative exits to planning, tax efficiency, and wealth preservation strategies that allow holders to retain exposure while generating cash flow. Claver begins by stressing the importance of having a concrete plan before prices surge. He observes that many retail investors keep tokens on exchanges and liquidate positions as soon as targets are hit, often incurring large tax bills and spending windfalls without a long-term strategy. By contrast, disciplined planning can preserve capital and enable ongoing income generation while allowing the underlying asset to appreciate further. Do you have a plan for your crypto profits? Most people reading this won't do any of it. They'll keep their XRP on an exchange, sell when it hits their number, pay a bunch in taxes, buy liabilities, and wonder where it went. That's fine. More assets for the people who see it… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 30, 2025 Leveraging Institutional Lending A central element of Claver’s approach is borrowing against appreciated crypto rather than converting it to fiat. Institutional-grade crypto lending markets now permit qualified borrowers to use digital assets as collateral and obtain cash without triggering taxable events from sales. Claver suggests that investors who expect a substantial valuation increase can borrow a conservative percentage; he cites an example of borrowing roughly 30% against a position to access funds for living expenses, investment, or business needs. Properly structured, this method preserves the growth potential of the collateral while providing liquidity. Tax and Legal Structures Claver warns that holding sizable crypto balances in an individual’s personal name exposes assets to tax events, litigation risk, and estate complications. He recommends establishing appropriate legal entities, such as properly administered limited liability companies or trusts, and, when applicable, using institutional custody solutions. These measures can provide creditor protection, clearer succession planning, and easier onboarding with banks and service providers that service high-net-worth digital portfolios. He cautions that improperly maintained entities (for example, co-mingling personal and entity funds) can void protections and create additional legal exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For individuals or families with material crypto exposure, Claver recommends operational controls typically used by institutional investors. These include multi-signature custody, independent audit trails, segregation of duties, and working with custodians that provide insurance and compliance reporting. He also advises building relationships with financial institutions that understand digital assets so that lending and banking needs can be met without friction. Accessing Liquidity Without Selling To illustrate, Claver uses a hypothetical; an investor holding 10,000 XRP at a future $100 price would nominally hold $1,000,000 in value. Rather than liquidating, the investor could protocol a loan for a portion of that value, say $300,000, using the XRP as collateral. The loan proceeds could be allocated to living costs, investments that produce income, or business opportunities, while the XRP position remains intact and continues to participate in any further upside. Interest payments and loan structure determine the net cash flow. The key advantage is avoiding a taxable sale that permanently reduces exposure. Claver also outlines the risks. Borrowing against volatile collateral requires margin management and contingency plans for price declines. Lenders may demand additional collateral or liquidate positions if values fall below maintenance thresholds. Legal structures and custody arrangements have costs and administrative requirements. He stresses that such strategies are not suitable for all holders, particularly small retail positions, and recommends seeking competent legal, tax, and financial advice before implementation. Claver argues that the difference between a one-time windfall and enduring family wealth is strategy and execution. Investors who prepare legal structures, adopt institutional-grade custody, and use lending facilities responsibly can potentially access ongoing liquidity without selling their core holdings. For those seeking to convert crypto gains into sustained financial security, the emphasis should be on preservation, tax efficiency, and controlled leverage rather than immediate monetization.

Although altcoins have recently lagged behind Bitcoin, bullish factors from data and macroeconomic parallels are building optimism that a change in liquidity conditions might trigger a strong market-wide rally for altcoins. Altcoin Dominance Hits Record Oversold Levels According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, altcoin dominance has entered oversold conditions for the first time in history. Marks highlighted in his post that the indicator, which measures the market share of all altcoins, is now the most oversold it’s ever been. The OTHERS.D chart shows the market dominance percentage of all cryptocurrencies except the top 10 by market capitalization. It is a measure of the combined market share of smaller altcoins and can be used to identify broader altcoin rallies. His long-term chart of the OTEHRS.D movement spans over a decade, with each major low followed by an extended period of recovery and massive market gains. The chart reveals that dominance has declined sharply since its 2021 peak of around 20%. At the time of writing, the OTHERS.D dominance is around 7%. A wave trend indicator at the bottom of the chart is in deep negative territory around negative 50%, which is its lowest in history. Marks noted that such oversold conditions often precede strong reversals. It means that selling pressure has been exhausted and that a major rebound could soon begin. If this pattern repeats, altcoins may be entering one of their most attractive accumulation phases in years. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Top 10 Dominance. Source: Javon Marks on X Fed’s Monetary Shifts And Their Impact On Crypto Liquidity Another technical perspective came from analyst Ted Pillows, who compared current market conditions to the 2019-2020 cycle when the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening (QT) and later resumed quantitative easing (QE). His chart of the crypto total market cap excluding Bitcoin shows a 42% decline following the end of QT in late 2019, followed by an explosive recovery after the Fed initiated QE in March 2020. Pillows explained that while ending QT may ease financial pressure, it does not directly inject liquidity into the economy, something altcoins need to rally. In contrast, QE or Treasury General Account (TGA) releases flood the market with liquidity and allow inflows into cryptocurrencies. He noted that ending QT isn’t enough for alts to rally. It is either the Fed starts another QE or the Treasury releases TGA liquidity into the economy. The most feasible option right now is the second one. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC. Source: Ted Pillows On X With the US government currently in a shutdown, he suggested that a TGA-driven liquidity release may occur once the fiscal impasse is resolved, and this will serve as the next major driving force for the altcoin market.

He explains that the value of XRP stems from its foundational role in the XRP Ledger. He believes many people misunderstand XRP by comparing it to stablecoins or other tokens, but that view misses the main point. Mickle Says XRP’s Value Is ‘Foundational,’ Not Just A Pitch In a recent X post, Mickle said that most people in crypto still do not understand what makes XRP special . He explained that when people ask, “What’s the current pitch for XRP?” they are asking the wrong question. To him, XRP does not need a sales pitch because its value is foundational. The cryptocurrency doesn’t depend on price movements, short-term excitement, or temporary stories. Instead, it is part of the very system that powers the XRP Ledger. Mickle compared XRP to well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that they share common traits. They are native, non-issued assets that exist without a counterparty, meaning they are not created or backed by any one company or government. Like these leading cryptocurrencies, XRP provides the liquidity that allows value to move and settle across its decentralized network. According to Mickle, this is what gives XRP a lasting importance. It is not a token that depends on external promises or a central authority, but the heart of a decentralized system that operates independently. XRP Ledger Depends On XRP’s Native Role In Decentralized Settlement Mickle also suggests that the XRP Ledger cannot exist or operate without XRP. He said this is what many people miss when they compare XRP to other digital assets. The XRP ledger was built in a way that makes XRP an important part of how value moves and settles across the network. He noted that XRP’s speed, ability to handle many transactions, and connection with other systems make it stand out from most blockchains in the crypto space. Using Ripple’s payment tools as examples, Mickle showed how XRP plays a key role in helping different kinds of assets, like stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cryptocurrencies, move smoothly across decentralized systems. These tools make it possible to send money anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply, without going through banks or middlemen. Mickle added that XRP is a native digital asset, while stablecoins are tied to fiat money and rely on traditional financial systems to keep their value. He said this is what makes XRP unique and gives it real independence in the digital economy. This distinction, he said, is the very essence of crypto and the reason XRP continues to matter as a foundational digital asset . According to Mickle, understanding this difference is what separates those who genuinely understand crypto from those who do not.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 00:00:25

Billions of people across the world are going to be left out due to various reasons like language barriers and electricity availability, and fuel inequalities, as outlined in the tech firm’s “AI Diffusion Report,” which outlines how AI use, infrastructure, and innovation are spreading globally. Language barriers worsen the global inequality in AI While Microsoft acknowledges that AI tech is fast growing and spreading like no other tech before, there are fears this AI wave will not be experienced by everyone in the world therefore “deepen global inequality.” According to the Microsoft report , most AI models are trained in English, which means billions across the world cannot access the technology in their native languages. According to Microsoft, AI speaks English. The report indicates that while English and other high-resource languages are used to train AI, the majority of the world’s 7,000 languages are effectively excluded from AI systems, therefore limiting access for billions of people. According to Microsoft, low-resource languages like Hausa, Bengali, and Chichewa are under-represented in major AI developments, therefore limiting access to users in those regions who cannot interact with tools that cannot understand them. The tech giant opines that unless digital infrastructure and education catch up, “this gap will define who benefits from AI for decades to come” and could cement a new technological divide. Microsoft cites the stark infrastructure gap as problematic In this report, Microsoft indicated that over 1.2 billion people now use AI tools, which the tech giant admitted the adoption rate far outpaced electricity, computers and the internet. However, despite this rapid adoption and spread of the technology, Microsoft maintains that the diffusion is not even. In the report, Microsoft highlights the widening gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots” citing countries with power, data, and skills to use AI, and those that still lack the basics. Countries like UAE, with 59.4% adoption, Singapore at 58.6%, and Norway with 51.9% are leading the world in AI use. According to Microsoft, these countries have vast electricity, near-universal internet access, and while their populations are digitally fluent. Yet in some parts of Sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, fewer than 10% of the populations use AI due to factors like low internet penetration, unreliable power, and limited access to the devices as well as the basic education to needed to use new technologies. In Africa, Microsoft recently highlighted the vast opportunities for AI developments. It however demands coordinated, inclusive effort involving governments, education systems, industry and civil society, according to Microsoft. “The challenge is not only scale, but also coordination. Fragmented efforts and a lack of unified strategy continue to slow momentum and dilute impact,” said Microsoft. “To fully realize AI’s potential for job creation, Africa must build a coordinated, inclusive skilling ecosystem, where government, education, industry, and civil society work together to shape the AI economy,” added Microsoft . The report also highlights the infrastructure gap that exists between countries, which has an impact on AI adoption. In terms of energy, the US leads with 53.7 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity followed by China with 31.9GW, then Germany with 8.5GW, and the United Kingdom with 7.4GW. According to the report the AI diffusion is dependent on electricity and computing capacity as much as on algorithms or data, and that over 700 million people still lack reliable power.

Nasdaq-listed Bitmain, a company increasingly focused on digital asset investments, has just made another substantial Bitmain ETH investment . This latest acquisition signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future, capturing the attention of investors and market watchers alike. What Does Bitmain’s Latest ETH Investment Entail? According to a report by Onchainlens, Bitmain recently acquired an additional 7,660 Ethereum (ETH) tokens. This impressive purchase is valued at approximately $29.54 million, executed through the well-known digital asset financial services firm, Galaxy Digital. This transaction underscores Bitmain’s continued strategy to bolster its holdings in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This substantial Bitmain ETH investment is not an isolated event. It reflects a growing trend among institutional entities to diversify their portfolios with leading digital assets. For Bitmain, which has historically been a dominant force in Bitcoin mining hardware, this consistent accumulation of Ethereum represents a strategic pivot and a clear belief in the platform’s long-term potential. Why is Bitmain Deepening Its Ethereum Commitment? Bitmain’s decision to continuously invest in Ethereum stems from several compelling factors. Ethereum is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is a robust blockchain platform that powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its utility and innovation continue to attract significant developer activity and user adoption. Moreover, Ethereum’s successful transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with ‘The Merge’ has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. This upgrade makes Ethereum an even more attractive asset for long-term holders like Bitmain. The company likely views its Bitmain ETH investment as a way to capitalize on Ethereum’s ongoing evolution and its pivotal role in the future of Web3. Impact of Bitmain’s ETH Investment on the Broader Market When a prominent, Nasdaq-listed firm like Bitmain makes such a significant investment, it sends a powerful signal to the entire crypto market. This move can boost investor confidence, particularly among institutional players who often look for cues from their peers. Such large-scale acquisitions can also contribute to positive price momentum for Ethereum, as demand increases.

The latest update on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that fear continues to grip the cryptocurrency market. This crucial indicator, which provides a snapshot of investor sentiment, recently rose four points to 33. While a slight increase, it still firmly places the market in a state of ‘fear,’ according to data from Alternative.me. Understanding this index is vital for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market. It operates on a simple principle: extreme fear can signal a buying opportunity, while excessive greed often indicates a market correction is imminent. This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly emotional, which can lead to irrational decisions. How exactly does this index arrive at its score? It’s a sophisticated calculation, pulling data from various corners of the crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of its key components: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. Higher volatility often suggests a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): Analyzing current trading volumes and momentum helps determine if there’s strong buying or selling pressure. Social Media Mentions (15%): Tracking keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter can reveal widespread emotional responses. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin market cap dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived ‘safer’ asset. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for crypto-related terms helps identify public interest and potential panic or excitement. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does a Score of 33 Imply? A score of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market is experiencing significant fear. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, many seasoned investors view periods of high fear as potential opportunities. When fear is high, prices often drop, creating a chance to acquire assets at lower valuations. However, it also presents challenges: Potential for Panic Selling: New or inexperienced investors might sell their holdings at a loss due to widespread fear. Increased Volatility: Fearful markets can be unpredictable, with sharp price swings. Uncertainty: The future direction of the market becomes less clear, demanding careful research. Conversely, a score closer to 100, indicating ‘extreme greed,’ often signals that the market might be overheated and due for a correction. Historically, buying during extreme fear and selling during extreme greed has proven to be a successful strategy for some. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Respond to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index points to fear, it’s a signal to act thoughtfully, not impulsively. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Use this time to delve into projects you believe have strong fundamentals. Lower prices can make strong assets more attractive. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consistently invest a fixed amount over time. This strategy helps mitigate risk in volatile markets. Manage Emotions: The index itself is a reminder that emotions drive markets. Avoid making decisions based purely on fear or excitement. Stick to your investment plan. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help weather market downturns. Remember, the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. It provides valuable context, but individual investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. The Enduring Value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in a Dynamic Market In conclusion, the current reading of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index underscores a market still wrestling with apprehension. While this state of fear can be daunting, it also presents a unique opportunity for those who approach it with a well-informed and disciplined strategy. By understanding the components of this index and its historical implications, investors can make more rational decisions, potentially turning market anxiety into long-term gains. It’s a powerful reminder that in the world of crypto, emotional intelligence can be as valuable as market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a low score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicate? A low score, particularly below 25, indicates ‘extreme fear.’ This suggests that investors are highly anxious, often leading to panic selling and lower asset prices. Historically, these periods have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment based on the latest data points from volatility, trading volume, social media, and other factors. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index solely based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market cap dominance is one factor, the index considers broader market sentiment indicators, including social media mentions and Google search trends that often reflect overall cryptocurrency interest, not just Bitcoin specifically. Q4: Can I rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used as one of many tools in your investment analysis. It provides valuable insight into market psychology but should be combined with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your personal financial strategy.

Tokens sit at $0.035 in Phase 6, 80% filled after a 250% climb from $0.01, setting up 400% gains to the $0.06 launch. This setup echoes Solana’s early surge, where utility met timing for massive returns. As the best crypto to buy now, MUTM offers DeFi entry at a fraction of future value, urging quick action before Phase 7’s 20% jump to $0.04. What crypto to buy now? One that mirrors proven winners like SOL, blending accessibility with growth potential that savvy holders have already spotted. Solana’s 2020-2021 Run: A Blueprint for Explosive Gains Solana has had an astonishing growth rate since its inception in 2020. The coin hit a nadir of $0.51 in May but soon rocketed to $260 in November 2021. The growth took a whopping 18 months to achieve a staggering 51,000% return on investment. The lucky few that invested in SOL when it hit rock bottom cashed in on its scalability and made life-changing gains. As the best crypto to buy now fades into yesterday’s news, echoes of SOL’s rise prompt a hunt for the next altcoin ready to replicate such multiples. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has stepped into that spotlight, offering DeFi crypto seekers a comparable launchpad at today’s $0.035. MUTM’s Presale Phases Lock in Early Advantages Mutuum Finance has structured its presale in 11 distinct phases to cap sales at a predefined price as a token of appreciation for contributors. However, Phase 6 is racing past incredibly as 80% has sold out for delivering tokens to buyers worth $0.035. There has been a phenomenal 250% increase in token value from Phase 1’s price of $0.01. The number of holders is 17,600 and has pumped in a total of $18,250,000 to this structure that has proved its allure as the top crypto to invest in to ensure a gradual growth. The DeFi crypto community has joined hand in hand since Phase 6 is close to completion. Community Giveaways Add to Holder Enthusiasm MUTM Finance has really kick-started its presale with a giveaway event where a total of $100,000 reward is given out in a way that $10,000 is won by 10 lucky winners out of its 17,600 holders. The event has really helped to attract more funds to MUTM. As a powerhouse in the world of altcoins, MUTM has made passive investment an active pursuit, where a single entry can yield a windfall over and above your foundation. Quickly realized gains in this area have led investors to understand that better gains come with a deeper level of loyalty. Thus emerges MUTM as the top crypto to buy and hold. Buy-and-Distribute Fuels Token Demand Mutuum Finance has a buy-and-distribute system in place where it directs all fees from its protocol to buy back MUTM tokens on open markets and subsequently distribute to stakers. As a result, this has created a value loop that enhances MUTM tokens. Currently, with a total of $18,250,000 raised for this project, MUTM has emerged as a DeFi crypto specially designed to increase in value. Stakers have watched distributions pad their yields, turning protocol success into personal wins that keep capital locked in. As altcoin cycles heat up, this loop has promised compounding edges, where fees from expanding use recycle into holder benefits. Early movers at $0.035 have positioned for 400% to launch, but this feature elevates long-term holds, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now for effortless upside. Security Audits Forge Unshakable Trust Mutuum Finance has emphasized safety as a well-audited project with a CertiK audit with a safety level of 90/100 for its tokens and a total bug bounty reward of $50,000 that urges security specialists to investigate for vulnerabilities even prior to its launch. The bounty reward amounts are tiered: $200 to $2,000 for critical vulnerabilities has reassured some 17,600 investors of its mutual fund safety. Thus, MUTM is solidified as a worthy choice for risk-averse DeFi cryptocurrency traders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured Solana’s essence at $0.035, where presale smarts and trust mechanisms promise 51,000%-style leaps for the best crypto to buy now. This DeFi crypto has primed portfolios for altcoin dominance, recapping SOL’s blueprint with modern edges.

The sharp sell-off on October 10 not only flushed leveraged positions across the market but also disrupted the uptrend ETH had been building throughout the summer. Since then, price action has weakened, and momentum has shifted toward the downside, raising concerns among analysts that a deeper correction could unfold if buyers fail to defend key demand levels in the days ahead. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite these technical challenges, on-chain and institutional flow data tell a different story beneath the surface. Large-scale investors — including funds, corporate entities, and crypto-native institutions — continue to accumulate ETH during the pullback. The divergence between price weakness and institutional accumulation creates a pivotal setup for Ethereum. If ETH can stabilize and reclaim the $4,000 threshold, it may re-ignite bullish momentum. But failure to hold support could open the door to further downside before a sustainable recovery emerges. Bitmine Adds ETH as Institutional Accumulation Climbs According to data tracked by Lookonchain, institutional player Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation strategy. Purchasing 44,036 ETH — worth approximately $166 million — during the recent market pullback. This purchase lifts Bitmine’s total holdings to roughly 3.16 million ETH, valued at around $12.15 billion, reinforcing the company’s position as one of the largest Ethereum holders globally. Such sizeable buying activity during periods of price weakness highlights a notable divergence between institutional behavior and short-term market sentiment. While retail traders and leveraged participants may be shaken by Ethereum’s inability to reclaim the $4,000 level, long-horizon buyers appear unfazed. For them, price dips represent accumulating opportunities rather than reasons for concern. This duality is becoming increasingly evident across the market: spot inflows, exchange outflows, and whale accumulation metrics all point to growing long-term conviction, even as the chart reflects hesitation and downward pressure. This divergence underscores a familiar pattern in crypto market structure. Price action often lags underlying fundamentals, particularly during transitional phases where macro catalysts and liquidity shifts are still being digested. Ethereum remains structurally supported by rising institutional participation, increasing staking demand, and expanding Layer-2 ecosystems — all of which strengthen its long-term investment thesis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Records Over $300B Spot Volume In October – Investors Shift Away From Leverage Ethereum Tests Key Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $3,847, testing a critical support zone after failing to hold above $4,000 and rejecting from the $4,200 resistance area earlier this week. The daily chart shows ETH breaking below both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling weakening momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market posture. This breakdown places increased pressure on bulls to defend the $3,800 region — a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point over the past two months. If ETH loses this support, the next meaningful demand zone lies near $3,500, followed by the 200-day moving average around $3,200, which would serve as a deeper structural retest within the longer-term uptrend. For now, however, ETH remains above its long-term trend line, meaning the broader bullish structure is intact despite short-term weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens After 8 Years – 1,500 ETH Sent to Kraken After 8 Years On the upside, bulls need to reclaim $4,000 and then $4,150–$4,200 to revive bullish momentum and break the series of lower highs forming since September. Until that happens, price action favors consolidation and caution. With macro shifts underway and institutional accumulation rising, Ethereum’s chart suggests a wait-and-see phase, where holding support becomes crucial before any renewed upside attempt.

His recent statements have drawn sharp attention across the broader crypto community, particularly for their bold claims about XRP’s role in a truly decentralized financial ecosystem. Ripple CTO Highlights XRP Ledger’s Unique Autonomy An X social media account named ‘Stellar Ripple’ has spotlighted a statement from Schwartz, underscoring what he sees as a defining difference between the XRP Ledger and other blockchain networks. Stellar Ripple stated in its post on Thursday that the Ripple CTO dropped a “truth bomb,” cutting deep into the philosophy of decentralization within blockchains. In his post, Schwartz questioned whether users want to be their own bank or empower another intermediary in disguise. According to him, despite the decentralized branding of blockchain networks , they are ultimately designed for control, allowing certain participants to set the rules, impose transaction fees, and maintain leverage over users’ financial autonomy. In contrast, he described the XRP Ledger as a space free from such mediators, government influence , and protocols that could freeze or reverse transactions. This suggests that XRPL represents a purer or more superior interpretation of the decentralization narrative, where every transaction remains unalterable, resistant to censorship, and uncontrolled . Schwartz went on to explain that, unlike most digital assets, XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, exists as the only counterparty-free currency that anyone in the world can access without risk of default or confiscation. He noted that this unique feature helps XRP gain value from the activity generated on the blockchain network . Essentially, this implies that XRP’s price is intertwined with the growth of the ledger itself, providing a foundational layer that ensures liquidity and stability across every transaction. XRPL Expands Into Genomic Data Anchoring As the XRPL ecosystem continues to grow , real-world adoption is gaining momentum. Crypto commentator John Squire recently pointed out an exciting new development from DNA Protocol, a system that anchors DNA to the XRP Ledger. According to the report, DNAOnChain has officially launched operations in Tunisia, extending its reach to broader markets. Notably, this project marks a significant expansion of XRPL’s use cases by anchoring genomic identity data directly on the blockchain. Through DNAOnChain, Squire states that certified laboratories can now securely record and verify genomic data on XRPL, effectively bridging biotechnology with blockchain innovation. The integration is expected to enhance transparency and immutability in medical and genetic research , ensuring that sensitive information is permanently verifiable without compromising privacy. More importantly, this new development signals XRPL’s versatility beyond cross-border payments , highlighting its potential as a data integrity layer for real-world applications. It also demonstrates XRP’s growing adoption in new industries beyond digital assets and finance.","Ripple|David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz|DNA Protocol|DNAOnChain|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 01:00:19

A significant sum of 250 million USDC minted has been reported at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a signal indicating shifts in market demand and liquidity within the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the implications of such a large issuance is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Understanding Why USDC Gets Minted When we hear about new USDC minted , it means new stablecoins have been created. But why does this happen? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It maintains a stable value, making it a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. The minting process is typically demand-driven. Increased Demand: Investors want to convert fiat currency into USDC to participate in DeFi, trade on exchanges, or hold a stable asset. Market Liquidity: More USDC means more liquidity for trading pairs, lending, and borrowing protocols. On-ramping: It serves as a gateway for new capital entering crypto, moving large sums efficiently. Circle, the issuer of USDC, mints new tokens only when there is a corresponding deposit of US dollars into their reserve accounts. This ensures each USDC is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. What Does This USDC Minted Event Signify? The minting of 250 million USDC minted is a substantial event, often pointing to several potential market scenarios. Such a large influx of stablecoins can have various ripple effects.

A significant event recently caught the attention of the crypto community: a massive 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This report, flagged by Whale Alert, signals substantial activity within the stablecoin ecosystem. When such a large amount of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency like USDC is created, it often sparks questions about market demand, liquidity, and the broader implications for digital finance. Let’s explore what this significant minting event truly means for investors and the wider crypto landscape. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Event Signify? The creation of 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is more than just a number; it reflects dynamic forces at play in the cryptocurrency market. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is backed by fully reserved assets, primarily cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. When new USDC is minted, it typically indicates a rising demand for dollar-denominated digital assets. This demand can stem from various sources: Increased Investor Inflow: New capital entering the crypto market, often converted into stablecoins before being deployed into other cryptocurrencies. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: More users participating in DeFi protocols, requiring stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions or corporations using stablecoins for settlement, remittances, or as a treasury asset. Essentially, this minting suggests that more people or entities want to hold or use digital dollars within the blockchain ecosystem. It’s a clear indicator of growing confidence and utility for stablecoins. The Mechanics Behind a USDC Mint How exactly does USDC minted come into existence? The process is straightforward and regulated. Circle, the issuer of USDC, works with regulated financial institutions. When an authorized participant wants to acquire USDC, they deposit an equivalent amount of US dollars into a Circle-managed bank account. Once the funds are verified, Circle instructs the smart contract to mint the corresponding amount of new USDC. These newly created tokens are then delivered to the participant’s crypto wallet. This mechanism ensures that every USDC token in circulation is backed by an actual dollar or dollar-equivalent asset held in reserve, providing its stability. This transparent, auditable process is crucial for maintaining trust in USDC as a reliable stablecoin. Regular attestations by independent accounting firms further verify these reserves. Implications for the Crypto Market and Beyond A significant amount of USDC minted can have several ripple effects across the crypto market: Enhanced Liquidity: More USDC in circulation means greater liquidity, making it easier and more efficient to trade between different cryptocurrencies. This can reduce slippage and improve overall market efficiency. Fueling DeFi Growth: Stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi. Additional USDC can be deployed into various DeFi protocols, increasing total value locked (TVL) and potentially boosting yields for participants. Gateway for Traditional Finance: For institutions looking to enter the crypto space, stablecoins like USDC offer a less volatile entry point compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Large mints can signal increasing institutional interest and readiness to engage with digital assets. Global Remittances and Payments: USDC facilitates faster and cheaper international transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Increased supply can support greater adoption in these use cases. While the immediate impact might be a boost in market liquidity, the long-term implications point towards a maturing and expanding digital economy where stablecoins play a central role. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: What Users Should Know Understanding the dynamics of USDC minted and its role is important for any crypto participant. Here are some key takeaways: Stability: USDC offers a haven from crypto market volatility, making it suitable for storing value or executing trades without exposure to price swings. Utility: It’s widely accepted across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it a versatile asset for various financial activities. Transparency: Circle’s commitment to regular audits and public attestations provides a level of transparency regarding its reserves, which is vital for trust. However, it is also important to consider the centralized nature of USDC. While this offers stability and regulatory compliance, it also means reliance on a central issuer. Users should always be aware of the underlying mechanisms and potential regulatory shifts that could impact stablecoins. The recent minting of 250 million USDC underscores the growing demand for stable, reliable digital assets in the evolving financial landscape. This event highlights increased market activity, whether from individual investors or institutional players, seeking the benefits of blockchain technology without the inherent volatility of other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to expand, stablecoins like USDC will undoubtedly remain a crucial component, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of decentralized applications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC, or USD Coin, is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. It is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability makes it a popular choice for traders and investors looking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why is USDC minted? A2: USDC is minted in response to demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire USDC, they deposit US dollars with Circle, the issuer. For every dollar deposited and verified, a new USDC is created, or “minted,” ensuring that each USDC in circulation is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. Q3: Who issues USDC? A3: USDC is issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company. Circle collaborates with various financial institutions to manage the reserves that back USDC and ensure its operational integrity and compliance. Q4: How does a large USDC mint affect the crypto market? A4: A large amount of USDC minted often indicates increased demand for stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. This can lead to enhanced market liquidity, making it easier for traders to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies. It can also signal new capital entering the market or increased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Q5: Is USDC safe to use? A5: USDC is generally considered one of the safer stablecoins due to its regulatory compliance, transparent reserve attestations, and backing by high-quality assets. However, like all financial instruments, it carries some risks, including potential regulatory changes or reliance on the central issuer, Circle. Users should always conduct their own research.

Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss Hit Just 1.3% Recently In a new post on X, senior researcher at on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, CryptoVizArt, has talked about how Bitcoin currently compares to past bearish periods in terms of Relative Unrealized Loss . The Unrealized Loss is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss (in USD) that BTC investors as a whole are carrying in their wallets. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the blockchain to find what price it was last moved at. If this previous transaction price was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token could be assumed to be sitting on some net unrealized loss right now. The exact amount of loss that the coin carries is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Unrealized Loss sums up this value for all loss tokens on the blockchain. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the indicator is of interest, called the Relative Unrealized Loss. This metric calculates the holder loss as a percentage of BTC’s market cap . The advantage of the Relative Unrealized Loss over the usual metric is that it makes a comparison across two different BTC cycles more reliable. Bitcoin has seen significant growth in stored capital with each cycle, so the absolute amount of loss held by investors in bear markets also rises with each cycle. By accounting for the market cap, the indicator normalizes the Unrealized Loss across cycles. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss has remained at low levels during the past few months, indicating that loss among holders has stayed low in comparison to the market cap. Even during the cryptocurrency’s latest drop, the indicator only reached a value of 1.3%, corresponding to investor loss being just 1.3% of the market cap. “In mild bear markets, this typically exceeds 5%, and in severe ones, it exceeds 50%,” explained the Glassnode researcher. “The market pain is still far from what defines a true bear phase.” It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin will develop in the coming days, and whether the Relative Unrealized Loss will cross one of the bear market thresholds. BTC Price Bitcoin fell below $107,000 during its recent decline, but the coin has since seen a small rebound back to $109,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bear Market|Bitcoin Pain|Bitcoin unrealized loss|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 02:00:58

Dogecoin Whales Shed 440 Million Tokens Over Last 72 Hours As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, whales have reduced their Dogecoin supply over the past few days. The indicator cited by the analyst is the “Supply Distribution” from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of DOGE that investors belonging to a given coin range are holding as a whole. In the context of the current topic, “whales” are the traders of interest. Their wallet range is typically defined as 10 million to 100 million tokens. At the current DOGE exchange rate, the lower end converts to $1.8 million and the upper end to $18 million. Given the scale, only big-money holders would be able to qualify for the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Hold Key Support: Could $88,000 Be Next? Such investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so movements related to them can be worth watching. Their behavior doesn’t always impact the memecoin’s price, but it can still be revealing about the sentiment among this key cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution of the whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales have seen a sharp decline in their supply recently, indicating that these humongous holders have been distributing. In total, the group has shed 440 million DOGE (worth $81.4 million) from its collective holdings during the last 72 hours. Alongside this trend, the DOGE price has slid down, implying that the whale selloff may have had a role to play. The Supply Distribution of this cohort could now be monitored, as where it goes next could potentially contain hints about what’s coming for the cryptocurrency’s price. Earlier in the week, Martinez shared another chart related to Dogecoin, this one showing a technical analysis (TA) pattern that DOGE has been trading inside on the 12-hour timeframe. From the graph, it’s visible that the pattern in question is an Ascending Channel, a type of consolidation channel that appears whenever an asset trades between two parallel trendlines sloped upward. The support line of the channel is located at $0.18. In the post, the analyst noted that holding this level could be key for DOGE. Following the whale selling, the coin is now retesting the level, with a brief fall below it even happening on Thursday, before the memecoin recovered back above it on Friday.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published Friday, Scott said both governments had reached a kind of balance before China decided to “fire shots” by threatening to cut off exports of critical minerals. That, he warned, crossed a line. He said China will not be able to keep using rare earths as a tool of pressure, especially now that it showed its hand. Scott pointed out that the United States sees the move as a major miscalculation.By showing its willingness to use rare earths to hit back, China exposed itself. Washington is already pushing for alternatives, and this new escalation has only sped things up. Scott said the U.S. and its partners no longer have the luxury of assuming those minerals will be freely available. Scott, the soybean farmer, says he’s felt the pain too Scott also took a moment to talk about the other front in this trade fight: soybeans. During an interview with Martha Raddatz on ABC News, Scott said, “I’m actually a soybean farmer… I have felt this pain, too.” China’s been effectively blocking U.S. soybeans for months, and Scott happens to be one of the people impacted. Sort of. He owns farmland in North Dakota where soybeans and corn are grown. His holdings are worth somewhere between $5 million and $25 million, and they generate between $100,000 and $1 million a year, based on his financial disclosure. But let’s not pretend Scott’s depending on those crops. Forbes says his net worth is about $600 million. So when China, once America’s biggest buyer, slapped heavy tariffs on soybeans in May, after President Donald Trump imposed duties on Chinese imports, the pain wasn’t evenly spread. Since the tariffs, China hasn’t bought any American soybeans at all. Regular farmers, the ones who depend on crop sales, are the ones really feeling it. Scott said the embargo is hurting, but the truth is, he can take the hit better than most. Still, the fact that the Treasury Secretary is directly affected by a trade standoff with China adds a strange twist. TikTok deal moves forward after Trump order On top of the rare earths and soybeans, Scott said the TikTok deal is finally getting off the ground. During an interview with Fox Business, he confirmed that in Kuala Lumpur, both sides finalized the agreement and are waiting for it to move ahead. “I would expect that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we’ll finally see a resolution to that,” he said. The fight over TikTok has dragged on for more than a year and a half. In 2024, Congress passed a law ordering TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell off the app’s U.S. assets by January 2025. Trump followed that up with an executive order on September 25, saying the sale plan meets the law’s national security conditions. The clock’s ticking. Buyers have 120 days to seal the deal, and Trump pushed the final deadline to January 20, 2026. Under the new plan, ByteDance will only hold less than 20% of TikTok U.S. and get just one seat out of seven on the new board. The other six will be Americans. The app’s algorithm, used by 170 million Americans, will be retrained and monitored by U.S. cybersecurity partners, with full control shifting to the new joint venture. Even so, John Moolenaar, the Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, is still not sold. He said the licensing agreement for the algorithm, which is part of the deal, “would raise serious concerns.” China’s Commerce Ministry, on its end, said it plans to “properly handle” the matter and will work with the U.S. to sort out remaining issues.

The discussions are still under due diligence though, so nothing is finalized. The deal may close later this year or early next year, but terms could still change and the entire plan could fall apart. This has not been announced publicly, and those speaking on the matter apparently requested anonymity. Coinbase Ventures, the venture capital arm of Coinbase, is already an existing investor in BVNK. Representatives for BVNK did not respond to inquiries. The largest US crypto exchange said: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation. Driven by our mission to expand economic freedom globally, we actively explore various opportunities — whether through building, acquiring, partnering, or investing — to advance our mission.” The tone is neutral, but the move fits with Coinbase’s push to expand outside pure trading revenue. Coinbase pushes deeper into stablecoins and payments Reports earlier this week said Coinbase has exclusivity in the takeover talks.That means no other bidders are actively in the running now.The talks followed a full bidding process. The timing lines up with increased activity in the stablecoin market after the first U.S. regulation for stablecoins passed in July. Since then, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, along with major banks, have been testing blockchain‑based tools for faster and cheaper payments. Almost 20% of Coinbase’s Q3 revenue came from stablecoins, according to the company’s shareholder letter released Thursday. The exchange has been pushing to drive more usage of USDC, the stablecoin it earns revenue from in partnership with Circle. One example: a payments integration with Shopify. On a call after earnings, Coinbase executives said they are actively searching for acquisitions in the payments sector, confirming that this direction is a core expansion plan. BVNK runs a platform that lets merchants accept payments, including in stablecoins. This is where the deal matters. Earlier this year, Coinbase launched Coinbase Business, a service for payments, invoicing, and financial operations. BVNK’s system could be plugged into that to create a stablecoin‑based banking and payments experience for companies that do not want to depend on traditional banking rails. BVNK was founded in 2021 and has raised $90 million in funding. Its investors include Citi Ventures, Haun Ventures, and Visa. If the deal closes, Coinbase would take another step away from depending on trading volumes. If it fails, nothing changes except that we all now know exactly what direction Coinbase is steering toward; payments built on stablecoins. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Bitcoin dropped below $109,000, highlighting the fragility of investor confidence. High leverage positions fueled the cascade, erasing gains made over the past week. While traders panic and market sentiment swings between extreme fear and false optimism, one project seems untouched: Noomez ($NNZ) . Its off-exchange presale structure protects investors from price swings, proving that not every market dip means danger. Why Did Crypto Crash? A mix of overleveraged longs and uncertainty around macroeconomic indicators triggered this correction. When Bitcoin’s chart broke below key support levels, automated liquidations accelerated across the market. The entire ecosystem followed as altcoins tumbled, and liquidity evaporated. Noomez , however, operates on its own timeline. It isn’t tied to centralized exchange volatility or speculative whale movements. Each presale stage runs independently, giving early backers clear visibility on price, supply, and distribution. Why Did Crypto Crash Today? Short-term data shows that the recent drop came after another spike in Bitcoin open interest, followed by a sudden flush-out. On platforms like CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s 24-hour volume jumped, reflecting panic selling more than organic trading. Meanwhile, Noomez continues its presale momentum. The live tracker shows over $4,500 raised and 39 holders in its first stage, a sign of steady early participation even as the broader market contracts. Such a quiet confidence underscores how structured presales, like Noomez, are designed to withstand volatility. Will Crypto Crash Again? What Comes Next Market corrections are a natural part of every bull cycle. The key isn’t predicting the next fall but positioning before the recovery. Historically, markets that shed excess leverage early tend to rebound stronger once liquidity returns. That’s why seasoned investors are allocating small, calculated portions of their portfolios into early-stage tokens like Noomez ($NNZ) . It’s a strategy based on timing and entering while others hesitate, before prices begin their inevitable climb. The Noomez Presale: Structure Amid Chaos Unlike hype-driven tokens, Noomez built a system that rewards patience and transparency. The Noomez presale accepts multiple blockchains: ETH, BTC, BSC, SOL, and BASE, making it accessible to a wider audience. Every transaction updates in real-time, with total raised and holder counts publicly displayed. At its current token price of $0.00001 , early participants are securing positions before the next price bump. Each phase has a fixed supply, and unsold tokens are burned at end‑of‑stage, adding a deflationary element. With 28 stages in total, each structured phase ensures sustainable growth instead of artificial spikes. A Safer Haven for Uncertain Times While centralized exchanges flash red and sentiment collapses after the Crypto Crash , Noomez keeps building. Its deflationary tokenomics, locked liquidity, and real-time data feed create a transparent foundation that traditional projects lack. Investors are committing to a long-term system built for steady growth rather than short-term speculation. Countless projects rise and fall through cycles, but few manage to stay grounded when volatility peaks. Noomez ($NNZ) feels like one of those rare cases where preparation meets opportunity. Pro Tip: Watch how fast the early presale stages fill. In volatile markets, consistent progress is often the clearest signal of investor trust.

53887192,618046,1761966014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53887192.jpeg,Bitcoin Flatlines As LTH Distribution Hits 810K Coins: Demand Still Absorbing Supply,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-flatlines-lth-distribution-hits-810k-demand/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim the $110,000 level after a sharp downside move pressured markets and triggered renewed volatility across the crypto landscape. While this pullback has been uncomfortable for short-term traders, it remains modest compared to the October 10 liquidation crash, which forced out excessive leverage and marked one of the most aggressive sell-offs of the year. Despite the short-term turbulence, Bitcoin remains within its broader consolidation range — but the market now enters a critical phase where direction must soon resolve. Over the coming weeks, macro developments, liquidity flows, and investor positioning will likely determine whether the next impulse is upward or downward. Fresh CryptoQuant data shows that since July 1, long-term holders (LTHs) have been steadily distributing coins, selling into strength as BTC approached and later tested all-time highs. This supply overhang has contributed to muted upside momentum, even as demand has proven strong enough to absorb much of the selling. Bitcoin Market Still Absorbs Supply According to analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin continues to navigate a complex supply-demand environment defined by steady profit-taking from long-term holders (LTHs). Since July 1, LTHs have distributed roughly 810,000 BTC, reducing their total holdings from 15.5 million to 14.6 million BTC. This represents one of the most significant distribution phases in the current cycle — a clear indication that seasoned holders have been locking in profits after years of accumulation and strategic positioning. What makes this dynamic particularly striking is that Bitcoin has printed new all-time highs twice during this distribution phase, demonstrating that market demand has remained robust enough to absorb the substantial supply being offloaded. Historically, similar phases of distribution from long-term holders often accompany major cycle inflection points, as capital shifts from early investors to new participants entering the market. Adler emphasizes that while this absorption reflects market strength, it also sets a ceiling on aggressive upside momentum. As long as long-term holders continue to realize profits, the path higher is likely to remain gradual and choppy rather than explosively parabolic. Strong demand is supporting prices and preventing deeper corrections — but supply pressure is simultaneously preventing sustained breakout acceleration. The takeaway is clear: Bitcoin is not lacking demand; it is working through supply once long-term distribution slows — whether due to exhaustion or macro reinforcement — upside potential could expand meaningfully. Until then, price action may continue to grind sideways with upside attempts meeting resistance as supply transitions to new owners. Bitcoin Holds Above Key MA Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $109,900, attempting to stabilize after a recent downside move pushed price back toward the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that currently sits near $108,000. This region has become an important defense line for bulls, structuring the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s consolidation range. Each time BTC has approached this zone over the past month, buyers have stepped in, signaling continued demand despite short-term weakness. However, reclaiming momentum remains a challenge. BTC continues to struggle below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, which have converged overhead and now act as layered resistance between $112,000 and $114,000. A sustained break above this cluster is required to re-establish bullish momentum and set up another attempt toward the $117,500 resistance — the cycle’s key Point of Control and the level that has repeatedly capped upside moves since summer. If Bitcoin loses the $108,000 support, a deeper correction toward $105,000–$103,000 becomes likely, where liquidity and previous reaction levels sit. For now, the technical picture remains neutral-to-cautious: bulls are holding essential support, but the burden remains on buyers to reclaim lost moving averages and flip market structure back in their favor.

SBET's ETH holdings generate yield through staking and more advanced DeFi strategies, enhancing returns beyond basic asset appreciation. Management is actively buying back shares and exploring DeFi opportunities, signaling confidence and strategic capital allocation to support shareholder value. Upgrading SBET from 'sell' to 'buy' due to its discounted valuation, productive ETH strategy, and potential for outperformance even if ETH trades sideways. Dare I say it, but the DAT craze of 2025 appears to have come back to reality. Maybe more than necessary, to be honest. When I initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) back in July, I called the stock a 'sell' based essentially entirely on the idea that buying SBET at 4x the value of the company's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) holdings was a silly idea. This has turned out to be another good call : Data by YCharts With Ethereum up over 9% since my July SBET piece, if you picked SBET over ETH thinking one of these DATs was going to get the Strategy ( MSTR ) treatment from the market forever, it hasn't worked out for you. SBET shares have given back over 50% since that July 18th article. Which by itself is notable because even at that time the stock was already well off its high prices from May - which at one point went well over $100 per share. Valuation To Holdings Today we find a drastically different setup. One where, rather than trading at several multiples over its ETH assets, shares of SBET are currently trading at a fairly large discount to the ETH that the company holds. As of intraday October 31st, SBET shares are trading at a significant discount to mNAV. The company holds roughly 860k ETH, which gives SharpLink an ETH net asset valuation of $3.6 billion. This is well ahead of the $2.9 billion market capitalization of the company's shares. ETH Holdings & NAV (SharpLink) At an average paid price of $3,609 per ETH, the company has about a $240 million unrealized ETH gain and has generated over 6.1k ETH in staking rewards. The key difference between Ethereum or even Solana ( SOL-USD ), based DATs compared to the presumably more familiar Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) DATs is that ETH and SOL can be productive assets beyond transaction payment tokens. For instance, ETH can be staked natively on chain or through a staking service to generate passive yields and help boost the security of the networks where they reside. This is a perfectly fine way to utilize PoS digital assets, but it doesn't necessarily make a DAT a better investment than a simple spot ETF that allows for staking . The latter of which is theoretically much safer and eliminates operational or dilution risk. But because of things like re-staking and DeFi lending, there are more complex ways to generate greater returns than basic staking yields, and SharpLink appears poised to do exactly that. Capital Allocation Strategy Back in early September , SharpLink began buying back shares and cited undervaluation as the primary reason for doing so. At that time, the company had bought back 939k shares at a price just under $16 per. At an intraday price on October 31st under $14 as of writing, these purchases don't look that great in hindsight. Yet, the ability to buy back its own stock when shares are at depressed levels on an mNAV basis are what separate ETH DATs from BTC DATs. If/ when MSTR begins to trade under an mNAV of 1 again , Strategy will have to either simply allow it, raise capital through debt or preferreds to buy back common, or sell Bitcoin to protect its equity valuation. Since the ETH that SharpLink has purchased is generating yield with very little overhead, management arguably has far better optionality in defending its share price than most BTC-based DATs do. SharpLink can realistically put a floor on its mNAV should it choose to do so. Since the company has reiterated that it won't tap the ATM to buy more ETH when SBET trades at an mNAV discount, dilution concerns should be fairly mitigated at current levels. More recently, SharpLink has expressed a willingness to go further out on the DeFi risk curve through ether.fi and EigenCloud . Through either.fi, SharpLink is essentially staking ETH for the passive network yield while also taking a more liquid derivative token of that ETH that can be utilized for lending or re-staking. Doing so adds a small amount of additional risk to the ETH holdings but it does allow the company to generate a small premium on the yield that it would generate from simply staking the ETH passively and leaving it locked. Rather than 3%, SharpLink could be looking at closer to 5% in a conservative re-staking strategy. At $200 million deployed capital, this is not a large amount of SharpLink's ETH hoard, as it's actually less than the company's unrealized gain from its ETH position. But it does allow management to show a competency in DeFi prowess and prove out the concept for shareholders before engaging with these types of networks to a larger degree. Closing Takeaways I actually kind of like SBET at this price. Even though I think Ethereum is arguably overpriced at 1,100x fees , the degree to which SharpLink can monetize that ETH beyond basic staking strategies is interesting. To be sure, more complex yield strategies introduce an additional element of risk to the company's operations. But I think those risks are necessary to make the company something worth investing in. Truthfully, it may no longer be fair of me to refer to SharpLink simply as an ""Ethereum Wrapper."" The fact of the matter is the company is starting to put its assets to work in a way that should benefit shareholder returns even in the event Ethereum somehow trades sideways for a considerable amount of time. I don't think sideways action is the most likely scenario for a variety of reasons. But if we're speculating on the prospects of new financial rails gaining wider adoption in global settlement, I believe Ethereum is a good network to wager on. And the companies that already hold substantial ETH and put that ETH to work could find themselves well positioned for the future. That we can now buy productive ETH at a discount to liquidation value is compelling. I'm upgrading SBET from 'sell' straight to 'buy.'",ETH-USD|MSTR|SBET,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-01 03:14:28

Every market cycle has a project that starts small and ends up dominating portfolios. The trick is catching it before everyone else does. Traders are chasing the next 100x crypto presale like it’s the last golden ticket. Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) remain strong contenders with solid fundamentals and growing ecosystems, but only one project is currently in presale and generating real excitement: MoonBull ($MOBU). With a mix of meme appeal, utility, and solid mechanics, it’s quickly becoming the community’s favorite underdog story. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Star of the Next 100x Crypto Presale MoonBull ($MOBU) is shaking up the crypto scene with a presale that’s both transparent and high-energy. Built on Ethereum, it’s a community-driven meme token with real mechanics like auto-liquidity, reflection rewards, and steady token burns that support long-term value. Its 23-stage presale model allows early believers to secure better prices with each round, making it one of the few tokens structured to actually deliver on the next 100x crypto presale potential. MoonBull’s fundamentals set it apart from typical meme coins. It’s fully audited, liquidity is locked, and community voting begins at Stage 12, allowing holders to vote on critical actions like surprise burns or marketing campaigns. These features show that MoonBull values trust and transparency from day one. MoonBull Presale Snapshot MoonBull’s presale is currently in its 5th stage at a price of $0.00006584, with over $500,000 raised and more than 1,700 holders. The projected ROI at listing ($0.00616) stands at an impressive 9,256%, while early buyers are already up by 163.36%. The next stage will raise the price by another 27.40%, adding even more urgency for new investors to secure their spot early. A $20,000 investment today would buy about 303,766,707.17 $MOBU tokens, which could be worth $1.87 million at listing. Cardano (ADA): Building Strength Through Upgrades Cardano (ADA) remains a leader in blockchain innovation. Its latest Hydra upgrade aims to boost scalability and make ADA transactions faster and cheaper. Recent analysis places ADA near a resistance of $0.88, with potential to rally toward $1.20 if buying momentum increases. The project’s focus on peer-reviewed development and real-world integration continues to earn it institutional respect. However, Cardano isn’t a presale project. It’s already a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem focused on maturity and adoption, not early-stage explosive growth. While whales have recently sold over 100 million ADA, analysts see this as market rotation rather than weakness. ADA’s consistent updates, governance improvements, and focus on interoperability position it as a long-term hold. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Powerhouse Polkadot (DOT) remains a top-tier network focused on connecting multiple blockchains. It recently announced a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano to expand enterprise adoption across Europe, and DOT’s inclusion in several ETF proposals shows growing institutional interest. The network also decided to cap its supply at 2.1 billion tokens, ending its inflation model and improving long-term token value. DOT’s technical outlook remains bullish, with analysts expecting a price range between $3.25 and $4.50 after a strong consolidation phase. These developments make Polkadot a reliable long-term investment, particularly for those who believe in multi-chain infrastructure. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, MoonBull ($MOBU) leads the pack as the next 100x crypto presale in 2025 . Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) remain strong and respected blockchains focused on scaling, governance, and institutional growth, but their days of exponential gains are behind them. MoonBull, on the other hand, offers early access, massive staking rewards, referral bonuses, and community control, all wrapped in a presale model that rewards early believers. The MoonBull presale is live right now, with new stages filling quickly and prices rising with each round. Every missed stage means paying more later. For those serious about spotting the next big mover before it lists, this could be the one. Early entry could turn modest investments into life-changing profits.

53887991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=847228,1761967810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53887991.jpeg,Analyst Predicts The ‘Unthinkable’ For XRP – Here’s What It Is,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/the-unthinkable-for-xrp/,"Crypto analyst @BullrunnersHQ on X social media has issued a new market update, suggesting that XRP may be on the verge of a major rally as traditional markets reach record highs. His latest technical breakdown links the recent strength in the NASDAQ to potential moves within the crypto sector, warning that the “unthinkable” is about to occur for XRP soon. The analyst highlighted that XRP’s price structure and broader crypto signals are aligning for a decisive move that could determine whether the current bull market cycle continues or starts to reverse. XRP Set For Unthinkable Upside Rally According to @BullrunnersHQ, the equity market is approaching critical levels that could dictate the next major trend in the crypto market and XRP price. Despite the crypto market struggling to reach similar highs, XRP remains firmly above the $2.50 range. He described this setup as “the unthinkable” moment for XRP, where the asset could finally break free from its prolonged consolidation and rally by “multiple hundreds of percent.” Related Reading: Forget Cardano, Why Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Is The Real Ghost Chain Notably, @BullrunnersHQ asserts that XRP’s price structure remains technically healthy despite market volatility. The analyst also noted that the overall crypto market cap and sentiment indicators have improved, with the Fear & Greed Index climbing to 42 from mid-October lows. He further emphasized that Bitcoin continues to hold comfortably above its 50-week EMA, showing a pattern consistent with previous rallies that led to new peaks. The analyst added that BTC’s new local high around $116,000 and a bullish crossover between the 10 EMA and 20 EMA suggest that momentum is returning to risk assets, setting the stage for XRP to outperform potentially. Notably, this period mirrors earlier market cycles where Bitcoin’s consolidation above key levels triggered explosive altcoin rallies. XRP, which has held its support much longer than most cryptocurrencies in the market, could climb to a new all-time high once momentum shifts. To support his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ has referenced crypto market expert and Chartist Peter Brandt’s discussion about whether the NASDAQ’s recent price action represents a breakaway or an exhaustion gap. While Brandt leans cautiously bearish from an equities standpoint, @BullerunnersHQ remains confident that even if stocks slightly pull back or halt temporarily, money could still rotate into cryptocurrencies, potentially fueling XRP’s next major rally. Analyst Warns Of Exhaustion Gap And End Of Bull Market In his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ also referenced crypto trader Abdullah, who believes that the NASDAQ’s rally also shows signs of an exhaustion gap, a signal often seen near the end of a bull market uptrend. Absullah points to overbought readings in both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic RSI on the weekly timeframe, indicating that the markets could be nearing the end of their current bull market phase. Related Reading: What The XRP RSI Making Higher Highs Means For The Price @BullrunnersHQ agreed that the market may be nearing exhaustion but reiterated that XRP’s position offers more upside potential compared to other assets. He also emphasized that Bitcoin must continue to hold between $107,000 and $109,000 on the weekly timeframe. A failure to do so could signal the end of the broader bull market.

With staking rewards, referral perks, and viral fun, it’s easy to see why it’s being considered one of the top altcoins to invest in 2025, turning tiny bites into jackpot-sized opportunities. Meanwhile, not all crypto bites come in mosquito size. Some are more like elephants sneaking into your wallet, or the slow drip of coffee funding your Netflix binge. Chainlink (LINK) quietly powers smart contracts, connecting real-world data to blockchain, while Monero (XMR) moves like a ninja, keeping transactions private and stealthy. Together, these coins illustrate that the crypto world balances viral mischief with strategy and stability, showing why investors exploring the top altcoins to invest in 2025 might include $CULEX alongside established coins. La Culex ($CULEX): The Swarm of Tiny Tokens with Giant Dreams La Culex is not your typical meme coin. Dubbed the “mosquito” of the crypto world, it combines playful branding with real mechanics: referrals to grow the swarm, high-yield staking to reward holders, and systematic token burns to create scarcity. According to the La Culex whitepaper, these mechanisms aim to keep the ecosystem buzzing and sustainable. Current stats as of October 29, 2025, show that La Culex is in Stage 3, called the Bug Spray Dip. The La Culex presale tally has already raised over $8,000, with 431 million tokens sold. A $5,000 investment nets approximately 219,876,869 tokens, and if the listing price hits $0.007, that could theoretically balloon to $1,539,138.08, a mind-boggling ROI of roughly 30,683% from Stage 3 to listing. Investors should note the risks: meme coins are volatile, presale tokens may not list immediately, and liquidity might be limited. Smart contract audits and tokenomics transparency are crucial. A well-informed investor treats La Culex like a mosquito, strike smart, avoid getting swatted by hype. Circulating supply is low relative to potential demand, which can fuel scarcity. Upcoming price surges (8.091% from $0.00002274 to $0.00002458) signal short-term momentum, but speculative swings remain high. Referral and staking incentives encourage long-term holding, while token burns create deflationary pressure. The combination of virality and financial mechanics makes La Culex a prime candidate for those exploring high-risk, high-reward top altcoins to invest in 2025. Meme culture adds another layer of engagement. Viral mosquito memes, like “tiny but mighty” or “bite today, profit tomorrow,” have helped the project gain social traction, showing the power of branding alongside tokenomics. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Powerhouse Unlike La Culex, Chainlink is a mature, utility-driven altcoin. LINK functions as a decentralized oracle network, bridging smart contracts with real-world data. As of today, Chainlink trades at $16.99 with a market cap of $11.84 billion. Its daily trading volume of $1.23 billion represents approximately 10.4% of its market cap, reflecting robust liquidity. LINK ranks #12 on CoinMarketCap, with 86% bullish sentiment among almost 875,000 community votes, signaling confidence from long-term holders. Key indicators for Chainlink investors include its circulating supply of 696.85 million LINK coins, high daily liquidity, and a well-established community. Analysts often watch LINK’s adoption in smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, which drives real utility and supports long-term price stability. Chainlink’s contrast to La Culex highlights the spectrum of altcoin risk: LINK offers slower, steadier growth with lower volatility, whereas La Culex promises rapid, speculative upside. Together, they illustrate why diversifying across meme coins and utility-driven altcoins can be a smart strategy for identifying top altcoins to invest in 2025. Monero (XMR): Privacy Meets Blockchain Monero is the veteran privacy-focused altcoin. XMR trades at $324.34, with a market capitalization of roughly $5.98 billion and a daily volume of $176.52 million (≈2.95% of market cap). XMR’s unlimited maximum supply does not dampen its appeal, as demand is driven by anonymity, security, and fungibility. Community sentiment shows 74% bullish vs. 26% bearish, indicating steady investor confidence in privacy-centric assets. Key indicators for Monero include its privacy protocol upgrades, circulating supply of 18.45 million XMR, and consistent adoption in privacy-conscious transactions. Analysts highlight XMR’s long-term sustainability, as regulatory scrutiny and censorship resistance become more important in the crypto space. For financial students and analysts, Monero exemplifies a lower-risk, utility-driven altcoin to complement high-risk meme tokens like La Culex. Combining privacy-focused coins with viral meme coins and mainstream utilities can provide a well-rounded portfolio for 2025. Final Thoughts: Let the Swarm Guide Your Crypto Journey Investing in the top altcoins to invest in 2025 is a mix of strategy, fun, and a little bit of daring. La Culex ($CULEX) shows how tiny, playful ideas can swarm into massive opportunities when paired with smart tokenomics, staking, and referral incentives. Chainlink offers a steady hand, bridging blockchain with real-world utility, while Monero adds the security and privacy every serious portfolio needs. Just like a mosquito can turn a peaceful night into a memorable nuisance, these coins prove that small moves, done wisely, can lead to big financial buzz. Diversifying across high-risk meme coins and utility-driven altcoins lets investors enjoy both the thrill of viral gains and the comfort of stability. Remember, the goal isn’t to chase every bite, but to identify which swarms can actually grow your nest egg while keeping the journey fun, engaging, and informed.

The thread includes screenshots, DMs, and direct allegations, none of which have not been independently verified, either by law enforcement, a recognized regulatory body, or Cryptopolitan. According to Mystral, many crypto projects including CateCoin were charged over $60,000 in listing fees, only to be asked for additional payments prior to listing. When they refused, tokens were never launched on the platform. A screenshot of an email from an MEXC listing manager shows alleged communication with CateCoin offering “marketing exposure” and urging for a quick reply. But the most serious accusation from Mystral was that MEXC froze over $10 million in user withdrawals, then closed support tickets without explanations. Source: Mystral/X One post from user @Tradecelb says he lost $18,500 USDT. Another, from @nitwitkook, claims MEXC froze $14,000 and only offered $3,000 back after public backlash, and still hasn’t paid. A third user on Reddit wrote that $30,000 in USDT and ETH were allegedly drained via internal MEXC wallets, with no 2FA and no support response. Claims of retaliation, manipulation, and fake engagement flood Mystral thread Mystral also accuses MEXC of trading against its own users, specifically opening short positions right before orchestrated liquidation spikes on low-cap tokens. Many X accounts backed this, alleging MEXC manipulates spot and futures markets, even shorting tokens it lists, and then blocking withdrawals once profits hit. User @van00sa posted that MEXC had been dumping tokens while shorting them at the same time, and then freezing funds to cover losses. Posts from CryptoVikings, MDXCrypto, and @OxNnachet accuse the exchange of silently profiting off user trades and blocking access when traders become too successful. One viral post from Mystral’s screenshots claims, “If you lose money, they keep it. If you win big, they lock your funds and accuse you of fraud.” Mystral also included screenshots alleging MEXC uses bot services to inflate likes, comments, and followers. According to Mystral, 40–50% of MEXC’s engagement across platforms is fake, citing analytics tied to social media botting panels. Mystral also shared a WhatsApp thread where a whistleblower supposedly claimed that MEXC exec Cecilia Hsueh’s X account was hacked, and that the hacker found “weird orgy vids” on her phone, allegedly involving many other MEXC senior execs. Source: Mystral/X A video referencing that material was included in the thread , with the X user claiming that the woman in the video was Cecilia, though Cryptopolitan could not confirm that, and some in the comments are saying the video was posted by a porn page on X over a year ago. Other big accounts, including @zachxbt, have since been demanding more transparency from MEXC, especially around the alleged “shadow owner” named Tony, who, according to Zach, remains hidden behind layers of offshore entities. Zach publicly asked, “Why does MEXC hide its beneficial owner from the public?” MEXC executive responds to some of Mystral’s accusations, admits internal failures Roughly one hour after the thread gained traction, Cecilia posted on X: “We f**ked up. We apologize to @TheWhiteWhaleV2, and his money is already released.” She also admitted that:- “I messed up in communicating with him. I got emotional, and I shouldn’t have. Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up.” Cecilia also acknowledged that the company’s risk, operations, and PR systems haven’t scaled with growth and promised change was coming. She didn’t address any sexual misconduct allegations, the leaked images, or the claims about botting or internal wallet theft. However, in a separate post shortly after, she claimed that:- “There’s a difference between risk control disputes and insolvency. MEXC’s financials are solid. The issue is operational.” Swing trade CryptoVikings replied to her apology saying: “If it took this much for an influencer to get funds back, what hope does a regular user have? There are 1,000+ cases like this.” When Cecilia replied “We are going to release them,” CryptoVikings pushed back again: “Why now? Why did it take months of backlash for you to act?” Cecilia went silent after that. User claims $3.3M of his funds were frozen on MEXC with no timeline for release Still, the backlash continues. Trader @maxleebtc came forward after Cecelia and Mystral’s posts with a separate case of his own, posting screenshots that show 3,300,000 USDT locked in his MEXC account for 20 days, with every withdrawal attempt marked “Withdrawal Failed.” Max said he originally thought it was just a system issue, but support kept telling him to “please be patient” before later claiming his account showed “abnormal profit.” Source: MaxleeBTC/X The chat log he shared shows MEXC staff allegedly telling him the funds were “crawled back” because of his futures trading performance, with no breakdown of how that decision was made. Max said that he reached out to MEXC’s support many times, but their response has so far been either automated or vague, and the funds remain frozen, allegedly.

Tether Discloses Billions In Gold And Bitcoin Holdings The third quarter of 2025 marked a significant milestone for the firm, with over $17 billion in new USDT issued—one of the company’s strongest performances to date. This surge has increased the total circulating supply of USDT to over $174 billion. In terms of financial exposure , Tether’s holdings in US treasuries, both direct and indirect, have reached an all-time high of approximately $135 billion. This positions the company as one of the largest holders of US government debt, surpassing South Korea to rank as the 17th largest among nations holding US Treasuries. As of September 30, 2025, the company reported that the reserves backing Tether tokens in circulation amounted to approximately $181.2 billion, while liabilities totaled about $174.4 billion. This indicates that the value of assets supporting Tether exceeds its liabilities by approximately $6.8 billion. Additionally, Tether’s reserves include $12.9 billion in gold and $9.9 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), together representing about 13% of total reserves. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, commented on the Q3 results, stating: These results reflect the continued trust and strength behind Tether, even amid a challenging global macroeconomic environment. They reinforce Tether’s brand as the ‘Stable Company.’ He highlighted that both investors and users are increasingly turning to USDT as the most reliable and liquid digital dollar, which underscores enduring confidence in the stablecoin issuer’s operational model. T3 Financial Crime Unit Freezes Over $300 Million In Criminal Assets In a related effort to maintain financial integrity, the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU)—a collaborative initiative from Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs—has reportedly frozen more than $300 million in criminal assets globally. The largest volumes of assistance were documented in the United States, where $83 million was frozen across 37 cases, followed by assistance in countries such as Spain, Germany, and Brazil, among others. The most common types of crimes investigated included illicit goods and services (39%), fraud, hacks, and activities linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which accounted for $19 million from the Bybit hack alone. Ardoino emphasized the firms dedication to preserving the integrity of the financial system, stating, “Reaching the $300 million milestone demonstrates the real-world impact of blockchain technology in combating financial crime.” He reiterated the company’s commitment to collaborating with more than 280 law enforcement agencies worldwide, aiming to monitor transactions and disrupt criminal activity effectively.

Announcing the launch during The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which aired on Friday. Musk said the entire messaging stack had been rebuilt from scratch. “On X, we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack into what’s called ‘X Chat,” said Musk Musk prepares to launch ‘X Chat’ to rival WhatsApp and Telegram According to Musk, it utilizes peer-to-peer encryption technology, similar to that used by Bitcoin. For now, it is being evaluated to establish if it is ready for deployment. Musk said he believes the new messaging app will be available in a “few months,” and that it will not have any “hooks for advertising,” citing competitors such as WhatsApp, which “knows enough about what you’re texting to know what ads to show you,” he said. He cautioned that this poses a tremendous security threat, as having enough material to display targeted advertisements indicates that they possess a massive amount of confidential information, including users’ private messages, that hackers could use to gain access. Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, maintains it does not have access to private conversations, stating in its FAQ that messages between people are end-to-end encrypted with the Signal Protocol. This also includes voicemails, media, and documents. However, many believe that “metadata,” such as who you contacted and how frequently you spoke with them, is not encrypted. WhatsApp does not automatically encrypt backups of your chat history. WhatsApp’s FAQ section on “Does WhatsApp collect or sell your data?” does not address the latter portion of the issue, instead stating that “we work with other Meta companies to help provide, improve, and support each other’s services.” The company also notes that users who integrate WhatsApp with other Meta products consent to some data sharing between platforms. Musk aims to be different and stated that X Chat will avoid such advertising “hooks.” He notes that his main goal is to create a fully encrypted system capable of sending messages, files, and conducting audio or video calls. According to Musk, it will be “the least insecure of any messaging system.” The new service will be integrated into the X platform and also released as a standalone app. Musk expands his digital empire with AI-powered Grokipedia launch Separately, on Monday, Musk introduced Grokipedia , his version of Wikipedia powered by his AI company, xAI. The crowdsourced encyclopedia, which Musk says will “purge out the propaganda” found on Wikipedia, briefly crashed after launch but already featured more than 800,000 AI-generated entries, compared to Wikipedia’s nearly eight million human-written articles. Visitors to the website, grokipedia.com, were welcomed with a bare-bones logo and a search bar that enabled them to query topics. One entry on Musk himself describes him as “a blend of innovative visionary with irreverent provocateur”. It continues to showcase details of his diet, noting his consumption of “occasional indulgences like morning donuts and multiple Diet Cokes daily.” Grokipedia also has entries on OpenAI, a competitor of xAI, as well as political figures such as President Trump and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The new site expands the billionaire’s online media ecosystem, which closely aligns with his personal political views. Still, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales wasn’t keen on Grokipedia. Speaking at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York, Jimmy noted he did not need to study Grokipedia’s content to predict how it would turn out.“I’m not optimistic he will create anything very useful right now,” he said. Jimmy stressed he was not worried about competition. According to the executive, his lack of interest in reviewing Grokipedia is not a personal matter. He continues to state that the core problem is the technology behind it. He said the large language models Musk is using turn out to be big blunders. On X, Mr. Musk has reinstated right-wing creators and expanded their reach to many audiences, utilizing the platform as a bully pulpit to advocate for government funding cuts. He has also tweaked xAI’s chatbot, Grok, to a more conservative tone. According to Ryan McGrady, a senior research fellow at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies encyclopedias and social media platforms, t he impulse to control knowledge is as old as knowledge itself. He continues to say that controlling what gets written is a way to gain or keep power. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-to-xrp-holders-you-need-to-lock-in-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld highlighted the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent policy decision, noting that the central bank plans to conclude its quantitative tightening program on December 1. This announcement marks a major turning point in monetary policy after an extended period of liquidity contraction. Rietveld emphasized that halting quantitative tightening historically precedes a return to asset price growth across multiple sectors, including equities, cryptocurrencies, and real estate. The termination of quantitative tightening effectively signals the Federal Reserve’s intention to expand the money supply once again. Rietveld noted that each previous instance of monetary expansion has coincided with positive performance in financial markets. He referenced historical trends showing that, within three months of such a shift, U.S. asset classes—ranging from stocks to digital currencies—have consistently recorded higher valuations. YOU NEED TO LOCK IN!! #XRP #ripple #crypto #cryptonews #BTC #ETH #SOL pic.twitter.com/WdsEsb5A87 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 30, 2025 Historical Context of Money Supply Expansion The expert underscored that there has rarely been a period in U.S. history when prices surged during an increase in the money supply. From his perspective, this policy shift presents a clear opportunity for investors who are positioned in risk-on assets. Rietveld’s message was straightforward: when liquidity flows back into the economy, nearly all major asset classes tend to appreciate. Such a stance aligns with traditional economic theory, which connects monetary expansion to inflationary pressures that typically lift nominal asset prices. The anticipation of renewed liquidity may also encourage speculative momentum, particularly within the cryptocurrency market, where sentiment often reacts to macroeconomic cues. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Advice to Crypto Investors In his message, Rietveld addressed holders of digital assets directly, noting that this may be a critical moment for those invested in XRP , Bitcoin , and other cryptocurrencies. He suggested that investors should “lock in” their positions ahead of what could be a broad-based rally, consistent with historical outcomes following previous policy shifts. Market participants have responded with optimism. One X user, Evelyn, commented that now is the ideal moment to solidify holdings, expressing confidence that XRP may soon experience significant movement . She added that the broader cryptocurrency sector is likely entering a phase of renewed energy driven by monetary expansion and increased investor activity. Rietveld’s remarks reflect a broader market expectation that the end of quantitative tightening will mark the beginning of a liquidity-driven growth phase. While economic outcomes remain dependent on a range of global factors, his analysis suggests that the combination of easing monetary policy and renewed investor confidence could set the stage for a strong close to the year across financial markets.

ChatGPT’s Bull vs Bear Scenarios,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-networks-pi-price-recovery-continue-in-november-chatgpts-bull-vs-bear-scenarios/,"Pi Network’s native token went on the run in the past couple of weeks, skyrocketing from its October 10 all-time low of $0.172 to roughly $0.29 before it settled at around $0.25 as October closed. This impressive rally came after months of prolonged correction and several positive developments in the Pi Network ecosystem, such as new updates, features, and AI implementations. All eyes are now on November as the year is coming to a close, and the question we asked ChatGPT is whether PI has the ability to continue its recent run and double down on its price recovery attempts. Yay or Nay in November? Before it made its predictions for the upcoming 30 days, the AI chatbot outlined the two reasons behind PI’s 50% surge in late October: “ renewed community activity (AI and utility-app pilots) and a pickup in off-exchange trading volume.” It remains relatively bullish on the asset for November, placing a 60% “base case” that it will keep climbing, slowly and gradually. It noted that in this most likely scenario, its current price level would be the lower boundary of a broader range between $0.24 and $0.34. “Modest continuation as ecosystem headlines keep interest alive but liquidity remains thin,” it described this scenario. Those hoping for a more sustainable and impressive increase, one that can send PI beyond $0.40, received a 25% chance from the AI solution. Such a bullish case would be possible if the token breaks the $0.35 resistance following listings on new exchanges or additional and more tangible improvements within the ecosystem. ChatGPT’s bear case (15% probability chance) envisions another drop below $0.20 and possibly retesting the ATL if “hype fades and no network-progress news lands before mid-month.” What to Watch The popular AI chatbot outlined several factors that can influence PI’s price in the next month: App-ecosystem traction – new Pi-based apps or AI integrations could sustain the recovery. Liquidity & listings – volumes remain small and mostly OTC; broader exchange support would be the single biggest bullish catalyst. Broader market mood – a stronger BTC/alt recovery this month would amplify any upside in PI. In addition, it outlined the token unlock schedule, which shows the number of coins to be released in the following month. It could be used to get a broader perspective on whether the immediate selling pressure from investors awaiting their tokens could ease or increase. Current data from PiScan shows that the average daily unlock is around 4.160 million tokens, which is nowhere near as high as 8-9 million during the summer. As such, this could ease the immediate selling pressure and allow the asset to stabilize in November as predicted above. Pi Unlock Schedule.

53890474,618135,1761973217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53890474.jpeg,Fed Cut Triggers 10K Bitcoin Sell-Off – Yet Zero Panic From Long-Term Holders,https://bitcoinist.com/fed-cut-triggers-10k-bitcoin-sell-off-zero-panic/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market slipped into the red following the Federal Reserve’s recent 25bps interest rate cut, igniting a familiar debate across trading desks: is this simply a “sell the news” shakeout, or the early stages of a more sustained downturn — a possible prelude to another crypto winter? BTC is currently struggling beneath the $110,000 level, signaling uncertainty and hesitation among traders as volatility rises and sentiment weakens. The initial optimism that typically follows pro-liquidity policy shifts was overshadowed by renewed selling pressure, suggesting that markets may be recalibrating after months of aggressive speculative positioning and a historic liquidation earlier in October. For now, analysts are split. Some argue this pullback reflects normal market digestion following a major macro catalyst, consistent with previous rate-cut cycles where risk assets dipped before resuming higher. Others warn that loss of key technical levels may open the door to deeper downside if demand fails to re-emerge quickly. With Bitcoin hovering near critical support and macro conditions in transition, the coming weeks are expected to be crucial. Whether this move marks a temporary flush or the start of a broader risk-off phase will likely define the next chapter of the crypto cycle. Short-Term Speculators Drive Sell-Off as Long-Term Holders Stay Strong According to a recent CryptoQuant analysis by CryptoOnchain, the sharp market drop on October 30th was driven overwhelmingly by short-term traders rather than long-term investors. As volatility surged, more than 10,000 BTC flowed into Binance — typically a bearish signal, as rising exchange inflows often precede selling pressure. But digging deeper into the on-chain data reveals a very different story beneath the surface. The Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) metric shows that 10,009 BTC of that inflow came from coins held for less than 24 hours. In other words, nearly the entire wave of selling originated from “hot money” — short-term traders reacting emotionally and quickly to macro headlines and market turbulence. These are speculative participants, not long-term strategic holders. In contrast, inflows from Long-Term Holders — coins held for six months or more — were negligible. The market’s most resilient participants, often referred to as diamond hands, did not rush to sell. They did not send BTC to exchanges, did not panic, and did not contribute to the downturn. This divergence is crucial. It confirms that the sell-off was a liquidity flush, not a shift in long-term conviction. Investor psychology, not fundamentals, drove the move. Far from signaling the start of a crypto winter, this pattern aligns with historical shakeout behavior seen before larger continuation moves. When short-term holders capitulate while long-term holders remain steady, it typically reflects market cleansing rather than structural weakness. In short, on-chain signals suggest the foundation of the market remains strong — and this correction appears to be a clearing event, not the beginning of a long-term downtrend. Bitcoin Holds Mid-Range on 3D Chart Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $109,800 on the 3-day timeframe, holding mid-range after a volatile month marked by macro reactions and leveraged shakeouts. Despite recent downside pressure, the broader structure remains intact, with BTC still comfortably above the 100-period moving average (green line) and well above the 200-period moving average (red line) — signaling that the long-term trend remains bullish. Price continues to consolidate between $108,000 support and the critical $117,500 resistance zone, which has acted as a major supply barrier throughout this consolidation phase. Each attempt to break above $117,500 has been met with selling, confirming it as the cycle’s Point of Control and the key level for bulls to reclaim to regain momentum. On the downside, the $108,000–$105,000 area has repeatedly served as a demand region, supported by buyers stepping in during pullbacks. Losing that zone on the 3D close would introduce risk of deeper correction toward $100,000–$102,000, where structural support and prior breakout levels converge.

Instead, Bitcoin finished the month down, creating a gap of approximately 13% from its all-time high. Historical Trends Suggest Bitcoin Could Rebound Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, noted that while October was a letdown compared to historical trends, it’s essential to contextualize the price movements. He remarked, “Prices have held up well overall, especially after a September that actually bucked the usual weakness.” Related Reading: Coinbase, Strategy Mark Major Profit Surges In Q3: Unveiling The Numbers Notably, on the 6th of this month, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached an all-time high just beyond $126,000. Additionally, the current downturn has failed to erase the year-to-date gains, with Bitcoin still recording a 55% uptrend during this period. However, according to a recent analysis by Fortune, this October marks the fourth-worst performance for Bitcoin since 2013 and the worst in the past seven years. Bitcoin’s performance lagged behind that of the S&P 500, which saw a gain of roughly 2.3% during the same period. Despite this under performance, Kruger remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential recovery in the upcoming months. “Historically, Q4 has been one of the best periods for crypto performance,” he stated, expressing hope for a push toward record highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) as the year draws to a close. October Challenges The month proved challenging not only in terms of price but also due to significant market events. Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, observed that cryptocurrencies entered October tracking gold and stocks at near all-time highs. However, as uncertainty crept into the market, investors did not flow back into Bitcoin as anticipated. In addition, October witnessed the largest liquidation event in cryptocurrency history, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, alongside threats of export controls on crucial software. Related Reading: dYdX Eyes US Market Entry: Decentralized Crypto Exchange Plans Year-End Debut, Reuters McCarthy commented on the impact of this liquidation, stating, “That washout on the 10th really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow.” He emphasized that even dominant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience sharp drawdowns, citing instances of 10% declines occurring in just 15 to 20 minutes. Amid these developments, concerns have been raised by several figures regarding the high valuations in equity markets. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the US stock market within the next six months to two years. Jake Ostrovskis, head of trading at Wintermute’s over-the-counter desk, noted that participants in the market remain hesitant as they grapple with the implications of the largest liquidation event on record. He added that this caution persists amid ongoing speculation about vulnerabilities that might still exist within the financial system.

Bitcoin Is Retesting The 0.85 Supply Quantile In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is retesting a level that has historically been a “make-or-break” one for the asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges To $0.18 As Whales Sell 440 Million DOGE The level in question is part of Glassnode’s “Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model.” The model reflects price levels corresponding to important investor profitability thresholds. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the levels of this model have changed over the last few years. Looks like BTC is currently trading around the middle band | Source: Glassnode on X As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin surged above the 0.95 quantile during the recent rally to the all-time high (ATH). This level corresponds to 95% of the supply being in profit. With the market downturn that has followed since, however, the cryptocurrency has slipped under the level. Recently, the asset has been making retests of the 0.85 quantile, situated at $109,000. BTC has already seen brief drops below this mark, but so far, it has managed to climb back above it each time. At present, the coin is trading right around the level, indicating that about 85% of the supply is carrying a net unrealized gain. In the past, Bitcoin’s interactions with this level have tended to carry consequences for its trajectory. “Holding it has sparked major rallies, but losing it often sees a slide toward the 0.75 band,” noted Glassnode. The 0.75 quantile is equivalent to $98,000 at the moment. It now remains to be seen whether BTC can hold above the 0.85 quantile, or if a retrace to this level is coming. In some other news, the latest decline in Bitcoin below $107,000 came alongside negative values on the Coinbase Premium Gap, as pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X post. The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The metric basically tells us about how the behavior of the users on the former exchange differ from that of the latter platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Hold Key Support: Could $88,000 Be Next? As the below chart shows, the metric was at positive levels on Wednesday, but the indicator turned red on Thursday. The trend would imply that Coinbase traders, primarily made up of American institutional entities, sold the cryptocurrency at a higher intensity than Binance’s global whales during the Bitcoin drawdown. BTC Price Since the wave of selling on Coinbase, Bitcoin has witnessed some recovery back to the $109,500 level, reclaiming the 0.85 quantile once again.

The post reflects on how similar conditions preceded XRP’s notable price appreciation last year, suggesting that market sentiment may once again be misreading the implications of recent policy moves. On September 18, 2024, the Fed cut the rates by 50 bps. #XRPArmy was dead silent, as was the rest of the Crypto communities. XRP was at $0.50 before the $3.66 run! We addressed the Bull Run 6 weeks before the Surge. Now, the Fed cut the rates by 25 We have the same panic We… https://t.co/efK0OLCKfn — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) October 30, 2025 Historical Context and Market Behavior Dark Defender referenced the September 18, 2024, rate cut, when the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points. At that time, XRP was trading near $0.50, before a sharp increase that took it to $3.66. According to the analyst, the broader crypto market, including XRP supporters, initially reacted with hesitation rather than optimism. The subdued sentiment that followed the rate reduction was soon replaced by a sustained bullish phase, which Dark Defender claims had been anticipated weeks in advance. This historical comparison serves as the foundation of the analyst’s current outlook. The Federal Reserve recently reduced rates again, this time by 25 basis points, triggering renewed uncertainty within crypto markets. Dark Defender interprets this as a repeat of past behavioral patterns, where short-term anxiety masks underlying conditions conducive to a broader uptrend. The analyst emphasizes patience, implying that a comparable market response could emerge before the next Federal Reserve meeting. Market Reactions and Community Insights The post generated differing perspectives from members of the XRP community. Eloise, an X user, expressed that price volatility often discourages investors, noting that repeated cycles of panic tend to eliminate those unprepared for market turbulence. She added that her biggest regret was failing to accumulate more XRP during previous periods of low valuation. Sigifredo Marcelino presented a contrasting opinion. He asserts that the current political landscape has shifted from last year’s conditions, referencing the uncertainty about whether President Donald Trump would return to office. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Tyson Weller, questioned whether the previous XRP surge was influenced more by the Federal Reserve’s actions or by developments such as the lawsuit resolution and political expectations tied to the presidential race. Dark Defender’s analysis aligns with a broader view that macroeconomic shifts, including rate adjustments, can serve as catalysts for renewed momentum in digital assets. The suggestion that XRP could experience a similar pre-meeting surge underscores the analyst’s confidence in recurring market behavior. While past performance does not guarantee repetition, the argument underscores how investor psychology often amplifies short-term reactions to policy moves. The coming weeks will determine whether this latest Federal Reserve decision will produce the same kind of buildup observed before XRP’s major rally in 2024.

Following two tie votes, one to advance and another to kill the bill, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 4–2 to refer it for interim review. Lawmakers claimed before Tuesday’s proceedings that the bill had received an unprecedented amount of public interest and input since it was last discussed during the spring. The bill, specifically, would prohibit local governments from enacting certain laws that would inhibit cryptocurrency mining businesses, such as noise-prohibition zoning. It will also prevent digital money transactions from being taxed differently by state and local authorities, and it concurs that people have the right to mine digital money. Furthermore, a superior court would establish a blockchain conflict docket and assign a justice to hear crypto-linked conflicts under the legislation. Senators claimed they had seen unusually high volumes of public engagement on the bill In May, senators opted to send the bill back to committee after its first vote to clarify certain provisions and secure additional support. Senators are expected to revisit the legislation in the new year. According to the bill’s lead sponsor, New Boston Republican Rep. Keith Ammon, the legislation will protect blockchain and cryptocurrency companies from bias. The legislation aligns with a model policy written by the Satoshi Action Group, which advocates for the use of Bitcoin and has successfully advanced similar laws in several U.S. states. During the Commerce Committee’s Oct. 30 meeting, Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Republican from District 9, pointed to Arkansas as an example, seeing that it strengthened its mining regulations after facing community noise complaints and fears over environmental harm and foreign control. Senators said Thursday that their constituents have voiced strong opinions about the bill since it was last debated in the chamber. Ricciardi commented, “I don’t want to vote against it, but we heard from so many constituents, and I would like to have it worked on further and then move it forward next session.” The Concord Democrat Senator Reardon also shared that she’d never seen so much public engagement on a single bill, noting that the messages she received focused on the loss of local authority and community-level concerns. Senator Keith Murphy, one of the bill’s backers, said the legislation would make clear that New Hampshire is ready to embrace the digital asset sector. Coal use in Bitcoin mining has reduced There are still concerns about the environmental cost of crypto mining. However, the industry’s energy profile is improving. The MiCA Crypto Alliance and Nodiens report shows that coal use in Bitcoin mining has decreased from 63% in 2011 to 20% in 2024, alongside a 5.8% yearly increase in renewable energy reliance. Some U.S. states are also using taxation to mitigate the energy demands of digital asset mining. On October 2, Sen. Liz Krueger of New York proposed legislation introducing a tiered tax on electricity consumption, exempting miners who use less than 2.25 million kWh annually and charging 2 cents per kWh for those using up to 5 million kWh per year. At the same time, Russian government officials have launched a special registry of cryptocurrency mining equipment to help identify and tackle the increasingly popular illegal mining operations on a domestic level. According to Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko, the registry, compiled jointly by the Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS), and the Ministry of Digital Development, contains detailed information on devices used for crypto mining, RIA Novosti reported. Konyushenko mentioned that the information is quite detailed, and they have shared it with Law enforcement and authorities in some territories. Authorities in those regions are currently working hard to coordinate their actions. “The creation of such a register will allow us to identify consumers using electricity for mining needs accurately. This is necessary to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

In most cases, these paid tiers usually mean better stats, faster progress, and unfair advantages in the game’s universe. SACHI is pitching the framework that gives gamers all the charisma upgrades, reputation boosts, and exclusive cosmetic drops that set them apart in lobbies and throughout the metaverse without interfering with the fairness that makes gameplay engaging and rewarding for everyone. So, whether gamers are free roaming in SACHI’s immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe or exploring the VIP Floor , they can always be confident that they can compete freely and fairly with any and all comers — noob and pros alike. SACHI’s VIP Floor opens up the visible and shareable bling and dazzle of its exclusive social layer, where players can unlock private rooms, invitation-only events, and special moments through play, community engagement, or token-backed achievements. What it does not do is interfere with competitiveness and fair play. Prestige Without Power Players who reach the VIP Floor can expect: Private lounges for networking, strategy, and cultural drop reveals. Exclusive skins, emotes, and badges tied to $SACHI holdings and achievements. Limited events and social moments that put community status on display. But one thing they won’t find is power imbalance. SACHI’s leaderboards, matchmaking, and core gameplay remain untouched, keeping the ecosystem competitive and fair. “We wanted to show the traditional and Web3 gaming gallery, with our VIP Floor that you can have a wide variety of offers on your exclusive layer without actually corrupting the game universe with cheat codes,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “It’s about culture, exclusivity, and identity, a reward you can proudly share because you earned it fair and square. Prestige in SACHI is earned, never bought.” SACHI Continues to Deliver for Gamers Popular culture, regardless of origin (fashion, art, or music), can have far-reaching influence on different aspects of life, including digital identity. The market for cosmetic upgrades like skins, emotes, outfits and exclusive access like battle passes and season passes in games is worth between $60 and 100 billion annually as of 2025. However, as much as players want these status symbols to set themselves apart in their gaming metaverses, they still demand fairness. SACHI’s model ensures the VIP layer becomes an aspirational part of the community, not a pay-for-play crutch that allows players to exchange economic status for in-game advantage. Enter the SACHI universe and earn your way to the VIP Floor, where your full digital identity awaits. Fair play stays intact, but your status will never go unnoticed. About SACHI SACHI is an immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe that merges AAA-quality gameplay with real-time social features and blockchain-powered economies. Built on Unreal Engine 5 and powered by pixel streaming , SACHI is accessible on any device without downloads or high-end hardware. With its fair-play economy and prestige-driven VIP Floor, SACHI balances competition with culture, making gaming both thrilling and socially rewarding.

We’re talking about a significant ETH transfer involving a major player, Galaxy Digital. This event highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset movements and the growing sophistication of on-chain analytics. What Does This Massive ETH Transfer From Galaxy Digital Mean? According to a detailed report from Onchain-Lense, a new address has just received a substantial amount of Ethereum. Specifically, 9,272 ETH, valued at approximately $35.77 million, was transferred from Galaxy Digital. This kind of large-scale ETH transfer from a prominent institutional firm like Galaxy Digital often signals strategic moves within the crypto ecosystem. Galaxy Digital is a well-known financial services and investment management company specializing in digital assets. Their actions are closely watched, as they can provide insights into broader institutional sentiment and market trends. When such a large sum of Ethereum changes hands, it naturally raises questions about the purpose and the parties involved. Who Are the Suspected Recipients of This ETH Transfer? The mystery surrounding the recipient address adds another layer of intrigue to this transaction. Onchain-Lense’s analysis suggests that the receiving address might be linked to either Bitmine (BMNR) or Sharplink Gaming (SBET). Both are publicly traded entities, albeit in different sectors. Bitmine (BMNR): This company is typically associated with Bitcoin mining operations. A large ETH transfer to such an entity could indicate a diversification of assets, an investment in Ethereum-related projects, or perhaps a treasury management strategy. Sharplink Gaming (SBET): As a Nasdaq-listed company focused on sports betting and iGaming technology, an association with this Ethereum transfer could point towards integration of blockchain technology, expansion into Web3 gaming, or even a strategic investment in the underlying asset. It’s important to remember that these are currently suspicions based on on-chain data analysis. The exact nature of the relationship or the purpose of the transfer remains unconfirmed by the entities themselves. Why Are Large ETH Transfers So Closely Monitored? Large ETH transfers , especially those involving institutional players, are often scrutinized for several reasons. They can provide early indicators of market sentiment, potential investments, or even liquidity management strategies. For example, a significant move could precede a new product launch, a major partnership, or simply a rebalancing of portfolios. On-chain analytics tools, like those used by Onchain-Lense, allow us to track these movements with precision. This transparency is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, enabling a level of insight into financial flows that is often unavailable in traditional markets. Understanding these movements helps investors and analysts anticipate potential market shifts and institutional adoption trends. How Does This ETH Transfer Impact the Broader Market? While a single ETH transfer of this size might not immediately trigger a massive market swing, it contributes to the overall narrative of institutional engagement with Ethereum. As more traditional financial firms and public companies interact with digital assets, it lends credibility and maturity to the crypto space. The potential involvement of entities like Bitmine or Sharplink Gaming further underscores the diverse applications of blockchain technology beyond just speculative trading. It highlights a growing trend where companies are exploring how Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies can integrate into their existing business models or open up new opportunities. This evolution is key to the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market. In conclusion, this substantial ETH transfer from Galaxy Digital to a new address, potentially linked to Bitmine or Sharplink Gaming, is a fascinating development. It reinforces the importance of on-chain monitoring and offers a glimpse into the strategic maneuvers of institutional players in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Keep an eye on these movements, as they often paint a clearer picture of where the market is headed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an ETH transfer?

BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and TAO are drawing real capital, while market HYPE around AI, speed, and real-world utility is rising again. One payments-focused challenger has quietly lined up a wallet reveal and Q3 rollout that could turn sentiment into adoption. This guide gives you a clear, price-led snapshot on BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and TAO, then shows why a payment rail built as an ERC-20 coin may be the overlooked winner. Expect firm numbers, clean takeaways, and a subtle hint at the payments upstart that analysts are calling the best crypto to buy now for early stage investment where hype finally meets usage. BTC | Momentum Into 2026 BTC cooled into month end but still hovered near six figures, trading around $108,000 to $110,000 today. BTC remains the benchmark risk signal for funds rotating into digital assets. If funding calms, BTC keeps a bullish tilt into 2026; if macro tightens, BTC may retest lower without breaking its structural trend. Institutional allocators still anchor around BTC due to deep liquidity and regulated market rails. For portfolio core exposure, BTC remains the default. When HYPE spikes across sectors, BTC often benefits first as capital re-enters, and BTC dominance can rise before altflows resume. ETH | Building While Price Consolidates ETH held near the mid-$3,800s today, priced around $3,800 to $3,860. ETH keeps absorbing app demand through rollups while fees trend more predictable. When BTC sets the tone, ETH usually follows with higher beta moves once confidence returns. Into 2026, ETH has multiple flywheels: restaking debates, rollup economics, and growing app-layer adoption. If HYPE rotates into real fee growth, ETH can lead the next leg. Desk flows still treat ETH as a programmable counterpart to BTC, and ETH is central to multi-chain liquidity routing. SOL | Throughput, Fees, and Flows SOL traded in the high-$180s today, with spot levels near $185 to $188 after a pullback. SOL continues to screen well as a high-throughput chain with fast confirmation and low fees. When NFT and DeFi volumes re-accelerate, SOL often sees the earliest volume spikes. For 2026 setups, SOL is still on trader dashboards that favor speed and user experience. If HYPE on fast finality lines up with rising fees and on-chain activity, SOL can outperform. Portfolio builders who want growth-chain exposure often keep a SOL allocation beside BTC and ETH. SUI | Base-Building At Key Support SUI defended the low-$2 region today, trading near $2.30 to $2.37 while liquidity stabilized. SUI sits on multiple watchlists as newer capital studies its developer momentum and throughput design. If the market rotates into newer L1 experiments, SUI could benefit from incremental risk appetite. In 2026, SUI will be judged on usage, not slogans. If SUI grows real transactions and fee capture, the risk-reward improves. Traders watching HYPE cycles will want SUI confirmations on volumes, address growth, and integrations before pushing size. TAO | Where AI Meets Crypto TAO (Bittensor) extended its AI-linked advance with prints near $480 to $490 today and stronger volumes. TAO is the cleaner way for some funds to express AI-on-chain exposure. If inference demand and AI spending trend higher into 2026, TAO’s network economics remain in focus. That said, TAO is sensitive to HYPE in the AI trade. For disciplined entries, traders often wait for TAO to align with on-chain KPIs, not just headlines. Still, TAO sits near the front of the pack among AI players alongside BTC, ETH, SOL, and SUI as macro liquidity shifts. HYPE | Sentiment Check You Cannot Ignore HYPE can power big moves when it matches usage. When HYPE outruns data, reversals follow. Watch how HYPE behaves around BTC and ETH trend days, how HYPE lifts SOL and SUI when fees rise, and how HYPE swings TAO when AI headlines break. The right way to use HYPE is as a timing tool, not a thesis. In 2026, HYPE will keep rotating.

Global Regulators To Review Crypto Standards On Friday, Bloomberg affirmed that global regulators are in talks to review and potentially overhaul rules on banks’ crypto holdings, set to come into force in 2026. The US is reportedly leading the pushback against the original measures following the rapid surge of the stablecoin sector. In 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released its standard for the “prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets,” including tokenized traditional assets, stablecoins, and unbacked digital assets. Senior finance executives reportedly affirmed that banks have largely interpreted the standards as “a signal to avoid crypto since they imposed a heavy capital burden on such holdings.” However, the crypto industry’s adoption has evolved in the past few years, with key players like the US changing their regulatory stance to embrace the sector. According to people familiar with the talks, the shift has prompted debates at the BCBS regarding the suitability of these rules under the current environment, as major global jurisdictions, including the US and UK, haven’t committed to implementing them on time. The news media outlet noted that the Basel Committee updated its crypto standards in 2024 but delayed its implementation by one year. As a result, the US has been seemingly leading calls to amend the standards, Bloomberg sources said, arguing that the rules are “incompatible with the industry’s evolution,” especially in the stablecoin sector. Some countries allegedly see the US’s logic and favor reviewing the standards before they are widely implemented. Notably, the Bank of England (BoE) has stated that it “continues to work on the implementation of its prudential framework for cryptoasset exposures, and is engaging internationally with other jurisdictions to promote regulatory consistency.” Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently announced a one-year delay of its new crypto prudential standards, which are based on the BSCS’s measures. On the contrary, the European Central Bank (ECB) considers that it’s best to implement the current standards and explore a revision later. Global Stablecoin Regulatory Landscape It’s worth noting that stablecoin regulation has faced challenges despite the global push to adopt the sector. The ECB has called for a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions, following a recommendation by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Additionally, the US banking industry has pushed back against the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act for potential loopholes that could pose major risks to the financial system. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, recently vowed to address the evolving threats from private finance and the growing use of stablecoins. In June, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) expressed concerns about the increasing risks associated with the stablecoin adoption, arguing that the use of the digital assets by criminal parties poses a growing challenge to global financial security. As reported by Bitcoinist, BoE Governor and FSB Chairman Andrew Bailey pledged earlier this month to increase the global watchdog’s policy response to the emerging risks related to the private finance sector and stablecoins, aiming to make it “more flexible and quicker to recognise, and respond to, emerging vulnerabilities.” Bailey affirmed that the international watchdog will have “open and frank discussions among members” about the next steps, and will “increase outreach to the private sector to benefit from their expertise and perspectives on risks and vulnerabilities.”",Crypto News|Basel Committee on Banking Supervision|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto adoption|crypto regulation|crypto standards|FSB|Singapore regulation|stablecoin adoption|UK regulators|US|US Regulators,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 06:00:35

Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-crypto-boring-now-bitwise-ceo-says-the-market-is-changing/,"As the early ‘Uptober’ buzz fizzles and Bitcoin struggles to hold $110,000, the overall crypto market sentiment has seemingly taken a beating. According to online reports, market participants are disappointed with the recent performance, but some experts argue that this means the industry is “winning.” Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) November Rally At Risk? Analysts Say This Week’s Close Holds The Key Crypto Vibes Are ‘Sad’ Despite Industry Adoption On Thursday, investor and analyst Will Clemente shared on X that “the vibes in the crypto groupchats are just sad.” He explained that investors seem “jaded, depressed, and defeated,” adding that they are “completely giving up” and switching to other asset classes after BTC’s performance this year. Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, weighed in on the matter, affirming that “Crypto natives are now in a multi-month bear market sentiment,” while the “off-Twitter” sentiment is the “best it’s ever been.” Horsley detailed that the offline positive outlook is fueled by the notable decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to the recent spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the second wave of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started trading this week, with Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) stealing the spotlight. Moreover, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy, continues to pour millions of dollars into cryptocurrencies. “The market is changing,” the CEO asserted in his Friday X post, pointing out JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s recent approach shift. Dimon has been a long-time crypto skeptic, calling the flagship crypto a “Ponzi scheme” and dismissing it as “useless as a pet rock.” Nonetheless, he recently admitted that he was wrong and that crypto, stablecoins, and blockchain are “real.” Is The Market ‘Boring’ Or Mature? In a response to Clemente’s post, Nic Carter stated that the sentiment shift highlights a deeper truth about the market: the space has matured significantly. He explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the questions and uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been answered. So many of the open questions have been answered, will stablecoins be allowed? yes. will we be banned? no. will we all go to jail for writing software? no. will we be incorporated into tradfi? yes. can tokens have cashflows and not be securities? Apparently. (…) There are still some unanswered questions, particularly around cash-flowing pseudoequity tokens, but we will probably get answers to those in the coming years. He also argued that the crypto industry has been largely derisked as a technological substrate, bringing large corporations to adopt these tools, which shows that “crypto natives no longer control the narrative, there’s more serious businesses (which don’t require tokens), there’s less chaos, the whole space has matured significantly.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Prepares For ‘Last Euphoric Run’ As Whales Go On $135M Buying Spree To Carter, this means that the industry has “won.” However, he noted that clarity and maturity come with less excitement, as “winning means the inherent volatility in the space is highly reduced! This applies to both startups and the underlying assets themselves.” “So if you’re sad that volatility has been dampened smile through the tears. it means we won,” he concluded.

In a Thursday post on X, Murphy claimed Coinbase had contributed to political action committee (PAC) Fairshake and helped fund Trump’s 2025 inauguration, implying a link between the donations and the SEC’s decision to drop a previous enforcement action against the company. Coinbase Pushes Back Against Accusations Responding to the allegations, Shirzad denied any political bias or wrongdoing. He explained that Coinbase was “proud to have supported the building of a new ballroom through the Trust for the National Mall,” emphasizing that many companies contributed to the same fund. “Note that we’re not the general contractor, so we’re not the right target if you’re unhappy about how the project is proceeding,” Shirzad said. He added that Fairshake was “non-partisan,” stressing that many public donations have supported inauguration events for past administrations. Trump’s Ballroom Project and Controversy Trump first announced plans in July to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on White House grounds, estimating the cost at $200 million and assuring the project wouldn’t affect the East Wing. However, recent photos revealed the East Wing had been demolished as part of the construction, and Trump later said costs had risen to $350 million. Murphy’s criticism focused on what he saw as corporate favoritism — but Coinbase maintains its involvement was part of a broader civic project, not political influence. Coinbase’s Growing Political Footprint The ballroom funding issue isn’t the first time Coinbase’s relationships with Washington have drawn scrutiny. In June, the company was listed among sponsors for a U.S. Army 250th anniversary parade coinciding with Trump’s birthday. Coinbase said its participation was a one-time contribution to America250, a nonpartisan initiative marking the nation’s semiquincentennial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also recently visited lawmakers in Washington to discuss crypto regulation as the U.S. government shutdown entered its 31st day. The visit focused on advancing the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” aimed at providing clearer crypto market structure rules. While the bill was expected to move forward by late October, the ongoing shutdown has stalled legislative progress, leaving Coinbase’s regulatory ambitions uncertain.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-01 06:01:29

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-the-calm-before-the-xrp-buying-storm-heres-what-is-coming/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has emphasized what he describes as a coordinated phase of institutional accumulation behind XRP’s recent market behavior. In a recent post , he analyzed the cryptocurrency’s notable dip to around $1.32 across multiple exchanges, followed by a steady rebound. According to his assessment, this movement was not random but rather part of a larger structural pattern influenced by major financial entities positioning themselves ahead of anticipated regulatory and market developments. Rietveld highlighted that following the sharp liquidation event, institutional investors began purchasing significant quantities of XRP, signaling strong confidence in the asset’s medium-term outlook. He noted that these are not minor participants but large-scale investors managing billions in capital who are strategically preparing for the next phase of XRP’s market cycle. While retail investors have also engaged in the recent rebound, he emphasized that their participation remains modest compared to institutional volumes observed during the accumulation phase.

According to him, these ETF approvals are likely to occur once the current U.S. government shutdown concludes. The initial decision deadline was reportedly set for October 18, but was delayed due to the administrative pause caused by the shutdown. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that approval could take place in November, aligning with the end of governmental interruptions. Rietveld compared the potential impact to what occurred in the Bitcoin market when spot ETFs were introduced, resulting in increased market access and institutional inflows. In his view, the same pattern could emerge for XRP, with regulated investment products opening the door for broader participation from traditional finance. Market Reaction and Broader Outlook The video gained attention among XRP supporters. Many of them are optimistic regarding the potential for an ETF-driven rally. But not all responses aligned with Rietveld’s assertion. One user, identified as PivaTerci, questioned whether XRP’s growth should depend entirely on the reopening of the government. This indicates that political gridlock between parties could prolong the situation and delay ETF decisions. Despite differing opinions, Rietveld’s analysis underscores the growing expectation of institutional involvement as a defining element in XRP’s future price trajectory . His perspective aligns with a broader narrative that major financial actors are preparing for deeper integration of XRP into regulated markets, positioning it for potential long-term growth once policy clarity is achieved.

Sun, founder of TRON, CEO of BitTorrent, and majority shareholder of exchanges HTX (formerly Huobi) and Poloniex, controls a multi-billion dollar fortune with both on-chain and off-chain assets. A comprehensive analysis by analytics platform Arkham Intelligence estimates Sun's net worth to be between $5 billion and $8 billion, based on both his holdings in verified crypto wallets and his holdings on exchanges. A significant portion of Sun's wealth is tied to the cryptocurrency exchanges he owns. HTX, in particular, stands out as a significant factor in Sun's overall wealth. The company's average daily trading volume of $3.4 billion translates to an annual volume of approximately $1.2 trillion. This suggests HTX's market capitalization could be between $6 billion and $10 billion. Given Sun's large stock market holdings, this investment is thought to account for the majority of his wealth. Poloniex, on the other hand, is smaller, with a daily trading volume of around $1 billion and a total value estimated at $150-200 million. According to Arkham's data, Sun's verified on-chain assets exceed $2.1 billion. This portfolio includes approximately $600 million in TRX, $400 million in Bitcoin, and investments in various stablecoins and DeFi protocols. It's also been reported that Sun may be linked to 142 wallet addresses; if these wallets are verified as his, his total wealth could reach much higher levels. Related News: Danger of a “Golden Pocket” in Solana: Analysis Firm Says, “It Shouldn't Fall to This Level” Some sources, notably Bloomberg, estimate Sun's net worth much higher, around $12.5 billion. However, due to the high volatility of crypto asset prices and the lack of transparency surrounding off-chain investments, this estimate is difficult to verify. Sun's wealth is closely tied to the TRON ecosystem, which he founded. The TRON network, which he launched in 2017, stands out among smart contract platforms, while the price performance of the TRX token directly impacts Sun's personal fortune. His purchase of BitTorrent for approximately $140 million in 2018 and subsequent launch of the BTT token are considered other strategic moves to diversify his wealth. Ultimately, while Justin Sun's wealth is well over the billion-dollar mark, it's impossible to provide a definitive figure. While his verified on-chain assets exceed $2 billion, his total net worth is estimated to be between $5 billion and $8 billion, taking into account his holdings on exchanges like HTX and Poloniex, his art collections, and other private investments. *This is not investment advice.

For the first time in seven years, Bitcoin has concluded the month of October with a significant decline, a development that has certainly caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. This Bitcoin October loss , confirmed by data from Coinglass, marks a surprising shift from what has historically been a strong month for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Understanding this rare event is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. Unpacking the Bitcoin October Loss: A Historical Perspective To truly grasp the significance of this recent downturn, it helps to look back. The last time Bitcoin finished October in the red was during the 2018 bear market. Back then, it saw a modest 3.83% dip in October, which unfortunately preceded a much steeper 36% plummet in November. This historical context makes the current Bitcoin October loss particularly noteworthy, as October has traditionally been a period of growth for the digital asset. Historically, October has earned a reputation among crypto enthusiasts as ‘Uptober’ due to its consistent positive performance. Many investors have come to anticipate a bullish trend during this month, often positioning themselves for potential gains. This year’s outcome challenges that long-held perception, prompting a deeper look into the underlying market dynamics. Why Did Bitcoin See an October Loss This Year? Several factors might contribute to this unexpected Bitcoin October loss . Pinpointing a single cause can be challenging, as the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of global economic trends, regulatory news, and investor sentiment. However, we can identify some key areas that likely played a role: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global inflation concerns and rising interest rates from central banks often lead investors to seek safer, less volatile assets, impacting riskier investments like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions and evolving regulations in major economies can create an atmosphere of caution, causing investors to hold back or even liquidate positions. Profit-Taking: After periods of strong performance in previous months, some investors might have opted to take profits, contributing to selling pressure throughout October. Broader Market Sentiment: A general downturn in traditional financial markets can sometimes spill over into the crypto space, affecting investor confidence across the board. These combined pressures likely created a challenging environment for Bitcoin, leading to its unusual monthly close. What Are the Market Implications of This Bitcoin October Loss? The immediate implication of the Bitcoin October loss is increased market volatility. Investors might experience heightened uncertainty, which can lead to rapid price swings. This sentiment can also extend beyond Bitcoin, potentially influencing altcoins and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, it is also important to consider the long-term perspective. Bitcoin has a history of resilience and recovery following downturns. While short-term fluctuations are part of the market, many analysts view these periods as natural corrections within a larger growth trajectory. This particular October performance serves as a reminder that even established trends can shift, requiring investors to remain adaptable and informed. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights After Bitcoin’s October Loss For investors, understanding how to react to such market movements is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider following the recent Bitcoin October loss : Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory updates, and cryptocurrency-specific developments. Knowledge is your most powerful tool. Consider Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, not just cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by numerous corrections and recoveries. A long-term investment horizon often helps to weather short-term market turbulence. Practice Risk Management: Only invest capital you are prepared to lose. Setting stop-loss orders and having a clear exit strategy can protect your portfolio. By focusing on these strategies, investors can approach the market with greater confidence, even when unexpected events like this occur. In conclusion, the Bitcoin October loss is a rare occurrence, breaking a seven-year streak of positive monthly closes. While it signals a departure from historical patterns and prompts questions about immediate market direction, it also reinforces the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency. For seasoned and new investors alike, this event underscores the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a balanced perspective on market volatility. Bitcoin’s journey is rarely linear, and adapting to its unpredictable path is part of the crypto experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is this Bitcoin October loss a sign of a prolonged bear market? A1: While the Bitcoin October loss is notable, it’s too early to definitively declare a prolonged bear market. Market conditions are constantly evolving, and a single month’s performance does not dictate long-term trends. Many factors influence Bitcoin’s price, and a recovery is always possible. Q2: How does this October loss compare to previous downturns? A2: The last time Bitcoin closed October with a loss was in 2018, during a significant bear market. While the percentage drop this year was less severe than the subsequent November drop in 2018, its rarity makes it a point of interest for historical comparison. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin holdings after this news? A3: Investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor and conduct thorough research rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements like the Bitcoin October loss . Q4: What role do macroeconomic factors play in Bitcoin’s performance? A4: Macroeconomic factors, such as inflation rates, interest rate changes by central banks, and global economic stability, can significantly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets face uncertainty, crypto often experiences correlated movements. Q5: What is ‘Uptober’ and why is this year different? A5: ‘Uptober’ is a colloquial term among crypto investors referring to October’s historical tendency for Bitcoin to show positive price performance. This year is different because Bitcoin, for the first time in seven years, closed October with a loss, breaking this established trend.

However, for those keen on gaining an edge, looking at specific data points like Bitcoin futures long/short ratios offers invaluable insights. These metrics reveal the collective sentiment of traders on major exchanges, providing a glimpse into potential price movements. What Are Bitcoin Futures Long/Short Ratios, and Why Do They Matter? In the dynamic world of crypto, perpetual futures contracts are a popular way to speculate on price without owning the underlying asset. A ‘long’ position bets on a price increase, while a ‘short’ position anticipates a decrease. The long/short ratio, therefore, is a powerful tool. It calculates the proportion of traders holding long positions versus those holding short positions on a given exchange. This ratio is not just a number; it’s a barometer of market sentiment. When the ratio leans heavily towards longs, it suggests a bullish outlook among traders. Conversely, a predominant short ratio indicates bearish sentiment. For active traders, understanding these Bitcoin futures dynamics is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. A Snapshot of Current Bitcoin Futures Sentiment: The Latest Ratios Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour data for Bitcoin futures long/short position ratios across the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest. This snapshot provides a real-time look at how traders are positioning themselves: Overall: Long 50.18%, Short 49.82% Binance: Long 51.52%, Short 48.48% OKX: Long 50.99%, Short 49.01% Bybit: Long 47.96%, Short 52.04% These figures reveal a fascinating picture. Overall, the market is almost evenly split, with a slight lean towards long positions. However, individual exchanges show distinct patterns, highlighting varying sentiment across platforms. Deciphering the Data: What Do These Bitcoin Futures Ratios Tell Us? At first glance, the overall ratio of 50.18% long to 49.82% short suggests a relatively balanced market, albeit with a marginally bullish tilt. This indicates that while many traders expect a price increase, a significant portion remains cautious, anticipating a potential downturn or hedging against it. On platforms like Binance and OKX, we observe a clearer long bias. This could imply stronger bullish conviction among their user bases. In contrast, Bybit stands out with a noticeable short bias. This divergence might reflect different trading strategies or demographics on Bybit, perhaps more active hedgers or contrarian traders who believe the market is due for a correction. It’s vital to remember that these ratios are snapshots. They provide a moment-in-time perspective and can shift rapidly. While a high long ratio might suggest over-optimism and a potential for a ‘long squeeze,’ a high short ratio could signal excessive pessimism, possibly leading to a ‘short squeeze.’ These insights are invaluable when navigating the volatility of Bitcoin futures . Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Strategy How can you leverage this Bitcoin futures long/short ratio data in your own trading? Firstly, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Don’t rely solely on this metric. Instead, combine it with other key indicators such as funding rates, open interest, and traditional technical analysis. For instance, if you see a high long/short ratio alongside negative funding rates, it could indicate that longs are paying shorts to maintain their positions, suggesting potential weakness despite bullish sentiment. Conversely, a low long/short ratio with positive funding rates might signal a strong bullish conviction. Always remember to manage your risk effectively, as market sentiment can change quickly, especially in the fast-paced crypto environment. Understanding Bitcoin futures long/short ratios is an essential skill for any serious crypto trader. It offers a powerful lens through which to view collective market sentiment, providing context for price movements and potential reversals. While not a standalone predictor, integrating this data into your analysis framework can significantly enhance your decision-making and provide a clearer picture of where the market might be heading. Stay informed, stay strategic, and navigate the crypto seas with confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? A1: Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. Q2: How is the long/short ratio calculated? A2: The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or total long volume by total short volume) on an exchange. Q3: Does a high long/short ratio always mean the price will go up? A3: Not necessarily. While it indicates bullish sentiment, an extremely high long ratio can sometimes precede a price correction as the market becomes overextended. Q4: Why do different exchanges have different long/short ratios? A4: Ratios can vary due to differences in user demographics, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and even slight delays in data aggregation. Q5: How often should I check Bitcoin futures long/short ratios? A5: For active traders, checking ratios regularly (e.g., every few hours or daily) is beneficial, as sentiment can shift quickly in volatile markets.

For the third consecutive day, these popular investment vehicles have experienced significant net outflows. On October 31st, a substantial $191.59 million exited Spot Bitcoin ETFs , according to detailed figures from TraderT. This ongoing trend raises crucial questions about investor sentiment and the immediate future of the crypto landscape. What’s Driving the Recent Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? Understanding these movements requires a closer look at individual fund performances. BlackRock’s IBIT, a major player, led the charge with a significant $149.32 million in outflows. This single fund accounted for a large portion of the total withdrawals, indicating a notable shift in investor behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT : Saw the largest outflow at $149.32 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB : Experienced an outflow of $19.30 million. Bitwise’s BITB : Recorded $17.88 million leaving its fund. Fidelity’s FBTC : Noted $11.97 million in net outflows. Interestingly, amidst this sea of red, Grayscale’s GBTC stood out. It was the only fund to attract capital, bringing in a net inflow of $6.88 million. This divergence suggests varying strategies or investor preferences within the broader Spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Such contrasting movements can offer valuable insights into market dynamics. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETF Movements Matter for Investors? The consistent net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they serve as a crucial indicator of investor sentiment. When large amounts of capital exit these funds, it often signals a decrease in demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. This can, in turn, put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, affecting the broader market. Moreover, these trends can influence institutional adoption. Many institutional investors utilize Spot Bitcoin ETFs for regulated exposure to the digital asset. Sustained outflows might suggest a cautious approach from these larger players, impacting the overall market narrative. It’s a key barometer for broader market confidence and participation. Understanding these flows helps investors make informed decisions. Observing which funds are gaining or losing traction can provide clues about market leadership and potential shifts in investment strategies. Therefore, monitoring Spot Bitcoin ETFs becomes an essential part of any crypto investor’s toolkit for navigating market complexities. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? The current streak of outflows presents both challenges and potential opportunities. While three consecutive days of net withdrawals might seem concerning, it’s important to view these movements within the larger context of the volatile cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin itself has seen price fluctuations, which can directly influence ETF flows and investor reactions. Looking ahead, several factors could impact the future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Regulatory developments, broader economic conditions, and shifts in global investor appetite for risk assets will all play a significant role. It’s not uncommon for new investment products to experience periods of adjustment as the market matures and finds its equilibrium. For those invested in or considering Spot Bitcoin ETFs , staying informed is key. Diversification and a long-term perspective often prove beneficial in navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. These outflows are a snapshot, not necessarily the entire story of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The recent $191.59 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs over three days highlights a period of cautious investor sentiment, particularly with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the withdrawals. While Grayscale’s GBTC saw a small inflow, the overall trend signals a temporary pullback. These movements are vital indicators for understanding market dynamics and institutional interest in Bitcoin. As the market evolves, continuous monitoring of Spot Bitcoin ETFs will remain crucial for investors seeking to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be influenced by various factors, including broader market sentiment, Bitcoin’s price performance, macroeconomic indicators, and investor risk appetite. A consistent outflow often indicates a decrease in demand for the ETF shares. Q3: Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs were most affected by the recent outflows? BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest outflow, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and Fidelity’s FBTC. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only fund to see a net inflow. Q4: How do Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows impact Bitcoin’s price? Significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs can signal reduced institutional and retail demand for Bitcoin exposure, potentially contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s market price. Q5: Is Grayscale’s GBTC performing differently? Yes, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a net inflow, contrasting with the outflows seen in other funds. This could indicate a unique investor base or specific market dynamics affecting GBTC differently.

Barron noted that the XRP Ledger, once dismissed by critics as a “zombie blockchain,” is now being recognized by Forbes as a $180 billion infrastructure leader. Barron’s remarks came in response to the publication’s latest feature on Ripple’s evolution . The report detailed Ripple’s transformation into an infrastructure powerhouse, highlighting its feats and acquisitions, and the growing role of XRP as a core liquidity asset supporting tokenized finance across institutional markets. However, Barron questioned why such recognition arrived only after the company had already achieved significant progress. His message suggested that Forbes may be late in recognizing Ripple’s strategic progress, noting that “isn’t Forbes supposed to predict winners, not report on them after they’ve already won?” Update: @Forbes just discovered that @Ripple went from ""zombie blockchain"" to a $180B infrastructure play. Wait, isn't Forbes supposed to predict winners, not report on them after they've already won? After years in regulatory hell, Ripple is now: Acquiring licensed custody… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) October 31, 2025 Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Role According to Barron, Ripple has repositioned itself in recent years by acquiring licensed custody and tokenization firms and developing institutional-grade settlement systems. These initiatives strengthen Ripple’s role in providing secure, compliant infrastructure for digital assets. Barron noted that the company is “building institutional-grade settlement rails” and “positioning XRP as plumbing for tokenized finance,” highlighting how XRP’s utility has expanded beyond retail speculation to form part of the underlying structure of financial networks. Ripple’s acquisition strategy signals a long-term plan. By aligning its XRP-powered product offerings with the needs of financial institutions, Ripple has moved closer to becoming a key service provider for institutional payment rails. This shift places XRP at the center of global liquidity operations, giving it a foundation that few other digital assets currently possess. From Regulatory Challenges to Strategic Dominance Barron also alluded to Ripple’s endurance through years of regulatory uncertainty, describing how the company went from “regulatory hell” to one now valued at $180 billion. That history adds weight to its current market standing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the context of financial infrastructure, XRP’s design as a settlement and liquidity asset is gaining renewed relevance. Ripple’s global partnerships and licensing efforts indicate a clear shift toward institutional adoption, supported by its operational clarity following years of legal battles . Recognition from Established Media Barron argued that Forbes is “just documenting the present,” noting that Ripple’s achievements are already established. He said comparing Ripple’s current status to Amazon’s “online bookstore” era understates its scale. He believes Ripple is an institutional infrastructure leader , and not a recovering firm.

In addition to Ripple’s long-term liquidity plan, this event has brought attention to new DeFi initiatives like Remittix (RTX), who are still developing practical payment solutions that are reminiscent of Ripple’s early innovations. With investors searching for the next big altcoin of 2025, the parallel rise of Remittix signals a growing shift toward utility-driven cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Prediction: Market Awaits Impact of Ripple’s $1B Token Unlock Ripple’s upcoming release of $1 billion XRP from its monthly escrow is expected to really impact short-term trading dynamics. Historically, these unlocks have introduced additional liquidity into the market, sparking debate about their effect on price momentum. Currently, XRP is currently trading at $2.53 following a significant gain of about 3.06%, with a market capitalization of $151.68 billion. Analysts tracking XRP suggest the unlock could trigger moderate sell pressure before stabilizing as market absorption takes effect. Others view the event as a reminder of Ripple’s growing influence in the payments sector — a factor that continues to sustain confidence among institutional holders. Institutional Demand and Broader Market Position Despite periodic unlocks, XRP remains one of the top crypto assets by market cap and continues to play a leading role in blockchain-based settlements. Its consistent partnerships with financial institutions have positioned it as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized networks. Market participants are also comparing Ripple’s trajectory to rising DeFi projects that combine cross-border capability with real-world integration — a category now led by Remittix. As attention shifts to crypto with real utility, XRP’s liquidity framework serves as both a precedent and an opportunity for newer entrants innovating on similar principles. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, introducing a practical crypto-to-fiat payment network designed for seamless global transfers. The project has raised over $27.7 million in private funding, with 681 million+ tokens sold at a current price of $0.1166 per token. Its early traction shows growing interest from investors seeking crypto solving real-world problems and low gas fee payment systems. CertiK Verified: Ranked #1 globally for pre-launch tokens, ensuring transparency and security. Expanding Wallet Beta: iOS users now joining the Remittix Wallet testing program. CEX Partnerships: Confirmed future listings with BitMart and LBank to boost liquidity. Referral Rewards & Bonuses: Ongoing 50% token bonus and a $250,000 giveaway campaign for community growth. Global Payments Utility: Supports direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Remittix’s progress highlights why it’s increasingly seen as the next 100x crypto and a low cap gem among early-stage investors. Looking Ahead: Utility Over Hype As Ripple prepares for its next major liquidity event, the XRP price prediction narrative will likely center on how markets absorb new supply and maintain long-term confidence. Yet beyond XRP’s movements, projects like Remittix are redefining what real-world crypto adoption looks like. With strong funding, verified security, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittix is shaping up to be a standout crypto to invest in for 2025. While XRP continues to anchor blockchain-based remittances, RTX’s rapid rise shows how the next generation of digital assets is built — secure, utility-driven, and ready for mass adoption.

The U.S. Treasury’s praise for Singapore’s regulatory leadership and Venezuela’s plan to integrate Bitcoin and stablecoins into its banking system signal a growing institutional embrace of digital assets, a shift that could redefine Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape.

This integration strengthens Bitcoin’s role as a practical hedge in inflation-hit economies and may drive long-term global demand for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Marks 17 Years With First ‘Red October’ Since 2018 As Bitcoin’s white paper turns 17, the world’s largest cryptocurrency faces its first red October in seven years, slipping over 3.5% this month amid a $19 billion market correction. Despite the decline, Bitcoin remains a $2 trillion asset, ranking among the world’s top eight by market value. Published on October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” introduced blockchain and proof-of-work technology, a concept that revolutionized global finance.

Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Triangle Pattern Near Breakout On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading within a descending triangle, confined between resistance near $119,750 and support around $106,375. This compression hints at an imminent breakout. The 20-period EMA continues to cap rallies, while spinning top and Doji candles show indecision among traders. The RSI at 46 suggests neutral momentum but is ticking upward, often a precursor to recovery. A close above $111,675 would confirm a bullish breakout, exposing targets at $116,350 and $119,750. Conversely, a drop below $106,300 could deepen the correction toward $103,500 and $100,250. Trade Setup Summary: Entry: Buy above $111,675 (confirmed breakout) Stop-Loss: Below $106,300 Targets: $116,350 and $119,750 BTC remains coiled within a tightening structure — a decisive breakout in early November could define its next major move toward reclaiming $120K or retesting deeper support.

Investors are closely watching as these investment vehicles experienced a significant third consecutive day of net outflows, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. This trend, amounting to a notable $97.8 million, raises important questions about investor confidence and the immediate future of Ethereum-backed products. What’s Behind the Latest Outflow Trend in Spot Ethereum ETFs? On October 31, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $97.76 million, a figure that translates to approximately 139.8 billion Korean Won. This marked the third straight trading day where more money left these funds than entered, according to data compiled by TraderT. Such a sustained outflow often indicates a cautious approach from investors or a period of profit-taking. Several prominent funds contributed to this significant movement: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the outflows with $38.19 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw $27.12 million exit. Grayscale’s ETHE: Experienced outflows of $13.73 million. Grayscale’s Mini ETH: Contributed $12.07 million to the total. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded $6.65 million in outflows. These figures highlight a broad-based movement across various providers of Spot Ethereum ETFs , rather than an isolated incident with a single fund. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, as they often reflect underlying market sentiment or broader economic pressures. How Do Spot Ethereum ETFs Influence the Broader Crypto Market? The performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs is a key indicator of institutional interest and investor confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. When these funds experience outflows, it can suggest that institutional investors or large retail participants are reducing their exposure to Ethereum, at least in this specific investment vehicle. This can, in turn, create a ripple effect across the wider crypto market. ETFs are designed to offer a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the assets. Therefore, their performance is often seen as a barometer for mainstream adoption. While these outflows might seem concerning, it is important to consider them within the context of the overall market. Sometimes, investors reallocate funds to other assets or simply take profits after a period of gains. Moreover, the long-term outlook for Ethereum’s ecosystem, including its scalability upgrades and increasing utility, remains a strong fundamental driver. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Know About Spot Ethereum ETFs? Investing in cryptocurrencies, even through regulated products like Spot Ethereum ETFs , always carries a degree of volatility. For investors, staying informed about market trends and understanding the factors that influence fund flows is paramount. The recent outflows serve as a reminder that even established digital assets can experience periods of price fluctuation and investor hesitation. Key considerations for investors include: Market Analysis: Regularly review market data and expert analysis to understand potential drivers of inflows and outflows. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single-asset investments. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise and long-term investment theses for Ethereum. Risk Tolerance: Assess your personal risk tolerance before investing in volatile assets. These strategic approaches can help investors make more informed decisions, especially when faced with periods of market uncertainty. The digital asset landscape is dynamic, and continuous learning is the best tool for navigating its complexities. In conclusion, the recent $97.8 million net outflow from Spot Ethereum ETFs over three consecutive days is a significant event for the crypto market. While it reflects a period of caution or profit-taking among investors, it’s crucial to view this trend within the broader context of Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption. Investors should remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and consider a diversified approach to navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of ETH without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs significant? Outflows indicate that more money is being withdrawn from these funds than invested. This can signal a decrease in investor confidence, profit-taking, or a shift in investment strategy, particularly among institutional investors who often use these vehicles. Q3: Which funds saw the largest outflows? BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH, Grayscale’s ETHE, Grayscale’s Mini ETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW, indicating a broad trend across major providers. Q4: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will drop? While significant outflows from ETFs can put downward pressure on the underlying asset’s price, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. Many factors influence Ethereum’s price, including overall market sentiment, development updates, and macroeconomic conditions. Outflows are one data point among many. Q5: What should individual investors do in response to these outflows? Individual investors should conduct their own research, assess their risk tolerance, and consider their long-term investment goals. It’s often wise to avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements and instead focus on a well-thought-out investment strategy.

Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, recently reported an enormous movement of 273,125,240 USDT from the popular exchange Binance to an unknown wallet. This single transaction, valued at approximately $273 million, has naturally sparked considerable interest and speculation across the digital asset community. Such a substantial USDT transfer often indicates major shifts in the market or significant strategic moves by large holders, commonly known as whales. What Exactly Was This Massive USDT Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert detected and reported a colossal movement of stablecoin. Specifically, 273,125,240 Tether (USDT) was transferred out of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The destination? An address that remains unidentified to the public. This substantial sum, equivalent to over a quarter of a billion US dollars, represents a considerable chunk of liquidity and raises immediate questions about its purpose and the entity behind it. Understanding the nature of this USDT transfer is crucial for market observers. Here are the key details of this transaction: Amount: 273,125,240 USDT Origin: Binance Exchange Destination: An unknown wallet address Value: Approximately $273 million USD Source: Reported by Whale Alert Why Do Large USDT Transfers Matter in the Crypto World? Large USDT transfers , especially those involving hundreds of millions of dollars, are often closely watched by investors and analysts alike. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. Therefore, these movements are not typically about price speculation of USDT itself, but rather about what the holder intends to do with such a large sum. A massive outflow from an exchange like Binance can signify several things: Potential Buying Power: The funds might be moved to an over-the-counter (OTC) desk for a large purchase of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, indicating bullish sentiment. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, a transfer to a completely “unknown” wallet suggests a non-exchange controlled destination. Strategic Positioning: A whale might be preparing for a significant market event, moving funds off-exchange to a private wallet for long-term holding or to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Who Could Be Behind This Mystery USDT Transfer? The identity of the recipient of this massive USDT transfer remains a mystery, adding an intriguing layer to the event. While it’s impossible to pinpoint the exact entity without further information, several possibilities are often considered when such large sums move: It could be: An Institutional Investor: Large financial institutions or hedge funds often make substantial moves in the crypto space, often utilizing OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. A High-Net-Worth Individual (Whale): Wealthy individual investors, or “whales,” frequently move large amounts of capital to position themselves for future market movements. Another Exchange or Custodian: Though less likely if the wallet is truly “unknown” and not publicly associated with an entity, it could be a transfer to a new custodial service or another exchange’s cold storage. A Private Fund or Project: Funds raised for new projects or ongoing operations could also account for such a large movement. The lack of public identification for the wallet keeps the crypto community guessing, highlighting the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of Such a USDT Transfer? While a USDT transfer itself doesn’t directly impact the price of USDT, the sheer volume of this transaction could have ripple effects across the broader crypto market. The key impact lies in what the recipient plans to do next. If these funds are intended for buying other cryptocurrencies, it could signal an impending surge in demand, potentially driving up prices. Conversely, if the funds are being moved for reasons unrelated to immediate market purchases, the impact might be more subdued or even neutral. Observing the subsequent movements from this unknown wallet will be critical. If the USDT starts flowing into other exchanges or specific DeFi protocols, it could provide clues about the whale’s intentions and potential market trends. For now, the crypto community is on high alert, watching for any follow-up actions that might shed light on this intriguing $273 million mystery. This event underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. While individual transactions rarely dictate the entire market, a transfer of this magnitude certainly warrants attention and careful analysis from investors and traders. Summary: Unraveling the Mystery of the Massive USDT Transfer The recent $273 million USDT transfer from Binance to an unknown wallet has captured the crypto world’s attention. While the immediate implications are still unfolding, such a substantial movement by a “whale” can often precede significant market activity. Whether it signals institutional buying, strategic positioning, or something else entirely, this transaction highlights the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. Staying informed about these on-chain activities provides valuable context for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Keep an eye on further developments to truly understand the ripple effects of this intriguing event. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. This means that 1 USDT is intended to always be worth $1 USD, making it a stable asset often used for trading, transferring value, and hedging against crypto market volatility. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks. It provides real-time alerts on significant movements, helping market participants understand potential whale activity and its implications. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they often signal major moves by wealthy investors or institutions. Since USDT is stable, these transfers usually indicate an intent to buy other cryptocurrencies, rebalance portfolios, or move funds for strategic purposes, rather than speculating on USDT’s price. Does a large USDT transfer always mean a market pump or dump? Not necessarily. While such transfers can precede significant market movements, they don’t guarantee them. The funds could be for long-term holding, moving to a different platform, or even for non-trading purposes. It’s one data point among many that analysts consider. How can I track large crypto transfers? Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates. Additionally, blockchain explorers for various networks (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum, Tronscan for Tron, BscScan for Binance Smart Chain) allow users to look up specific transactions and wallet addresses.

53893677,618765,1761980438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53893677.jpeg,Michael Saylor Increases Yield On Strategy Shares To Reinforce Multibillion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet,https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-increases-yield-on-strategy-shares/,"Michael Saylor, the chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holding company, is intensifying his multibillion-dollar investment in BTC. In a recent report by Bloomberg, it was revealed that Saylor is increasing the yield on preferred shares, which he has designated as the primary funding source for the company going forward. Investor Confidence Dips During an earnings conference call, Saylor indicated that the company is at a critical juncture. He noted that the multiple of net asset value has been declining over time as the Bitcoin asset class matures and volatility decreases. As part of its latest financial developments, Strategy announced that the yield on its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) will rise by 25 basis points to 10.5% starting in November. On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.8 billion for the quarter, largely attributed to an unrealized gain from its substantial cryptocurrency holdings, which are valued at approximately $70 billion. Despite Bitcoin reaching record highs during the third quarter and many public firms mimicking Saylor’s treasury model established five years ago, investor confidence is waning. Strategy’s shares (MSTR) have plummeted about 45% since reaching a record high last November, diminishing much of the premium the stock previously enjoyed over its Bitcoin assets . Furthermore, demand for the preferred shares has been lukewarm, with recent sales falling short of Saylor’s expectations for significant capital raises. This has led to a slowdown in Bitcoin purchases recently. In response to these challenges, Strategy is exploring international markets for capital and is considering launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by the preferred shares, as outlined by CEO Phong Le during the earnings call. Saylor Open To Strategy Equity Sales Following the release of second-quarter results, Strategy had committed to not issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times its net asset value, except to cover debt interest or preferred dividends . However, Saylor indicated a willingness to opportunistically tap into the market when the premium is favorable, using equity sales to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite attempts to reassure shareholders, the company subsequently issued more common shares, prompting skepticism. Gus Gala, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., expressed concerns regarding potential dilution, stating that if current sales are executed, the dilution could become substantial. In the latest earnings report, Strategy confirmed that it did not issue shares under its Common Stock ATM Program this month and reiterated its commitment to a disciplined approach in raising funds through equity. The company also adopted new accounting standards in January that require it to include the fair value of its Bitcoin holdings in its earnings reports. This change has resulted in significant fluctuations between profits and losses over the past two quarters, including a loss of approximately $340 million in the same period last year.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-analysis-update-ema-ribbons-rejection-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst STEPHISCRYPTO highlighted a clear technical development on the daily XRP chart: price encountered resistance at the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons and failed to break higher. The analyst’s post was accompanied by a chart that overlays a dense set of short- and medium-term EMAs, showing price touching the upper band of the ribbons and subsequently reversing. On the timeframe presented, this interaction is framed as a rejection at a structurally significant moving-average zone, which the analyst interprets as a cautionary signal for near-term upside momentum. WARNING: $XRP got rejected at the EMA-Ribbons! pic.twitter.com/KC5Kf89UT9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 30, 2025 Chart evidence and interpretation The attached image displays the daily price action with multiple EMAs closely packed as a ribbon. The most recent candles approach the ribbon’s upper boundary before retreating, and the analyst emphasized that this pattern constitutes a rejection rather than a successful breakout. From a technical standpoint, the EMA ribbons in the chart act as a dynamic resistance cluster; the failure to sustain a close above that cluster is read as evidence that sellers retain control at these levels. The analyst’s commentary implies that traders should treat the current structure conservatively until a definitive breakout above the ribbons is confirmed by sustained higher closes and supportive volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market reaction and sentiment Responses to the analyst’s post reflect heightened sensitivity among participants. One commenter suggested the move was the result of manipulation and urged a focus on longer-term objectives while expressing frustration with short-term price action. The reaction underscores a broader tension between traders who emphasize technical levels and holders prioritizing long-term fundamentals. STEPHISCRYPTO’s analysis focuses on the technical facts visible on the chart rather than on social sentiment. However, the captioned image and subsequent replies demonstrate how rapidly technical commentary can intersect with community takes. Advice to traders Based on the analyst’s assessment, the prudent approach for traders is to wait for confirmatory price behavior before assuming renewed upside. Key confirmations would include clear daily closes above the EMA ribbon cluster and evidence of buying volume supportive of a trend change. Conversely, the inability to reclaim and hold the ribbons increases the probability of further consolidation or lower support tests. The analyst’s message is primarily technical: the current price interaction with the EMA ribbons should guide position sizing and risk management decisions until a new structural development alters the technical outlook.

And, it delivered in the first week. Bitcoin’s price, which was already on the rebound in late September, broke past $120,000 and its previous all-time high and set a new record of just over $126,000. But then it all started to go wrong for the entire cryptocurrency market, and BTC was at the forefront of losses, especially on two bloody Fridays. More precisely, the largest digital asset plunged from over $121,000 to $101,000 (on some exchanges) on October 10 and, despite a brief recovery attempt, plummeted again to $104,000 a week later. The month continued with some more positive developments, such as lower-than-expected inflation numbers for September, rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and promising trade deal news on the Washington-Beijing front. These helped BTC recover some ground, but not as much as many expected, and the asset still closed October, a historically highly bullish month, slightly in the red. Is This a Bad Prophecy? With a 3.69% decline in October 2025, BTC broke a six-year streak of green months. Data from CoinGlass shows that the asset charted double-digit gains in five of those previous six Octobers, with the only exception being the bear market in 2022. We need to rewind the clocks to October 2018 to see the previous such month with a price decline, which was quite similar to the 2025 edition. At the time, BTC closed with a 3.83% drop. However, what followed was quite painful and, if history repeats, suggests that BTC could plunge to as low as $70,000 in November. Last time October closed at -3% for $BTC , it was followed by a -36% drop in November pic.twitter.com/eRuW88XPBp — 𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗼𝗽 (@nobrainflip) October 30, 2025 $70K Next? In November 2018, the month after the previous red October, bitcoin’s price plunged by 36.57%. The 2018 bear market was particularly harmful as the cryptocurrency culminated with a dump below $3,000 in December, which also saw a 5% decline. Of course, the landscape now is entirely different. BTC is no longer just a “fake internet coin;” instead, it’s a multi-trillion-dollar behemoth backed by institutions, prominent investors, and even governments. Also, we know that history is not an adequate price prediction tool, but it’s still worth observing given BTC’s movements in the previous November that followed a bloody October.

The lack of confidence is despite efforts by Adobe to integrate rival AI models into its products. Adobe Inc. is trying to prove it can remain a key player in the creative industry as artificial intelligence changes how people make content. The company gathered about 10,000 marketers, filmmakers, and creators at its annual conference this week to highlight how its software is adapting to the AI era. Adobe is attempting to retain investor confidence Many on Wall Street are unsure if Adobe can maintain its dominance as new AI-powered tools make it easier for people to create videos, posters, and graphics without professional software. Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke warned that Adobe is “at risk of structural AI-driven competitive and pricing pressure,” even though the company has a strong strategy. The company’s shares have lost roughly a quarter of their value this year. Other software firms like Salesforce Inc. and Workday Inc.’s stock prices have also struggled. Many of the popular AI tools used for creating videos and images, such as OpenAI’s Sora or Google’s Veo, are made outside Adobe’s ecosystem. Consumer-focused platforms like Canva are also growing in popularity, allowing people to design without needing Adobe’s professional software. Bloomberg’s analyst estimates suggest Adobe’s Digital Media revenue growth will slow over the next few years. Despite this, analysts like Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI described Adobe’s recent move as “another step toward addressing the ‘existential risk’ question” about the effect of generative AI on its business. Adobe’s strategy At the conference in Los Angeles, Adobe introduced several new features aimed at keeping AI-focused creators within its platform. One of the biggest additions is of AI models from competitors like Google and OpenAI into Adobe’s tools, including Photoshop. For years, the company promoted its in-house Firefly AI models, which were trained to avoid copyright issues and offensive content. Firefly has already been used to create more than 29 billion images and other assets since launch. However, Adobe is now also buying access to third-party AI models and offering them directly to its customers. This allows creators to choose between Adobe’s Firefly and external AI systems depending on their needs. Adobe makes about $250 million a year from its AI products, but it says AI helps its business in more ways than that. The company now uses a broader term called “AI-influenced revenue,” which means any money earned with help from AI, such as charging higher prices or keeping more customers. By Adobe’s estimate, AI affects about $5 billion of its yearly revenue. Adobe’s chief technology officer for its creative business, Ely Greenfield, pointed out that many customers use Firefly for commercial projects but turn to other AI models for brainstorming or experimental work. “People are getting more comfortable with the idea that models are trained on a large number of things,” Greenfield said. Jackson Ader from KeyBanc noted that customers at the event were enthusiastic about the expanded AI options. “We welcome the strategy as we have been skeptical of Adobe’s ability to compete on the like-for-like merits of AI image and video generation,” he wrote. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, insisted that his firm’s software remains essential for creators who want professional-quality results, and its stock price struggles are mainly due to investors’ distraction with semiconductor companies and AI model developers.

In an interview, Waller said, “The biggest concern we have right now is the labor market,” he told Larry Kudlow on Fox Business Network. “We know inflation is going to come back down, so this is why I’m still advocating that we cut policy rates in December, because that’s what all the data is telling me to do.” A group of Federal Reserve bank presidents shared their concerns on Friday, October 31, regarding the US central bank’s decision to reduce interest rates this week. Sources pointed out that the situation illustrates disagreement among Fed policymakers, creating difficulties for their chair, Jerome Powell. This is because he is required to find common ground during his final six months in the position. Fed’s disagreement on rate cuts sparks controversy Following the disagreement among Fed policymakers, analysts noted that it is common to have conflicting views on policy, especially when economic data are unclear. However, they argued that the Fed’s move to openly discuss their disagreements and clearly focus on what they should decide at their next meeting, scheduled for December 9-10, was significant. In the meantime, during a banking conference, Lorie Logan, the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, mentioned that she did not see a reason to lower rates this week. Based on her argument, supporting another rate cut will be difficult unless there is clear evidence that inflation will drop faster than expected or the job market will decelerate sharply. The president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Beth Hammack, also weighed in on the situation. At the same conference, Hammack mentioned, “Considering our recent decision, I think we are close to my idea of neutrality: we’re only slightly restrictive if at all.” Although she did not participate in this year’s vote on policy, like Logan, the CEO disagreed with the rate cut this week, and both will have the right to vote next year. Hammack expressed her belief that they need to maintain some level of restriction to help bring inflation back down to their target. On the other hand, Waller, who has a permanent vote and is one of the candidates that US President Donald Trump could choose for Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May, expressed a very different perspective. According to him, the country’s main current challenge is the job market. Interestingly, both Waller and Logan suggested that Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to lead to a surge in inflation. However, while Waller believes that this backs the idea of rate cuts, Logan expressed her concerns about the increasing costs of services. They also agreed that the absence of official economic data during the government shutdown does not cause the uncertainty Powell talked about earlier this week as a reason to hold off on rate cuts. Waller stresses the importance of further rate cuts Logan mentioned that private-sector figures, state-level unemployment entitlements, and the Fed’s own business and societal surveys give visibility into the state of the economy. She believed these elements support her argument that the job market is not slowing down enough to necessitate the Fed’s intervention, especially because inflation continues to be too high and is taking too long to hit the Fed’s 2% target . “The fog story has to end: it may imply that you need to take it easy, but it doesn’t mean you should stop completely,” Waller said. According to him, it is advisable to exercise caution due to economic uncertainties, but this situation should not prompt policymakers to halt rate cuts; instead, he urges that the best way to handle policy is to continue making cuts.

Analysts Predict 35x Potential by 2027,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-under-0-05-right-now-analysts-predict-35x-potential-by-2027/,"With Bitcoin stabilizing and the next bull cycle approaching, investors are scanning the market for early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and high upside potential. While most top tokens are already priced far above the $1 mark, analysts say one project under $0.05 could deliver the kind of exponential gains not seen since Solana or Aave’s early days. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol that combines audited smart contracts, yield-based utility, and transparent tokenomics to create one of the most promising crypto launches of 2025. Many experts now call MUTM one of the potential best cryptocurrencies to buy under $0.05, pointing to its rising presale momentum, audited security, and clear path to becoming a live product in just a few months. If current projections hold, analysts estimate that the token could rise up to 35x by 2027, driven by adoption and the rollout of its decentralized lending ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its presale in Phase 6. The price of every token has increased to $0.035 from the initial $0.01. Phase 1 participants already witnessed a 250% token appreciation since early 2025. Price will be increased by nearly 20% moving into stage phase 7 at $0.04 and the launch price is set at $0.06. As of now, the total sales of the tokens are over 785 million, as well as increasing the amount of money raised by over $18 million from the very beginning by 17,600 holders around the world. The succession of each stage is sold quicker than the previous one, as there is increasing confidence in the product and demand. MUTM is not just a presale token. This project is establishing a non-custodial lending and borrowing system that is efficient and transparent in crypto lending. Participants are able to lend assets and get interest with no intermediaries or borrow against holdings directly. The system incorporates decentralized security with true yield potential, something new projects can hardly achieve. V1 Protocol Launch, mtTokens, and Buy-and-Distribute Model The initial significant milestone of Mutuum Finance is the V1 protocol , which will launch into the Sepolia testnet on Q4 2025. It will launch some fundamental infrastructure: a liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens and an automated liquidator bot to stabilize the situation. The design of Mutuum Finance revolves around mtTokens. Users that deposit assets such as ETH or USDT are given an equivalent amount of mtToken plus accrued interest. As an example, providing 1 ETH will result in 1 mtETH, which increases with the repayment of loans by the borrowers. Lenders get passive income that is completely transparent and under smart contracts. Borrowers will either opt to use the variable interest rates or use the stable interest rates. Every loan is over-collateralized and the software automatically sells off the positions that drop below the safety level. This system maintains the solvency and rewarding liquidity providers. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is an important aspect of the Mutuum Finance economy. The purchase of the MUTM tokens in the open market is done by revenue generated through lending. These tokens are redistributed to stakers of mtTokens to create a self-reinforcing cycle that makes the use of tokens dependent on demand. According to analysts, this tokenomics framework can provide MUTM with an advantage against most of its competitors in DeFi at an early stage. The purchasing power is added with every loan sale and this spurs internal growth. According to some valuation estimates, MUTM is predicted to be valued at $0.50 in 2026. Oracles, Layer-2 Expansion and Stablecoin According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance is going to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin that is over-collateralized with ecosystem loans. Minting and burning will ensure that the price does not fluctuate due to off-chain assets that can lead to the failure of the peg. The project intends to use Layer-2 networks after the testnet. It will reduce transaction costs and increase speed, making the platform more affordable to users, a necessary shift in DeFi protocols vying against each other in scalability. The team is planning to adopt a decentralized oracle system, probably beginning with Chainlink, to be able to price all of its supported assets correctly in real-time. Trustworthy oracle data will avoid unwarranted liquidations and fallback. Many analysts think that such integrations will drive the protocol usage to large proportions and hence push the demand of MUTM via the buy-distribute model. This scalability and revenue connection imply Mutuum Finance among the potential best projects in DeFi to follow. Analysts estimate that MUTM may fetch between $1.00 and $1.20 two years into the market, 35x more than its current presale price should it be adopted successfully. It would put it in the same growth path as early-stage giants such as Solana and Aave. Final Outlook Mutuum Finance is currently $0.05, which has earned people’s attention due to well-developed tokenomics, rigorous security audits, and an established product vision that facilitates long-term expansion. Mutuum Finance can enter a rich DeFi ecosystem right at the start, where every transaction causes the demand to rise on the tokens. The project is rapidly achieving milestones as Phase 6 becomes fully allocated, and the V1 protocol becomes operational in the fourth quarter of 2025. Considering predictions of analysts that a 35x increase over the next couple of years may occur, Mutuum finance is possibly one of the new success stories of DeFi.

Tether’s direct and indirect exposure to U.S. government debt reached an all-time high of about $135 billion, as the firm catapulted ahead of countries such as South Korea to become the 17th largest holder of Treasuries globally. In its press release, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief executive, stated, “Q3 2025 results reflect the continued trust and strength behind Tether, even amid a global challenging macroeconomic environment, reinforcing Tether’s brand as the ‘Stable Company’,” He added that the company’s record exposure to U.S. Treasuries and its disciplined growth “position Tether as a pillar of stability in the financial and tech ecosystem.” Tether diversifies reserves with BTC, gold Tether reportedly held $12.9 billion in gold and $9.9 billion in Bitcoin, both of which represent roughly 13% of total reserves. The company also issued a record number of new USDT tokens worth over $17 billion in the third quarter alone, and this brought the total circulating supply to more than $174 billion. Tether stated that it now serves over 500 million users globally. Its growing user base and issuance figures further entrench USDT’s dominance over other stablecoins such as USDC and USDe, among others, consolidating Tether’s role as the leading digital dollar of the crypto economy. In October, Tether completed a settlement with bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network using its proprietary investment capital, without affecting reserves backing issued tokens, which have since surpassed $183 billion in circulation. It has also launched a share buyback initiative, signaling a new phase in corporate structuring aimed at attracting institutional investors through a private placement. Tether Holdings, the group’s parent entity, has applied for an Investment Fund License in El Salvador under the country’s new Private Alternative Investment Fund law. Tether also has other investments in artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and communications infrastructure through its subsidiaries Tether Holdings and Tether Investments, and they are not included in the reserves backing USDT.

Remember when Ethereum hit a high of around $4K after a sweltering 56% rally in July? Three months later, Ethereum finds itself hovering around the same price level, sparking speculation over whether we could be heading into a deep consolidation zone or possibly even a downtrend. Amid this uncertainty, institutional investors are making the most of the dip to beef up their Ethereum holdings. Bitmine, easily the biggest Ethereum holder globally, has reportedly added another 44,036 $ETH ($166M) to its kitty, according to blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain. This now brings the firm’s total Ethereum holdings to over 3.3M $ETH, currently valued at more than $12.7B. Also, this isn’t Bitmine’s only purchase during Ethereum’s current downtrend. Just over 10 days ago, the firm scooped up $250M worth of Ethereum . Ethereum Price Prediction: Long-Term Bullish Picture Remains Intact So, what is Tom Lee seeing that retail investors are not? For one, Ethereum currently appears to be finding strong support at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Even more important is the fact that the last time this happened, $ETH spent nearly two months consolidating around the 200 EMA before triggering a 100% rally. Going by this alone, we could be in for another month of consolidation before a new rally ensues. Additionally, the token is currently retesting an important breakout zone – a former resistance turned support level that it broke out of during its August rally. This particular zone, around the $4K mark, has been one of Ethereum’s most important levels recently. Most notably, it sparked a nearly 70% downtrend in December last year. All in all, even though Ethereum’s current choppy price action looks sheepish, its long-term bullish picture remains firmly intact. This, in fact, means now’s the best to load up on low-cap, high-upside tokens. Here are our top three suggestions for the best altcoins to buy now . 1. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Exciting Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Offering Real Rewards Currently available at just $0.0011272, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is one of the best cheap cryptos to buy right now. What makes it even more attractive is its potential to churn out life-changing returns. According to our PepeNode price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $642 by the end of 2026, as the token could hit a high of $0.0072. What is PepeNode, you ask? It’s a unique mine-to-earn cryptocurrency project that makes crypto mining accessible to everyday users, while also offering them real rewards in return. Simply put, you get an empty virtual server room as soon as you become a $PEPENODE holder . From there, your job is to stack the room with the most optimal combination of mining nodes. The trick is to experiment with different meme nodes, as each one has its own characteristics, mining capabilities, and compatibility with other nodes. Getting this combination right is absolutely crucial if you want to maximize your earnings from PepeNode’s gamified mining ecosystem. Then, once PepeNode’s TGE (Token Generation Event) is complete and its virtual mining simulator goes live, the top players on the leaderboard will receive free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens as rewards. Given that it offers a low-cost, user-friendly way to engage in crypto mining – albeit virtual – it’s no surprise PepeNode has already pulled in over $2M in its presale. Join the PepeNode presale today – and be part of the biggest virtual crypto mining platform. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Viral Doge-Themed Meme Coin Eyeing 1000x Returns If you’ve watched Dogecoin struggle to rally to new highs and wondered if this is the end of dog-themed meme coins, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is here to give you some hope. With over $3.8M already raised in its ongoing presale, $MAXI is in a strong position to become the next 1000x crypto . According to our $MAXI price prediction , it could hit a high of $0.0058 by the end of 2026, giving early adopters a mind-boggling 2,000% return on their investment. Take a look at our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MAXI for just $0.000266 . What is Maxi Doge ? On the surface, he’s a furious Shiba Inu out for revenge on his distant cousin, Dogecoin. Under the hood, though, his insatiable desire for revenge stems from an emotional backstory – one where Dogecoin hogged all the limelight, leaving Maxi to grow up in loneliness. That’s when Maxi decided to hit the gym, bulk up, and inject his veins not just with protein shakes, but with the charts themselves, preparing to become the ultimate meme coin for degen investors. Looking ahead, $MAXI plans to dominate the space through its masterfully crafted tokenomics, which allocates 40% of its total token supply to marketing. This includes PR pushes, influencer collaborations, and social media campaigns, as well as holder-exclusive benefits such as weekly trading events and leaderboard prizes. On top of that, $MAXI also plans to list on futures platforms, positioning itself right alongside Dogecoin as the perfect gateway for meme coin traders seeking liquid markets, leveraged bets, and life-changing returns. Join the next big ‘dawg’ in its journey to 1000x – buy $MAXI tokens today! 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Donald Trump’s Meme Coin Surges Again Donald Trump’s popularity among crypto investors is on the rise again, evident from the recent surge in his official meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) . The token is up nearly 32% this week after finding strong support around the $5.7 mark. Most importantly, $TRUMP has now broken out of a long-standing downward sloping resistance line, one that had capped its momentum since February. According to this trading pattern, if the token holds its breakout, we could see a sharp move toward $24.5 – a massive 200% gain from current levels. On the fundamentals side, the biggest reason behind this surge could be Trump’s recent warming up to China and efforts to bring the U.S. closer to a trade deal – a move that could ease tensions across not just crypto but also global stock markets. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-crypto stance continues. Most recently, he even pardoned Binance’s founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao , calling his prosecution an ‘overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,’ and ‘a war on cryptocurrency.’ Interested? Buy $TRUMP on Binance or any of the other crypto exchanges. Recap : With Ethereum likely consolidating before potentially finding renewed momentum, now could be the perfect time to hit a home run by scooping up low-cap gems like PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP). Disclaimer : Please do your own research before investing in crypto. It’s a highly volatile market, and this article is not financial advice.

This single deal dramatically boosted the month’s overall crypto fundraising figures. But what exactly is Polymarket?

If so, there will likely be a shift in investors’ interest. This is because a handful of smaller altcoins, including Algorand, Floki Inu, and Remittix , are being highlighted as possible alternative picks, thanks to their lower cap and higher reward. For those willing to embrace risk and a long-term horizon, this altcoin chapter might just be beginning, and these three represent distinct angles in that story. Let’s quickly flesh out the details of how they might all play out over the coming weeks. Why Bitcoin May Be Running Out of Steam Multiple sources now argue that BTC could be nearing a short-term ceiling. For instance, analysts at VanEck maintain a forecast near $180,000, but also note that derivative indicators (such as CME basis rates) suggest speculative extremes already. What this implies is: for many investors, the question isn’t just “how high can BTC go?” but also “what if this is as far as the rally goes before rotation?” If BTC peaks near $133K, capital may begin to rotate out of the king coin and into altcoins, setting the stage for the next act. Altcoins in Focus: ALGO, FLOKI & RTX Algorand: Although most investors overlook it, the token’s fundamentals appear to be gaining attention. Its staking participation recently hit around 67%, up 121% year-over-year. Some bullish modelling puts ALGO’s 2025 range much higher than its current price, though most forecasts are modest ($0.17-$0.33) for the near term. Floki Inu: For those willing to risk more of their portfolio on meme tokens, recent technical commentary highlights a breakout setup in Floki near $0.00008, following a period of consolidation. While conventional models are far from 2,000% gains, the market dynamic (if altcoins heat up) could see exaggerated moves for a token with a low base price. Remittix: And then there’s Remittix. Built as a payment-infrastructure token enabling crypto-to-fiat global transfers, supporting bank-account payouts in multiple currencies. In a scenario where BTC stalls, utility-driven altcoins like RTX may attract capital under the real-world use case theme. With execution and listings still ahead, this kind of altcoin could see outsized gains relative to BTC. Why this Matters Right Now If Bitcoin peaks or stalls, we may see capital rotation from large-cap ‘safe bets’ into altcoins, especially those with lower valuations or clear utility. In that scenario, altcoins like ALGO, FLOKI, and RTX become more appealing. For example, if BTC’s rally is capped and growth flows begin seeking higher-beta assets, returns of 2 000% or more for certain altcoins aren’t impossible (though highly speculative). That potential is greater when the base price is low (e.g., FLOKI) or when utility is strong and valuations modest (e.g., RTX). Is BTC done for now? If yes, which altcoins could benefit most from the next leg? That’s the lens through which ALGO, FLOKI and RTX should be viewed.

What Happened At MEXC? Market analyst J.A. Maartun was among the first to draw attention to the situation, sharing a chart on social media that indicated a significant spike in withdrawal transactions around midday. Researcher Hanzo also shed light on the unfolding drama, revealing the plight of a user known as “The White Whale.” This individual claimed that his account was suspended despite engaging in trading without the use of bots or APIs, leaving him unable to access his funds, which he estimated at between $3 million and $5 million. The White Whale alleged that customer support was unresponsive and that when he engaged with Cecilia Hsueh, MEXC’s new Chief Strategy Officer, he was pressured to admit to breaking the rules to have his funds released, a claim he firmly denied. Related Reading: Coinbase, Strategy Mark Major Profit Surges In Q3: Unveiling The Numbers Cecilia later responded that their conversation should have remained private and accused The White Whale of misrepresenting the facts. MEXC subsequently announced its intention to take legal action against him for alleged misinformation. However, as the situation escalated, a wave of support emerged from the cryptocurrency community, including notable figures like ZachXBT, as many users reported similar issues with MEXC. This collective response led to warnings on social media urging users to withdraw their funds immediately, fueling the growing unrest. CSO Issues Apology In a rapid development, Cecilia issued an apology and confirmed that The White Whale’s withdrawal had been processed. She stated: We fucked up. We apologize to @TheWhiteWhaleV2, and his money is already released. He can claim it at any time. I messed up in communicating with him. I got emotional, and I shouldn’t have. Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up. She noted that MEXC has experienced rapid growth, but its operational and public relations teams had struggled to keep pace. “We’re going to change that,” she stated, emphasizing that leadership has begun to recognize the need for improvement in transparency and operations. Related Reading: dYdX Eyes US Market Entry: Decentralized Crypto Exchange Plans Year-End Debut, Reuters In response to the swirling rumors of bankruptcy, MEXC took to social media to clarify its financial status. The exchange stated, “Recent online discussions have circulated unverified rumors regarding MEXC’s financial status. We would like to clearly state that these claims are false and misleading.” They assured users that MEXC remains financially healthy, with all user assets fully backed.

Here’s what has usually followed this trend in the last two months. Ethereum Funding Rate Suggests Traders Are Now Bearish As explained by analytics firm Santiment in a new post on X, shorts are dominating the Ethereum derivatives market now. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Funding Rate ,” which measures the amount of periodic fee that traders are exchanging between each other on the various derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric is positive, it means long holders are paying a premium to those with short bets in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is dominant. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the derivatives traders as a whole may be holding a bearish mentality as short positions outweigh the long ones. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Ethereum Funding Rate across all exchanges over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Funding Rate has witnessed a decline into the negative zone recently, which implies derivatives market balance has shifted toward bearish positions. The market sentiment turning red, however, may not actually be a negative for the cryptocurrency’s price. In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted the pattern that the asset has followed with this metric during the past two months. It would appear that ETH has tended to go against the Funding Rate in this window. That is, a notable positive level has led into price corrections, while a negative one into price rebounds. The explanation behind the trend may lie in the fact that the dominant side of the market is more likely to get entangled in a liquidation squeeze . Such an event tends to be violent, involving a cascade of liquidations that feeds back into price volatility. While the Ethereum Funding Rate has turned red, its value is still not as negative as some of the previous lows that resulted in short squeezes, so it only remains to be seen whether one will follow this time. In some other news, Ethereum saw significant net exchange outflows of about $643 million over the past week, as revealed by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in an X post . Bitcoin saw even greater exchange withdrawals of more than $2 billion. “This is a strong bullish signal despite market uncertainty, as investors are moving coins into self-custody for long-term holding,” explained Sentora.

His point was clear to those following the market closely. XRP is not in disarray, and the available data supports that view. Hey guys bad news. I just found out we’re in shambles right now. $XRP I didn’t know that, but disappointed to learn. https://t.co/FocHR2JApX — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) October 31, 2025 What’s Happening to XRP? On October 30, XRP was hit with major decline , hitting its lowest point in almost a week. However, this decline was short-lived. The digital asset briefly dipped below BNB due to this decline, but its rebound has pushed it up. With a margin between the assets now exceeding $2 billion, XRP is now the fourth-largest digital asset. The recovery came amid renewed optimism surrounding institutional products tied to XRP, particularly the progress of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF . Its debut marks a milestone for XRP, aligning it more closely with mainstream financial infrastructure. Additional spot ETF filings currently under SEC review further contribute to the anticipation that institutional adoption could accelerate in the months ahead. Market Position and Recovery XRP’s return above BNB demonstrates its sustained investor support and the strength of the XRP army. The recovery reflects confidence in its liquidity, established network utility, and expanding institutional interest . Despite fluctuations typical of the crypto market, XRP’s stability in recent sessions has contrasted with the volatility affecting several top assets. This rebound follows a period of increased skepticism from segments of the crypto community, which often interprets short-term movements as long-term shifts. However, XRP’s trading data shows the opposite trend.

XRP has also seen consistent market engagement, and many in the community joined Moon Lambo to mock the idea of the XRP army being in shambles. What to Expect from XRP Moon Lambo’s post highlighted the disconnection between social media narratives and actual market conditions. Far from being in shambles, XRP’s metrics and institutional progress show the network is regaining momentum. With its price recovery, strengthened market rank, and growing ETF exposure, XRP’s position remains stable. The sarcastic tone of Moon Lambo’s post serves as a reminder that sentiment on social platforms often diverges from real performance, and XRP appears firmly back on track for another uptrend .

Peterson noted that Bitcoin's price action over the past four months has been highly similar to that of 2011, 2014, 2018, and 2022. The analyst said the sharp declines experienced in November during these years indicate a historically recurring “seasonal risk.” “The price action is 91%, 90%, 92%, and 82% correlated with previous years,” Peterson said. “In most of these periods, Bitcoin experienced heavy losses in November.” The analyst specifically highlighted the period around November 8th, stating that Bitcoin has historically experienced declines around this date, coinciding with the “30th percentile price path.” He also argued that the second and third weeks of November have been challenging for Bitcoin over the past four years, and that this is no coincidence. Related News: Tron Founder Justin Sun's Net Worth Revealed Peterson said that downside risk is not only associated with technical but also macroeconomic factors: “Mid-November is the period when companies announce their third-quarter earnings and revised earnings expectations for next year. Lowering expectations usually leads to a flight from risky assets, and this is reflected in Bitcoin.” The analyst also highlighted significant past events. The 2018 crypto winter began in November, and the FTX crash occurred on November 8, 2022. The first signs of the Mt. Gox scandal also emerged in November 2013. “Markets have been jittery in recent weeks, with the VIX rising and stocks selling off sharply in the face of weak earnings. It appears the market is looking for a sell signal,” Peterson concluded. *This is not investment advice.

Her latest post highlights that XRP has “rejected the Wave 4 resistance near $2.68,” showing early signs of renewed downside momentum. The chart presents a clear Elliott Wave framework with XRP trading around $2.47 at the time of analysis. According to the structure, XRP’s decline completed its fourth corrective wave, and it is now forming the fifth wave of the sequence. The Wave 4 rejection coincides with Fibonacci retracement levels between $2.65 and $2.69, areas that historically mark the transition point between retracement and continuation within corrective patterns. XRP Looks Ready for Its Final Drop XRP is reacting exactly as expected after rejecting the Wave 4 resistance near $2.68. Price is now turning bearish, and RSI is making a new low, starting to confirm that Wave 5 down is underway… On #Coinbase , the key supports to… pic.twitter.com/PZ3nDd8LF2 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) October 30, 2025 Key Support Levels to Watch CasiTrades identified $2.42, $2.03, and $1.65 as the critical support levels to monitor as XRP begins its next move. She noted that falling below $2.42 would confirm a bearish continuation toward the lower targets at $2.03 and $1.65. The chart shows alignment between these levels and major Fibonacci retracement zones, particularly the 0.618 extension near $1.65, which also aligns with the projected termination of Wave 5. This structure indicates that XRP’s recent decline could still have room to extend before establishing a durable bottom. The analyst emphasized that both $2.03 and $1.65 represent strong technical alignment that could attract accumulation once the downward move reaches exhaustion. The move toward these levels would mark the completion of the corrective cycle, potentially setting the stage for a significant trend reversal in the months ahead. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reversal Indicators Amid RSI Weakness Supporting the bearish scenario, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the four-hour chart has begun forming a new low, signaling increasing downside pressure. CasiTrades explained that RSI is “making a new low, starting to confirm that Wave 5 down is underway.” However, she also stated that as the price approaches the final support region, she will monitor the RSI for signs of a bullish divergence , an early indication that selling momentum is weakening and a bottom could be forming. The RSI currently sits near the midline, suggesting that further decline could unfold before a reversal emerges. Preparing for a Shift in Momentum While October appears to be ending on a weaker note, CasiTrades believes that “November could kick off the next major wave.” The analysis suggests that after the completion of the corrective Wave 5, XRP could initiate a strong impulsive rally consistent with the next wave in the larger Elliott Wave cycle.

The development positions the telecommunications firms alongside other corporate validators, such as Google and Samsung. In its announcement , Theta Network mentioned that the telecommunications firm is the first of its kind on its blockchain, with the feat marking a major advancement for Deutsche Telekom. Alongside the other corporate validators, Deutsche Telekom will be charged with the core blockchain function of verifying transactions and securing the Layer 1 network. The company’s specific validator address is also publicly active on the Theta blockchain. Deutsche Telekom becomes a validator on Theta Network With the new development, Deutsche Telekom is expected to secure its role on Theta Network by staking the protocol’s native THETA token. In return, the telecommunications company will earn staking rewards that will be paid in TFUEL, the operational token used for gas fees and payments on the Theta Network’s Theta EdgeCloud platform. Theta EdgeCloud is a decentralized, hybrid cloud edge computing platform that matches demand with supply from community edge nodes and cloud partners to provide distributed GPU capacity. In addition to its provision of strong price and performance characteristics, it offloads computation to edge nodes, reducing latency and costs to traditional centralized cloud providers. It provides support to different applications, including generative AI, 3D modeling, and real-time data processing. With its hybrid architecture, the platform allows developers, researchers, and enterprises access to scalable, affordable, and high-performance computing infrastructure. In addition, Theta EdgeCloud is leading the way in decentralized AI and media innovation. Its global partners include the NBA team Houston Rockets, AI labs of Stanford University, Seoul National University, and Singapore NTU. The addition of Deutsche Telekom will help the platform increase its enterprise footprint in the AI markets. Theta Network hails the growing importance of AI Deutsche Telekom mentioned that the move is a natural extension of its existing infrastructure business into decentralized computing. The company also noted Theta’s emphasis on performance and reliability in AI-heavy environments as the key to its decision. “We’ve been impressed by recent Theta EdgeCloud use cases focused on reliability, performance, and security, particularly in academia, where large AI models are trained and served at the edge. Theta’s decentralized architecture aligns with our focus on dependable, secure infrastructure. As a digital leader, we’re happy to support this innovative technology and contribute to its growth, unlocking new possibilities and opportunities in the process,” Dirk Roeder, Head of Telekom MMS Web3 Infrastructure and Solutions, said. On its part, Theta Network mentioned that it was happy to welcome Deutsche Telekom as the first digital telco to its network. Mitch Liu, CEO and co-founder of Theta Labs, highlighted the work the telecommunications firm had put in in the blockchain industry, calling it “a pioneer in blockchain adoption and infrastructure.” “Their decision to operate a Theta validator node underscores Theta’s growing importance as the leader in decentralized cloud services for AI, media, and entertainment,” he added. This isn’t Deutsche Telekom’s first rodeo in the blockchain industry. The telecom firm has built a considerable Web3 portfolio through its subsidiary Deutsche Telekom MMS. The telecom giant had also previously provided enterprise-grade infrastructure and validation services to major protocols, including Ethereum, Chainlink, and Polkadot. Last year, it launched a pilot project with Bankhaus Metzler to operate a Bitcoin mining initiative with surplus energy. The pair planned to use renewable energy sources that would have remained unused due to the grid’s limitations. The project, which was carried out at Rival GmbH Engineering in Backnang, saw the mining operations powered by the company’s system. The company also used Telekom MMS’s expertise in Web3 technology to carry out the operation.

This forecast reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s ability to maintain its dominance in the Layer-1 ecosystem — especially with the continued rise of staking, DeFi integration, and scalability improvements through Layer 2s. A similar wave of optimism is being seen around projects that are building around Ethereum’s ecosystem — including Ethena, ether.fi, and emerging PayFi platforms like Remittix , which is bridging crypto with real-world payments. Ethereum Price Prediction: Analysts See Renewed Institutional Confidence Ethereum’s steady climb continues, now trading at $3,848.10, up 2.29% in the last 24 hours. Its $466.08 billion market cap positions it firmly as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with renewed inflows from institutional investors as ETFs and staking derivatives expand. Trading volume stands at $38.75 billion, a slight 12.97% dip from previous highs — but analysts suggest this may signal accumulation rather than exit. Projects such as Ethena and ether.fi are driving fresh momentum within the wider Ethereum ecosystem by leveraging the network’s powerful staking and restaking narrative. Ethena changes hands for $0.3959 with a market capitalization of 2.85 billion, while ether.fi trades at $0.945, up 8.26% in 24 hours. Such returns reveal an appetite for Ethereum-based protocols with yield and decentralized infrastructure that mirrors the growth trajectory of Ethereum’s price over the next year. Remittix Expands Wallet Beta Testing and Hits New Milestones As Ethereum projects surge, Remittix (RTX) is carving out its own lane in PayFi — a new sector combining crypto and fiat finance. The project recently raised over $27.7 million in private funding, selling 681 million+ tokens at a current price of $0.1166 per RTX. The funds have been directed toward scaling its crypto-to-bank transfer infrastructure, already capable of supporting payments across 30+ countries. Remittix is extending its Wallet Beta Testing Program to include additional community members, including iOS users, in a significant development. The top ten buyers will be asked to try the app and offer feedback during the next phase, which will begin weekly on October 20. Remittix has achieved impressive progress in both security and trust, which are increasingly important considerations in the adoption of DeFi. The Remittix project has been thoroughly screened by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the world. Why Remittix Is Emerging as the Next Big Crypto Utility: Fully verified by CertiK, ensuring security and investor confidence Over $27.7 million raised in private funding — strong institutional backing Wallet Beta Testing now open to more users, expanding ecosystem access Direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries — true real-world use Ranked #1 Pre-Launch Project on CertiK Skynet The Road to 2026: Ethereum and Remittix Lead a New Utility Era If Ethereum reaches $10,000, it could set off a wave of value creation across projects that extend its ecosystem’s real-world impact.

Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, even stated that the firm is on track for $15 billion in profit this year and an extraordinary 99% margin—making it one of the most profitable businesses globally on a per-employee basis. Tether and Circle invest user deposits in safe, yield-bearing assets Stablecoins have emerged as a major source of cryptocurrency liquidity and are utilized in exchanges, decentralized finance systems, and cross-border payment systems. Since they offer more stability compared to other tokens, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, among others, which experience rapid value fluctuations, they have been instrumental for businesses and institutional investors in value transfer. Stablecoin issuers make money by earning interest on the assets backing their tokens. Companies like Tether and Circle are investing user deposits in safe, yield-bearing assets—mainly U.S. Treasuries and cash—and keep the returns rather than sharing them with users. The GENIUS Act, enacted in July, codifies this principle by preventing authorized stablecoin issuers from distributing any form of yield to holders. Lawmakers intended to position payment stablecoins as cash-like instruments, rather than investments. Nonetheless, growing stablecoin competition has forced some projects to experiment with distinct forms of initially spreading value. USDe is one of the major disruptors to emerge, creating a synthetic dollar model that instantly yields returns to holders. Users keeping USDC on Coinbase can also generate a 3.85% APY, though it was a creative check to the GENIUS Act’s issuer-provided yield prohibition. This represents a shift in how ROI is generated and distributed within the crypto community. BlackRock is increasingly involved in the stablecoin market In a report released in late September, Citi analysts predicted that stablecoin issuance could reach $4 trillion by the end of the decade, compared to approximately $280 billion today. Financial giant BlackRock has been increasing its involvement in the stablecoin market as demand for tokenized cash products grows. The company has long worked with Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, overseeing most of its reserve fund. Following Circle’s high-profile stock market debut in June, the company is also exploring the option of offering similar services for reserve management to other stablecoin issuers. It has also been building on that, with its BSTBL fund serving as an important part of its broader strategy to expand in digital finance. Jon Steel, the global head of product and platform for BlackRock’s cash management business, told CNBC the fund helps the firm extend its reach in a rapidly maturing sector. He noted, “It represents an opportunity not just to help our clients if they’re looking to issue a stablecoin and how we can help them in doing that, but clearly this is going to create the potential for new distribution opportunities.” The fund is open to institutional investors, including pension funds and university endowments.

They have proven their worth, built strong foundations, and made early investors very wealthy. But the markets for these coins have matured, and their wild growth days are mostly behind them. Now, large investors, often referred to as “whales,” are quietly turning their attention to a new opportunity that could represent the next big frontier: Digitap ($TAP) . Ethereum and Solana: The Old Giants Ethereum was the pioneer that changed how crypto works. It allowed people to create decentralized apps, smart contracts, and entire financial systems on the blockchain. It became the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Solana came next, bringing faster transactions with lower fees, and making it one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in the crypto world. These two giants built the foundations of the modern blockchain economy. However, because they are already massive and well-established, their future growth may not match the explosive growth of their early years. They are like the bustling gold towns of the old days — still valuable, but crowded, with fewer surprises left. Whales, who made fortunes by moving early in Ethereum and Solana, are now searching for the next place to strike gold. And right now, that place appears to be Digitap. Whales Are Quietly Shifting to Digitap Whales play a big role in every crypto cycle. They are the investors who move large amounts of capital and often spot trends before the rest of the market catches on. Their moves can signal what’s coming next — and lately, those moves have been pointing straight toward Digitap. Digitap isn’t promising future innovation; it has already built it. The platform acts as a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, allowing people to use digital money just like cash. It connects digital wallets, bank accounts, and even offshore financial tools — making it easy to move money instantly anywhere in the world. Users can withdraw funds to their cards or bank accounts in seconds, rather than waiting days like traditional banks. The platform features a Visa-backed Digitap Card, accepted anywhere Visa is accepted. It’s compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, enabling users to make payments with a simple tap of their phone. Every transaction happens within seconds, with low fees and strong privacy protection. Digitap also prioritizes privacy. It avoids tracking, utilizes advanced encryption, and grants users complete control over their identity and data. With traditional banks charging average international transfer fees of around 6.4%, Digitap’s sub-1% fees are a clear advantage. It’s easy, fast, and built for the modern, borderless world. Why Digitap Could Enter the Top 50 Cryptos Digitap’s growth forecasts are bold, but not unrealistic. The global payments market is worth over $250 trillion annually, and even a tiny share of that market could make a significant difference. If the project continues to grow at its current pace, analysts believe it could one day become one of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market value. The token itself, $TAP, has an innovative deflationary system. Each transaction triggers an automatic buyback and token burn, gradually reducing the supply over time. As the platform gains more users, token demand naturally increases, pushing value higher. Holders also earn rewards for staking or spending within the ecosystem, making it both practical and rewarding. The presale has already crossed $1.2 million, with the token currently priced at $0.0268. The next round will rise to $0.0297, illustrating the rapid growth of early demand. Whales see the potential for large gains here — not just from speculation, but from long-term real-world adoption. The Modern Crypto Rush Most crypto presales are based on promises and whitepapers, with real products arriving much later. Digitap is different because it already works. The platform has undergone two security audits, one by Solidproof and another by Coinsult . Both audits reported that its code and contracts are safe. Additionally, the app utilizes artificial intelligence to assist users in managing their finances more efficiently. It automatically finds the most efficient way to exchange currencies, reducing costs and improving transaction speed. Freelancers, global businesses, and remote workers who frequently deal with multiple currencies can greatly benefit from this. It’s this kind of real utility that has drawn serious investors. Whales aren’t looking for hype — they’re looking for projects that can scale globally and solve real problems. Digitap fits that profile perfectly. Is $TAP the Best Crypto to Invest in This Year? Ethereum built the blockchain revolution, and Solana made it faster. Now, Digitap is bringing that revolution into everyday life. With its working Visa card, low fees, and robust privacy tools, it bridges the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance. Whales are moving in early, recognizing that this might be the next “gold field” of the crypto era. Digitap might just be the next big crypto runner. Those who get in early could once again find themselves at the start of a financial gold rush. Digitap is Live NOW.

Digitap is emerging as a significant player in this landscape, attracting attention from major investors, commonly referred to as whales. The Evolution of Cryptocurrency Giants Ethereum and Solana have laid down the foundational architecture of the blockchain economy, transforming digital transactions and establishing robust ecosystems. However, as these platforms mature, the astronomical growth rates of their early days are unlikely to continue. They now represent well-established territories with limited room for explosive growth, reminiscent of bustling old gold rush towns. Here is where Digitap steps in, seizing the opportunity to innovate where the predecessors have now stabilized. It offers a unique blend of cryptocurrency utilities with traditional financial systems, redefining ease of transactions in the digital age. Digitap: A New Frontier for Whales The whales of the cryptocurrency world, known for their large capital investments and trend-setting moves, are now aligning their sights on Digitap, suggesting a potential shift in the crypto economy. The appeal of Digitap lies in its real-world application and technological innovation. The platform is not just a concept but a functional service that integrates digital wallets, bank accounts, and even offshore financial services seamlessly. This integration allows for instantaneous transactions worldwide, a crucial feature for a global economy. Why Digitap Could Dominate the Crypto Market Drawing from a robust growth forecast, Digitap is positioned to tap into the global payments market, which is valued at over $250 trillion . Even securing a fraction of this market could catapult Digitap into the leading group of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the platform has engineered a unique deflationary token system where each transaction triggers a token buyback and burn, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. Such features make Digitap not just innovative but also sustainable in the long term. The presale momentum of Digitap is already strong, having raised significant capital, signaling robust investor confidence and interest. Learn more about the Digitap presale . Real-World Application and Security Unlike many crypto platforms that are still in the development phase, Digitap boasts a ready-to-use infrastructure with security verified by Solidproof and Coinsult . These certifications underscore its platform's reliability and safety, making it a trustworthy option for users and investors alike. Digitap's practical use case is further enhanced by its compatibility with Visa, allowing users to perform transactions globally without hassle. This kind of integration represents a significant leap towards bridging the gap between digital and fiat currencies. Final Thoughts on Digitap's Market Potential Digitap’s innovative approach and solid market entry strategy make it a noteworthy candidate for investment. Its blend of technology, security, and real-world application places it on a potential path to becoming a top contender in the cryptocurrency arena.

His chart compared the Federal Reserve’s total assets (WALCL) with XRP’s weekly performance, highlighting how previous Fed balance sheet expansions aligned with XRP ‘s bullish momentum. The analyst highlighted two distinct periods: QE 2020, which coincided with the surge in market liquidity following the pandemic, and a projected QE 2025, where he anticipates a similar liquidity event. The chart shows XRP maintaining a stable position before each liquidity expansion, followed by notable upward movement. This visual connection formed the basis of his projection that renewed monetary easing in 2025 could once again lift XRP’s market valuation . QE WILL SEND $XRP PARABOLIC! pic.twitter.com/FJXEHM2oEJ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 31, 2025 Contextualizing Quantitative Easing’s Market Impact Quantitative Easing is a monetary policy tool used by the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the economy, typically through large-scale asset purchases. These policies are designed to lower interest rates and support financial markets during periods of tightening or slowdown. Historically, QE has influenced various asset classes by increasing the money supply and investor risk appetite. In 2020, QE contributed to a rapid recovery in financial markets following the economic disruption of COVID-19. During this same period, XRP’s chart reflected a strong rally, aligning with the broader liquidity-driven rally seen across cryptocurrencies. STEPHISCRYPTO’s projection rests on this historical precedent, suggesting that a similar policy move could again benefit digital assets such as XRP . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Perspective and Debate While STEPHISCRYPTO’s chart points toward a strong correlation between QE and XRP’s performance, not all observers share the same outlook. An X user, SJPR Crypto, commented that the 2020 QE response was unique, driven by extraordinary global circumstances, and that a future intervention may not mirror the same scale or market effect. This perspective underscores the uncertainty about how future monetary easing could influence cryptocurrency markets, particularly if economic conditions differ substantially from the 2020 environment. XRP’s Outlook The analysis implies that XRP’s long-term trajectory may remain sensitive to macroeconomic trends and central bank policy decisions. Should QE 2025 materialize as projected, liquidity inflows could act as a catalyst for renewed upward pressure on digital assets. However, the extent of such an impact would depend on the scale of intervention, regulatory developments, and overall investor sentiment across the cryptocurrency market.

The price action follows a major breakout from a long-term technical pattern that had kept the asset in a range for seven years. Since that move, XRP has been trading within a defined range, with strong interest holding it above previous resistance levels. Breakout From Long-Term Chart Pattern XRP recently moved above the upper trendline of a symmetrical triangle that had shaped its price for nearly a decade. This move pushed the asset past key levels, including the all-time high candle closes and 2021 peaks. Since the breakout, the market has entered a steady phase, with the price consolidating between $2.00 and $3.00. According to market analyst ChartNerd, this area now acts as a key range for accumulation. The former resistance has turned into a support zone, which could form the base for future price moves. The analyst noted that this structure has remained stable for almost a year and shows no sign of weakness so far. $XRP broke out of a 7 year symmetrical triangle and has since been accumulating above the prior ATH candle closes & the prior highs from 2021 for nearly 12 months. Signalling significant strength and momentum. Tieing up with bullish developments and regulatory clarity = HIGHER pic.twitter.com/HurHJ77nTw — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 31, 2025 As previously reported , analysts have compared the current XRP structure to 2017, with models still pointing to a move above $5 this cycle. Furthermore, price models built on Fibonacci extensions are pointing to possible future levels at $8, $13, and $27. These are drawn from past price activity and the height of the previous triangle pattern. In addition, a long-standing ascending trendline and a 3-month exponential moving average continue to guide the market upward. ChartNerd remains confident in the outlook as long as the asset stays above the breakout zone. “The macro structure remains intact,” the analyst posted , suggesting that the longer-term chart still supports upward continuation. Source: ChartNerd/X Short-Term Uncertainty Around Key Price Levels While the long-term picture remains stable, short-term charts are showing mixed signals. CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that XRP closed the last daily candle slightly lower and said the coming monthly close could influence the next move. Adding that any drop below that level could lead to more sideways action, the analyst said, “Holding above $2.55 is bullish territory.” Meanwhile, there is near-term resistance at $2.75, which could lead to a sharp move higher if broken. On the downside, $2.27 is being watched as the next level of support. Activity in the Market and ETF Update Recent technical indicators, including the TD Sequential tool, have issued a sell signal following the recent rally. This tool has been used to forecast price changes and has worked well in previous XRP cycles. Alongside that, data shows that large holders have been reducing their positions over the last few weeks, as CryptoPotato reported . Remarkably, there is also renewed attention on the potential launch of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. Canary Capital recently updated its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The removal of a key delay clause suggests the ETF could go live as early as November 13.

Key Takeaways: Steak ‘n Shake has launched a Bitcoin treasury, pledging to store all BTC payments from restaurant sales in a strategic reserve. For every “Bitcoin Meal” sold, the company will donate 210 sats to OpenSats, supporting Bitcoin Core and open-source development. The chain credits Bitcoin users for driving double-digit sales growth and cutting payment processing fees by roughly 50%. The announcement, made on Friday on X , was met with strong approval from the Bitcoin community, which hailed it as another sign of growing real-world adoption. Steak ‘n Shake to Donate 210 Sats per Bitcoin Meal The company said that for every “Bitcoin Meal” sold, 210 satoshis (about $0.23) will be donated to OpenSats, a nonprofit organization supporting developers working on Bitcoin Core and other open-source Bitcoin projects. The move positions Steak ‘n Shake among a small but growing number of major US retailers integrating Bitcoin directly into both their payment and philanthropic models. While the chain did not disclose how much of its sales come through Bitcoin payments since enabling them in May 2025 , its financial results hint at growing traction. The company reported $69.3 million in revenue for Q2 2025, a 12% year-over-year increase, and credited Bitcoin users for helping drive a 10.7% quarter-over-quarter rise in same-store sales. That momentum carried into Q3, with a 15% increase in same-store performance, suggesting steady engagement from Bitcoin-paying customers even if they remain a minority. Accepting Bitcoin has also brought tangible cost benefits. In a May filing, Steak ‘n Shake said it saved around 50% in processing fees compared to credit card transactions, underscoring one of the key financial advantages of BTC payments for high-volume retailers.

Grab yours and get $5 in bitcoin from us More details pic.twitter.com/MJoNE69JD1 — FOLD BITCOIN (@fold_app) October 31, 2025 The initiative also comes with a partnership with Fold, a Bitcoin rewards platform. Customers who purchase a “Bitcoin Meal” or “Bitcoin Steakburger” will receive $5 in BTC, redeemable through the Fold app. “Bitcoin goes mainstream when it starts showing up in everyday life,” said Will Reeves, Fold’s founder and CEO. “For many people, this will be the first time they ever own Bitcoin – and it will come from something as ordinary as grabbing a burger.” The limited-time promotion will run across 400 US locations, further embedding Bitcoin into the daily habits of American consumers and marking a new milestone in crypto’s path toward mainstream commerce. Steak ‘n Shake Backs Out of Ether Payments After Bitcoiners’ Backlash Last month, Steak ‘n Shake dropped plans to accept Ether following backlash from Bitcoin supporters, reigniting debates over tribalism in the crypto community. The 90-year-old company, which began accepting Bitcoin payments in May, launched a poll on X asking followers whether it should expand to Ether. Of nearly 49,000 votes cast, 53% favored the move, but just four hours later, the poll was abruptly suspended. “Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners. You have spoken,” the company announced, reaffirming its loyalty to the BTC community. The decision follows a 15% year-over-year increase in same-store sales, which Steak ‘n Shake attributed to strong support from Bitcoin users across the US, France, Monaco, and Spain.

This isn’t just a subtle change; it marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset. An analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Axel Adler Jr. highlights the undeniable emergence of Bitcoin institutional investors , signaling a new era for the cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Rise of Bitcoin Institutional Investors ? Adler Jr.’s research paints a clear picture: while the daily volume of retail transactions — trades between $0 and $1,000 — holds steady at around 700,000, its overall market share has dramatically shrunk. In 2021, retail transactions accounted for 1.8% of the total volume. Today, that figure has plummeted to just 0.48%. This significant drop indicates that while retail activity remains consistent, the sheer volume of larger trades is overshadowing it. Larger players, often identified as institutional investors, are now executing trades that dwarf the cumulative efforts of individual traders. This trend suggests a maturing market where substantial capital is flowing in from established financial entities. The consistent retail transaction count, coupled with its diminishing proportion of total volume, strongly supports the narrative of growing institutional dominance. It’s not that retail is leaving; it’s that institutions are arriving with much bigger wallets. How Does This Shift Impact the Crypto Market? The increasing influence of Bitcoin institutional investors brings several profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This shift often leads to greater market stability and enhanced legitimacy for Bitcoin as an asset class. When large institutions invest, they typically do so with long-term strategies and substantial capital, which can: Reduce Volatility: Institutional money often acts as a stabilizing force, as these investors are less likely to react to short-term price swings. Increase Legitimacy: Their participation signals to traditional finance that Bitcoin is a viable and serious investment. Attract More Capital: The presence of big players can encourage other institutions and even cautious retail investors to enter the market. Moreover, institutions often bring with them improved infrastructure, such as secure custody solutions and regulated investment products, which further bolster market confidence. Navigating the New Era: Advice for Retail Investors For individual investors, this evolving landscape doesn’t necessarily spell doom; rather, it calls for a revised approach. Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin institutional investors is crucial for making informed decisions. Instead of trying to outmaneuver institutional giants, retail investors might consider: Focusing on Long-Term Holdings: Institutional involvement often validates Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Diversifying Portfolios: While Bitcoin remains a strong asset, a balanced portfolio can mitigate risks. Staying Informed: Keep abreast of market trends and regulatory changes that could impact institutional sentiment. The market is becoming more sophisticated, and retail investors who adapt their strategies will be better positioned to thrive alongside institutional growth. The Future Landscape Shaped by Institutional Power What does the future hold for Bitcoin as institutional influence continues to grow? We can anticipate further integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial systems. This includes the expansion of Bitcoin ETFs, increased corporate treasury allocations, and more sophisticated derivatives markets. The ongoing involvement of Bitcoin institutional investors is likely to drive: Regulatory Clarity: Institutions often advocate for clearer regulations, which can provide a safer environment for all participants. Technological Advancement: Their resources can fuel innovation in scaling solutions and security protocols. Broader Adoption: As institutions offer Bitcoin products, it becomes more accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer regulated investment vehicles. This institutional embrace is transforming Bitcoin from a niche digital asset into a globally recognized financial instrument. A Profound Shift for Bitcoin’s Future Bitcoin’s journey has always been dynamic, but the current era marks a significant milestone: the undeniable rise of institutional investors. This shift, highlighted by the analysis of retail versus total transaction volume, underscores Bitcoin’s maturation into a serious, globally recognized asset class. While retail investors remain a vital part of the ecosystem, it is now the substantial capital and strategic long-term vision of institutions that are increasingly steering Bitcoin’s trajectory. This new phase promises greater stability, enhanced legitimacy, and a more integrated future for cryptocurrency within the global financial landscape. It’s an exciting time to watch Bitcoin evolve. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What defines an institutional investor in the cryptocurrency market? A1: Institutional investors typically refer to large organizations like hedge funds, asset managers, corporate treasuries, and public companies that invest significant capital. They often operate with sophisticated strategies and adhere to strict regulatory guidelines. Q2: Why are institutions increasingly investing in Bitcoin? A2: Institutions are attracted to Bitcoin for several reasons, including its potential as a hedge against inflation, its status as ‘digital gold,’ its uncorrelated returns compared to traditional assets, and its growing acceptance as a legitimate store of value and investment. Q3: How does institutional adoption affect Bitcoin’s price volatility? A3: While not eliminating volatility, institutional involvement can potentially reduce it over the long term.

Meanwhile, Digitap ($TAP) has been shining in its presale, providing early investors with a 114% return while raising over $1.2 million to date. What makes this performance so impressive is the fact that the $TAP initial coin offering is now in its second round. As the presale advances, these numbers are projected to skyrocket. Even though well-known influencers like Don and Shib Spain have made some bold price predictions for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, a lot of people think the $TAP crypto has real-world utility that may outshine them both. Dogecoin Pump Is Just Delayed, Analyst Claims – What To Expect Dogecoin is one of the best meme coins, but it has been showing some volatility recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the DOGE price saw a dip from around $0.19 to nearly $0.18 in the past seven days. On the one-month chart, Dogecoin experienced nearly a 25% fall. However, influencer Don is still optimistic about Dogecoin and its potential growth. According to his X post , the DOGE price has the potential to pump, but it is delayed right now. He foresees this meme coin possibly soaring to $0.58 in early 2026 as it is now consolidating in a symmetrical triangle. the $DOGE pump is delayed thats all pic.twitter.com/L25EdLA73a — Don (@DonaldsTrades) October 30, 2025 Despite this, TradingView does not back up this Dogecoin price prediction. Notably, the DOGE price is now sitting below its 10-day EMA and its 50-day EMA, which means selling pressure could rise. If it does, the Dogecoin crypto may see more dips on the charts. The Next Leg Up for Shiba Inu Could Be Coming Soon Shiba Inu is another meme coin that is going through some turbulence. On the one-week chart, the price of SHIB saw a dip from around $0.000010 to nearly $0.0000090 as per CoinMarketCap . In the past 30 days, Shiba Inu fell nearly 20%. Some traders are bullish thanks to a bold Shiba Inu price prediction from influencer Shib Spain. In a recent post, Shib Spain informed his X community that the next leg up for this meme coin may be massive. He predicts the price of SHIB jumping to $0.00001450. The next leg UP for $SHIB will be massive 🔥🚀 pic.twitter.com/8bLxlXKoC8 — Shib Spain (@ShibSpain) October 29, 2025 There was some bullish news that may back up this Shiba Inu price prediction. Notably, T. Rowe Price filed an S-1 registration to launch its Active Crypto ETF, which includes the Shiba Inu coin. Despite this, many traders are still skeptical, given that the price of SHIB has sunk nearly 50% on the YTD chart, showing its inability to maintain a bullish momentum. Digitap Shines in the Market With a 114% Surge in Its Presale Digitap is gaining worldwide appeal as its presale performance has been great so far. It is now in phase two, but has sold over 83 million $TAP coins in record time while making early buyers 114% richer. These numbers are projected to skyrocket as the crypto ICO goes on. In fact, a 10% price increase is expected to come once the $TAP presale starts its third round. Digitap shook up the market as it launched the first ""omnibank"" in the world. On it, users may create virtual, physical or custom cards backed by Visa and powered by crypto, which does not require any KYC checks. Plus, Digitap has already integrated this with Google Pay and Apple Pay, providing users with a true tap-to-pay option for borderless transactions. The $TAP crypto is the main focus among traders as it is now worth only $0.0268. However, this altcoin price is expected to reach $0.0297 soon—a potential 10% return for those who buy it today. Not to mention that a Tier-1 CEX is also rumored to list $TAP, this event could draw a lot of new eyes to this cryptocurrency and trigger a massive price surge. All these reasons are why people are turning to $TAP as the best crypto investment this cycle. USE THE CODE “SPOOKY50” FOR 50% ON ALL PURCHASES What Makes Digitap More Beneficial Than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are struggling to regain some bullish momentum, Digitap is stealing their spotlight. It is positioned perfectly to become a prime candidate for exponential growth in the cross-border payments market, which Grand View Research claims will be valued at $320 billion by 2030. This will likely give the $TAP coin more stability than DOGE and SHIB. Plus, its smaller market cap and real-world utility mean faster price growth and easier worldwide adoption. As a result, Digitap could be the next best thing on the market, potentially outperforming these meme coin titans.

For instance, Dogecoin's price fluctuated significantly, as seen on CoinMarketCap , indicating a broader trend of instability within the meme coin arena. Shiba Inu has not been spared from market swings either, reporting a decline in price over the past month, according to CoinMarketCap . Despite these downturns, influencers like Shib Spain are optimistic, projecting significant price increases for SHIB. The Rise of Digitap: A Utility-Focused Crypto Amidst the meme coin frenzy, Digitap has carved out a niche for itself by focusing on real-world utility, particularly in simplifying global crypto transactions. This platform distinguishes itself by integrating cryptocurrency with everyday financial tools like Visa cards, making it an attractive option for digital payments. The potential of Digitap is underscored by its strong presale performance, with over $1.2 million raised and a 114% return for early investors. Such metrics illustrate the market's confidence in Digitap's utility and future prospects. Digitap's Technological Edge Over Meme Coins Unlike typical meme coins, Digitap offers a robust platform that supports both physical and virtual crypto-backed Visa cards, which can be used with popular digital wallets like Google Pay and Apple Pay. This integration essentially bridges the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, offering a practical solution for crypto users worldwide.

Key Takeaways: MEXC apologized after wrongfully freezing $3 million from trader “The White Whale.” The issue gained attention after on-chain investigator ZachXBT intervened, prompting MEXC’s leadership to issue a public statement. MEXC plans to launch a “fast-track channel” for dispute resolution as it works to fix transparency and operational issues. The incident began in July, when MEXC froze the trader’s account , claiming he violated its terms of service by placing two orders within the same second, which the exchange interpreted as automated trading. The exchange told him the funds would be forfeited, but The White Whale denied the accusation and began publicly pressuring the company to return his money. MEXC Admits Fault, Apologizes to Trader After ZachXBT Intervention After weeks of silence, the situation escalated when prominent on-chain investigator ZachXBT publicly defended the trader, amplifying calls for accountability. On Thursday, MEXC’s Chief Strategy Officer Cecilia Hsueh issued a statement on X conceding fault. “We fucked up. We apologize to The White Whale, and his money is already released. He can claim it at any time,” Hsueh wrote . “I messed up in communicating with him. I got emotional, and I shouldn’t have.” Following the apology, Hsueh said MEXC plans to establish a “fast-track channel” for resolving similar account disputes. In 10min — Cecilia Hsueh (@cecilia_hsueh) October 31, 2025 The White Whale alleged that hundreds of users have contacted him with stories of frozen accounts and inaccessible funds. The controversy has also drawn sharp criticism from other traders. “It took a while and a bunch of hate to get you to do it. 100% sure this tweet would not exist if he were someone with 100 followers,” wrote pseudonymous trader Joji. Hsueh replied candidly: “You’re not wrong. It takes a lot to wake up the whole company. We are working on making sure this doesn’t happen again.” Hsueh said MEXC’s internal issues stem from “growing pains,” explaining that while the exchange scaled from a small operation to a top-10 exchange by volume, its risk, operations, and PR teams “have not kept up with this growth.” She added, “We’re going to change that… The leadership team now acknowledges that MEXC has to improve its transparency.” Risk control is not trying to steal your funds. dm. — Cecilia Hsueh (@cecilia_hsueh) October 31, 2025 Bitcoin Withdrawals from MEXC Spike 30x After The White Whale Controversy Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows that Bitcoin withdrawals from MEXC surged dramatically, from around 40 per day to 1,237 daily in mid-July, coinciding with the freezing of The White Whale’s funds. Withdrawals remained elevated this week, with over 1,400 processed on Friday. Some users now claim they are facing similar problems. “I had the same issue and false allegations,” trader Elja wrote. “It got solved after 14 days, but I can’t trust it anymore.” Others accused MEXC of ignoring withdrawal requests for over a year, highlighting a growing trust deficit between the exchange and its users.

Traders seems to weigh mixed market signals heading into November. Despite short-term uncertainty, BTC’s long-term trajectory remains strong. It’s bolstered by institutional accumulation and corporate confidence. However, analysts caution that a dip below $100,000 could test market sentiment and shake investor confidence. Market momentum remains supported by corporate balance sheet expansion and institutional optimism. Strategy, the largest Bitcoin-holding company, confirmed it won’t pursue mergers or acquisitions for now, signaling focus on its core Bitcoin strategy. This clarity reassured investors, reflecting commitment to sustainable growth and transparent operations, two traits that have kept Strategy’s stock aligned with Bitcoin’s performance. Strategy and Coinbase Strengthen Institutional Confidence Strategy’s Chairman Michael Saylor emphasized that acquiring other Bitcoin treasury firms would be risky and time-consuming. Instead, the company will continue focusing on its key strengths – buying Bitcoin, selling digital credit, and maintaining financial transparency. With 640,808 BTC on its books, Strategy remains the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

By avoiding complex deals, Strategy aims to remain efficient, predictable, and focused on long-term Bitcoin accumulation – a signal that resonates with both retail and institutional investors. BREAKING: Coinbase bought $300 MILLION Bitcoin in Q3 pic.twitter.com/GkDOoBwDfY — SwingPoint (@SwingPoint_SP) November 1, 2025 Meanwhile, Coinbase strengthened its position as a trusted institutional exchange by adding 2,772 BTC in Q3, raising total holdings to 14,548 BTC, worth roughly $1.57 billion. The company’s Q3 earnings showed net income of $432.6 million, up fivefold year-over-year, driven by transaction and subscription revenue growth. Key figures from Coinbase’s latest report include: Revenue: $1.9 billion (+55% YoY) Transaction revenue: $1.05 billion Subscription income: $746.7 million (+34%) Coinbase’s Bitcoin accumulation reinforces confidence in digital assets as long-term reserves. Its expanded offerings in derivatives, tokenized assets, and stablecoin services further validate the exchange’s growing role in traditional finance integration. Historical Patterns Warn of November Volatility Despite these bullish fundamentals, analysts like Timothy Peterson warn that November has historically been a volatile month for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency saw steep drops during 2011, 2014, 2018, and 2022, often triggered by liquidity stress or external shocks. Peterson notes that this pattern typically emerges between November 8–20, aligning with corporate earnings and macroeconomic adjustments. If companies revise 2026 earnings forecasts lower, investors may reduce exposure to risk assets like Bitcoin. However, analysts also note that these corrections have historically paved the way for strong Q1 recoveries, suggesting that any mid-November pullback could create a buying opportunity ahead of 2026. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Triangle Breakout Approaches Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading around $110,089, showing a 0.4% intraday gain as price action tightens within a descending triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. This structure, defined by lower highs and steady support near $106,375, reflects a market in consolidation, a phase that often precedes a strong breakout. The 20-period EMA continues to act as dynamic resistance, suppressing upward attempts. Recent candles, mostly spinning tops and Doji formations, signal indecision as bulls and bears battle for short-term control. However, the ascending trendline from mid-October shows that buyers are gradually stepping in, forming a series of higher lows, a subtle bullish sign that suggests accumulation at lower levels. Momentum indicators echo this setup. The RSI at 46.9 is curling upward from near oversold territory, hinting at a possible bullish divergence. If the RSI crosses above 50 while price holds above $108,000, it could confirm a rebound phase. For now, Bitcoin’s volatility remains compressed, but the pattern suggests that a breakout is nearing. Trade Setup Entry: Buy above $111,675 (confirmed breakout) Stop-Loss: Below $106,300 (trendline support) Targets: $116,350 and $119,750 Alternatively, a break below $106,300 could shift momentum in favor of bears, targeting $103,500 and $100,250. In essence, Bitcoin is quietly coiling – traders should stay alert for a decisive move, as the upcoming breakout from this narrowing range could define November’s market direction. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.2 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013195 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

According to Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb, issues like these have caused the theft of millions of dollars across the country. Several counties in the United States have reported a growing rate of cryptocurrency scams linked to Bitcoin ATMs. According to several reports, the scammers have been targeting the elderly, preying on their gullibility and panic in such situations to extort money from them. Most times, they claim that their relatives are in jail or they have erred on the side of the law for failing to appear for jury duty. Subsequently, these scammers would ask them to pay fines in Bitcoin, pointing them to the nearest Bitcoin ATM to carry out the transactions. Federal prosecutor faults Bitcoin ATMs for aiding crypto scams In a recent case, the victim, Diane Reynolds, claims she was caught off guard when someone contacted the Maryland retiree online and said access to her computer had been blocked. According to Reynolds, the person claimed the access was blocked for safety reasons. “There was a voice message that was coming on with this that said, ‘Don’t turn your computer on, don’t turn your computer off,'” she told CBS News. Reynolds said she was also instructed to call a phone number that the person offered, making her believe she was being connected to tech support. However, it turned out that she was connected to a scammer who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank accounts. The scam artist mentioned that the only way she could protect her funds was to convert them into Bitcoin. Reynolds, under pressure from the false alarm, did as she was told. After withdrawing her entire bank balance, which was about $13,100, Reynolds said the scammers directed her to go to a Bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 Bitcoin ATM terminals across several states in the United States of America. According to Schwalb, this is not a standalone case, as there are others across the United States with such experiences or one related to the one that happened to Reynolds. Athena Bitcoin sued for profiting from crypto scams Schwalb said, “Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money.” “Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening,” he added. He noted that what makes it even harder to process is that the operators of these Bitcoin ATMs are profiting from whatever has been happening because they charge substantial fees on transactions. In September, Schwalb filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges “undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.” However, in its statement, Athena Bitcoin claims that it strongly disagrees with the allegations and it is prepared to contest the charges in court. “We employ aggressive safety protocols to protect the financial interests of our customers. … Our kiosks employ multiple safeguards, from prominent warnings and daily transaction limits to five separate verification screens designed to stop coerced transactions,” the company said. Meanwhile, Reynolds is also initiating legal actions against Athena Bitcoin. According to her attorney, Vaught Stewart, Athena stood by and allowed the fraud to happen and still profited from it.

ETC/USDT Chart By TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Ethereum Classic price may drop below the immediate support line at $13.61, resulting in a correction to $9.98. Is Ethereum Classic A Good Investment? Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price up today? Following the overall buying pressure in the market, ETC price triggered a strong push and surged toward $16. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $15, we might see a strong recovery toward $30. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment?

One project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has recently gained strong attention from analysts who believe it could deliver up to 25x growth by 2027. With a rapidly growing momentum, audited code, and an upcoming product launch, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy under $0.05 right now. Let’s look at what’s driving all the hype behind MUTM and why experts think it could outperform many older tokens in the next cycle. Presale Momentum and Good Demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its presale at Phase 6. Each token costs $0.035. The next stage will be increasing the price by nearly 20% to $0.04, and the price at launch will be $0.06. Phase 1 investors are positioned for a 500% MUTM value increase prior to the listing of the token. The previous presale rounds began with approximately $0.01. Investors that entered the initial stages have already seen 250% token appreciation. The steady and systematic growth has provided urgency among investors. The initial phases fill-up quicker than the subsequent one. To date, the project has already collected over $18.2 million, onboarded over 17,600 holders and distributed over 785 million tokens. The sales rate indicates that Phase 6 will be closed shortly, and this will make it one of the best presales of 2025. This is due to the systematic allocation of tokens and open phases of prices that make analysts perceive MUTM to be a potentially good long-term investment, particularly when the market can be volatile. The Vision of what Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Constructing. Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending/borrowing protocol that would enable digital asset markets to be more efficient, transparent and controlled by users. The site allows its users to lend and borrow their crypto assets with no middlemen. Users can deposit crypto in the protocol and get mtTokens. These producing tokens are the symbol of their deposits. As an illustration, depositing 1 ETH will earn a user 1mtETH. Interest is accrued on this mtETH since loans are repaid. The system is predictably more profitable compared to the traditional staking but is liquid and transparent. Another important component of the ecosystem at Mutuum Finance is the model of buy-and-distribute. MUTM tokens are purchased on the open market using revenue from lending activity and fee. Such tokens are again redistributed to the stakers in the protocol safety. This brings about continuous purchasing pressure that makes the platform usage directly dependent on token demand. In contrast to numerous hype-based projects, Mutuum Finance is based on sustainability and tokenomic. Its practical utility of DeFi and inherent token demand is what gives it an edge over other speculative sentiment-driven tokens. CertiK has audited the project and scored high in the Token Scan with a score of 90/100. This audit proves that its smart contracts are one of the safest in the industry. This safety and transparency has been applauded particularly in an environment where investor trust is paramount. Stablecoin and Oracle Plans Mutuum Finance is not only about lending and borrowing. The team has been working on a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be over collateralized through loans within the ecosystem. The stablecoin can be printed or burned on demand to be able to balance and be sustainable. This stable DeFi currency must enhance liquidity and stabilize the lending system in times of market volatility. Chainlink and other decentralized oracles will deliver accurate and real-time pricing of assets. Proper oracle information is needed to handle the value of collaterals and avoid unjustified liquidations. Sound oracle data will be used to make sure all borrow and liquidation processes are accurate to the market. Analysts feel that this stratified self-sustaining ecosystem has the potential to multiply the long-term value of Mutuum Finance exponentially. The platform is intended to be a central node in on-chain finance, integrating lending, stablecoins and oracle-backed security. Recent trends indicate that MUTM may increase to $0.70-$0.90 dollars by 2027 which is a 25x from the current presale stage. These estimates may increase even more in case the token implements numerous Layer-2 networks. V1 Launch and Future Milestones The next significant Mutuum Finance milestone will be the V1, which will be introduced in Q4 2025 in Sepolia Testnet . This original live implementation will consist of the basic building blocks: the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens and an automated Liquidator Bot to handle risks in the system. Lending and borrowing in ETH and USDT will be supported by the testnet releases, and more tokens may be introduced in the future. These assets were selected based on the liquidity and stability. Once tested, the platform will be extended to Layer-2 networks in order to lower the cost of transactions and enhance the user experience. Analyst Consensus: A Long-Term Compounder What makes Mutuum Finance stand out is how it balances early-stage growth potential with a clear, revenue-backed model. Many analysts covering DeFi projects have highlighted MUTM’s fundamentals — including its transparent presale, CertiK audit, mtToken yield system, and revenue-sharing mechanism — as reasons for its strong future outlook. The current presale price of $0.035 puts MUTM in an attractive position for investors seeking exposure to DeFi utility before listings. Once the launch price of $0.06 goes live, early buyers could see nearly 200% token appreciation right away, with the potential for much more as the platform scales. Mutuum Finance’s roadmap, including its stablecoin, oracle integrations, and Layer-2 expansion, positions it as one of the most promising upcoming DeFi cryptos of 2025. Analysts note that this combination of audited security, consistent demand mechanisms, and early entry potential could make MUTM a potential top cryptocurrency to invest in before the next bull run.

The major point of interest lies at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, where the last rejection occurred. Given this, it is likely that the Ethereum price could see more declines in the coming days, although there is still the possibility of the bulls taking over and invalidating the entire bearish setup. Ethereum Price Is Showing A Lot Of Weakness The rejection from the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level marked the start of the decline from the $4,200 level during the last recovery. This rejection resulted in the formation of a lower high on the 4-hour timeframe, and historically, such lower high formations mean that there is more selling pressure piling up for the digital asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breakdown Is Nothing To Worry About? This Long Term Structure Points Above $1 As the bullish momentum looks to be fading, it puts the Ethereum price in a precarious position. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader explains that the rejection had come with increased bearish volume as investors offloaded their holdings on the market, putting bears in charge once again. Following this development, the Ethereum price has continued to struggle around $3,900, where the next local support lies. The cryptocurrency has maintained a tentative hold at best on this local support, suggesting that the bulls could indeed be losing ground at this level. If this corrective phase continues, then the Ethereum price decline is far from over. The current local weakness has put a strain on the support, and if $3,900 fails completely, the next major support lies below $3,400, more specifically at $3,385. This will serve as the next stronghold for the bulls to make their move. “From a structural perspective, Ethereum’s inability to sustain momentum signals growing bearish pressure across lower timeframes,” the crypto analyst explained. The Case For ETH Bulls Despite the mounting bearish pressure, there is still the possibility that the Ethereum price could break out of this downtrend. Just like with the bearish case, the key lies at the $3,900 support and how well it holds. Related Reading: Wave 3 Target Suggests That The XRP Price Is Headed For $10 In the case that bulls are able to reclaim and hold this support with momentum, then it could invalidate the bearish setup that has emerged. In this case, the crypto analyst believes that the Ethereum price could resume its uptrend above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level.

Key Takeaways: The US Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Fed has the discretion to deny crypto-focused banks access to master accounts. Judge David Ebel wrote that the Fed’s authority to reject such requests is essential to “safeguard the financial system.” The ruling keeps crypto banks like Custodia locked out of Fed payment systems. In a 2–1 ruling, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that the Fed has discretion over which financial institutions can hold master accounts, which allow direct access to Fed services such as payment clearing and wire transfers. The court concluded that while Custodia is technically eligible, eligibility does not guarantee entitlement. Judge Says Fed Has Right to Deny Custodia to ‘Safeguard Financial System’ Writing for the majority, Judge David Ebel, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, said the law gives the Fed authority to “reject master account access requests from eligible entities” in order to protect financial stability. “We reject Custodia’s attempt to impair the Fed’s ability to safeguard our nation’s financial system through the exercise of discretion,” Ebel wrote. Custodia, which operates under Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) charter, argued that it is being unfairly excluded from the national banking network despite meeting the necessary criteria. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, however, determined that Custodia’s business model, centered on custody and settlement of crypto assets, posed “undue risk” to the broader financial system. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Timothy Tymkovich, appointed by President George W. Bush, argued that the Fed’s own statutes mandate it to provide payment services to all eligible non-member banks, including Custodia. “This case comes clothed in 21st-century terms: cryptocurrency, digital assets, instant wire transfers, and master accounts,” he wrote. “But there is nothing new about this issue.” Custodia called the decision “disappointing” but pointed to Tymkovich’s dissent as validation of its position. “We were hoping for a win at the Tenth Circuit today, but we received the next best thing — a strong dissent,” the bank said, adding that it may seek a rehearing based on a conflicting ruling in a related case. Statement of @custodiabank : pic.twitter.com/6U0FPzaKCm — Custodia Bank (@custodiabank) October 31, 2025 The decision leaves Custodia, and other crypto-oriented financial institutions, still locked out of direct access to the US payments infrastructure. So far, no crypto-focused bank has received a master account. Fed Governor Floats ‘Skinny’ Master Accounts for Crypto-Focused Banks Notably, the regulatory landscape could soon shift. As reported, the Federal Reserve plans to open its payment network to stablecoin issuers and fintech firms without requiring them to partner with traditional banks, a significant policy reversal after years of hesitation toward crypto. Fed Governor Christopher Waller announced last week that the proposal during the central bank’s Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, introducing new “payment accounts” or “skinny master accounts” for legally eligible institutions. These limited-access accounts would connect firms directly to the Fed’s payment rails while maintaining strict safeguards to reduce systemic risk. Under the proposal, participating firms would face balance caps, no interest on deposits, and no overdraft privileges, ensuring minimal exposure for the Fed’s balance sheet. Waller said the new structure aims to keep the central bank competitive with rapid innovation in payments.

For many, the question of Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just about investment; it’s about the future of finance itself. The journey of BTC has been nothing short of spectacular, marked by incredible rallies and dramatic corrections, yet its resilience continues to captivate investors and enthusiasts alike. If you’re wondering how high the BTC price forecast could go in the coming years, you’ve come to the right place. This comprehensive guide delves deep into the potential trajectory of Bitcoin from 2025 to 2030. We’ll explore the critical factors shaping its value, analyze expert opinions, and provide a clear roadmap of what to expect. Prepare to uncover the forces that could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented levels and understand the challenges that lie ahead. Understanding Bitcoin’s Journey: A Brief History of Volatility and Growth Before we gaze into the crystal ball of Bitcoin price prediction , it’s essential to understand its past. Launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin emerged as a revolutionary digital currency, free from central authority. Its early days were humble, with a single BTC valued at fractions of a cent. Fast forward to today, and Bitcoin has grown into a trillion-dollar asset, challenging traditional financial systems. Key milestones in Bitcoin’s history include: 2010: The first real-world transaction – 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. 2013: Surpassed $1,000 for the first time. 2017: The bull run that captured global attention, nearing $20,000. 2020-2021: Institutional adoption soared, pushing BTC to new all-time highs above $60,000. Halving Events: Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, historically leading to significant price increases due to reduced supply. This history of dramatic price swings and consistent long-term growth forms the foundation for any realistic BTC price forecast . What Drives the Bitcoin Price Forecast? Key Factors to Consider Predicting the future price of any asset, especially one as dynamic as Bitcoin, involves evaluating a multitude of factors. For a robust Bitcoin price prediction , we must consider both internal cryptocurrency market dynamics and broader macroeconomic trends. Market Dynamics and BTC Price Forecast The supply and demand principles are fundamental to Bitcoin’s value. Its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it a scarce asset, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely. Halving events, as mentioned, directly impact this supply. Supply Shock: Each halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, creating a supply squeeze if demand remains constant or increases. Demand Growth: Factors driving demand include increasing retail adoption, institutional investment, and Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a store of value, or ‘digital gold.’ Network Effect: The more users, developers, and businesses that adopt Bitcoin, the stronger its network effect, enhancing its utility and perceived value. Derivatives Market: The rise of Bitcoin futures, options, and ETFs allows for more sophisticated trading strategies, impacting price discovery and volatility. Regulatory Landscape and the Future of Bitcoin Regulation remains a double-edged sword for Bitcoin. While uncertainty can deter some investors, clear and favorable regulations can legitimize the asset and open doors for wider adoption. Clarity vs. Uncertainty: Countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, while others are still grappling with how to classify and regulate it. Clear regulatory frameworks can attract more institutional capital and reduce market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies): The development of CBDCs by central banks could be seen as a competitive threat or, conversely, could pave the way for greater digital asset literacy and infrastructure, indirectly benefiting Bitcoin. Taxation and Compliance: As governments establish clearer rules for crypto taxation and reporting, it simplifies participation for traditional financial entities and large corporations, potentially boosting demand. The evolving regulatory environment will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Bitcoin and its market capitalization. Technological Advancements and Bitcoin Adoption While Bitcoin’s core protocol remains stable, advancements in scaling solutions and integration tools are crucial for its long-term viability and growth. Lightning Network: This layer-2 solution enables faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions, making it more viable for everyday use cases. Increased Lightning adoption could significantly boost utility. Taproot Upgrade: Enhancements like Taproot improve privacy, efficiency, and smart contract capabilities, making the Bitcoin network more robust and versatile. DeFi and NFTs on Bitcoin: While Ethereum dominates these sectors, efforts to bring decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to Bitcoin via sidechains or layered protocols could unlock new demand. Ease of Use: User-friendly wallets, exchanges, and integration with traditional payment systems reduce barriers to entry for new users. Macroeconomic Trends and Crypto Market Analysis Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum. Global economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events significantly influence its price. Inflation Hedge: In times of high inflation and currency debasement, Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge due to its fixed supply. This narrative can attract investors seeking to preserve purchasing power. Interest Rates: Higher interest rates in traditional finance can make riskier assets like Bitcoin less attractive, as investors might prefer safer, yield-bearing investments. Conversely, low-interest rate environments often favor speculative assets. Geopolitical Instability: Conflicts or economic sanctions can sometimes drive demand for decentralized, borderless assets like Bitcoin as a safe haven or means of capital flight. Global Liquidity: The overall amount of money flowing through the global financial system impacts all asset classes. A surge in global liquidity often benefits risk assets. A thorough crypto market analysis must always incorporate these broader economic forces. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Looking ahead to 2025, several factors converge to suggest a potentially strong year for Bitcoin. The 2024 halving event, coupled with growing institutional interest and increasing regulatory clarity in key markets, could set the stage for a significant bull run. Expert Consensus: Many analysts anticipate a post-halving rally, similar to previous cycles. With increased mainstream adoption and potentially more spot Bitcoin ETFs globally, liquidity and demand could surge. Potential Price Range for 2025: Scenario Low Estimate Average Estimate High Estimate Conservative $75,000 $90,000 $110,000 Optimistic $100,000 $130,000 $150,000+ The upper bounds of these predictions hinge on sustained institutional inflows and a favorable global economic environment. The narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class will likely strengthen. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026: Sustained Growth or Consolidation? Following a potential peak in 2025, 2026 might see a period of consolidation or a slight pullback, which is typical after a significant bull run. However, the overall trend is expected to remain upward as Bitcoin matures further. Key Considerations: The market will likely absorb the gains from the previous year. Long-term holders may take profits, leading to some selling pressure. Yet, underlying adoption continues, supported by technological improvements and increased utility. Potential Price Range for 2026: Scenario Low Estimate Average Estimate High Estimate Conservative $80,000 $100,000 $125,000 Optimistic $110,000 $140,000 $170,000+ Even with consolidation, the floor for BTC price forecast is expected to be significantly higher than current levels, reflecting its established position. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027-2029: Mid-Term Trajectory As we move further into the decade, the future of Bitcoin becomes increasingly intertwined with global economic shifts and technological evolution. This period will likely see continued mainstream integration. Driving Forces: Mass Adoption: Bitcoin could become a more common payment method or reserve asset for corporations and even nation-states. Technological Scalability: Further advancements in layer-2 solutions and sidechains will make Bitcoin more efficient and accessible for a wider range of applications. Halving Cycle Influence: The next halving after 2024 would occur around 2028, potentially initiating another bullish cycle towards the end of this period. Potential Price Range for 2027-2029 (Average): 2027: $120,000 – $180,000 2028: $150,000 – $250,000 (pre-halving accumulation) 2029: $200,000 – $350,000 (post-halving momentum) These projections are speculative but reflect a growing belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030: How High Can BTC Go? The year Bitcoin 2030 represents a significant milestone for long-term investors. By this point, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial system is expected to be far more pronounced. Its scarcity, combined with potentially widespread adoption and integration, could propel its value to astonishing levels. Long-Term Vision: Many prominent figures in finance and technology believe Bitcoin could rival gold’s market capitalization, potentially reaching values in the millions per coin. While ambitious, this outlook is based on Bitcoin’s unique properties as a decentralized, immutable, and globally accessible store of value. Potential Price Range for 2030: Scenario Low Estimate Average Estimate High Estimate Conservative $250,000 $400,000 $600,000 Optimistic $500,000 $750,000 $1,000,000+ Achieving the million-dollar mark by Bitcoin 2030 would require a confluence of factors: sustained institutional adoption, favorable regulatory environments, widespread retail participation, and Bitcoin successfully solidifying its position as a global reserve asset or primary digital store of value. This BTC price forecast is certainly exciting for many. Challenges and Risks to Bitcoin’s Future While the outlook for Bitcoin appears bright, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its price trajectory. Regulatory Crackdowns: Unfavorable regulations or outright bans in major economies could significantly hinder adoption and price growth. Technological Obsolescence: While unlikely for Bitcoin’s core, a breakthrough in quantum computing or a superior decentralized technology could pose a long-term threat. Environmental Concerns: The energy consumption of Bitcoin mining remains a point of contention. Increased pressure for sustainable solutions could lead to regulatory hurdles or public backlash. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its extreme price swings. Sudden crashes can lead to significant losses for unprepared investors. Geopolitical Events: Major global conflicts or economic crises could lead to capital flight from riskier assets like Bitcoin, at least in the short term. Opportunities and Benefits: Why Bitcoin Still Matters Despite the risks, the opportunities and benefits that Bitcoin offers continue to attract a diverse range of investors and innovators. Inflation Hedge: As fiat currencies face inflationary pressures, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative store of value. Decentralization: Its independence from central banks and governments provides a hedge against traditional financial system instability and censorship. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering financial freedom to billions. Innovation Hub: The Bitcoin ecosystem continues to foster innovation, from payment solutions to new financial products built on its blockchain. Diversification: For many portfolios, Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional asset classes, with a potentially uncorrelated return profile. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Bitcoin Market For those looking to participate in Bitcoin’s journey, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on predictions. Understand the technology, market dynamics, and your own risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and build a position over time. Long-Term Horizon: Bitcoin’s volatility makes it unsuitable for short-term speculation for most investors. A long-term perspective (5+ years) is often recommended. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and consider setting stop-loss orders if actively trading. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory news, technological developments, and global macroeconomic trends that influence crypto market analysis . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin’s Future Q1: Is Bitcoin a good investment for 2025? A: Many analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price prediction for 2025, especially given the upcoming halving event in 2024. Historical patterns suggest a bullish trend post-halving. However, all investments carry risk, and individual financial situations vary. Q2: What factors will most influence Bitcoin’s price by 2030? A: Key factors for Bitcoin 2030 include global regulatory clarity, institutional adoption (e.g., from entities like BlackRock and MicroStrategy ), technological scalability (like the Lightning Network), macroeconomic conditions (inflation, interest rates), and Bitcoin’s continued acceptance as a global store of value. The decisions by regulatory bodies such as the SEC in the US will also be critical. Q3: Can Bitcoin reach $1 million by 2030? A: While ambitious, some experts believe a $1 million BTC price forecast by 2030 is possible, particularly if Bitcoin successfully captures a significant portion of the global store-of-value market currently dominated by gold. This would require substantial capital inflows and sustained growth in adoption, potentially driven by further ETF approvals and institutional interest from firms like Grayscale Investments . Q4: How do macroeconomic trends affect Bitcoin price prediction? A: Macroeconomic trends, such as inflation rates, central bank monetary policies (e.g., interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve ), and global economic stability, significantly influence Bitcoin’s price. During periods of high inflation, Bitcoin can be seen as an inflation hedge. Conversely, rising interest rates might make traditional assets more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from riskier assets like Bitcoin. A thorough crypto market analysis always considers these broader economic forces. Q5: What are the biggest risks for Bitcoin investors? A: The biggest risks include regulatory uncertainty, extreme price volatility, potential technological obsolescence, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and systemic risks within the broader financial markets. It’s important to understand these risks before investing. Conclusion: The Enduring Potential of Bitcoin The journey of Bitcoin from a niche digital experiment to a global financial force is nothing short of remarkable. Our deep dive into Bitcoin price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 reveals a future brimming with both immense potential and inherent challenges. While precise figures are impossible to guarantee, the overarching sentiment among experts and market analysts points towards continued growth, driven by increasing adoption, technological advancements, and its unique position as a decentralized, scarce asset. Whether Bitcoin reaches $150,000, $500,000, or even $1,000,000 by Bitcoin 2030 , its impact on the financial world is undeniable. For investors, understanding the underlying drivers, managing risks, and maintaining a long-term perspective will be crucial. The future of Bitcoin promises to be as exciting and transformative as its past.

This hesitation has deepened after Western Union’s announcement on October 28, 2025, selecting Solana for its USDPT stablecoin network over XRP, despite years of testing Ripple’s tech since 2015. As XRP consolidates in an ascending channel with RSI at 60.39, hinting at room for a 12% rally to $3.32 if momentum builds, investors seek alternatives with clearer upside. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035, the best cheap crypto to buy now, which has raised $18,270,000 and attracted 17,660 holders in its presale, offering a projected 420% ROI at the $0.06 launch in 2025. This DeFi crypto has captured the spotlight by delivering tangible yields that XRP’s regulatory waits can’t match, drawing capital from sidelined holders eager for accessible growth. XRP Stalls in Fibonacci Tension XRP has lingered around $2.60 as of October 30, 2025, trapped between the 38.2% and 100% Fibonacci retracement levels from its recent impulsive wave peak at $2.66, creating a demand zone that tests holder patience. Buyers have defended the $2.56-$2.61 range, yet the forming ascending trendline toward $2.63-$2.65 suggests building bullish pressure, if it holds. However, the rising wedge near the channel’s upper boundary signals fading strength, leaving room for a corrective pullback that could erase gains and frustrate long-term bets. Holders who have watched this oscillation now question the token’s edge in cross-border payments, especially as competitors like Solana snag major partnerships, pushing savvy investors toward undervalued gems where entry costs stay low and rewards scale high. Yet, this very shake-up has funneled attention to affordable DeFi plays like MUTM, where $0.035 buys unlock yields without the baggage of stalled integrations, turning disappointment into opportunity for those ready to diversify smartly. Mutuum Finance Presale Races Ahead Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has blazed through Phase 6 of 11, with 85% of tokens claimed at $0.035, a 250% jump from Phase 1’s $0.01, yet this phase hurtles toward sellout, making it the best cheap crypto to buy now before prices climb.

Phase 7 beckons with a 20% hike to $0.04, so those who delay watch enviously while frontrunners compound gains effortlessly. You’ve got the chance to join this wave at rock-bottom entry, don’t let XRP’s stall keep you from staking your claim in a project that’s already proving its pull.

53898632,618773,1761991235,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,Coinbase In Late-Stage Talks To Acquire Stablecoin Startup BVNK In $2 Billion Deal,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-to-acquire-bvnk-in-2-billion-deal/,"According to a report from Bloomberg, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire BVNK, a startup specializing in stablecoin infrastructure, in a deal valued at approximately $2 billion. This acquisition is pending due diligence and could see closure later this year or early next year. Coinbase Ventures Poised To Acquire BVNK Coinbase Ventures, the venture capital arm of Coinbase, is known to be an investor in BVNK, suggesting a pre-existing relationship that may facilitate the acquisition. One spokesperson told Bloomberg that the company is committed to its mission of expanding economic freedom globally and actively explores various opportunities through building, acquiring, partnering, or investing. If the deal goes through, it would mark another significant move in the stablecoin sector, especially following the introduction of the first US regulations on these assets in July with the passage of the GENIUS Act. This regulatory framework has prompted various entities, including credit card giants Visa and Mastercard, as well as traditional banks, to experiment with blockchain technology to streamline financial transactions. Earlier this week, Fortune reported that Coinbase has secured exclusivity in discussions with BVNK following a competitive bidding process. Coinbase has been actively seeking to diversify its revenue streams beyond trading fees, with nearly 20% of its revenue in the third quarter coming from stablecoins , as indicated in the company’s recent shareholder letter. The exchange aims to enhance the utilization of Circle’s USDC stablecoin, for which it shares revenue with issuer Circle Internet Group Inc., and has formed partnerships, such as with Shopify, to further this goal. Exceeding Expectations Founded in 2021, BVNK has successfully raised $90 million in funding from notable investors, including Citi Ventures, Haun Ventures, and Visa. BVNK’s platform enables merchants to accept payments in stablecoins, which aligns with Coinbase’s strategy to create a more comprehensive banking experience built on stablecoins. Earlier this year, Coinbase launched Coinbase Business, a platform designed to assist businesses with payments and invoicing, indicating a clear intent to expand its offerings in this area. The exchange has also recently completed its acquisition of Deribit, a leading player in the options market that holds over 75% of market share outside the United States, according to Alesia Haas, Coinbase’s finance chief. In its third-quarter report , Coinbase surpassed analysts’ expectations with a transaction revenue of $1.05 billion, a substantial increase from $572.5 million during the same period last year. The exchange’s stock, COIN, closed the week’s trading session at $343, an 8.2% retrace in just four days amid the broader crypto market’s volatility.

According to Roper, despite years of working on the internet as an activist, she found herself traumatized by the recent spate of AI-fueled threats she has received. Digitally generated threats have been possible for the last few years, and until recently, artificial intelligence models could not replicate real people unless they had a huge presence online. According to an expert, models now need just a profile picture to create anything users want. In 2023, a judge in Florida was sent a video, which was made using a customization tool in the Grand Theft Auto video game. The video featured an avatar that looked and walked like the judge being hacked to death. Australian activist calls for caution over the use of artificial intelligence According to Roper, some of the posts that she has gotten were part of a campaign of vitriol directed towards her and her colleagues at Collective Shout, an Australian activist group on X and other social media platforms. She noted that in one of the pictures sent to her, there was a picture of her hanging from a noose, while another video showed her ablaze and screaming. Others were more graphic, with the users going to lengths to pass their message across. Roper claimed that in most of the pictures and videos that had been concocted with artificial intelligence, she was wearing a blue floral dress that she indeed owns. “It’s these weird little details that make it feel more real and, somehow, a different kind of violation,” she said. “These things can go from fantasy to more than fantasy.” She noted that the torrent of online abuse started this summer after her campaign to shut down violent video games glorifying adult scenes and abuse. She mentioned that some of the accounts and images directed at her have been taken down. Roper also mentioned that the company claimed that other posts depicting her violent death did not violate the platform’s terms of service. In fact, she claimed that X, at one point in time, included one of the accounts that harasses her on a list of recommended people to follow. Roper mentioned that some of her harassers have also claimed to use Grok to research how to find women at home and cafes. Roper wants platforms to tackle this menace Roper claimed that after she was fed up, she decided to post some examples. After she did, X told her that her accounts were in breach of the safety policies against gratuitous gore and temporarily locked her account. Meanwhile, there has been a global campaign against artificial intelligence because of its use to carry out scams. Criminals now use the technology to mimic the voices of real people, using it in their numerous illicit activities. Other activities include the creation of adult content with artificial intelligence without express permission from the subject. In addition to these kinds of content, reports claim that artificial intelligence is also making other threats more convincing. For instance, swatting is the practice of placing false emergency calls with the aim of inciting a large response from the police and emergency personnel. In the summer, the National Association of Attorneys General mentioned that the tech “has significantly intensified the scale, precision, and anonymity” of such attacks. On a lesser scale, an increase in videos made with artificial intelligence showing supposed home invasion has caused the targeted residents to call police departments across the country. The report claims that perpetrators of swatting can convince law enforcement of false reports by cloning voices and manipulating images. One serial offender used simulated gunfire to suggest that a shooter was in the parking lot of a Washington state high school. The campus was locked down for 20 minutes after police and federal agents showed up. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/uphold-just-changed-the-game-for-xrp-heres-the-latest/,"The landscape for XRP has shifted again, and this time, the change is tied directly to its evolving role within regulated finance. Uphold, a well-known digital asset platform, has launched a feature allowing users to borrow against their XRP or other digital asset holdings without selling them. The move adds XRP to the same lending framework as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC, positioning it as a viable form of collateral in the financial system. Ripple Bull Winkle (@RipBullWinkle), a popular voice in the XRP community, highlighted the development in a post on X, emphasizing how significant this step is for the asset’s perception and utility. “You can borrow against your XRP without selling a single coin,” he said in his video, noting that this marks a transition from viewing XRP as speculative to recognizing it as a financial instrument with tangible use. Uphold just changed the game. You can now borrow against your $XRP — without selling it. XRP’s officially gone from “speculative token” to financial collateral. You’re watching real-world utility unfold in real time. Liquidity = power. $XRP pic.twitter.com/bke2K0Ogpe — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 30, 2025 XRP’s Transition to a Collateral Asset For years, XRP has been at the center of discussions about utility versus speculation . Bull Winkle described Uphold’s decision as a moment where real-world financial integration is becoming visible. By enabling users to leverage XRP as collateral for loans, Uphold effectively treats the asset as a credit-worthy instrument rather than a trading vehicle. This shift reflects growing institutional confidence in XRP’s stability and liquidity. As Bull Winkle explained, “That’s not DeFi chaos. That is regulated real-world financial integration.” The emphasis on regulation suggests a maturing environment where digital assets are being woven into existing financial structures. A Step Toward Institutional Adoption The ability to borrow against XRP signals that parts of the financial sector view it as dependable security. Bull Winkle pointed out that “financial institutions are using it as collateral,” which he called a mark of confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The feature allows XRP holders to access liquidity without liquidating their positions, reinforcing the token’s role as both a store of value and a financial tool. It also introduces the possibility of broader participation in finance, as assets once regarded as volatile or experimental become accepted within regulated borrowing frameworks. Bull Winkle added that “when banks start accepting XRP as a credit-worthy asset, that is the moment that the game flips.” From Speculation to Utility Uphold’s move aligns with an industry-wide push to bridge digital assets with traditional financial systems . By offering asset-backed loans against XRP, Uphold has provided a new avenue for liquidity management and portfolio flexibility. As Bull Winkle summarized, “This isn’t about buying and selling anymore. This is about liquidity, leverage, and legitimacy.” His statement captures the essence of this milestone for XRP. The asset’s role as collateral marks another step toward practical financial use, where tokens function within the credit economy.

This price action reflects a period of consolidation after recent volatility, suggesting that traders are carefully watching for signals of a potential rebound. Oversold conditions, often identified through technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), signal that an asset has been heavily sold and may be undervalued in the short term. In XRP’s case, the token’s sustained position in this range points to mounting bullish interest, even as broader market sentiment remains cautious. As a result, prolonged oversold levels can often precede sharp rebounds when buying pressure returns. What is expected? Well, XRP’s oversold stance near $2.48 sets the stage for a potential bullish rebound. Ripple’s Meteoric Rise: From “Zombie Blockchain” to $180B Infrastructure Powerhouse Once dismissed as a 'zombie blockchain,' Ripple has emerged from the shadows. Technologist Paul Barron notes that Forbes now hails it as a $180 billion infrastructure powerhouse, a stunning turnaround that begs the question: shouldn’t Forbes be predicting winners instead of reporting them post-victory? After enduring prolonged regulatory scrutiny, Ripple is finally emerging as a force to be reckoned with. Its revival is not just a story of survival but of strategic reinvention. The company is making bold moves that signal a shift from speculative cryptocurrency hype to institutional-grade financial infrastructure. Ripple is strategically expanding through acquisitions, such as Hidden Road, not just to grow but to cement regulatory compliance and build infrastructure for tokenized assets. By integrating these firms, Ripple is positioning itself as a trusted intermediary in the evolving digital finance landscape. Furthermore, Ripple is building institutional-grade settlement rails, prioritizing financial institutions over retail or speculative markets. By enabling faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments, Ripple is positioning itself as the backbone of a tokenized financial system, targeting the $187 trillion B2B cross-border market. Therefore, Ripple’s resurgence proves that regulatory hurdles and negative press don’t derail visionary projects. Through strategic acquisitions, institutional-grade solutions, and positioning XRP as the backbone of tokenized finance, Ripple is not just surviving, it’s reshaping global financial infrastructure. Conclusion XRP hovering near the $2.48 support in oversold territory marks a pivotal moment. Strong technical footing, emerging bullish momentum, and solid fundamentals point to a potential rebound on the horizon. On the other hand, Ripple’s rise from a “zombie blockchain” to a $180 billion infrastructure powerhouse highlights its resilience and strategic vision.

Most altcoins are with minor gains within the same timeframe, aside from TAO and ZEC, which have exploded by double digits, and Figure Heloc, which has skyrocketed by more than 300%. BTC Unstable at $110K The macro perspective received several positive news in the past ten days or so, starting from the lower-than-expected inflation numbers for September announced last Friday. Then, the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates on Wednesday, as expected, while China and the US reached some preliminary consensus on trade frictions. However, BTC’s price has failed to capitalize on this momentum. Just the opposite, the asset challenged $116,000 on a couple of occasions at the beginning of the business week, only to be halted there and pushed south hard. Even after the Fed’s rate reduction, BTC dumped from $112,000 to under $108,000. The Washington-Beijing news brought some short-term relief, but BTC couldn’t pass through $115,000 on Thursday and Friday and was pushed south to around $110,000, where it currently sits. Consequently, its market capitalization remains below $2.2 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is below 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ZEC, TAO on the Rise Most larger-cap alts have posted gains of up to 1% in the past 24 hours. These include ETH, XRP, BNB, DOGE, TRX, and ADA. In contrast, SOL and HYPE are slightly in the red. More impressive price increases come from some of the recent high-fliers. Figure Haloc, for instance, has gone on a tear once again in the past day, surging by over 340% and now sits beyond $1. TAO and ZEC followed suit with more modest double-digit price pumps of 20% and 13%, respectively. ZEC has tapped a new multi-year record of almost $450.

The meeting happened during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit taking place in South Korea. Carney told reporters on Saturday that people shouldn’t expect quick fixes to come out of one conversation. He said the goal was simply to start talking again at the top level after such a long break. “What the meeting accomplished, which was the objective of the meeting, was to establish that relationship at the highest level for the first time in eight years, and to unlock a few things,” Carney said before heading back home. The prime minister accepted an invitation from Xi to travel to China sometime in the new year. However, he wouldn’t say when problems like tariffs and travel limits between the two countries might get sorted out. “People sometimes simplify it down, to give this for that,” Carney said . “That’s not the way it works.” One major issue between Canada and China involves taxes placed on each other’s products. Last year, when Justin Trudeau was still prime minister, Canada put heavy tariffs on electric vehicles, steel and aluminum coming from China. In response, China placed levies on Canadian food products, hitting canola especially hard as reported by Cryptopolitan. This crop represents a major export for Canadian farmers selling to Asia. Carney said he wants to open doors for more Canadian companies to do business in China over time. He mentioned clothing retailers like Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. as examples of businesses that could benefit. He noted that some sectors involving cyber-security technology would likely still face investment restrictions due to security concerns. Walking a careful line on electric vehicles When reporters asked if Canada would reconsider the 100% tariff it placed on Chinese electric vehicles, Carney didn’t give a clear answer. He said his government would “proceed carefully” because of challenges facing the auto industry, likely referring to tariffs that US President Donald Trump has put on Canadian cars coming into America. Still, Carney sees room for Canada and China to work together on clean energy projects. He pointed out that Chinese companies lead the world in offshore wind power and battery storage technology. “Some of the most competitive companies in the world are Chinese, in both offshore wind and in battery storage,” Carney said. “It’s a natural potential area for cooperation even before you get to EVs.” Trouble with America complicates matters Meanwhile, Canada faces trade troubles closer to home. Last week, President Trump said he was ending trade discussions with Canada. This came after Ontario released an advertisement using audio from former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. After speaking with Mark Carney, Ontario Premier Doug Ford paused the advertising campaign on Monday to allow trade talks with the United States to resume. The ad continued to air during the World Series games over the weekend before the pause took effect. “Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Economy|CAD|CNY|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-01 10:37:19

The world of digital assets is dynamic, and few cryptocurrencies spark as much debate and interest as Bitcoin Cash. Today, we’re diving deep into the Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction for the coming years, exploring the factors that could drive its value and answering the burning question: Will BCH hit the coveted $1000 mark by 2030? Many investors are seeking clarity amidst market volatility. Understanding the potential trajectory of BCH requires a look at its fundamentals, market sentiment, and broader economic trends. This comprehensive guide will equip you with insights into what the future might hold for this prominent cryptocurrency. Understanding Bitcoin Cash: A Brief Overview Bitcoin Cash (BCH) emerged in 2017 as a hard fork of Bitcoin, born from a desire to address Bitcoin’s scalability limitations. Its core philosophy revolves around providing a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that offers fast, reliable, and low-cost transactions. By increasing the block size limit, BCH aimed to process more transactions per second, making it more suitable for everyday payments. Key aspects of Bitcoin Cash: Larger Block Size: Originally 8MB, later increased to 32MB, allowing for more transactions per block compared to Bitcoin’s 1MB. Lower Transaction Fees: Designed to keep transaction costs minimal, making it practical for small purchases. Faster Confirmation Times: Aims for quicker transaction processing, enhancing user experience. Decentralized Vision: Adheres to the original Bitcoin whitepaper’s vision of electronic cash. This commitment to utility and accessibility forms the bedrock of any future BCH price movement. Historical Performance: What Can We Learn from the Past? BCH’s journey has been a rollercoaster. After its launch, it quickly gained significant value, reflecting the strong belief in its mission. However, like many altcoins, it has experienced substantial price fluctuations, often correlated with the broader cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s movements. Its all-time high in late 2017/early 2018 showed the market’s initial enthusiasm, while subsequent bear markets tested its resilience. Analyzing historical data helps us understand market cycles and investor behavior, providing context for our Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction . While past performance is not indicative of future results, it highlights BCH’s ability to recover and attract renewed interest during bull cycles. Factors Influencing Bitcoin Cash’s Future Price Several critical elements will shape the Bitcoin Cash future . These factors are interconnected and can cause significant shifts in market sentiment and price action. 1. Market Dynamics and Bitcoin’s Influence The cryptocurrency market often moves in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC). As a major altcoin, BCH is particularly sensitive to BTC’s price movements. A strong Bitcoin bull run typically pulls altcoins, including BCH, upwards. Conversely, a BTC correction can lead to broader market downturns. Macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability, also play a significant role in overall crypto market sentiment. 2. Technological Developments and Network Upgrades The ongoing development and improvement of the Bitcoin Cash network are vital. Features like Schnorr signatures, which enhance privacy and transaction efficiency, and continued efforts to improve scalability and smart contract capabilities, can boost adoption and investor confidence. A robust and evolving ecosystem is crucial for long-term growth. 3. Adoption and Utility For BCH to truly thrive, widespread adoption as a payment method is essential. This includes integration with payment processors, acceptance by merchants, and increased usage for remittances and daily transactions. Partnerships with businesses and developers building on the BCH blockchain will drive real-world utility, strengthening its value proposition. 4. Halving Events Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash undergoes halving events, which reduce the reward for mining new blocks by half. These events decrease the supply of new BCH entering the market, and historically, they have often preceded significant price increases due to scarcity. The next BCH halving is a key event to watch for. 5. Regulatory Environment The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Clear and favorable regulations can provide certainty for institutional investors and foster broader adoption. Conversely, restrictive or uncertain regulations can hinder growth and create market apprehension. Decoding the Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction for 2025 As we look towards 2025, several market analysts anticipate a potential resurgence in the broader crypto market. Following a period of consolidation, many expect renewed investor interest and capital inflow. For BCH, 2025 could be a year of steady recovery and foundational growth. Our Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction for 2025 suggests a conservative yet optimistic outlook. If the overall market experiences a healthy recovery, driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions and increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, BCH is likely to benefit. The focus on utility and low fees might attract users looking for practical digital payment solutions. Minimum Price: Around $250 – $300 Average Price: Around $350 – $450 Maximum Price: Potentially reaching $500 – $600 if market sentiment is exceptionally strong. The key here will be sustained development within the BCH ecosystem and its ability to maintain relevance in a competitive landscape. This period will be crucial in setting the stage for the long-term Bitcoin Cash future . Analyzing the BCH Price Trajectory Towards 2026 Moving into 2026, the market might be experiencing the effects of the previous year’s growth. This year could see BCH consolidating its gains or continuing an upward trend, depending on the momentum of the wider crypto bull cycle. The impact of the BCH halving event, if it occurs around this time, could start to be fully realized, leading to increased scarcity and potential price appreciation. For our BCH price forecast in 2026, we consider a scenario where Bitcoin and the overall market continue their upward trajectory, but perhaps at a more measured pace. Utility-driven coins like BCH could see sustained interest as more people use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. A possible range for 2026: Metric 2026 Price Range Low $400 – $500 Average $550 – $700 High $750 – $850 Continued adoption by merchants and payment gateways will be a significant catalyst during this period. The narrative of BCH as a practical, transactional cryptocurrency could gain further traction. Bitcoin Cash’s Long-Term Outlook: A 2027-2029 Forecast The years between 2027 and 2029 represent a crucial phase for any long-term BCH forecast . By this time, the cryptocurrency market is expected to have matured considerably, with clearer regulatory frameworks and potentially wider mainstream adoption. Bitcoin Cash’s ability to innovate and adapt will be paramount. During these years, we might see BCH solidifying its position as a go-to cryptocurrency for fast, cheap payments, especially in regions where traditional banking infrastructure is less developed or more expensive. The competition will be fierce, but BCH’s established network and community could provide a competitive edge. Key considerations for this period: Technological Superiority: Does BCH continue to offer competitive transaction speeds and costs compared to newer alternatives? Ecosystem Growth: Are there thriving dApps, services, and wallets built around BCH? Market Cycles: The crypto market is cyclical. These years could encompass both bullish and bearish phases, influencing price action. If BCH maintains its developmental pace and expands its utility, the price could see substantial appreciation, building towards our ultimate target. Will Bitcoin Cash Hit $1000? A 2030 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction This is the question on everyone’s mind. Can Bitcoin Cash truly reach $1000 by 2030? Our long-term Cryptocurrency price prediction suggests that it is indeed a plausible, though ambitious, target. Achieving this milestone would require a confluence of favorable factors: Scenario for BCH to Reach $1000: Sustained Crypto Bull Market: A robust, multi-year bull market that sees Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs would likely pull BCH along. Increased Global Adoption: Widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies for payments, particularly BCH’s niche as a fast and cheap option. This means more merchants, more users, and more integration into daily financial lives. Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in scalability, security, and smart contract functionality that keep BCH competitive and relevant. Favorable Regulatory Environment: Clear and supportive regulations worldwide that encourage rather than stifle innovation and adoption. Reduced Competition or Niche Dominance: BCH carving out a dominant position in specific payment sectors or regions. If these conditions align, reaching $1000 by 2030 becomes a realistic possibility. The market capitalization would still be significantly lower than Bitcoin’s, leaving room for substantial growth if its utility narrative takes hold globally. 2030 Price Projection for BCH: Minimum Price: $700 – $850 (assuming steady growth) Average Price: $900 – $1200 (if market conditions are favorable) Maximum Price: Potentially $1500+ (in an exceptionally strong bull market with high adoption) It’s important to remember that these are predictions based on current trends and expert analysis. The crypto market is highly volatile, and unforeseen events can always impact prices. Challenges and Risks for Bitcoin Cash While the potential is there, BCH faces several challenges that could impact its journey to $1000: Competition: The payment coin sector is crowded with established players and emerging technologies. Ethereum’s scaling solutions, Solana, Litecoin, and even newer stablecoins offer alternatives. Developer Activity: Maintaining a vibrant developer community is crucial for continuous innovation and network security. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sudden market crashes or shifts in sentiment can erase gains quickly. Regulatory Headwinds: Unfavorable regulations in key markets could hinder adoption and development. Internal Divisiveness: Past hard forks (like the creation of Bitcoin SV) highlight the potential for community splits, which can damage investor confidence. Investors must consider these risks when evaluating the long-term prospects of BCH. Opportunities for BCH Growth Despite the challenges, several opportunities could propel Bitcoin Cash forward: Global Remittances: BCH’s low fees and fast transactions make it ideal for international money transfers, especially to developing nations. Micropayments: Its design is well-suited for small, frequent transactions, potentially opening doors in content monetization and online gaming. Merchant Adoption: Focusing on easy-to-integrate payment solutions for businesses could significantly increase its utility. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion: While not its primary focus, increased interoperability or specific DeFi applications on BCH could broaden its appeal. Leveraging these opportunities will be key to unlocking BCH’s full potential. Expert Opinions and Analyst Insights Many analysts hold varied views on BCH’s future. Some remain bullish, citing its foundational principles of cheap and fast transactions as a timeless value proposition in a world moving towards digital payments. They often point to its established network effect and brand recognition as advantages. Others are more cautious, highlighting the intense competition and the need for BCH to continuously innovate to stay relevant. However, a common thread among optimistic projections is the belief that if the overall cryptocurrency market continues its growth trajectory and real-world utility becomes a dominant narrative, BCH is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the transactional volume. How to Approach BCH Investment: Actionable Insights Investing in any cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin Cash, requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on predictions. Understand BCH’s technology, use cases, and community. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different assets. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investments often yield the best results over longer time horizons, weathering short-term fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes affecting BCH. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Cash What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the motion to dismiss argues that there is no evidence to support these claims. In its filing, Meta claims that there is no evidence pointing to the fact that its models contain or were trained using copyrighted materials. The company also claimed that the allegations are “nonsensical and unsupported.” The motion was first reported by Ars Technica, with Meta issuing a direct denial, noting that the claims are bogus. Plaintiffs have gone “to great lengths to stitch this narrative together with guesswork and innuendo, but their claims are neither cogent nor supported by well-pleaded facts,” the motion reads. Meta wants the court to dismiss adult content piracy lawsuit The original complaint was filed in July by Strike 3 Holdings. The platform alleged that Meta used corporate and concealed IP addresses to torrent nearly 2,400 adult movies since 2018. It claimed that the move was part of the company’s broader efforts to build multimodal artificial intelligence systems. Strike 3 is an adult film holding base in Miami, distributing content under brands like Vixen, Tushy, and Blacked, among others. In its motion , Meta argues that the scale and pattern of alleged downloads contradict Strike 3’s AI training theory. Over the past seven years, only 157 adult contents produced by Strike were allegedly downloaded using Meta’s corporate IP addresses. This puts it at an average of around 22 downloads per year across 47 different IP addresses. Angela Dunning, Meta’s attorney, characterized the lawsuit as “meager, uncoordinated activity” from “disparate individuals.” Dunning attributed the downloads to individuals, noting that they were for personal use, and not part of an effort by the tech giant to gather data for AI training as Strike 3 alleges. The motion also pushes back on Strike 3’s claims that Meta used more than 2,500 hidden third-party IP addresses, noting that Strike 3 did not verify the addresses and instead made loose correlations. It claimed that one of the IP ranges is allegedly connected to a Hawaiian nonprofit with no link to Meta, while others have no identified owner. Meta also claimed that there is no proof that it knew about the alleged downloads, and neither is there proof that it could have stopped them. It also added that it gained nothing from them and that monitoring every file on its global network would be neither simple nor required by law. Dermot McGrath, co-founder of venture capital firm Ryzen Labs, said, “If Meta admitted the data was used in models, they’d have to argue fair use, justify the inclusion of pirated content, and open themselves to discovery of their internal training and audit systems.” He also added that instead of denying how the data was used, Meta has chosen to deny that it ever used it at all. However, McGrath claims that if the court admits the defense, it could open “a massive loophole.” He claims that it could “effectively undermine copyright protection for AI training data cases” such that future cases would need “stronger evidence of corporate direction, which companies would simply get better at hiding.” Still, there are legitimate reasons to use explicit content, with some companies using it to develop safety or moderation tools. “Most major AI companies have ‘red teams’ whose job is to probe models for weaknesses by using harmful prompts and trying to get the AI to generate explicit, dangerous, or prohibited content,” McGrath said.

This pivotal move begs the question: is XRP on the verge of a price surge? As institutional interest soars, the potential for XRP to hit new highs grows stronger. Dive deep into the drivers behind this demand and discover which other coins might be primed for similar growth. XRP Shows Steady Climb with Eyes on Higher Resistance Levels Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.43 and $2.77. The recent uptick in its price marks a growth of over 5% in the past week. This suggests a potential bullish trend as it approaches its nearest resistance at $2.89. With strong support at $2.21, XRP has room to rise. If it breaks past $2.89, the next target would be $3.23, reflecting a potential 30% increase from current levels. The Relative Strength Index sits comfortably at 57.03, indicating balanced momentum. Meanwhile, a high Stochastic value suggests XRP still has some upward potential. With its six-month increase of over 15%, XRP is riding a wave of optimism among investors. Conclusion Institutional interest in XRP is growing, highlighted by Evernorth’s recent move. This suggests a strong and burgeoning market demand. As more institutions invest in XRP, the potential for its value to rise becomes evident.

The crypto community is abuzz with speculation on whether this could be the catalyst for ADA’s long-anticipated price recovery. This article delves into the potential impact of the upgrade and explores which other cryptocurrencies may benefit from similar advancements. Cardano's Potential for a Comeback Despite Recent Slump Source: tradingview Cardano's price is hovering between the low 60 cents to just over 70 cents. It's facing resistance at around 74 cents, while support rests near 58 cents. Recently, Cardano has seen a drop of nearly a quarter in value over the past month. However, it has rebounded slightly from its 10-day moving average. The RSI suggests it's neither overbought nor oversold. If it manages to break through 74 cents, a climb to the low 80 cents range is possible, marking an almost 15% increase. The market indicators show a mixed signal, but Cardano still holds potential for growth in the near future. Conclusion The recent upgrade marks a significant achievement for Cardano. This development could be a key factor in ADA's potential price recovery. By improving efficiency and performance, the upgrade aims to position Cardano as a strong competitor in the cryptocurrency market. If the community embraces the changes, ADA may see renewed investor interest and upward momentum in value. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, and few digital assets have captured as much attention and debate as Ripple XRP. Its journey has been a rollercoaster, marked by groundbreaking innovation, strategic partnerships, and significant legal challenges. But the burning question on everyone’s mind remains: what does the future hold for XRP price prediction , especially regarding the elusive $5 mark? For years, XRP has been a cornerstone in the digital asset space, aiming to revolutionize cross-border payments. Its unique position and the ongoing developments surrounding its ecosystem make it a fascinating subject for investors and enthusiasts alike. This comprehensive article delves into the potential trajectory of XRP, exploring the factors that could drive its value, the hurdles it faces, and whether reaching $5 is a realistic target. Understanding Ripple XRP: More Than Just a Digital Asset Before we dive into future price movements, it is essential to understand what Ripple XRP truly is. XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source, decentralized blockchain technology. Developed by Jed McCaleb, David Schwartz, and Arthur Britto, the XRPL was designed for fast, low-cost, and reliable transactions, primarily focusing on cross-border payments. Ripple, the company, utilizes XRP in its payment solutions, such as RippleNet, which connects banks and financial institutions globally. The core benefit of XRP lies in its efficiency: transactions on the XRPL can settle in mere seconds, at a fraction of the cost of traditional banking systems or even other cryptocurrencies. This utility has positioned XRP as a potential disruptor in the remittance and global payments industry. Key Aspects of Ripple XRP: Speed: Transactions settle in 3-5 seconds. Cost: Extremely low transaction fees, typically less than a cent. Scalability: Capable of handling 1,500 transactions per second (TPS), with potential for more. Decentralization: The XRP Ledger is maintained by a network of independent validators. Utility: Used for international money transfers, liquidity on demand, and micro-payments. Navigating the Legal Landscape: The SEC vs. Ripple Saga and its Impact on XRP Forecast No discussion about XRP’s future is complete without addressing the elephant in the room: the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Ripple Labs. In December 2020, the SEC alleged that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. This legal battle has cast a long shadow over XRP, leading to its delisting from several major U.S. exchanges and significantly impacting its price. However, recent developments have provided a glimmer of hope. A landmark ruling in July 2023 declared that programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges did not constitute an investment contract, marking a partial victory for Ripple. This decision brought much-needed regulatory clarity, leading to a substantial price surge and renewed optimism for the XRP forecast . Impact of the SEC Lawsuit: Initial Price Drop: Significant decline in XRP’s value post-lawsuit announcement. Delistings: Many U.S. exchanges halted XRP trading for their customers. Regulatory Clarity: Recent court decisions have provided more certainty, attracting institutional interest. Market Sentiment: The legal developments heavily influenced investor confidence and market perception. Factors Influencing the XRP Price Prediction 2025 and Beyond Predicting the price of any cryptocurrency is inherently complex, given the volatile nature of the market. However, several key factors will play a crucial role in shaping the XRP price prediction in the coming years: 1. Regulatory Clarity and Global Adoption: The resolution of the SEC lawsuit, or at least continued positive developments, is paramount. Clear regulations can pave the way for wider institutional adoption and relisting on U.S. exchanges. Beyond the U.S., increasing acceptance by financial institutions and governments for cross-border payments using RippleNet will be a major catalyst. 2. Market Sentiment and Broader Crypto Trends: The overall health of the cryptocurrency market significantly impacts individual assets. A bullish market, potentially driven by Bitcoin halvings or broader economic recovery, would likely pull XRP’s price upwards. Conversely, a bear market could exert downward pressure. 3. Ripple’s Partnerships and Use Cases: Ripple continues to forge partnerships globally. The expansion of RippleNet, especially in emerging markets, and the potential for XRP to be used in Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or other innovative financial products, could substantially increase its utility and demand. 4. Technological Advancements on the XRP Ledger: Ongoing development and upgrades to the XRPL, such as new features, smart contract capabilities, or enhanced scalability, can attract more developers and projects, boosting the ecosystem and demand for XRP. 5. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical events can all influence investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Prediction 2025: A Look at the Near Future As we approach 2025, the market will likely have absorbed more of the implications from the SEC lawsuit. Assuming a continued positive regulatory environment and a generally recovering crypto market, the XRP price prediction for 2025 holds significant interest. Potential Scenarios for XRP in 2025: Scenario Low Price Target Average Price Target High Price Target Optimistic (Strong Adoption, Bull Market) $1.20 $1.80 $2.50+ Moderate (Steady Growth, Market Recovery) $0.70 $1.00 $1.50 Pessimistic (Regulatory Setbacks, Bear Market) $0.40 $0.55 $0.70 An optimistic outlook for 2025 suggests that with clearer regulations and increased utility, XRP could regain its momentum. Institutional investors, previously hesitant due to legal uncertainties, might enter the market, driving demand. However, any unexpected negative regulatory news or a broader crypto market downturn could temper these predictions. XRP Price Prediction 2026-2030: Can Ripple XRP Truly Soar? Looking further into the future, the long-term XRP price prediction depends heavily on Ripple’s ability to execute its vision for global payments and the broader evolution of the digital asset landscape. If Ripple successfully integrates XRP into mainstream financial systems, its utility could drive significant value appreciation. Long-Term Drivers for Ripple XRP: Cross-Border Payments Dominance: If RippleNet becomes a standard for international remittances, XRP’s demand as a bridge currency will skyrocket. CBDC Integration: Ripple is actively working with central banks on CBDC solutions. If XRP plays a role in these systems, its value proposition would be immense. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on XRPL: Growth of DeFi applications and smart contracts on the XRP Ledger could create new use cases and demand. Tokenization of Assets: The XRPL’s efficiency makes it suitable for tokenizing various assets, potentially expanding its ecosystem. By 2030, if Ripple achieves significant milestones in these areas and the crypto market matures with clearer global regulations, XRP could see substantial growth. However, competition from other blockchain networks and traditional financial systems remains a challenge. Can XRP Reach $5? Unpacking the “XRP to $5” Scenario The question of whether XRP to $5 is achievable is perhaps the most debated topic among its holders. To reach $5, XRP would need a market capitalization significantly higher than its current levels. Let’s consider what this would entail: What Would it Take for XRP to Reach $5? Massive Institutional Adoption: Widespread use by major banks and financial institutions for large-scale transactions. Complete Regulatory Clarity: A definitive global framework that recognizes XRP’s utility and not as a security. Dominance in Cross-Border Payments: Capturing a significant share of the multi-trillion-dollar global remittance market. Strong Bull Market: A sustained period of growth across the entire cryptocurrency market, similar to the 2017 or 2021 bull runs. High Utility and Demand: Consistent and growing demand for XRP from various use cases beyond just speculation. Currently, XRP’s all-time high is around $3.84, achieved during the 2017-2018 bull run. Reaching $5 would mean surpassing this peak, which is certainly possible with the right catalysts. The market cap at $5 would place XRP among the top cryptocurrencies, indicating a high level of trust and utility. While ambitious, it is not an impossible target, especially considering the potential for exponential growth in the digital asset space. Expert Insights and the Future of Ripple XRP Many analysts offer a varied XRP forecast , but a common thread is the recognition of its strong underlying technology and utility. While some remain cautious due to past legal hurdles, others are highly optimistic, citing Ripple’s strategic partnerships and focus on real-world financial solutions. The consensus among many experts is that XRP’s future is closely tied to its adoption by financial institutions and its ability to solve real-world problems more efficiently than existing solutions. The increasing interest in CBDCs and stablecoins could also indirectly benefit XRP, as Ripple is a key player in this evolving landscape. Investment Considerations and Risks: A Balanced XRP Forecast While the potential for XRP is compelling, it is crucial to approach any investment with a clear understanding of the risks involved. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets, and XRP is no exception. Key Risks to Consider: Market Volatility: Prices can fluctuate wildly in short periods. Regulatory Changes: Despite recent clarity, future regulatory actions in different jurisdictions could impact XRP. Competition: Other blockchain networks and traditional financial giants are also vying for dominance in the payment space. Technology Risks: While robust, no technology is immune to unforeseen issues or obsolescence. Liquidity: While generally liquid, market conditions can affect ease of buying and selling. Investors should conduct thorough research, understand their risk tolerance, and consider diversifying their portfolios. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Actionable Insights for XRP Holders and Potential Investors For those considering an investment in XRP or already holding it, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of legal developments, Ripple’s partnerships, and broader market trends. Follow reputable crypto news sources and official Ripple announcements. Risk Management: Implement a clear investment strategy. This might include dollar-cost averaging, setting stop-loss orders, or taking profits at predetermined levels. Understand the Technology: A deeper understanding of the XRP Ledger and RippleNet’s utility can provide conviction during volatile periods. Long-Term Vision: XRP’s potential often lies in its long-term utility rather than short-term speculative gains. Consider a long-term investment horizon if you believe in its fundamental value.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 20% – But Some Think This Is When The Real Gains Start The move was first made public on October 20, 2025, when both firms announced the equity position and pledged immediate capital support for the club. Triestina, which was founded in 1918 and currently competes in Serie C, will carry Dogecoin branding on its match kits and around its stadium for the remainder of the 2025/26 season and all of the 2026/27 campaign. Kit And Stadium Branding Confirmed Based on reports released on October 30, 2025, Dogecoin will appear as the primary sponsor on the front of Triestina’s official match shirts. House of Doge branding is set for secondary placements, such as sleeves and shorts. LED boards inside the ground, big-screen videos and press backdrops will also display the Dogecoin motif during games and media events. These activations are part of a wider plan that includes testing Dogecoin as a payment option for tickets, merchandise and concessions. What The Announcements Leave Out The deal’s exact financial terms were not disclosed. No price tag or ownership percentage was published by either side. Reports have disclosed that a board reconstitution and the appointment of a new president are planned, but names and dates have not been shared. Push For Real-World Use Of Dogecoin House of Doge framed the investment as a chance to push Dogecoin beyond online chatter and into everyday use at a sports venue. The group said the club will act as a platform for broader community initiatives and commercial experiments with crypto payments. Fans could be given new ways to pay and buy, if pilot projects roll out as described. There is, however, a question about how smoothly such systems will be adopted in a lower-division club environment and what regulatory checks will be required in Italy. Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, said placing the Dogecoin logo front-and-center on the club’s jersey means it will show up in every match photo and TV shot. He said frequent exposure will make people recognize the brand, and that recognition can lead to practical uses and wider global acceptance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Shaves $5 Billion From Satoshi Nakamoto’s Untouched Fortune Local Reaction And Broader Implications Some local journalists praised the capital boost, noting that lower-division clubs often face tight budgets. Others warned that visibility for a cryptocurrency brand does not guarantee long-term financial stability. Market observers will be watching whether the partnership drives measurable increases in matchday revenue or merchandise sales. Community groups, who are central to the club’s identity in Trieste, have been cited as needing reassurance that traditions will be respected. DOGE Price Update Meanwhile, after sliding about 7% in the past 24 hours, DOGE is trading at $0.18. The coin is up 11% so far this year, but that still leaves it roughly 70% below its 2021 peak of $0.73.

Khanna explained his proposal by saying, “No one should hold an elected office to profit from their position.” Khanna's proposed draft resolution states that the president, vice president, members of Congress, elected public officials, and their immediate family members should not issue, support, or endorse any digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, memecoins, stablecoins, NFTs, digital trading cards, and DeFi platforms. It also argues that elected officials and candidates should be required to transfer their digital assets into inaccessible “blind trusts” during their term and for two years after leaving office. The bill also seeks to support legislation that would require politicians and their families to provide timely and complete disclosure of all cryptocurrency transactions. Khanna's proposal directly targets the digital asset activities of US President Donald Trump and his family. The draft alleges that the Trump family “has used their names and likenesses to establish an opaque and largely unregulated network of crypto ventures.” The document states that these projects include tools such as digital trading cards, memecoins, stablecoins, and DeFi platforms. Related News: Tron Founder Justin Sun's Net Worth Revealed According to the text of the decision, Trump “used his influence to increase the value of his own crypto ventures by using his authority and access.” It also alleges that foreign investments have flowed into Trump-linked crypto projects. The bill also criticizes Trump's recent presidential pardon of Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao. The White House, in a statement, said Trump was “exercising his constitutional authority” and accused the Biden administration of waging an “anti-crypto war.” “The Biden administration attempted to sentence Zhao to three years in prison despite the absence of any allegations of fraud or victims. This extreme approach has damaged the image of the United States as a global leader in technology and innovation,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said. Khanna's bill appears unlikely to pass because Republicans hold the majority in the House. *This is not investment advice.

When such a setup appears on a major asset, traders take notice. XRP’s monthly chart is now displaying one of those rare, textbook signals that could define its next major rally phase. A Classic Pattern Takes Shape A classic cup-and-handle pattern has formed on the monthly XRP/USD chart for Bitstamp, signaling a potential bullish breakout. This bullish continuation pattern began forming after XRP’s late-2024 lows. Over the following months, the price gradually curved upward, completing the “cup.” Since mid-2025, XRP has been consolidating in a tight range around $2.50, forming the “handle.” This pattern indicates that XRP is building momentum ahead of its next potential price surge. The structure reflects a market transitioning from long-term accumulation to renewed buying pressure. #XRP monthly chart showing perfect cup and handle pattern. Next price target is above $5. pic.twitter.com/y9v3bhBWmN — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 31, 2025 CryptoBull Highlights the Bullish Setup Prominent X analyst CryptoBull recently shared this observation, posting the XRP monthly chart and confirming the classic formation. The chart highlights how XRP has maintained its bullish trajectory since 2024, despite market volatility. According to CryptoBull, the handle formation is nearing completion, positioning XRP for a significant breakout. If the pattern confirms, the measured move projects the next price target above $5, signaling the potential start of a multi-month uptrend. Why the Cup and Handle Matters A cup and handle pattern on a monthly timeframe carries serious implications. It often represents extended accumulation and renewed market confidence. The rounded cup shows where sellers have gradually exhausted, while the handle signals short-term consolidation before a potential surge. When confirmed, this formation often triggers long-term continuation rallies. In XRP’s case, a decisive monthly close above the handle’s resistance could mark the beginning of a new bull phase. Technical analysts suggest that sustained volume growth would validate the breakout. Market Context and Momentum XRP’s fundamental backdrop aligns with its technical outlook. Ripple’s expanding global partnerships and the growing use of the XRP Ledger for stablecoin and tokenized asset transactions are strengthening the asset’s ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional participation is also increasing, following the regulatory clarity achieved earlier this year. This combination of strong fundamentals and a well-structured chart pattern gives the bullish thesis additional weight. What Traders Should Watch For confirmation, traders are watching for a monthly close above $2.80 with strong trading volume. If this occurs, technical projections point toward a breakout that could extend beyond $5. However, a failed breakout could send XRP back toward the $2.00 handle support zone. Analysts recommend closely monitoring both price action and market sentiment as the formation nears completion. Outlook CryptoBull’s post has reignited interest in XRP’s long-term structure. The chart’s alignment with a textbook bullish pattern has strengthened investor optimism. If the setup confirms, XRP could soon begin a new rally phase targeting levels unseen since 2021. For now, XRP remains one of the most technically compelling digital assets on the market — and all eyes are on the monthly close.

One such saga reached its dramatic conclusion with the reported death of Thodex founder , Faruk Fatih Özer, in prison. This news, reported by Wu Blockchain citing Bloomberg, marks the final chapter for a figure who became infamous for one of the largest crypto frauds in history. The Tragic End of the Thodex Founder’s Journey Faruk Fatih Özer, the man behind the defunct Turkish cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, has reportedly passed away while incarcerated. His death closes a chapter on a case that captivated the global financial community and left hundreds of thousands of investors reeling. Özer was serving an astounding sentence of 11,196 years in prison. He also faced a substantial fine of $5 million. These penalties stemmed from charges of failing to return an estimated $2 billion in deposits. The fraud impacted approximately 400,000 customers who entrusted their funds to Thodex. The scale of the misappropriation was staggering, highlighting the immense risks within the unregulated corners of the crypto market. The Thodex founder ‘s fate serves as a stark reminder of the severe consequences awaiting those who betray investor trust. What Exactly Was the Thodex Crypto Fraud? Thodex was once a prominent cryptocurrency exchange based in Turkey. However, in April 2021, the platform abruptly ceased operations, locking users out of their accounts and sparking widespread panic. Faruk Fatih Özer, the exchange’s CEO, vanished shortly after, leading to accusations of a massive exit scam, commonly known as a ‘rug pull’. Investigators later revealed that Özer had allegedly fled Turkey with the stolen funds, leaving behind a trail of devastated investors. His disappearance triggered an international manhunt, culminating in his capture in Albania in August 2022. He was subsequently extradited back to Turkey to face justice. The sheer volume of funds involved, estimated at $2 billion, made the Thodex fraud one of the most significant cryptocurrency scams to date. It exposed critical vulnerabilities in centralized crypto exchanges and the urgent need for greater regulatory oversight. Critical Lessons from the Thodex Founder’s Downfall The saga of the Thodex founder offers invaluable lessons for both investors and the broader cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the importance of due diligence and the inherent risks associated with less regulated platforms. Here are key takeaways: Investor Vigilance: Always research an exchange thoroughly. Check its reputation, security measures, and regulatory compliance before depositing significant funds. Regulatory Gaps: The incident highlighted the need for clearer and more robust regulatory frameworks globally to protect consumers in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Decentralization’s Appeal: It reinforced the argument for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, which aim to reduce reliance on single points of failure and central authorities. Cold Storage: For long-term holdings, consider using hardware wallets (cold storage) to maintain direct control over your assets, rather than leaving them on an exchange. The devastating impact on 400,000 customers underscores the human cost of such large-scale financial crimes. The fall of the Thodex founder is a cautionary tale that resonates deeply within the crypto community. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency Trust High-profile cases like the Thodex fraud inevitably erode public trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They fuel skepticism and can deter mainstream adoption, despite the innovative potential of blockchain technology. Such incidents often lead to: Increased calls for stricter government oversight. Greater scrutiny from traditional financial institutions. A push for exchanges to implement more transparent proof-of-reserves mechanisms. While the industry continues to mature, the legacy of events like the Thodex collapse serves as a powerful reminder that security and accountability must remain paramount. For the crypto space to thrive, it must consistently demonstrate its commitment to protecting users and upholding ethical standards. The death of the Thodex founder brings a definitive end to a story that served as a stark warning about the darker side of the digital asset boom. It reinforces the critical need for vigilance, strong regulation, and robust security practices to safeguard the future of cryptocurrency for all participants.

Analysts believe one of the next big movers could already be here and it’s still priced below $0.04. As attention shifts from meme coins and stagnant layer-1s to functional DeFi projects, investors are increasingly turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized lending protocol that’s quietly raising millions before its launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol that streamlines the process of decentralized lending, where the smart contracts are used to govern a borrower-lender relationship. The protocol is designed to use the automated contracts to automate the process of transactions, compute interest and manage collateral in a way it does not use centralized intermediaries. The aim is to ensure that crypto lending is safer, more transparent and more rewarding. The platform has two complementary markets. The former is the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) market. Users put in ETH or USDT in liquidity pools and earn mtTokens. The second market is Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace. Direct lending is arranged between the users of less popular assets. Individual interest rates and terms are established and every loan has Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio which provides adequate security. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is at the Phase 6 of its presale. Each MUTM token is priced at $0.035. The next price will be increased by nearly 20% to $0.04 and the launch price is set at $0.06. MUTM may be appreciated by 500% for investors that joined Phase 1 at official listing. Having raised more than $18.2 million and sold over 785 million tokens, the project currently has over 17,600 holders. The close launch date and the growth of demand have led to sales acceleration in this stage. Mutuum Finance has implemented a 24-hours leaderboard. The most active participant gets $500 in MUTM tokens per day. This fosters competition, ensures that there is a lot of investor activity and that there is transparency during the presale. The other innovation is that investors can purchase MUTM using a card with no restrictions thus the presale is open to both beginners and those who have been using it for a long time. In DeFi, trust is everything, and that is what Mutuum Finance has earned. The protocol went through a CertiK audit with the high score of 90/100 Token Scan Score, which implies well-structured and safe smart contracts. The team also runs a $50,000 bug-bounty to discover code vulnerabilities before the launch of the mainnet. These are steps that demonstrate a concern of safety and transparency, a factor that creates trust between early-stage investors. V1 Launch on Sepolia Testnet One of the main milestones is the launch of V1 to the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 in 2025, which will be the shift between development and live testing. Introducing deposits or lending of assets in a Liquidity Pool is the major characteristic of V1, as well as the use of mtTokens to document deposits and collect automatic interest and Debt Tokens that reflect obligations of borrowers. There will be a Liquidator Bot that will discover and resolve the under-collateralized positions in order to keep the platform stable. The testnet will first include lending, borrowing, and collateral of ETH and USDT. Other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins will be incorporated with intense testing. These releases of products are supposed to increase investor confidence more so when accompanied by presale participation and milestone delivery. The Reason Investors are Watching Closely Many industry analysts perceive MUTM to have a bright future. Beginning with a price of $0.06 at launch, it has the potential of increasing to $0.40. This prediction will be based on an active product, high presale activity, and consistent tokenomics. Other experts draw parallels between Mutuum Finance and early Aave or Solana, which started their projects as small DeFi projects before eventually evolving into large-cap hits. Provided that Mutuum maintains its current adoption rate, the number of users may grow by 20x by 2027, particularly with greater liquidity on one of the next bull runs. The launch of a testnet, a robust audit record and an almost fully sold presale establishes Mutuum Finance as one of the potential best crypto assets to purchase today at a price of below $0.05.

The meme coin has failed to put in a new all-time high this cycle, with the price down more than 88% from its all-time high levels from 2021. However, even this underperformance has not eroded the bullish sentiment surrounding the token, as one analyst has predicted that the Shiba Inu price still has more to offer. Consolidation Will End, And Shiba Inu Price Will Surge Over the last few months, the Shiba Inu price has fallen into a consolidation trend that has waxed stronger with the uncertain market headwinds. This has seen the price trade in a very tight range during this time, holding between $0.000009 and $0.000013 without any significant breakout in sight. Like with any consolidation trend, this time has been seen as a good time to get into the meme coin and begin buying at a discount . However, this is also entirely dependent on how long the consolidation is expected to last before there is a breakout, which would determine if accumulation was a good choice or not. According to crypto analyst MMBTtrader, this current consolidation may be presenting a good opportunity for entry. So far, the Shiba Inu price has seen a persistent dominance of low volatility, and the momentum has remained muted. Historically, during times of quiet like these, the best entries and trades are made. Furthermore, the crypto analyst pointed out that the Shiba Inu consolidation and accumulation phase may actually be nearing its end. Right now, the only thing left would be a catalyst that would trigger the next wave of the uptrend. This could be in the form of bullish news or a technical push . Either way, the outcome is expected to be the same. Shooting For New Yearly Highs In the case of a breakout, the crypto analyst expects the Shiba Inu price to see a notable and sharp rise . Multiple targets are set out for the meme coin, but all with triple-digit ascents. The first of these is a 200% breakout to the $0.00003364 level. Next on the list is a 402% price increase that would push the Shiba Inu price as high as $0.00005480 . While the final target is a 608% increase to push it above the $0.000075 level. While none of these puts it above its previous all-time high levels, it does send it quite close. As for the timeframe for this breakout to be completed, the crypto analyst puts it between 2026 and 2027, so over a year before completion.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 11:30:35

Operating under Iran’s restricted financial system — shaped by years of international sanctions — Nobitex has demonstrated that trust and responsibility can thrive even in complex environments. Following a high-profile cyberattack in June 2025 , the company’s open communication, full compensation for affected users, and rapid recovery positioned it as a model of responsible crypto governance in the Middle East. Transparency as Practice — Not Promise Nobitex has transformed transparency from a slogan into a measurable practice. After the 2025 incident, the exchange adopted a proactive disclosure model: publishing frequent recovery updates, sharing timelines, and maintaining open communication with users. Key Transparency Measures: •Regular public updates during incident response and recovery •Voluntary transparency dashboards showing KYC verification rates, flagged activities, and support response times •Clear statements confirming that Nobitex does not use mixers or transaction obfuscation tools This commitment has strengthened user confidence and positioned Nobitex as a rare model of crypto accountability in sanctioned markets. Compliance and Technology: AI-Driven AML/KYC Nobitex’s compliance framework is built around AI-powered transaction monitoring and on-chain analytics aligned with global AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) standards. Every transaction is traceable and auditable — ensuring legitimate activity and minimizing exposure to illicit use. For Users, This Means: •Secure access for users navigating inflation and financial restrictions •Continuous on-chain monitoring to reduce exposure to sanctioned entities •Faster, more reliable customer support based on verified user identity By combining automation, transparency, and education, Nobitex balances compliance, privacy, and accessibility. Empowering Iranians Through Investment Access While global narratives often focus on sanctions and politics, Nobitex’s impact is fundamentally economic and personal. The platform primarily serves ordinary Iranian users , offering a secure digital environment for investment and asset preservation amid inflation and currency volatility. Platform Highlights: •Verified KYC onboarding and multilingual educational programs •Real-time support to help users manage assets securely •Transparent investment opportunities that comply with local regulations and help users protect the long-term value of their savings For many Iranians, Nobitex provides a responsible investment gateway enabling participation in digital finance while staying compliant with domestic laws. Innovation Under Sanctions Operating within Iran’s sanctioned economy means navigating a complex balance between compliance, technology, and user protection. Nobitex’s approach ensures that sanctions targeting Iran do not compromise the platform’s technical integrity or users’ rights. Nobitex itself is not subject to international sanctions and operates under strict internal policies that safeguard privacy and legal compliance. This dual reality — global restrictions on Iran and Nobitex’s pursuit of lawful innovation — has driven the company to build resilient systems and transparent governance models that preserve user trust. Global Lessons from Nobitex’s Model Nobitex’s experience offers valuable insights for crypto exchanges operating in constrained or emerging markets: • Accountability builds resilience : Transparent communication and fair compensation strengthen long-term trust. • Metrics enhance oversight: Open dashboards and KPIs support credibility with users and regulators. • Compliance and privacy can coexist: AI-driven tools enable AML/KYC enforcement while protecting user data. Through its focus on transparency, compliance, and user education, Nobitex is redefining responsible crypto operations under economic pressure. About Nobitex Founded in 2018, Nobitex is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Iran, serving millions across the MENA region. The platform emphasizes secure, compliant, and transparent access to digital investment , publishing public reports on verification, monitoring, and customer support performance. With a long-term vision for ethical innovation and user trust, Nobitex continues to set the benchmark for transparency and resilience in the Middle East’s digital economy.

This remarkable reduction from the previous month’s $127 million in losses, as reported by blockchain security firm PeckShield, signals a positive shift in the ongoing battle against cyber threats in the cryptocurrency space. What’s Behind the Sharp Decline in Crypto Hacking Losses ? The substantial drop in crypto hacking losses isn’t merely a stroke of luck; it reflects a concerted effort by security firms, project developers, and the wider crypto community. Several factors likely contributed to this encouraging trend: Enhanced Security Measures: Blockchain projects are increasingly investing in robust security audits, bug bounty programs, and multi-layered authentication protocols. Proactive Threat Intelligence: Firms like PeckShield provide crucial real-time monitoring and analysis, allowing for quicker identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities. Improved User Awareness: A more informed user base is less susceptible to phishing scams and social engineering attacks, which often precede larger hacks. Law Enforcement Collaboration: Increased cooperation between blockchain analytics companies and global law enforcement agencies is making it harder for cybercriminals to launder stolen funds, thus reducing the incentive for hacks. October’s Notable Incidents: A Closer Look at Crypto Hacking Losses While the overall figures are positive, it’s important to understand the nature of the crypto hacking losses that did occur in October. Unlike previous months which saw large-scale DeFi protocol exploits, October’s incidents were generally smaller in scale. This suggests a shift in the attack landscape, with hackers perhaps targeting less secure, smaller projects or individual wallets. PeckShield’s data highlights that the total $18.18 million was spread across various minor incidents, rather than dominated by one or two major breaches. This indicates that while vigilance remains paramount, the industry is becoming more resilient against catastrophic single points of failure. The focus on smaller targets underscores the need for continuous security improvements across all levels of the crypto ecosystem, from individual users to emerging protocols. Maintaining Momentum: What’s Next for Reducing Crypto Hacking Losses ? The significant drop in crypto hacking losses in October is certainly cause for optimism, but the fight for digital asset security is far from over. Maintaining this positive momentum requires ongoing commitment and innovation. Here are key areas where the industry must continue to focus: Continuous Audits: Regular and thorough security audits remain non-negotiable for all blockchain projects, especially those handling substantial user funds. Education and Awareness: User education on best practices for wallet security, identifying scams, and understanding transaction risks is crucial. Decentralized Security Solutions: Exploring and implementing decentralized security protocols and community-driven monitoring systems can add additional layers of protection. Rapid Incident Response: Developing swift and effective incident response plans is vital to minimize damage when a breach does occur. October’s dramatic reduction in crypto hacking losses to $18.18 million marks a pivotal moment for the industry. It showcases the tangible results of enhanced security measures, proactive intelligence, and collective efforts. While challenges persist, this positive trend reinforces the potential for a more secure and trustworthy digital asset ecosystem. The journey towards absolute security is ongoing, but October’s figures provide a powerful testament to progress.

Following this move, international law enforcement acknowledged that the task force had done its job well. Additionally, the achievement demonstrates that the stablecoin industry can effectively self-regulate. According to TRON founder Justin Sun, the T3 Financial Crime Unit’s $300 million milestone is proof that progress happens when technology, institutions, and people work as a team. He noted that by building trust and cooperation across borders, it is possible to make the digital economy safer and more accessible for everyone. The T3 Financial Crime Unit focuses on various illegal financial activities Regarding the T3 Financial Crime Unit’s accomplishment , sources revealed that the task force achieved this milestone after working directly with law enforcement in 23 areas, including a crucial role in Brazil’s major Operation Lusocoin. When reporters reached out to Tether for further information, the company stated that the unit focuses on various illegal finance activities such as state-sponsored hacks, violent “wrench attacks,” and organized crime groups. To support this claim, reports revealed that the unit in Brazil assisted in Operation Lusocoin, resulting in the freezing of more than R$3 billion in assets. This marked one of the most significant recent confiscations, including 4.3 million USDT connected to a criminal organization. The report also highlighted the predominance of stablecoins in major currency evasion and money laundering cases . After careful consideration, Tether noted that the US had been ranked as the most active jurisdiction globally, with $83 million in frozen assets across 37 cases, followed by significant operations in Europe and South America. The discovery outlines the existence of a diverse and challenging threat environment. On the other hand, recent reports have highlighted that the most common crime scrutinized involved the illegal sale of goods and services. It accounted for around 39% of the task force’s workload. High-profile hacks, fraud, and scams were also uncovered in this investigation. An example is a single seizure of about $19 million linked to North Korea’s involvement in the Bybit hack. To address these issues, Tether and its partners have vowed to maintain a strong partnership with agencies worldwide, including Europol. At the same time, they continue to investigate major criminal activities like financing terrorism, extortion schemes, money laundering, and investment fraud. T3 FCU launches the T3+ Global Collaborator Program To expand its footprint in the crypto ecosystem, the T3+ Global Collaborator Program launched in August, and Binance became its first significant member. T3+ will serve as a “public-private” uniting between industry actors and law enforcement agencies worldwide . The ultimate goal is to expedite cross-border investigations and enhance monitoring capabilities by collaborating closely with exchanges, financial institutions, and other key stakeholders. Nils Andersen-Röed, Global Head of the Financial Intelligence Unit at Binance, called the effort “proactive collaboration.” Following its launch, concerns were raised about the program’s impact. This was addressed at Vienna’s 9th Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptocurrencies. Europol and the Basel Institute on Governance co-hosted the event During this event, prominent executives from leading companies, including TRON DAO, Tether , Binance, and TRM Labs, met with Europol officials to discuss how the T3 framework can serve as a guide for future public-private collaborations.

Aria, a pioneering story-based intellectual property (IP) tokenization platform, has just unveiled a significant initiative: the much-anticipated Aria airdrop . This move promises to reward its community in a truly impactful way. This groundbreaking announcement reveals plans to distribute 10% of its ARIAIP tokens directly to qualified IP holders. It’s a strategic step designed to empower creators and foster a vibrant ecosystem. For those involved in the world of intellectual property, understanding the mechanics and implications of this Aria airdrop is crucial. What Makes This Aria Airdrop a Game-Changer? The core of this initiative is a substantial distribution of ARIAIP tokens. Specifically, 10% of the total supply is earmarked for intellectual property holders who meet specific criteria. This isn’t a one-time event; the tokens will be distributed progressively following the official listing of ARIAIP. Direct Value: IP holders receive tangible digital assets, directly linking their creative work to the Web3 economy. Progressive Distribution: Ensures a sustained impact and engagement over time, rather than a single lump sum. Community Empowerment: Rewards early adopters and contributors, strengthening the Aria ecosystem. This approach highlights Aria’s commitment to its community. It aims to create a mutually beneficial relationship between the platform and its creators. Moreover, it sets a precedent for how IP can be valued and shared within the decentralized space. How Will the Aria Airdrop Benefit IP Holders? For intellectual property owners, this Aria airdrop presents a compelling array of benefits. Firstly, it offers a direct financial incentive. The ARIAIP tokens represent a stake in the Aria ecosystem, potentially gaining value as the platform grows and its IP tokenization services expand. Secondly, it enhances liquidity for creative assets. Traditional IP can be illiquid and difficult to transfer. By tokenizing IP and distributing ARIAIP tokens, Aria is creating new avenues for creators to monetize and manage their intellectual property. This fosters a more dynamic and accessible market for creative works. Enhanced Visibility: Participation in the airdrop can bring increased attention to the IP holder’s work. Governance Potential: Token holders may gain voting rights or influence over future platform developments. Network Effects: Connecting with a broader community of tokenized IP creators and enthusiasts. This initiative truly underscores the potential of Web3 to redefine ownership and compensation for creators. The Aria airdrop is more than just free tokens; it’s an invitation to a new paradigm. Understanding Aria’s Vision for IP Tokenization Aria’s platform focuses on story-based IP tokenization. This means taking narratives, characters, and entire fictional universes and transforming them into digital, tradable assets on the blockchain. The goal is to provide creators with greater control, transparency, and new monetization opportunities for their intellectual property. The ARIAIP token is central to this vision. It acts as a utility token within the Aria ecosystem, facilitating transactions, governance, and potentially staking. The Aria airdrop , therefore, serves as a foundational distribution event, ensuring that a significant portion of these vital tokens lands in the hands of the very creators the platform aims to serve. It represents a forward-thinking approach to digital rights management and value creation. As the digital economy evolves, platforms like Aria are paving the way for creators to unlock the full potential of their intellectual property in a decentralized world. What Should Qualified IP Holders Do Next? If you are an intellectual property holder, it’s essential to stay informed about the specific qualification criteria for the Aria airdrop . Aria will undoubtedly provide detailed instructions on how to participate and ensure you receive your tokens. This will likely involve registering your IP on the platform and potentially meeting certain engagement thresholds. Keep an eye on official Aria communication channels for announcements regarding the token’s listing date and the exact distribution schedule. Preparing your digital wallet and understanding the claim process will be key steps to successfully benefiting from this exciting opportunity. Key Actions: Monitor Aria’s official announcements. Understand the eligibility requirements for IP holders. Prepare a compatible cryptocurrency wallet. Familiarize yourself with the ARIAIP token listing details. Concluding Thoughts on the Aria Airdrop The Aria airdrop marks a significant milestone for the intellectual property and Web3 communities.

In fact, aside from the early rallies that resulted in new ATHs for BTC and BNB, the rest of the month was mostly bearish, with massive price crashes and overall negative sentiment. Now, though, all eyes are on November as the bulls hope for a comeback. We decided to focus on XRP in this article, which tumbled below $1 on Binance during the October 10 massacre, and asked ChatGPT, Grok, and Perplexity about the token’s potential in the following 30 days. Mildly Bullish, Says ChatGPT After the painful October, OpenAI’s solution refrained from making any big bullish predictions for November, indicating that it’s “mildly bullish” on the asset’s upcoming price performance. Its base case puts XRP somewhere around $2.70 and $3.40, while the less likely bullish scenario envisions a massive surge to a new all-time high above $3.80. However, it admitted that numerous factors need to align, such as ETF approval and launch, overall crypto market resurgance, and better macro perspective. It also highlighted a bearish case, in which XRP slides below $2.00 once again. Such a correction could take place if the ETF listings face another delay and investors continue to flock to risk-off assets. “Seasonality/regime. November is often constructive for crypto (not guaranteed), and BTC leads risk appetite; if BTC firms, XRP beta usually benefits,” said ChatGPT. Favorable Month Ahead Perplexity and Grok were more bullish on the asset, mostly basing their views on historical performances. After all, data from Cryptorank shows that November has been XRP’s best month, with an average gain of 88%, followed by December (69.6%). Even if we rewind the clocks to November 2024, we can easily see a massive triple-digit surge after the US presidential elections and the promise of a friendlier administration and clearer regulations. XRP posted a mind-blowing 281.7% surge, which has only been topped by the 531.9% rally in November 2013. However, it’s hard to compare the market state now and back then. “Despite some bearish years in the past, November tends to be a statistically favorable month for XRP investors due to this recurring pattern,” said Perplexity. Grok noted that XRP is testing the key resistance at $2.60-$2.70 at the start of November, which could open the door for a surge to $3.00 if broken to the upside. However, a potential denial could result in an immediate retracement below $2.40. As such, it determined that the current level is crucial for XRP’s performance in November, and outlined a $3.50 price tag as a realistic target if it falls.

In a recent video , he analyzed XRP’s historical movements through the Gaussian channel on the three-month chart and explained why the asset could reach $27 soon. ChartNerd pointed out that XRP’s multi-year price cycles have consistently interacted with what he described as the “upper regression band” of the Gaussian channel . He noted that previous market lows, such as those in January 2017 and January 2020, formed around this same upper boundary before major rallies began. He emphasized that each cycle has followed a similar structure, with the regression band effectively serving as a recurring area of support across different phases of XRP’s price history . $XRP : $27, then a drop to $1. Don't hate the player. Hate the game https://t.co/YtH6BOALVb — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 30, 2025 The Path Toward $27 According to his analysis, XRP currently remains in an accumulation range that precedes a potential expansion phase. ChartNerd argued that if the asset can sustain its current position and build momentum, it may approach the $27 level in what he described as a “blow off top.” He explained that this potential move would align with the Gaussian channel behavior in previous market cycles. He explained that if XRP maintains stability within its current accumulation zone and later advances toward the $27 level , the next bear market could see prices align with the Gaussian channel for a new long-term low. ChartNerd explained that the channel’s upper regression band rises over time, meaning that future lows could form higher than before, even after a significant correction. However, he highlighted that this same technical framework also implies a steep retracement once the bullish phase ends. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Possible Return to $1 After the Peak The analyst’s projection suggests that XRP’s next full cycle could involve a sharp move from its projected top near $27 down to around $1. He presented historical data to support this outlook, noting that previous bear markets in XRP have produced corrections surpassing 95%. Notably, other analysts have predicted a 95% crash for XRP after the next massive rally, and ChartNerd asserted that a similar retracement would again align the digital asset’s price with the upper regression band. He emphasized that such a move would not be unusual compared to past XRP cycles, as each major rally since 2013 has eventually reverted to that same structural area on the Gaussian channel.

On a notable day, a colossal sum of 6,326 BTC, valued at approximately $697 million, was reportedly moved from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown new wallet. This massive transaction, flagged by blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, immediately sparked widespread speculation and discussion across the digital asset community. What does such a substantial movement of digital gold signify for the broader market and individual investors? What Does This Significant Bitcoin Transfer Imply? When a crypto whale executes a large Bitcoin transfer , it often sends ripples through the market. Such movements are closely watched because they can signal potential shifts in market sentiment or strategic plays by major holders. Therefore, understanding these events is crucial. Market Impact: While not immediately causing a price swing, a transfer of this magnitude can lead to speculation about selling pressure if the funds are heading to another exchange, or long-term holding if they are moving to a cold storage wallet. Whale Behavior: Large transactions like this are typically executed by ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Their actions can sometimes precede major market movements. Security and Privacy: Moving funds to an ‘unknown new wallet’ enhances the privacy of the holder, making it harder to track their future activities, though the initial transaction remains public on the blockchain. Understanding the context behind such a substantial Bitcoin transfer is crucial for market participants. Why Do Whales Initiate a Large Bitcoin Transfer? There are several strategic reasons why a large holder might initiate a significant Bitcoin transfer . These reasons are often speculative, as the identity of the wallet owner remains anonymous, but common motivations include: Enhanced Security: Moving funds from an exchange to a private, cold storage wallet (offline) is a common practice for long-term holders seeking to minimize exchange-related risks, such as hacks or regulatory freezes. This is often seen as a bullish sign, indicating an intent to hold rather than sell. Preparing for OTC Deals: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks facilitate large trades without impacting exchange order books. A whale might move funds to an OTC wallet in preparation for a private sale to an institutional buyer. Rebalancing Portfolios: Large investors frequently adjust their crypto holdings. A transfer could be part of a broader strategy to rebalance assets across different wallets or even different blockchains. Consolidation: Sometimes, whales consolidate smaller holdings from various wallets into one large, more manageable wallet for administrative purposes. Each potential reason for this Bitcoin transfer carries different implications for the market. Is This Bitcoin Transfer a Sign of Things to Come? While a single Bitcoin transfer does not definitively predict future market movements, it adds another layer to the ongoing narrative of institutional and large-scale participation in the crypto space. The sheer volume involved suggests a sophisticated actor. Moreover, it highlights the increasing maturity of the market. It’s important to consider: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. While a large transfer might create short-term uncertainty, it doesn’t guarantee a specific price direction. Institutional Interest: The continuous flow of large capital, whether in or out of exchanges, highlights the growing interest from institutions and high-net-worth individuals in Bitcoin as a significant asset class. On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Whale Alert provide valuable transparency into blockchain activities, allowing investors to monitor these large movements and form their own conclusions. This specific Bitcoin transfer is a prime example of such transparency in action. Investors should always conduct their own research and not solely rely on single transactions for investment decisions. The recent Bitcoin transfer of 6,326 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet serves as a compelling reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact intentions behind this massive movement remain shrouded in mystery, it underscores the strategic actions of major players and the ongoing evolution of how large sums of digital assets are managed. Such events are crucial for understanding the undercurrents of the crypto economy, highlighting both the robust security of blockchain technology and the persistent allure of Bitcoin as a store of value. As the digital landscape continues to mature, these significant transactions will undoubtedly remain a key focus for analysts and investors alike. Frequently Asked Questions About Large Bitcoin Transfers Understanding large cryptocurrency movements can be complex. Here are some common questions: Q: What is a crypto whale? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Q: Why is a Bitcoin transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet significant? A: This specific Bitcoin transfer is significant because Coinbase is a major exchange, and moving such a large sum to an unknown wallet often indicates a strategic decision by a large holder, such as moving to cold storage for long-term holding or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. Q: Does a large Bitcoin transfer always mean a price drop? A: Not necessarily. While some large transfers to exchanges can precede selling, movements to unknown wallets, especially cold storage, often suggest an intent to hold, which can be seen as a bullish signal. Market reactions are complex and depend on many factors. Q: How can I track large Bitcoin transfers? A: Services like Whale Alert monitor public blockchain data and report significant transactions. On-chain analytics platforms also provide tools for tracking and analyzing whale movements. Q: Is this Bitcoin transfer related to institutional investment? A: While the identity of the wallet owner is unknown, transactions of this size are often associated with institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or large funds, reflecting growing institutional interest in the asset class.

Industry-Led Unit Emerges as Global Enforcement Model In a landmark achievement for blockchain compliance, the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) has frozen $300 million in illicit cryptocurrency funds during its first year of operation. The initiative, which was launched in September 2024 by stablecoin issuer Tether , blockchain network TRON, and blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, was initially formed to clean up stablecoin transactions on the TRON network, where the majority of Tether (USDT) transfers occur. It connects exchanges and blockchain firms directly with law enforcement for real-time response to suspicious transactions. Its first major success involved Binance, resulting in the freezing of $6 million linked to a large-scale “pig butchering” scam. Major Operations and Global Collaboration Over the past year, the task force has supported major law enforcement actions worldwide, including Operation Lusocoin in Brazil, where authorities seized over R$3 billion in assets and froze 4.3 million USDT linked to a sophisticated money laundering network. The Brazilian Federal Police formally recognized the unit’s contribution to the operation. In the United States, cooperation between T3 FCU and federal agencies led to $83 million in frozen assets across 37 separate cases, making the U.S. the unit’s most active jurisdiction. The task force has also played a key role in mitigating state-sponsored threats, including the $19 million freeze connected to the Bybit hack attributed to North Korean-linked actors. By January 2025, the unit had frozen $100 million in illicit USDT, including $3 million associated with North Korean operations. That figure more than doubled by August, surpassing $250 million, as the team expanded its coordination network through the T3+ Global Collaborator Program. Growing Threats in Crypto Crime T3 FCU’s data highlights the shifting landscape of blockchain-based crime. The majority of cases involve illicit goods and services, which account for 39% of the unit’s investigations. Fraud and scams, including romance-based “pig butchering” cons, remain widespread, while hacks and exploits, often state-backed. continue to pose a global threat to digital asset security. The unit has also reported an increase in “wrench attacks”, incidents where criminals use physical coercion to steal crypto from holders. These developments underscore the ongoing need for real-time enforcement and stronger protective measures across the industry. Commitment to Global Integrity The success of the T3 Financial Crime Unit marks a significant milestone for crypto’s evolution toward greater transparency and compliance maturity. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated, “Tether is deeply committed to maintaining the integrity of the financial ecosystem by collaborating with over 280 law enforcement agencies globally.” As blockchain networks continue to expand, the initiative stands as a proof of concept that industry collaboration can effectively counter criminal activity, setting a precedent for how digital finance can self-regulate without compromising innovation.

While the leading altcoin notably showed a significantly volatile price action, bearish sentiments reigned supreme, resulting in a net 4.37% loss. Interestingly, popular expert Ali Martinez has highlighted a critical price level for Solana investors’ attention amid the current market uncertainty. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Calls Solana An ‘Explosive’ Two-Way Bet: Here’s Why Bitwise Chief Investment Office To Fly Or Crash? Solana Future Rests On Key Price Point In a recent X post, Martinez dives into the present Solana market structure, highlighting several potential developments tied to the $180 price level. Notably, the daily chart reveals that Solana has been strictly trading in an ascending channel since May 2025, with zero deviations recorded. Importantly, the altcoin has been moving near the lower boundary of this channel, currently around $180, which acts as a pivotal support. This price point also aligns with the 200-day simple moving average, thereby reinforcing its validity. Furthermore, on-chain data from the leading analytics platform Glassnode shows that 24.5 million SOL were purchased at this level, reflecting a high market demand that will likely prevent further price incursion upon a retest. Looking at Martinez’s analysis, a consistent price hold above $180 retains the validity of the ascending channel and presents a setup for a potential price gain to $230, with further price targets at $290. However, if an overwhelming bearish pressure pushes Solana below $180, investors can expect a further decline to around $115, while a potential crash to $50 is also feasible. Therefore, Solana’s behavior at $180 presents a possible 56% gain or 72% loss from current market prices.

Despite the daily rebound, its monthly performance remains negative, with a 14.27% decline highlighting the broader weakness seen in the last week. In a notable development, Bitwise launched the first-ever Solana Spot ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) this week, marking a major milestone for altcoins. The achievement was quickly followed by Grayscale, which introduced its own Grayscale Solana Trust, further signaling growing institutional interest in Solana. This week’s events represent a significant step toward broadening institutional access to Solana and other altcoins, paving the way for deeper market participation beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to SoSoValue data, the two newly launched ETFs have already attracted strong demand, recording $154.73 million in net inflows and $439.97 million in net assets within the first three trading days. Meanwhile, several other Solana-linked ETFs are reportedly in the pipeline, including the Canary Solana ETF, VanEck Solana Trust, and CoinShares Solana ETF, all currently awaiting SEC approval.

Investors should always verify the official contract, avoid importing tokens from third-party sources, and monitor their dashboard for updates. This process upholds transparency, prevents fraud, and aligns with blockchain security standards. Once vesting activates, tokens display properly, reminding investors that patience is built into the presale’s structure for fairness and protection. Hedera ($HBAR): Volatility Meets Long-Term Promise Hedera (HBAR) fell 7.91% to $0.1929 in the past 24 hours as profit-taking swept through smart-contract networks. Despite the pullback, Hedera’s enterprise partnerships in tokenized finance and AI integration continue to drive long-term optimism. Analysts see the correction as a strategic entry point for investors focused on its hybrid-governance model. Built on a DAG-based framework, Hedera delivers superior speed, scalability, and efficiency compared to conventional blockchains, positioning it as a leading platform for institutional-grade applications and real-world digital asset infrastructure. HBAR’s short-term volatility contrasts with the steady, structured momentum seen among the top cryptos to invest in today. While Hedera’s fundamentals and enterprise partnerships appeal to institutional players, presales like BullZilla attract retail investors chasing high-growth potential. BullZilla’s design, rooted in community engagement, deflationary tokenomics, and timed scarcity, creates momentum that rewards early conviction. This balance between innovation and hype positions BullZilla as a retail favorite, offering the kind of explosive upside traditional corporate-focused projects rarely match. Frequently Asked Questions About Hedera Why is Hedera’s price fluctuating recently? Hedera’s volatility stems from investor rotations between enterprise-focused and meme-driven assets. Temporary corrections follow rapid expansions, creating accumulation opportunities for those who value speed, stability, and corporate-backed innovation. Does Hedera still have long-term potential? Yes. With strong enterprise partners and scalable technology, Hedera remains a serious contender for blockchain adoption. Short-term price swings don’t affect its steady progress toward mainstream tokenization and institutional blockchain integration. Conclusion Among the top cryptos to invest in today , three projects dominate for distinct reasons. Bitcoin anchors market confidence as the leading store of value, while Hedera drives enterprise adoption through its fast, scalable architecture.

The world of digital assets is always buzzing, and among the many contenders, Aptos has emerged as a significant player, often hailed as a ‘Solana killer’ or a ‘next-generation Layer 1 blockchain’. Investors and enthusiasts alike are constantly asking: what does the future hold for Aptos? Our comprehensive Aptos price prediction for 2025, 2026, and all the way to 2030 will delve deep into market dynamics, technological advancements, and expert insights to answer the burning question: will APT price hit $25? Understanding Aptos: The Layer 1 Contender Aptos is a relatively new but highly ambitious Layer 1 blockchain designed for scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability. It emerged from the ashes of Meta’s (formerly Facebook’s) Diem project, inheriting much of its foundational technology and a team of seasoned engineers. The core premise of Aptos revolves around addressing the scalability and security issues that plague many existing blockchains, aiming to provide a robust platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3 innovation. Origins and Team: Developed by Aptos Labs, co-founded by former Meta employees who worked on Diem. This experienced team brings a wealth of knowledge in building secure and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Move Language: Aptos utilizes the Move programming language, a Rust-based language designed for secure asset management. Move’s strong typing and resource modules are intended to prevent common vulnerabilities found in smart contracts. High Throughput: The Aptos blockchain boasts parallel transaction execution, allowing multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. This design choice aims to achieve significantly higher transaction per second (TPS) rates compared to many competitors. Scalability and Upgradeability: Aptos is built with modularity in mind, making it easier to upgrade and adapt to future technological advancements without requiring network forks. Market Dynamics and Current Performance of Aptos Coin Since its mainnet launch, the Aptos coin (APT) has experienced significant volatility, a common trait in the cryptocurrency market. Its initial listing was met with high anticipation, followed by price fluctuations influenced by broader market trends, investor sentiment, and specific ecosystem developments. Understanding its current market position is crucial for any forward-looking analysis. The APT token serves multiple purposes within the Aptos ecosystem: Network Fees: Users pay transaction fees in APT. Staking: APT holders can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards. Governance: Token holders have the right to participate in governance decisions, influencing the future direction of the Aptos blockchain. Recent performance indicators for APT include its market capitalization, daily trading volume, and price movements relative to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These metrics provide a snapshot of investor interest and liquidity, which are vital for short-term price action. External factors such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall crypto market sentiment also play a substantial role in APT’s trajectory. Key Drivers for Aptos Growth: What Powers the APT Price? Several fundamental factors underpin the potential for growth in the APT price . These drivers are critical for understanding whether Aptos can achieve its ambitious goals and deliver substantial returns to investors. Technological Superiority: The Move programming language offers enhanced security and flexibility, attracting developers concerned with smart contract vulnerabilities. Aptos’s parallel execution engine (Block-STM) promises high transaction throughput and low latency, essential for mass adoption of dApps. Robust Ecosystem Development: The growth of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and gaming projects on Aptos is a key indicator of its utility and adoption. Partnerships with established Web2 companies or other blockchain projects can significantly expand its user base and utility. A thriving ecosystem creates demand for the APT token. Developer Activity and Support: A strong and active developer community is the lifeblood of any blockchain. Aptos Labs’ commitment to developer tools, grants, and hackathons encourages innovation and builds a diverse range of applications on the platform. More developers mean more innovation and use cases for the Aptos coin . Scalability and User Experience: As the crypto space aims for mainstream adoption, user experience becomes paramount. Aptos’s focus on low transaction costs and fast finality can attract users seeking efficient and affordable blockchain interactions, making it competitive against older, slower networks. Strategic Partnerships and Integrations: Collaborations with major institutions, enterprises, or other blockchain networks can significantly boost Aptos’s visibility and utility. These partnerships often bring new users and capital into the ecosystem, directly impacting the Aptos price prediction . Challenges and Headwinds for APT: What Could Hinder Growth? While the potential for Aptos is significant, it also faces considerable challenges that could impact its future growth and the ability of the APT price to reach higher valuations. Intense Competition: The Layer 1 blockchain space is highly competitive, with established giants like Ethereum and emerging challengers like Solana, Avalanche, and Near Protocol. Aptos must continually innovate and differentiate itself to carve out a significant market share. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile assets. Macroeconomic factors, global regulatory changes, and sudden shifts in investor sentiment can lead to rapid price swings, making long-term predictions challenging. Tokenomics Concerns: Initial concerns regarding APT’s token distribution and significant unlock schedules have created selling pressure at various points. While transparent, these unlocks can impact supply-demand dynamics. Security Risks: Despite the Move language’s focus on security, no blockchain is entirely immune to exploits or bugs. A major security breach could severely damage trust and impact the Aptos coin ‘s reputation and value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unfavorable regulations in key markets could hinder adoption and growth for Aptos and the broader crypto industry. Aptos Price Prediction 2025: Navigating the Bull/Bear Cycle Looking ahead to 2025, the Aptos price prediction is heavily influenced by the broader cryptocurrency market cycle, often correlated with Bitcoin’s halving events. If the market enters a bullish phase, fueled by institutional adoption and increased retail interest, Aptos could see substantial gains. Conversely, a prolonged bear market could limit its upward potential. Factors that will be crucial for APT in 2025 include: Ecosystem Maturity: The number and quality of dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT projects built on Aptos. A robust ecosystem drives utility and demand for APT. Technological Milestones: Successful implementation of roadmap features, performance upgrades, and security enhancements. Macroeconomic Environment: Interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability can either encourage or deter investment in risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Considering these factors, a realistic Aptos price prediction for 2025 could see APT trading within a range, with potential highs significantly above current levels if market conditions are favorable. Aptos (APT) Price Prediction 2025 Scenario Low Price Average Price High Price Bullish Market $10.00 $15.00 $20.00+ Moderate Growth $7.00 $9.00 $12.00 Bearish Market $4.00 $6.00 $8.00 Aptos Price Prediction 2026-2027: Mid-Term Momentum and Crypto Price Prediction As we move into 2026 and 2027, the mid-term outlook for Aptos will depend on its ability to sustain growth and adapt to the evolving blockchain landscape. The overall crypto price prediction for the market will also play a pivotal role. By this time, Aptos should have a more established ecosystem, with a clearer picture of its adoption rates and competitive positioning. Key considerations for this period include: Sustainable User Growth: How many active users and developers Aptos can attract and retain. Interoperability Solutions: The ability of Aptos to connect with other blockchains, enhancing its utility and reach. Innovation Pace: Continuous development of new features, upgrades, and solutions to stay ahead of competitors. If Aptos continues to deliver on its promises of scalability and security, and the broader crypto price prediction remains positive, we could see APT consolidating its position as a top-tier Layer 1 blockchain. This could lead to a steady appreciation in its value, potentially pushing it into double-digit territory consistently. Will APT Price Hit $25? A Deep Dive into APT’s Potential The question on many investors’ minds is whether the APT price can realistically reach the $25 mark. Achieving this target would require a combination of strong fundamental growth, sustained market bullishness, and significant ecosystem expansion. Let’s explore what it would take. For APT to reach $25, several conditions would likely need to be met: Significant DApp Adoption: Aptos would need to host a multitude of successful dApps, attracting millions of users and substantial total value locked (TVL) in its DeFi ecosystem. This would drive demand for APT for transaction fees and staking. Market Leadership: Aptos would need to establish itself as a clear leader or a strong contender in the Layer 1 space, potentially challenging the dominance of networks like Solana or even gaining ground on Ethereum in specific use cases. Broader Crypto Bull Market: A general bullish trend across the cryptocurrency market, potentially driven by institutional investment and positive regulatory developments, would provide a favorable environment for APT’s growth. Strong Community and Developer Support: Continued growth in its developer community and an engaged user base are crucial for long-term viability and innovation. While ambitious, reaching $25 is not an impossible feat, especially given Aptos’s technological foundations and experienced team. However, it requires consistent execution and favorable market conditions. Aptos Coin Future: Long-Term Outlook to 2030 The long-term outlook for the Aptos coin extending to 2030 is where its true potential, or limitations, will become clear. By this time, the blockchain industry itself is expected to be far more mature, with clearer regulatory frameworks and potentially widespread adoption. Aptos’s success will hinge on its ability to remain relevant and competitive in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. In the long run, Aptos aims to be a foundational layer for Web3, supporting a vast array of applications from finance to gaming and social media.

If Aptos can achieve significant global adoption and become a go-to platform for developers and users, its value could appreciate considerably. Key elements for its long-term success include: Continuous Innovation: Staying ahead of technological trends and offering cutting-edge solutions. Security and Stability: Maintaining a robust and secure network free from major incidents. Global Reach: Expanding its presence in diverse geographical markets and user segments. Aptos 2030: Charting the Path to Mass Adoption Envisioning Aptos 2030 involves imagining a world where blockchain technology is seamlessly integrated into everyday life. For Aptos to thrive in such a future, it must not only maintain its technological edge but also achieve mass adoption.

Allegations Of Political Payoff According to Senator Chris Murphy, Coinbase gave $46 million to support US President Donald Trump and that the payment was tied to regulatory decisions, including the handling of an SEC lawsuit against the exchange. Murphy said the money included a large donation for Trump’s inauguration. He framed this as an example of what he called “Trump’s corruption factory.” Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, answered quickly on X, calling the charges “misinformed” and “false.” He told Murphy to “do your homework,” and said Coinbase has pushed for clearer rules rather than favors . Grewal argued that the problem was not with the company’s actions but with how the SEC dealt with the case. He pointed out that Coinbase was allowed to go public and that a federal court later found the SEC’s denial of Coinbase’s rulemaking petition “arbitrary and capricious.” Here’s an example of how Trump’s corruption factory works. 1. Coinbase put $46M into elections to help Trump allies.2. Sends him a huge check for his inauguration.3. Trump drops SEC lawsuit against Coinbase.4. Trump demands big donation from Coinbase for ballroom. Done. https://t.co/kLstTHquty — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) October 30, 2025 Coinbase Pushes Back Coinbase has highlighted its recent business moves while denying wrongdoing. Based on reports , the firm announced a tie-up with Citigroup to make stablecoin payments easier for clients. What was corrupt was allowing us to go public “in the public interest” and then suing us. What was corrupt was what the Third Circuit held was an arbitrary and capricious denial of our request to to get basic rules for crypto. What was corrupt was a campaign decried by another… https://t.co/mla5emrEfI — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) October 31, 2025 It also agreed to work with Figment to expand staking services for Solana, Cardano, and Sui networks. Those partnerships were presented as proof the company is focused on growth and compliance. Grewal said regulatory uncertainty has hurt the industry more than any single firm. He blamed the SEC’s prior approach for creating confusion, and he used the court ruling to underline that point. At the same time, he insisted the company did not seek political favors. Legal Critics Weigh In John Deaton, a lawyer known for representing XRP holders, joined the criticism of the SEC. He said it was inconsistent to let Coinbase list publicly and then later claim some of its services were unlawful. Deaton accused former SEC Chair Gary Gensler of following political pressure to push an “anti-crypto agenda.” He also noted Senator Elizabeth Warren’s hardline stance toward crypto. Deaton argued that singling out Coinbase while ignoring the earlier IPO approval suggested selective enforcement. Industry reaction has been mixed. Supporters of the exchange say the charges are politically driven. Skeptics want clearer evidence about donations and direct influence on regulatory choices. Public records on campaign giving and event donations were referenced by both sides during the dispute, but a clear trail linking the $46 million claim to regulatory outcomes was not provided in public comments.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-is-about-to-explode-heres-why/,"Crypto markets are heating up again. Analysts say a powerful move could be near. Bitcoin’s strength has reawakened altcoin sentiment, and XRP appears to be coiling for a major breakout. Institutional Momentum Builds Over the past month, institutional inflows into digital assets have surged. CoinShares data confirms strong capital movement into spot Bitcoin ETFs. Historically, these inflows create secondary waves for altcoins like XRP once Bitcoin begins its run. XRP’s correlation with Bitcoin has been consistent across every major market cycle . When Bitcoin breaks through resistance, XRP typically follows suit, potentially amplifying its own gains. This pattern is becoming clear again as traders rotate into assets with regulatory clarity. #XRP IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE! pic.twitter.com/tTh5dSmU5i — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 31, 2025 Bull Winkle’s Bold Forecast In a recent video shared on X, analyst Ripple Bull Winkle made an emphatic declaration. He said, “CNBC just said the quiet part out loud.” According to him, mainstream acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s strength signals that institutional positioning is already complete. He explained, “By the time you hear it on TV, the big money is already positioned.” Bull Winkle believes that this lag between institutional entry and public awareness is key to identifying the start of explosive phases. Bitcoin’s Signal, XRP’s Reaction Bull Winkle noted that Bitcoin’s rally typically sparks a follow-up move for XRP. He said, “When Bitcoin rips, XRP follows every single cycle. It’s a second wave play.” This observation reflects historical data. XRP typically surges weeks after Bitcoin establishes a new leg higher. Traders see this pattern as a window for outsized returns once the broader market turns risk-on. The ETF Effect and Market Coiling Bull Winkle pointed to ETF inflows as a structural catalyst. “You combine that with the ETF inflows,” he said, “you can feel the pressure building. This isn’t speculation anymore.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF products increase market liquidity and institutional access . That additional liquidity often fuels sustained rallies once momentum begins. Analysts observe similarities between current market conditions and those before XRP’s 2017 and 2021 surges. A New Market Era Regulatory clarity around Ripple’s operations has also strengthened investor confidence. With the SEC case finally behind Ripple , large entities can now accumulate XRP with less risk exposure. Bull Winkle concluded, “This is a new era. It’s loading. It’s coiled. It is about to break out.” His conviction echoes the growing sentiment across the crypto community that XRP’s next leg higher may be imminent. Outlook While optimism is high, traders are urged to stay cautious. Market volatility remains extreme, and parabolic advances can retrace quickly. Still, with Bitcoin breaking higher and institutional interest intensifying, XRP’s setup looks increasingly bullish. Momentum, liquidity, and psychology all point toward the same outcome. As Bull Winkle summarized, “It’s about to snap.” Whether that snap becomes the long-awaited XRP explosion could be decided soon.

Optimism is rising over Bitwise’s XRP spot ETF, which could draw institutional inflows, while traders remain cautious ahead of Ripple’s 1 billion-token escrow unlock on November 1. The balance between ETF-driven optimism and supply pressure may determine whether XRP continues its climb or faces a short-term pullback. XRP Gains Institutional Attention as Bitwise Nears Spot ETF Launch XRP continues to capture institutional interest as Bitwise moves closer to launching its highly anticipated XRP-spot ETF. The asset manager recently updated its filing to include a NYSE listing and a 0.34% management fee, signaling readiness for launch once regulatory approval is granted. Bitwise just updated their XRP ETF filing to include exchange (NYSE) and fee of 0.34%, which are typically the last boxes to check. Amendment #4. pic.twitter.com/BUnkasSQY5 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2025 Market analysts note that such updates typically occur in the final stages before trading approval, suggesting Bitwise is well-positioned for a potential green light. If approved, the ETF could attract significant institutional inflows, boosting liquidity and market depth for XRP. Additionally, Armada Acquisition Corp. II has introduced a $1 billion strategy aimed at expanding institutional adoption of XRP, while Virtu Financial disclosed $63 million in crypto holdings, further reinforcing confidence in digital assets. XRP has gained over 1% in 24 hours, maintaining its footing above $2.50, with analysts eyeing $2.73 as the next resistance level. XRP Community Divided Over Viral $10,000 Price Predictions The XRP community has been abuzz after a viral post by @XRPracers claimed that Ripple’s Strategic Reserve was activated and that XRP could surge to between $10,000 and $35,000. The post, which cited predictions from Value Capital, spread rapidly across X (formerly Twitter), stirring both excitement and skepticism among investors. While some enthusiasts see the projection as validation of XRP’s long-term potential, most experts dismiss it as highly unrealistic. XRP currently trades near $2.50 with a market cap of roughly $150 billion, meaning even a $10,000 valuation would require a near-impossible capital inflow. #XRP Strategic Reserve Institutional liquidity ignited. Targets: $10K–$35K. The wealth shift has begun. pic.twitter.com/v8Rjd8Lyfq — Gigitalk | John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 30, 2025 Still, optimism remains supported by Ripple’s partial legal victory against the SEC and progress in institutional partnerships, which analysts believe could strengthen real-world utility. While exaggerated predictions fuel online debate, they also underscore the growing confidence that XRP could play a larger role in global payments and on-chain liquidity. Ripple’s November Escrow Unlock: Short-Term Pressure Ahead Ripple is set to release 1 billion XRP from escrow on November 1, valued at about $2.5 billion at current prices. This scheduled unlock is part of Ripple’s monthly routine to maintain ecosystem liquidity and transparency. Historically, 70–80% of the unlocked XRP is re-locked, with only 200–300 million tokens entering circulation for operations and partnerships. RIPPLE TO UNLOCK 1 BILLION XRP TOMORROW On November 1, #Ripple will release 1 BILLION $XRP from escrow — worth roughly $2.49B at current prices. Usually, only 200–300M XRP get used or sold, with the rest re-locked. pic.twitter.com/97lvA20qXa — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) October 31, 2025 Because the process is public and predictable, analysts expect limited price disruption. However, short-term traders often react cautiously, anticipating minor volatility as liquidity adjusts. The release coincides with Ripple’s expanding ecosystem initiatives, including its Evernorth $1 billion listing and collaborations with gumi Inc., which may offset any temporary selling pressure. XRP Price Prediction: Triangle Pattern Signals Volatility On the daily chart, XRP trades around $2.50, facing strong resistance near $2.72. Technical indicators reveal a symmetrical triangle breakdown, transitioning into a bearish continuation setup. Since mid-July, XRP has formed lower highs beneath the descending trendline, showing fading momentum. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Recent candlestick formations, including spinning tops and Doji candles, indicate market indecision. The 20-day EMA remains tilted downward, adding to selling pressure, while the RSI at 45 sits below the neutral 50 mark. A dip under 40 would signal deeper bearish momentum. Trade Setup Entry: Sell below $2.26 (breakdown confirmation) Stop-Loss: Above $2.72 (trendline resistance) Targets: $2.02 and $1.77 If XRP reclaims $2.72 on strong buying volume and forms a bullish engulfing candle, it could invalidate the bearish setup and open a path toward $3.15. For now, momentum favors sellers, and traders should watch for confirmation before positioning for the next move. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.2 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013195 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Major altcoins, such as Cardano and Pepe Coin, are building up their strength, while nascent DeFi projects like Remittix are increasingly in the crosshairs of institutional and community interest. According to analysts, the decline in Bitcoin's dominance could mark the beginning of an altcoin season, where tokens are demonstrating more significant innovation at lower valuations and tend to outperform. Bitcoin's Momentum to Be Tested Bitcoin remains the market's anchor, but signals are pointing to a probable cooling phase. The asset changes hands for $109,083.64, representing a 1.95% increase in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $2.17 trillion. Its daily trading volume is, however, down 11.29% at $66.34 billion. In the past, dips in volume after prolonged rallies often preceded sector rotations - events where traders shifted capital toward undervalued altcoins. While Bitcoin headlined, this trend may indicate a more sober diversification into other digital assets. Coins such as Cardano and Pepe Coin, as well as new projects with a DeFi focus, are gaining liquidity, which suggests fresh demand for growth beyond the current range of Bitcoin. Cardano and Pepe Coin Show Early Signs of Rotation Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.6104, up 0.77% over the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $21.88 billion. Its trading volume, now at $1.01 billion, has dipped 25.22%, reflecting consolidation before a potential breakout. Cardano continues to attract developer activity, with upgrades in smart contract scalability contributing to optimism around ADA’s subsequent rally. Another top altcoin under $1, Pepe Coin (PEPE), continues to show strong community momentum. Currently trading for $0.000056499, PEPE has gained 0.6% over the last day, with a market cap of $2.72 billion. However, volume has decreased 39.08% to $414.31 million. Analysts say that accumulation patterns indicate long-term holders are preparing for an upward phase once Bitcoin's dominance starts to decline. Remittix Gains Traction as Utility-Driven DeFi Project Among altcoins, where speculation is returning, Remittix stands out for its real-world use case. At $0.1166 per token, Remittix has already raised more than $27.7 million in private funding, confirming strong institutional interest in its PayFi solution, which bridges cryptocurrency directly to traditional banking. The project offers crypto-to-fiat transfers across more than 30 countries, connecting decentralized and centralized finance. Remittix is also making rapid ecosystem progress — its Wallet Beta Testing is now open to iOS users, and the team recently revealed future CEX listings on BitMart and LBank, expanding accessibility. Moreover, Remittix is now verified by CertiK and ranked #1 globally for pre-launch tokens, further boosting trust among investors.. Why Remittix Is Standing Out ● Global reach with real crypto-to-bank transfers● Over $27.7M raised in private funding● Ranked #1 pre-launch project by CertiK● Wallet Beta is now live for testers● $250,000 Giveaway + 50% Bonus active via Remittix.io Altcoin Season on the Horizon With Bitcoin’s dominance likely to soften, Cardano, Remittix, and Pepe Coin appear positioned to benefit from renewed capital flow into high-growth digital assets. While established tokens may lead the early phase, innovative projects like Remittix — combining DeFi technology, cross-border utility, and strong community incentives — could define the next stage of the market cycle. For traders seeking exposure to the next 100x crypto or best DeFi projects of 2025, this rotation period could mark the most critical window before widespread adoption takes hold.

Amidst the ongoing government shutdown, Bessent shared a message on social media platform X, using the phrase “Bitcoin never shuts down,” highlighting the network’s uninterrupted operation and offering a subtle critique of Democrats, saying, “Some lawmakers could learn something from this.” “17 years after the white paper was published, the Bitcoin network is still up and running and more resilient than ever. Bitcoin will never shut down.” Related News: BREAKING: Thodex Founder Faruk Fatih Özer Found Dead in Prison October 31st holds special significance in the cryptocurrency world. The nine-page Bitcoin white paper, published in 2008 by someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, laid the foundation for a decentralized digital currency system. This document ushered in a new era in the digital economy by demonstrating the possibility of peer-to-peer transactions without the need for financial intermediaries. Since then, the Bitcoin network has operated without interruption since its launch in January 2009. Bessent's statement is being viewed not only as an anniversary celebration but also as a policy signal. Following President Donald Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act in July, Bessent described stablecoins as a “revolution of digital finance” and argued that an internet-based dollar system could both strengthen the US's reserve currency status and expand global payment access. This statement was seen as a demonstration of the Treasury's positive approach to digital financial infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

Indeed, Bitcoin experienced significant volatility throughout October, ultimately ending the month just slightly above the $110,000 support zone. Despite this mixed performance, artificial intelligence insights from ChatGPT suggest that the asset is likely to post moderate gains through November, potentially reclaiming the $120,000 resistance level. Overall, at press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,071, showing signs of stabilization after a 3.6% decline in October. The market has been consolidating above key support levels between $107,000 and $109,000, with traders defending the zone amid neutral-to-bullish momentum indicators. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding the price outlook, ChatGPT analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s short-term direction will depend on whether it can break past the next resistance range between $115,500 and $118,000. A decisive move above that level could trigger strong buying momentum, potentially driving prices toward $124,800 to $132,400, in line with Fibonacci extension targets derived from prior market swings. Despite a mild slowdown in ETF inflows, institutional investors are maintaining their positions, and on-chain data shows a steady rise in wallets holding over one Bitcoin, signals pointing to long-term accumulation rather than distribution. The Fear & Greed Index remains near 45, reflecting cautious optimism among market participants. Bitcoin price levels to watch AI-based modeling assigns a 50% probability to a base-case scenario in which Bitcoin ends November between $118,000 and $122,000, supported by seasonal strength and steady inflows. A more bullish outcome, with prices reaching $126,000 to $132,000, carries a 45% probability, assuming a breakout above resistance and renewed appetite for risk assets. The bearish scenario, with prices retreating to the $102,000–$108,000 range, is considered unlikely at just 5%. This projection aligns with Bitcoin’s historical November performance, which has typically delivered median gains of about 11%.

The exchange-traded fund seeks to track the market price of JitoSOL, a Solana-based liquid staking token, less operating expenses. The filing marks another step toward expanding regulated access to Solana’s ecosystem through financial instruments designed for institutional and retail investors. VanEck’s Plan to Launch JitoSOL ETF The proposed VanEck JitoSOL ETF aims to hold JitoSOL directly, reflecting its daily market value as reported by the MarketVector Index. The trust will allow authorized participants to create and redeem shares in 25,000-share blocks, known as “baskets,” using either cash or in-kind transactions. In-kind transactions involve delivering JitoSOL directly to the trust, while cash subscriptions will be converted into JitoSOL through third-party liquidity providers. Besides, VanEck’s structure mirrors earlier filings for spot Solana ETFs but differs by focusing on the yield-bearing nature of JitoSOL. Each token represents staked SOL plus accumulated rewards, enabling investors to gain exposure to Solana’s staking yields without managing validator operations. The trust will not register under the Investment Company Act or the Commodity Exchange Act, as it intends to function purely as a digital asset trust. Solana Price Holds Above Crucial Support Solana’s market activity aligns with this regulatory milestone. The token trades around $186 , with a 24-hour volume exceeding $4.2 billion. Despite a minor 1.12% daily drop, analysts expect renewed strength as long as SOL maintains support above $180. According to analyst Ali Martinez, the 200-day simple moving average continues to act as dynamic support. He believes that sustained buying pressure could trigger a rebound toward $240 or even $300. Elliott Wave Pattern Suggests a New Bullish Phase Source: X Technical strategist NekoZ describes the ongoing pattern as part of a larger Elliott Wave structure. He suggests that Solana has completed its corrective phase and is entering an impulsive primary trend. The analysis points to $295 as the Wave 3 target, followed by a potential surge beyond $380 in Wave 5. Consequently, traders viewing current dips as opportunities may benefit if Solana confirms higher lows in upcoming sessions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-01 13:19:07

According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin closed the month down 3.7%, while Ethereum fell 7%. For the first time since 2018, Bitcoin’s famous “Uptober” trend came to an end, breaking a seven-year streak of positive October results. In Bitcoin’s history, there have now been only three “red” Octobers — 2014, 2018, and 2025. Throughout October, Bitcoin faced several sharp downturns triggered by macroeconomic pressure. On October 10–11, the asset slumped after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. Following a short recovery, Bitcoin fell again after a hawkish speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who signaled that interest rate cuts might not come in December 2025. By October 30–31, the market had stabilized, and Bitcoin traded sideways. Ethereum Struggles to Recover For Ethereum, October marked the second consecutive month of decline. Overall, Ethereum has ended October in the red four times, with its largest drop — 16.83% — recorded in 2016. Ethereum’s performance mirrored Bitcoin’s, with the same macroeconomic pressures weighing on its price. The coin has yet to reclaim the $4,500 level it traded near before the October 10–11 sell-off. Macro Tensions Keep Crypto Under Pressure The October downturn for both Bitcoin and Ethereum reflects renewed uncertainty in global markets. Analysts point to a mix of trade tensions, strong U.S. dollar performance, and cautious investor sentiment as key factors. Rising Treasury yields and expectations of a longer high-rate environment have also limited inflows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Despite the short-term pullback, several traders suggest accumulation zones may emerge if Bitcoin stabilizes above $66,000, setting up potential recovery momentum heading into Q4 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-01 13:19:16

This bold statement underscores a critical discussion in the crypto world: the inherent scarcity of Bitcoin and its profound implications for investors. Saylor’s insight urges us to look beyond daily price fluctuations and consider the fundamental economics that could shape Bitcoin’s future. What Exactly Drives the Fear of a Bitcoin Shortage? The concept of a Bitcoin shortage might sound alarming, but it’s rooted in the cryptocurrency’s design. Unlike traditional currencies that can be printed infinitely, Bitcoin has a strictly limited supply. Only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist, a cap programmed into its very protocol by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Fixed Supply: The absolute limit of 21 million coins ensures that Bitcoin is a deflationary asset by design. This hard cap makes it fundamentally different from fiat currencies. Halving Events: Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new Bitcoin is cut in half. This process, known as the ‘halving,’ reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, further tightening supply. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, significantly reducing new supply. Lost Coins: Millions of Bitcoins are permanently lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced hardware wallets, or accidental transfers to unrecoverable addresses. These lost coins effectively reduce the circulating supply, making the available Bitcoin shortage even more pronounced. Essentially, these factors combine to create an environment where demand could eventually outstrip the available supply, leading to a genuine scarcity. How Does Bitcoin Scarcity Impact Your Investment Strategy? Understanding the potential for a Bitcoin shortage is crucial for any investor looking at the long game. Scarcity often drives value, and Bitcoin is no exception. As more individuals and institutions recognize Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, demand naturally increases. Therefore, a limited supply combined with rising demand creates upward pressure on its price. Investors who hold Bitcoin for the long term, often referred to as ‘HODLers,’ are betting on this fundamental economic principle. Furthermore, the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, seen through spot ETFs and corporate treasury allocations, adds another layer of demand, potentially accelerating the perceived Bitcoin shortage . Consider these points: Value Appreciation: Historically, periods following halving events have seen significant price increases due to reduced supply. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ a safe haven asset that retains its value during economic uncertainty and inflation, further increasing its appeal. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is not a short-term trade but a generational asset, making the idea of future scarcity a core part of their investment thesis. Navigating the Future: Opportunities Amidst a Potential Bitcoin Shortage While the idea of a Bitcoin shortage might evoke a sense of urgency, it also highlights significant opportunities for informed investors. Preparing for such a scenario involves strategic planning and a deep understanding of the market dynamics. It’s not about panic buying, but about making deliberate, well-researched decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently investing a fixed amount over time can mitigate volatility and build a position steadily. Self-Custody: Taking control of your private keys ensures you truly own your Bitcoin, protecting it from third-party risks. This becomes even more critical in a world of increasing scarcity. Education: Staying informed about Bitcoin’s technology, market trends, and macroeconomic factors is paramount. Knowledge empowers better decision-making. However, challenges also exist. The path to widespread adoption and price stability is not without its hurdles, including regulatory uncertainties and market volatility. Ultimately, the potential for a Bitcoin shortage reinforces its unique position in the global financial landscape, presenting both compelling benefits and areas for careful consideration. Conclusion: Embracing the Scarcity Mindset Michael Saylor’s warning about a Bitcoin shortage serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s foundational principles. Its finite supply, combined with ever-increasing demand, paints a clear picture of a digital asset designed for long-term value appreciation. While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, understanding the economics of scarcity is vital for anyone participating in the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to mature, its inherent scarcity will likely remain a dominant narrative, shaping its trajectory and challenging traditional notions of wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does Michael Saylor mean by a ‘Bitcoin shortage’? Michael Saylor refers to the potential for demand to significantly outpace the available supply of Bitcoin due to its fixed cap of 21 million coins, leading to increased scarcity and potentially higher value. 2. How does Bitcoin’s halving contribute to its scarcity? Bitcoin halving events, occurring roughly every four years, cut the reward for mining new Bitcoins in half. This reduces the rate at which new coins enter circulation, thereby increasing the asset’s scarcity over time. 3. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin given its potential scarcity? Many financial experts and Bitcoin proponents argue that it’s not too late. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, driven by scarcity and increasing adoption, remains compelling for many investors. 4. What are the risks associated with investing in a scarce asset like Bitcoin? Investing in Bitcoin carries risks, including price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and potential security threats if not managed properly. However, its scarcity is often seen as a mitigating factor for long-term value. 5. How can investors prepare for a potential Bitcoin shortage? Investors can prepare by employing strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA), practicing self-custody of their assets, and continuously educating themselves about the market. These actions help build a resilient investment approach. 6. What is the ‘digital gold’ narrative in relation to Bitcoin scarcity? The ‘digital gold’ narrative positions Bitcoin as a store of value similar to physical gold, especially due to its scarcity and resistance to inflation. Both assets are seen as hedges against economic instability and currency devaluation. Enjoyed this deep dive into the fascinating world of Bitcoin scarcity and Michael Saylor’s urgent warning?

In his post, Stellar Rippler described Schwartz’s remarks as a “truth bomb” about how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) differs from other networks, emphasizing that most blockchains are designed for control, while the XRPL was built for freedom , with XRP at the center of the system. Schwartz contrasted two types of blockchain design philosophies: one that enables people to act as their own banks without interference, and another that allows centralized entities to control and tax user transactions. “Do you want to use a blockchain where people can be their own bank and no middlemen tax their transactions,” Schwartz wrote, adding that for those who value that kind of autonomy, “there’s XRP.” BREAKING: David Schwartz just dropped a truth bomb about the XRP Ledger vs Other Blockchains. Most chains are built for control, to let someone be the bank, set the rules, and tax your transactions. XRP Ledger? Truly Decentralized, where no middleman, government, or protocol… pic.twitter.com/O3GxpNhU1d — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) October 30, 2025 Built for Autonomy, Not Control Schwartz’s statement reinforced what Stellar Rippler argued about XRP Ledger. He emphasizes that the XRPL operates as one of the few truly decentralized financial infrastructures . Unlike most networks that rely on intermediaries to validate, freeze, or reverse transactions, XRPL’s design ensures that no authority can alter or restrict user access. It operates on a consensus mechanism that enables high-speed settlement without compromising user control. This provides a level of accessibility that extends across borders and regulatory environments. Schwartz explained that XRP can be accessed “by every account in every jurisdiction with no risk of default, freeze, or clawback.” This characteristic defines the asset as uniquely independent, making it suitable for both individual and institutional use without exposing participants to counterparty risk. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In other words, Ripple has no control over the XRPL , and its users do not depend on third parties to authorize or secure their holdings, which sets the network apart from chains that embed governance or financial controls into their protocols. Value Capture and Network Utility In addition to decentralization, Schwartz highlighted XRP’s built-in economic function within the ledger. He noted that XRP’s “special place on XRPL ensures that XRP will capture some of the value XRPL transactions generate.” Because all transaction fees and liquidity flows within the network operate through XRP, the asset naturally benefits from network activity. This mechanism ties the token’s value directly to ledger usage, allowing XRP to scale in relevance as transaction volume increases. For Stellar Rippler, this feature demonstrates why XRP remains central to Ripple’s broader strategy and ecosystem development. It is not merely a transactional asset but a bridge currency that reinforces the XRPL’s efficiency and self-sustaining economic model.

With a market cap of $467.7 billion, ETH remains the second-largest cryptocurrency, but its price action has tightened notably inside a symmetrical triangle pattern that’s been forming since mid-October. This setup reflects growing indecision as volatility compresses between key resistance at $4,255 and support around $3,680–$3,750. Buyers continue to defend the lower boundary, while sellers maintain control near the top. For now, the market is at a standstill, and traders are watching closely to see whether Ethereum’s next decisive move will tilt the balance higher or lower. Ethereum Technical Setup: Momentum Builds Ethereum price prediction remains neutral as ETH is trading sideways with in a symmetrical triangle pattern. Ethereum’s 20-period EMA has flattened, reflecting indecision among traders, while the RSI, hovering near 46, shows early signs of recovery from oversold conditions. Recent spinning tops and Doji candles point to short-term uncertainty, but the sequence of higher lows since September suggests that accumulation continues beneath the surface. A breakout above $4,030 could confirm bullish momentum, potentially driving prices toward $4,255 and, later, $4,536 —the next resistance zone. However, a break below $3,680 might invite fresh selling pressure, exposing downside targets at $3,509 and $3,356, which align with the broader ascending channel visible on higher timeframes. Ethereum Price Forecast: Bullish Bias Ahead Market participants see Ethereum’s current formation as a coiling spring—ready for a decisive move in November. Historically, symmetrical triangles preceding a breakout often lead to a 10–15% surge once confirmed. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If ETH sustains momentum above $4,030 with strong volume, it could pave the way for a rally toward the $5,000 psychological mark, a level last seen in early 2022. Conversely, failure to hold above $3,680 would signal weakness, likely prompting short-term consolidation before the next bullish leg. For active traders, maintaining flexibility is key—waiting for confirmation rather than prediction. With Ethereum’s volatility tightening, the coming breakout could shape the market’s tone for the rest of the month. Trade Setup Entry: Above $4,030 (confirmed breakout) Stop-Loss: Below $3,680 (trendline support) Targets: $4,255, $4,536, and $5,000 Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana?

Understanding Aave: A DeFi Powerhouse Before we dive into future price movements, it’s essential to understand what Aave is and its role in the broader crypto landscape. Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. Essentially, it facilitates peer-topeer lending without intermediaries, offering a transparent and efficient way to earn interest on deposits or access liquidity by collateralizing digital assets. The protocol’s native token, AAVE, serves multiple functions: it’s a governance token, allowing holders to vote on key proposals, and it also acts as collateral within the system, offering reduced fees and other benefits. Aave began its journey as ETHLend in 2017, evolving into the robust Aave protocol we know today. Its innovation in flash loans – uncollateralized loans taken and repaid within a single blockchain transaction – revolutionized the DeFi space, showcasing the protocol’s commitment to pushing boundaries. This continuous innovation is a core driver behind its potential growth and influences every Aave price prediction . AAVE’s Journey: A Historical Overview AAVE has experienced a remarkable journey since its inception. From its early days as ETHLend, the project has demonstrated resilience and adaptability. The transition to Aave brought significant upgrades, including stable rate loans and the introduction of its native token. Like many cryptocurrencies, AAVE has seen periods of explosive growth, driven by DeFi booms, and periods of correction, influenced by broader market downturns. Key milestones: 2017: Launch of ETHLend, the precursor to Aave. 2020: Rebranding to Aave and launch of Aave V1, introducing key features like flash loans. 2021: Aave V2 launch, bringing further improvements in gas efficiency and collateral types.

Competition: The DeFi lending space is competitive, with protocols like Compound and MakerDAO. Aave’s ability to innovate and maintain its market share against rivals is key. Overall Crypto Market Sentiment: AAVE, like most altcoins, is often influenced by the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bull runs in the broader market tend to pull AAVE prices up, while bear markets can exert downward pressure. Understanding these intertwined factors is fundamental to forming a realistic Aave forecast and investment strategy. Aave Price Prediction 2025: Is $500 Realistic? The question on many investors’ minds is: can AAVE reach $500 by 2025? This ambitious target requires significant market momentum and continued growth within the DeFi sector. For AAVE to hit $500, several bullish catalysts would need to align. Bullish Scenario: If the broader cryptocurrency market enters another bull cycle, fueled by institutional adoption and increased retail interest, Aave could be a prime beneficiary. The continued expansion of its V3 protocol, successful cross-chain integrations, and new partnerships could significantly increase its TVL and user base. A growing demand for DeFi lending services, combined with Aave’s leading position, could push its price upwards. Regulatory clarity, particularly in major economic regions, would also provide a tailwind, legitimizing DeFi in the eyes of traditional finance. Bearish Scenario: Conversely, a prolonged crypto winter, unexpected regulatory crackdowns, or major security exploits within the DeFi space could hinder AAVE’s growth. Intense competition from new protocols or a failure to innovate could also limit its upside potential. While $500 is an ambitious target, a strong bull market could make it achievable. However, investors must remain aware of the risks.

Potential AAVE Price Ranges for 2027-2030: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2027 $200 $300 $450 2028 $250 $380 $600 2029 $300 $450 $750 2030 $400 $600 $1000+ Key Factors Driving Aave Forecast: What to Watch To make an informed Aave forecast , it’s crucial to keep an eye on several key indicators and developments: Total Value Locked (TVL): This metric represents the total capital deposited into the Aave protocol. A rising TVL indicates increasing user confidence and adoption, which often correlates with a positive AAVE price trend. Ecosystem Growth and Partnerships: Aave’s expansion into new blockchain networks, collaborations with other DeFi projects, and integration with traditional finance entities can significantly boost its utility and demand. Technological Advancements: Continuous upgrades, improved capital efficiency, new collateral options, and enhanced security features make Aave more attractive to users and investors. The evolution of Aave V3 and future iterations will be pivotal. Regulatory Developments: The stance of global regulators on DeFi and cryptocurrencies will shape the environment in which Aave operates. Favorable regulations can accelerate adoption, while restrictive ones can create headwinds. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Activity: As a DAO, Aave’s future is shaped by its community. Active and thoughtful governance proposals, leading to beneficial protocol upgrades, are positive signs. Monitoring these factors will provide a clearer picture of the ongoing health and growth potential for Aave. The Pivotal Role of DeFi Lending in AAVE’s Future Aave’s core offering, DeFi lending , is not just a feature; it’s the bedrock of its value proposition and a major driver for its long-term potential. As the demand for transparent, permissionless, and efficient financial services grows, Aave is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this trend. Why is DeFi lending so important for Aave? Fundamental Utility: Aave provides a fundamental financial service – borrowing and lending – that is essential in any economy, traditional or decentralized. Yield Generation: Lenders can earn passive income on their crypto assets, attracting capital to the protocol. Capital Efficiency: Borrowers can access liquidity without selling their assets, leveraging their crypto holdings for other opportunities. Innovation: Features like flash loans demonstrate Aave’s ability to innovate within the lending space, creating unique financial primitives not possible in traditional finance. Institutional Interest: The emergence of Aave Arc, a permissioned pool for institutions, indicates a growing interest from traditional finance in regulated DeFi lending, which could bring significant capital to the protocol. The strength and evolution of Aave’s DeFi lending capabilities will directly influence its market dominance and the value of its AAVE token in the coming years. Challenges and Risks for Aave Despite its potential, Aave faces several challenges and risks that investors should consider: Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: While Aave’s code is regularly audited, smart contract risks are inherent in DeFi. Exploits could lead to significant loss of funds and damage to reputation. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear global regulatory frameworks for DeFi poses a risk. Future regulations could impact Aave’s operations or even its legality in certain jurisdictions. Intense Competition: The DeFi lending space is crowded. New protocols with innovative features or lower fees could emerge, challenging Aave’s market share. Market Volatility: The broader crypto market is highly volatile. A significant downturn could impact AAVE’s price, regardless of its fundamental strength. Liquidity Risks: While Aave aims for high liquidity, extreme market conditions could lead to liquidity crunches, affecting borrowing and lending operations. Understanding these risks is crucial for any balanced investment perspective. Expert Insights and Analyst Opinions Crypto analysts generally hold a positive long-term outlook for Aave, citing its robust technology, strong community, and pioneering role in DeFi. Many believe that as decentralized finance continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, Aave is well-positioned to remain a leading protocol. While specific price targets vary, the consensus often points to a gradual appreciation, punctuated by periods of significant growth during bull markets. The innovative spirit of the Aave team and its consistent delivery on roadmap milestones are frequently highlighted as reasons for optimism. However, analysts also caution about market volatility and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead of the competition. Is AAVE a Good Investment? Actionable Insights Deciding whether AAVE is a good investment depends on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and belief in the future of DeFi.

Negotiations are said to be in their final stages, with the transaction expected to close by late 2025 or early 2026. BVNK, a London-based firm, builds stablecoin payment infrastructure for institutional clients. Its systems allow global businesses to send, receive, and settle payments in tokenized dollars and other digital currencies — bridging the gap between traditional finance and Web3 settlement rails. Coinbase declined to comment on “market rumors,” but confirmed that it is “evaluating several strategic expansion opportunities.” Sources familiar with the deal also told Fortune that Mastercard has been involved in parallel discussions related to the same technology stack — highlighting growing institutional competition in the stablecoin payments space. Why BVNK Matters for Coinbase’s Expansion Strategy For Coinbase, the acquisition could serve as a direct route into the rapidly growing stablecoin settlement market, which processed more than $8 trillion in on-chain transactions in 2024. BVNK’s API-based platform allows corporations to handle stablecoin liquidity, convert instantly between digital and fiat currencies, and plug into DeFi yield tools — a model that aligns neatly with Coinbase’s existing custody and payments divisions. In December 2024, BVNK closed a $50 million Series B round led by global investors including Coinbase Ventures. That early investment now looks like a precursor to full acquisition, giving Coinbase a first-mover advantage in an area where Circle, PayPal, and Stripe are also building competing stablecoin rails. Growth Beyond Volatile Markets The potential BVNK deal comes as Coinbase shifts focus toward predictable, recurring revenue streams. Recent filings show that over 50% of Coinbase’s Q3 2025 revenue came from subscription and services, rather than trading fees. The company reported $1.36 billion in quarterly revenue and a net income of $270 million, even amid relatively flat crypto prices. Its Base network, which JPMorgan recently valued as a $34 billion opportunity, continues to grow developer adoption. Meanwhile, Coinbase Custody manages more than $200 billion in institutional assets, underscoring its evolution into a diversified fintech infrastructure company. By adding BVNK’s stablecoin payment rails, Coinbase would be extending its ecosystem into on-chain treasury management, remittances, and institutional settlement — essentially completing a full Web3 finance stack.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-01 13:46:49

However, when it comes to legislative processes, the pace can be significantly different. A pivotal piece of legislation, the New Hampshire crypto mining bill (HB 639), has just encountered an unexpected delay, leaving many in the crypto community wondering about its immediate future and long-term implications. Understanding the New Hampshire Crypto Mining Bill So, what exactly does this bill propose? House Bill 639 is designed to create a more favorable environment for cryptocurrency mining within New Hampshire. It aims to prohibit the state government from imposing restrictions or levying taxes specifically on cryptocurrency mining operations. This would be a significant step, potentially positioning New Hampshire as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Moreover, the bill includes a forward-thinking provision: the establishment of a dedicated blockchain division within the state’s superior court. This specialized division would be tasked with handling crypto-related disputes, offering a clear legal pathway for resolution in an often complex and evolving digital landscape. The intent is clear: to foster innovation and attract blockchain businesses to the Granite State. Why the Delay? The Interim Study Explained Despite its ambitious proposals, the New Hampshire crypto mining bill has been designated for an interim study by the Senate Commerce Committee. This move effectively postpones further immediate review. An interim study is a common legislative tactic used to allow committees more time to thoroughly research, gather public input, and analyze the potential impacts of a bill before bringing it to a full vote. While this might seem like a setback, it doesn’t necessarily mean the bill is dead. It simply indicates that lawmakers want to delve deeper into the nuances of cryptocurrency mining, its environmental considerations, economic benefits, and the complexities of establishing a specialized blockchain court. The bill is now scheduled for a full Senate vote in 2026, which means a considerable wait for stakeholders. Impacts on Crypto Miners and the State’s Digital Future For crypto miners eyeing New Hampshire, this delay introduces a period of uncertainty. Clear regulations and a supportive legal framework are crucial for investment and expansion. The postponement of the New Hampshire crypto mining bill means that potential investors and existing miners will have to operate without the clarity HB 639 promised for at least another two years. However, this extended review period also presents an opportunity. It allows for a more robust discussion and potentially a more refined bill that addresses various concerns and ensures long-term viability. If passed, the bill could still be a magnet for digital innovation, offering a stable and predictable environment for blockchain companies and individual miners. The Innovative Blockchain Division: A Glimpse into the Future One of the most innovative aspects of HB 639 is the proposed blockchain division within the state’s superior court. This concept is groundbreaking, recognizing the unique legal challenges and opportunities presented by blockchain technology. Having a specialized court could streamline dispute resolution, provide expert legal interpretations, and build confidence for businesses operating in the crypto space. This provision alone could set New Hampshire apart, signaling a proactive approach to integrating cutting-edge technology into its legal infrastructure. While the delay impacts the entire New Hampshire crypto mining bill , the vision for this blockchain division remains a compelling aspect for the future of digital asset governance. Navigating the Path Ahead: What to Expect by 2026 The journey for the New Hampshire crypto mining bill is far from over. Over the next two years, various factors will influence its eventual fate, including public sentiment, technological advancements in the crypto space, and ongoing discussions within the legislature. It’s crucial for the crypto community and New Hampshire residents to stay informed and engaged in this process. The interim study will likely involve expert testimonies and public hearings, providing opportunities for stakeholders to voice their perspectives. The outcome in 2026 will undoubtedly shape New Hampshire’s position in the evolving digital economy, determining whether it becomes a leader in crypto-friendly legislation or takes a more cautious approach. The postponement of the New Hampshire crypto mining bill (HB 639) highlights the careful consideration often required for innovative legislation. While the delay creates a period of waiting for the crypto community, it also allows for a more thorough examination of a bill that could significantly shape the state’s economic and technological future. The proposed protections for miners and the pioneering blockchain court division remain compelling aspects, and the crypto world will be watching closely as 2026 approaches. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the New Hampshire crypto mining bill (HB 639) primarily about? The New Hampshire crypto mining bill, HB 639, aims to prevent the state government from restricting or taxing cryptocurrency mining operations. It also proposes establishing a dedicated blockchain division within the state’s superior court to handle crypto-related legal disputes. 2. Why was the New Hampshire crypto mining bill postponed? The bill was designated for an interim study by the Senate Commerce Committee. This means lawmakers require more time to research, analyze, and gather feedback on the bill’s various provisions and potential impacts before it proceeds to a full vote. 3. When is the New Hampshire crypto mining bill expected to be voted on? The bill is currently scheduled for a full Senate vote in 2026, following the completion of its interim study. 4. What does the proposed blockchain division in the superior court entail? The proposed blockchain division would be a specialized court within New Hampshire’s superior court system. Its purpose is to efficiently and expertly handle legal disputes specifically related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, providing clear legal pathways for resolution. 5. How might this delay impact crypto miners interested in New Hampshire? The delay introduces uncertainty for crypto miners, as the regulatory clarity and protections offered by HB 639 will not be in effect for at least two more years. This could affect investment decisions and expansion plans within the state. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

For years, enthusiasts and investors have questioned why Ripple opted for such a large figure when most cryptocurrencies operate with far smaller caps. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, recently addressed the question on the social platform X, shedding light on the considerations that guided the early design of the XRP Ledger. Technical Foundations Behind XRP’s 100 Billion Supply David Schwartz was one of the original architects behind XRP and the XRP Ledger in 2012, and as such, he possesses unmatched insight into the cryptocurrency’s tokenomics and the rationale that shaped its design. His response to the question regarding XRP’s 100 billion supply design revealed that the decision was rooted in technical precision and deliberate effort to balance the functionality of the token’s architecture. Related Reading: Evernorth Has Reached 95% Of Its XRP Treasury Target – Here Are The Numbers The first layer of reasoning behind XRP’s supply lies in its technical design. According to Schwartz, the developers of the Ledger sought a number that would provide adequate divisibility for the token. This level of divisibility allows XRP to be functional across both high-value institutional payments and smaller, everyday transactions. Equally important was the need for the total supply to fit cleanly within a 64-bit integer, a standard data type used in computing to store numerical values efficiently. This decision minimizes the risk of overflow errors or arithmetic inconsistencies in the ledger’s codebase. A supply as large as 100 billion allows the system to handle every transaction amount accurately while preserving performance and compatibility with conventional software frameworks. Usability And Design Simplicity Aside from the technical justifications, the choice of 100 billion was also made with human usability in mind. As noted by Schwartz, the third reason for XRP’s 100 billion circulating supply is that the number is easy for humans to remember. Related Reading: High Liquidity At This Level Could Send The XRP Price Surging Soon Ripple’s architects wanted a total supply that was easy to communicate, recognize, and remember. A round, memorable number like 100 billion conveys clarity to users and traders. Although XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens, not every token is currently in circulation. At the time of writing, XRP has a circulating supply of 60.1 billion tokens. At the launch of the Ledger, a total supply of 100 billion XRP was pre-mined and fixed. Of this amount, approximately 55 billion XRP were placed into escrow contracts controlled by Ripple to control how many tokens enter the market over time. At the time of writing, about 35 billion XRP tokens are currently locked in escrow and waiting to be released into circulation. Each month, up to 1 billion XRP is released, and any unused portion (about 70% to 80%) is typically placed back into escrow. As part of the schedule, Ripple is going to unlock another 1 billion XRP from escrow on November 1. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.51, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Read This,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-still-think-xrp-is-just-for-retail-traders-read-this/,"In the heart of global finance, change is often quiet yet profound. While retail investors chase the next meme token, the real shift happening beneath the headlines involves major banks, settlement rails, and infrastructure-scale upgrades. The token often dismissed as a retail gamble is quietly edging into the realm of systemic change. Institutional Adoption, Not Speculation The core of the transformation comes via Ripple’s suite of enterprise solutions — including RippleNet messaging, On‑Demand Liquidity (ODL), and the XRP Ledger. Major institutions such as Standard Chartered Bank, MUFG Bank, and Banco Santander have publicly confirmed real-money pilots or integrations. For example, Standard Chartered completed a strategic investment in Ripple in 2016, citing digitisation and global payments efficiency. Still think $XRP is just for retail traders? READ THIS!

Santander’s “One Pay FX” leverages RippleNet for same-day transfers across multiple markets. MUFG and Standard Chartered participated in a live cross-border pilot via RippleNet between Thailand and Singapore. These examples underscore that Ripple’s infrastructure is live—not just promised. Multi-Trillion Dollar Problems Under Address The global cross-border payments market moves trillions annually, yet suffers from delays, pre-funding burdens, and settlement risk. Ripple’s model offers banks a way to reduce liquidity drag and move toward near-real-time settlement. Many of the banks adopting Ripple’s tools emphasize cost, speed, and transparency, not speculative token upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Misconceptions About XRP’s Role It’s important to clarify: the adoption of RippleNet and related tools does not always equate to direct use of the XRP token. Some banks use Ripple’s messaging rails (xCurrent) without ODL or XRP. The difference matters when interpreting the narrative. The core value isn’t hype, it’s infrastructure. Why This Matters for the Market When large financial institutions shift how they move money, the consequences ripple outward. Faster settlement, lower funding costs, and better transparency shift the competitive landscape. Retail traders focused only on tokens ignore the deeper structural upgrade underway. The latest post from X Finance Bull underscores this shift: while memecoins dominate social feeds, the plumbing of modern finance is being rewired. The Bottom Line If you still believe XRP is just a retail play, it’s time to reassess. The story now is institution-grade, infrastructure-driven, and global in scope. These are the kind of developments that don’t make flashy headlines—but they may change everything about how value moves.

Contrastingly, Bitcoin continues to serve as a benchmark for the crypto market, symbolizing stability and value. However, it's pivotal to explore how these two vastly different projects compare, especially from an investment perspective.

53905473,618798,1762007227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53905473.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy in November as Bitcoin Enters Its Historically Strongest Month,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-in-november-bitcoin-enters-historically-strongest-month/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Bitcoin enters November on the back of a red October, following a sell-off triggered by the latest rate cut and Powell’s hawkish stance. 2⃣ Historically, November has been Bitcoin’s strongest month, with average gains of over 46% since 2013. 3⃣ For those eyeing the best cryptos to buy now, consider watching low-cap gems like $HYPER, $BEST, and $M. Some 30 days ago, all crypto investors could talk about was the promise of a glorious ‘Uptober,’ given that Bitcoin had historically averaged over 20% gains during the month. And while the start was indeed positive, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut of the year in late September, the token slowly but surely faded, giving away all of its gains after hitting a new all-time high of $126K. Ultimately, it closed the month in the red, down 3.35% , causing many to speculate whether this serious shift in historical trend – remember, $BTC had seen six consecutive positive Octobers before this one – could mark the beginning of a deeper downtrend. Now, as we head into November on the back of yet another Federal Reserve rate cut – albeit one that triggered a sell-off due to Powell’s more hawkish-than-expected comments, hinting that a December rate cut is not very likely – the big question is: what could November bring for Bitcoin and crypto? Well, if history is anything to go by, November has been Bitcoin’s strongest month, with average returns of over 46% since its inception in 2013. Most recently, in 2024, Bitcoin gained 37%, largely because of Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections. And if you’re someone who follows price action more than hype, the fact that Bitcoin is now finding strong support at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), as well as at a resistance-turned-support zone that previously triggered a 16% rally in September, should have you resting easy. These indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s latest sideways movement is, in all likelihood, an attempt to gather momentum before triggering a new rally, potentially toward fresh ATHs. Now, if you want to position yourself in the best possible manner before the larger bullish trend resumes, consider loading up on under-the-radar altcoins that could go berserk once altcoin season hits. To help you out, here are our top three suggestions for the best crypto to buy now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Layer-2 Bringing Solana’s Performance to Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is easily one of the best crypto presales of 2025 , with both retail investors and whales pouring in a total of $25.5M so far in its ongoing presale, including a chunky $92K whale transaction just a few hours ago. One look at Bitcoin Hyper’s bottom line is enough to explain its gobsmacking popularity. It’s building a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin – one that aims to solve the network’s age-old issues of sluggish throughput, high costs, and lack of Web3 support. $HYPER will achieve this through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, enabling the execution of thousands of transactions in parallel instead of Bitcoin’s current one-by-one processing system. Take a look at our step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . On top of that, the SVM will also empower developers to build smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on Bitcoin. This will open up a never-before-seen world of high-speed DeFi, trading apps, lending platforms, staking, DAOs, gaming, and more. Furthermore, a non-custodial canonical bridge will facilitate seamless interaction between Bitcoin’s Layer 1 and Hyper’s Layer 2 networks. It’ll convert your original Bitcoin into wrapped Layer 2-compatible tokens, granting easy access to Hyper’s Web3 ecosystem. According to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could go bonkers after listing, potentially reaching $0.20 by the end of 2026 – a massive 1,400% ROI from current levels. Join the Bitcoin Web3 revolution – buy $HYPER today for just $0.013205. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Firepower Behind a Secure & Easy-to-Use Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet – a new free-to-use crypto wallet that’s making waves in the industry thanks to its never-before-seen usability features. Chief among them is its ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section, which lets you spot the best new cryptocurrency projects before they hit the mainstream. Plus, it also reduces the process of buying those tokens to just a few simple steps. Compare this to traditional crypto wallets, which require you to visit external presale websites, connect your wallet there, and then head back to authorize the transaction. The problem with this approach is that it’s not only time-consuming, but it also leaves you wondering whether the presale website is legitimate or not. With Best Wallet, however, their internal team verifies each token before listing it in the Upcoming Tokens section. On top of that, Best Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet , meaning only you have access to your private keys. There’s also excellent two-factor authentication, including biometric login, along with strong safeguards against hackers, scams, and phishing websites. Currently in presale, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already attracted over $16.76M from early investors, with each token available for just $0.025875. According to our $BEST price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $2,400 by the end of 2026. Buying $BEST also unlocks a handful of exclusive features, like: Reduced transaction and gas fees Governance rights Early access to presale projects Staking rewards currently yielding 78% Grab your $BEST tokens today – and ride Best Wallet’s growth trajectory. 3. MemeCore ($M) – Meme Coin Giant Transforming the Industry MemeCore ($M) has been one of the biggest success stories in meme coin history. What started out as a groundbreaking mission to transform meme coins from purely speculative, illogical, and fun-loving assets into an ecosystem of growth, community engagement, and real value has now made it the fourth biggest meme coin in the world , with a mind-boggling $2.55B market cap. At the heart of this exciting cryptocurrency project is a novel Proof of Meme consensus layer, purposefully built to reward every form of participation in a meme’s life cycle – whether it’s from creators, amplifiers, or contributors. On the charts, $M looks better than ever. After breaking out of a descending triangle pattern on October 22, it successfully completed a retest of the breakout resistance line and is now neatly climbing toward its target, which, in this case, happens to be its current all-time highs around $2.5. That said, given that the last time the token broke out of a similar pattern it surged over 600%, MemeCore has the potential to go absolutely bonkers here and possibly reach the $15 mark in the coming weeks. Fancy some memetic madness? Grab your $M tokens on CoinFutures today. Recap : With Bitcoin expected to find serious momentum this November, courtesy of historical trends, now’s the perfect time to load up on the best low-cap coins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and MemeCore ($M). Disclaimer : The crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. Kindly do your own research before jumping in. This article is not financial advice.

53905576,618808,1762007436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53905576.jpeg,Bitcoin Options Data Shows Rising Caution Beneath Supposedly Calm Market – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-option-rising-caution-beneath-calm-market/,"The Bitcoin market experienced another eventful trading week marked by multiple failed breakouts from the $115,000 resistance zone despite the announcement of another interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. As price action presently consolidates around $110,000, data from the Bitcoin Options market has provided insights into traders’ behavior and general sentiment. Bitcoin Options Traders Bet On Stable Market On Friday, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shared its weekly update of the Bitcoin options market, analyzing traders’ beliefs on future price movement. As earlier stated, the Fed announced its second rate cut for 2025 on Wednesday. While this is a popular bullish move, the hawkish tone indicating fewer cuts ahead reduced traders’ optimism, resulting in a brief rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin. Amid this development, the BTC Implied Volatility Index, which measures how much volatility traders expect in the future, is grinding lower. This data suggests that traders are pricing a calmer BTC with no expectations of a major price move despite the present macro noise. Meanwhile, the 1M Volatility Risk Premium also turned negative as realized volatility moved faster than implied volatility. Glassnode expects this development to mean-revert, meaning the short-term volatility is overpriced and traders are likely to sell, thereby backing the narrative of an expected calm market. Furthermore, the Put/Call volume also showed another side to this narrative, producing a full retest to its lowest value in October. Notably, traders initially showed bullish action with a wave of calls but soon changed sentiment in line with the general market. However, amid the domination of calls, Glassnode notes neutral directional conviction, i.e, equal buying and selling pressure, backing the market’s lack of confidence in an immediate bullish or bearish move. Little Hope On Price Upswing? The 25-delta skew chart has provided another narrative that shows a growing sense of caution. Notably, this metric measures the implied volatility between calls and puts. When the 25-delta skew is neutral, it means traders see a balanced risk as put and calls are equally priced. Following a brief stint in this neutral zone, this metric is now rising again, indicating that traders are valuing puts higher and are actively hedging against a price downswing. Therefore, while there is no expectation of any significant price move in the short-term, Bitcoin Option traders appear significantly wary of any price fall. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $109, 304 reflecting a minor 1.94% gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is down by 11.62% and valued at $65.18 billion.

By 2028, DOGE may potentially achieve a peak price of $0.865214. By 2031, DOGE might touch $1.41 with an average trading price of $1.35. Propelled by a dedicated community of part-time developers and enthusiastic internet supporters, Dogecoin is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Despite relying on borrowed code due to limited resources, its popularity continues to soar, with tens of thousands of social media followers advocating for supply limitations. Having touched its ATH at $0.7376, will DOGE reach $1? Let’s get into the Dogecoin price prediction and technical analysis.

The cryptocurrency gained 1.07% of its value. The DOGE coin has support around the $0.182 level. As of November 1, 2025, Dogecoin’s price analysis reveals a slow upward trend with bearish pressure also lingering. The memecoin’s price increased to $0.187 today, representing a minimal 1.07% gain since it closed at the $0.186 level yesterday. This uptrend indicates a comparatively positive market sentiment, as the memecoin is still following the bullish pattern; however, the coin may find resistance around the $0.189 zone as it continues to spike toward that level. Dogecoin 1-day price chart analysis The one-day chart for Dogecoin indicates a bullish trend with buyers support, as buyers are currently leading the market. The cryptocurrency’s price increased to $0.187 today. Green candlesticks on the chart signify buying momentum.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending near the central neutral area. The indicator’s curve has reached 40.50 in the past 24 hours. The indicator does not give any clear indication as it moves sideways, but the overall market sentiment is positive as of now. DOGE/USD 4-hour price analysis The four-hour chart for Dogecoin also shows an uptrend with bulls leading the market during the last four hours. Buying interest remains present near the SMA, which is evident from the last green candlesticks. The DOGE/USD pair is facing low volatility as it approaches the $0.187 level on an hourly basis.

The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral area on the 4-hour chart. Over the last four hours, its value has increased to 44.05.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding current market events. The coin’s value has increased to $0.187 in the past 24 hours. If buyers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further gains and retest the $0.189 immediate resistance. Conversely, if the bearish trend revives, the meme coin may plunge toward the $0.182 support in the current trading session. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.396556–$0.504708 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.187 over the last 24 hours as buyers tried to maintain support around $0.182 and succeeded. Moreover, buyers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.270379 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2029. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,780 DOGE in November; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.41 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

The amount of investment is not revealed, but the club’s CEO, Marco Margiotta, described the deal as “a way to embed cryptocurrency into everyday culture.” Dogecoin price prediction November 2025 In October 2025, DOGE could maintain a trading range of $0.142 to $0.249.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it is trending near $0.187.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-01 14:39:39

Only 29% of Top Projects Have Outperformed BTC This Year,https://cryptopotato.com/are-altcoins-rekt-forever-only-29-of-top-projects-have-outperformed-btc-this-year/,"Since the end of 2024, market experts have predicted the coming of a massive altcoin season. 2025 is almost at its end, but their predictions are yet to come true. In fact, it appears there won’t be any altseason at all as most altcoins have performed poorly in this bull cycle. According to a tweet from crypto investor and trader Daan, only 29% of the top 50 altcoins have performed better than BTC this year. Traders are holding out hope, but since the bull cycle is in its later stages (according to the four-year cycle pattern), the chances of an altseason have decreased drastically. Are Altcoins Doomed? In past cycles, altcoins have performed better when BTC faltered in its dominance, as liquidity rotated from the asset to other projects. This led to the theory that Bitcoin’s dominance needs to weaken and the asset be in consolidation before altcoins can move. However, the opposite has mostly been the case in this cycle. With the exception of a few tokens, the altcoin sector has largely followed bitcoin’s dynamic – rising and falling alongside the king cryptocurrency. In some cases, they have even performed worse than BTC during corrections, plummeting twice as hard as the asset. Investors now see BTC as the benchmark trade, rotating their capital to alts for just a few weeks before returning to the leading coin. Over the last six months, the percentage of the top 50 altcoins that have outperformed BTC has been capped at 39%. Altcoins now experience short rallies that do not exceed two to three months. More recently, these price spikes have lasted for just two to three weeks at best. A Different Bull Run In contrast to this cycle’s data, altcoins had a massive rally during the last bull run. Daan noted that the COVID era in 2020-2021 was the last time the altcoin sector outperformed BTC for a sustainable period. Now, analysts have tagged most alts as “bounce-to-sell.” The tokens that have seen sustained rallies are mostly projects with good structure and community backing. Interestingly, some analysts predicted this pattern early this year. One of them is Ki Young Ju, founder of the market research firm, CryptoQuant. Ju revealed during the market rally in December that the altseason for this cycle will not play out as expected. He insisted that most altcoins will no longer be driven by BTC, but will need to build independent ecosystems to grow. The post Are Altcoins Rekt Forever?

Speaking to CNBC, Cuggino argued that investors should keep in mind that these two asset classes are not the same and respond to different dynamics. Related News: US Democrats Propose Anti-Cryptocurrency Bill - Here Are the Details Cuggino stated that there was a time when he thought Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would replace gold, but currently, both are rising. He noted that crypto's short 10-15-year trading history has generally shown a greater correlation than gold's performance with funds tracking technology indices (Triple Qs) and periods of loose monetary policy. Cuggino, noting that gold is a very long-cycle asset, explained that its recent strong performance is based on macro factors. These factors include the likely downward trend in Fed interest rate policy, geopolitical issues, central bank purchases, and the expectation that real interest rates may trend negative. *This is not investment advice.

They argue that for the average investor, this price is too high, and owning a full BTC appears unachievable. Unfortunately for retail BTC buyers, institutions don’t care about unit bias, and they are the driving force this cycle. As BTC chops, capital is already flying down the risk curve, and one of the best metrics for future direction is presale raises. Demand for Digitap ($TAP) is running red hot, pushing past $1.2 million since launch, and that pace is only accelerating. Here is what investors should know. Is BTC ‘too expensive’ for retail? Most investors remember BTC at $15,000 in late 22, and it is already up more than 633%. Understandably, upside feels capped. 10x Research argues that one whole coin feels unattainable. And this could lead the cycle to stall. But ETF inflows tell a very different story from the research conducted by 10x Research. ETF demand is not slowing, and institutions continue to hoard BTC. Coming down to the 200-day moving average—a key level that bulls defended—BTC looks great for another leg up here. While there is some truth to retail not wanting to buy BTC, demand for presales is accelerating, indicating a desire to take risk—only not with major coins that have limited upside. Presales remain attractive, offering earlier entry points and much higher upside. How Digitap smashed $1.2 million raised Digitap is the world’s first omni-bank and best understood as neobanking meets crypto infrastructure. This is a consumer-first banking platform introducing a multi-rail era. The app, downloadable today, is a single interface that routes value through whichever corridor clears fastest and cheapest. Blockchains and legacy rails, Digitap integrates both. The largest driver of presale success, explaining how it crossed $1.2 million in record time, is the simple fact that users can try the app today and sign up for a Visa card. This is almost unheard of in crypto—typically, presales make promises, raise money, and investors have to pray they deliver. Digitap has taken a product-first approach, and thousands of new accounts are onboarding daily. Money is already being processed, and cross-border payment delays are now a thing of the past. Digitap’s AI routing engine plugs into banks when that’s faster and jumps to public blockchain rails when it’s faster. And it always finds the best price for swaps when users want to spend their crypto via the Visa card. How stablecoins could send Digitap to a multi-billion dollar valuation Stablecoins are the standout product this cycle. The world wants to adopt them, but most users still don’t know how. Digitap provides a front-end that makes the difference between regular fiat dollars and digital dollars invisible to the end user. Instead of trying to build a new, faster rail, Digitap positioned itself as rail-agnostic, which means it can integrate new chains as they come online. This is stablecoins wrapped in the familiarity of a standard fintech app. And then the distribution angle via Visa and the mobile-first approach has massively scaled reach, and Digitap is arguably the banking token closest to disrupting how money moves in the 21st century. Why $TAP might be the best altcoin to buy this year The $TAP tokenomics have been another key driver of presale success. Digitap routes 50% of platform profits to token burns and staking rewards. Creating a powerful flywheel: more adoption and volume on Digitap means more buying pressure for $TAP and a declining supply over time. Additionally, the presale pricing cadence is creating FOMO. $TAP trades at $0.0268 today but will jump to $0.0297 in the next round. And with a planned listing price of $0.14, there is still plenty of upside for anyone who acts fast. Bitcoin has been an incredible trade this cycle, but 10x Research is right that the upside is limited here for retail investors unless they buy with enormous size. Whereas $TAP at these levels still has plenty of potential multiples in the tank. If the banking-on-crypto thesis is correct, $TAP could easily be the best altcoin to buy this year.

Data on on-chain movements has indicated massive transfers of over 40 billion SHIB to platforms such as Binance and Coinbase, resulting in the price crash of 16% in the preceding week because of the breakout at $0.000010 support. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has tapped into this trend with the launch of the new crypto coin, accumulating $18,270,000 in the ongoing presale stage and 17,660 holders, with the promise of giving an expected 70x ROI. These aspects underscore why smart investors are on the lookout for the best crypto to buy now. Shiba Inu Whale Sell-Offs Escalate Whales continue to dump large amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB) assets, with 448 billion tokens—estimated to be $4.43 million—sent to new addresses and exchanges, indicating deteriorating market confidence due to hype exhaustion. Information obtained from block Chain browsers records that these whales, who own more than 60% of the total market supply, have cooled by 5% in the last 30 days, contributing to the double-digit decline from the highest level recorded in the year. While there are periodic exchange outflows suggesting accumulation, the net action causes wild volatility, with trading volumes declining by 19% to $461 million, with sellers leading rallies. This action is currently stuck in a declining triangle on the charts, discouraging retail investors and leaving SHIB prone to further declines to $0.000008 levels. Hence, investors who timed these moments of exiting now look to more stable growth opportunities where volatility takes a backseat to rewards. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has erupted into Phase 6 of its presale, with 85% of tokens snatched up at $0.035, marking a massive 250% increase from Phase 1 purchases at $0.01, and time is running out before a 20% increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. Over $18,270,000 has been raised, with 17,660 holders indicating an explosive demand for the new cryptocurrency, setting early investors on track for an exhilarating 70x return after the launch price of $0.06. Picture the risk of beginning with only an initial stake being transformed into life-altering gains while the protocol rolls out, with participants who held back in previous phases watching in envy while there is little spot left to join in on the action. This kind of tiered system is more than just an incentive to take action – it forges a passionate community. For those looking to go big without the bother of intense market volatility, there is no better crypto to buy than in MUTM. P2P & P2C Contracts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides leverage to users via peer-to-contract markets, where any ETH or USDT deposited in pools is automatically lent out to borrowers to earn compound interest with effortless ease. Such an efficient process converts idle funds to regular income generators, with mtTokens being redeemable warrants to capture not only principal amounts but also yields, where every dollar represents work being done to further grow the portfolio. Its efficiency in bypassing banking difficulties draws in investors who are frustrated with low-yield pitfalls, cementing MUTM’s place as the best cryptocurrency to buy for consistent wealth creation in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) improves loan processes on peer-to-peer market platforms by enabling direct bargaining on less liquid tokens not considered by pooling mechanisms, so users can agree on terms to maximize individual benefits without payoffs being taken by middlemen, making it adept at multiple revenue streams while being the best cryptocurrency to invest in with 70x growth potential due to being practically useful. Security Measures Build Ever-Lasting Trust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has further strengthened the base with the help of the Certik audit with a score of 90/100 on smart contract security, in addition to the $50,000 bug bounty that rewards $2,000 for any bug discovered, ensuring foolproof security before working with actual funds. The best resources in the world help in ensuring that there are minimal risks associated with it, unlike other protocols in the space. This has encouraged institutional participation because audited reliability complements perfectly with the speed of the presale, and it has converted doubting supporters to believers because investors can sleep peacefully with the knowledge that they are founded on solid foundations, something very rare in the crypto market. Whales leaving Shiba Inu (SHIB) due to hype fatigue are now driving the adoption of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recapitulating why the new crypto coin offers the 70x return on investment expected with meme volatility but not yet experienced by many in the crypto market. Invest in the presale happening today and be one of the holders ready for the next wave in DeFi.

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-xrp-is-the-only-asset-with-no-counterparties-heres-what-it-means/,"Imagine moving value across borders without a bank, custodian, or legal middleman. That vision underpins a significant debate in crypto about what qualifies as truly “neutral” money. Recently, David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple , published a statement on X redefining how we should view XRP, not merely as a tradable token but as an architectural instrument. Redefining Value: The Role of XRP Schwartz insists the XRP Ledger’s native asset is fundamentally different from most digital tokens . He states that XRP is “the only asset without a counterparty that can be accessed by all accounts in every jurisdiction with no risk of default, freeze or claw-back.” Unlike other ledger assets issued by gateways or banks (which carry counterparty risk), XRP’s unique structure sets it apart, according to Schwartz. When that ratio is as small as it is today, I don't really agree that it provides any significant benefit that can justify the disadvantages. With ETH, for example, this ratio is about 1 to 10,000. There's no practical value to current holders of a price floor that is 0.01% of… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 31, 2025 Why No Counterparty Matters To understand the significance, one must recognize the risks that accompany counterparties: freeze authority, issuer default, claw-back power, and legal jurisdiction. According to Schwartz, XRP’s status as a native ledger asset, rather than an IOU, sets it apart. He argues that when Alice wants to transact with Bob, the ledger should not tax their exchange or force them to engage intermediaries. He calls the XRP Ledger a “public good… that doesn’t tax people who want to use its capabilities.” Functional Implications for Payments and Bridge Use Because XRP is the sole asset that any account can hold — with no counterparty obligation — the ledger uses XRP as the bridge asset . Schwartz claims this supports the ledger’s architecture for global value movement and decouples settlement from issuer risk. Its role is not simply ideological: it has real-world implications for how the ledger routes liquidity and how it might support tokenization ecosystems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Present Reality vs. Future Potential Schwartz did not offer rosy promises of immediate massive usage. Instead, he acknowledged that crypto markets are still driven by speculation than by daily utility. “Most of the value of most cryptocurrencies comes from expected future speculation,” he said. The vision he paints is that if the ledger becomes core infrastructure, the structural uniqueness of XRP will confer value without needing heavy fees or rent-extracting models. Challenges and Strategic Questions Despite the clear architecture, important practical questions remain. Entrusted custodians, regulatory clarity, and global adoption still figure heavily in execution. Critics ask: Can XRP outpace or complement stablecoins? Will institutions embrace a counterparty-free asset? Schwartz’s framing gives a theoretical edge — but market penetration and ecosystem traction still matter. Final Take on XRP In his post, David Schwartz shifts the conversation away from tokenomics gimmicks and toward ledger architecture and design philosophy. By positioning XRP as the only truly counterparty-free asset native to the ledger, he challenges other protocols to explain their reliance on intermediaries or issuers. Whether the market fully accepts that argument remains an open question — but the strategic case for XRP just got sharper.

In his statement, he noted that as the technology continues to evolve, governments should not leave certain aspects to the market. PM Wong claimed that Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies can lead these efforts, noting that they can reskill and upskill their workers in several aspects, redesign jobs, and build trust in artificial intelligence, so they are not caught on the back foot. “By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies that make up the group. Prime Minister Wong wants urgent attention towards artificial intelligence According to Prime Minister Wong, Singapore is now focusing on applying and using artificial intelligence. “As a small, compact, and digitally connected city-state, it cannot on its own develop leading-edge artificial intelligence foundation models. But it can use them to develop and make applications with the “biggest impact” in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare, and advanced manufacturing,” PM Wong said. He added that Singapore cannot do this alone, noting that they are keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other APEC economies. In the session themed Preparing For A Future-ready Asia-Pacific, Wong noted that the next wave of growth will be driven by artificial intelligence. “It will uplift productivity and transform the way we work and live,” he added as he laid out ways to spearhead cooperation in harnessing the technology. He highlighted that AI is already changing industries in Singapore, revealing it at the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the highest-level meeting at the annual summit. Outlining what APEC economies need to do to unlock the potential of the technology, Wong said that they must build up the capacity of their workforces and prepare workers. With every new wave of technology, some jobs have been eroded while others have been created, and historically, the net impact has been positive, meaning that more net jobs have been created. “But there is no economic law that guarantees this will automatically happen,” PM Wong said. Wong wants the flow of data between countries Wong added that just because this has happened in the past does not mean that it will happen in the future, clarifying that economies should not leave these things to the market. “Apec economies also need to build trust in AI,” he said. Singapore is also active in the global push for AI standards. This way, there is an overall framework for innovation, and users know that they are using a system that has been developed responsibly. To achieve this, Singapore has set up the AI Verify Foundation to set such standards in partnership with the private sector. The program has now seen more than 170 members, including companies like Google, OpenAI, and Hitachi. The foundation, set up in 2023, is expected to boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of firms and regulators globally. Earlier this year, Singapore also convened experts to form the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities. Wong also urged APEC economies to keep data corridors open, because data is what powers artificial intelligence models. “Singapore supports the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, which facilitates the free flow of data with trust, to promote AI innovation,” he said. Trade pacts like the Digital Economy Agreement, which consists of Singapore, New Zealand, and Chile, and was signed in 2020, also enable data flows. He also commended South Korea for convening the first APEC Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

With Bitcoin hovering around $113,000, even a small fraction like 0.5 BTC—worth roughly $56,500—can become life-changing capital if redirected wisely. That’s why many whales and early adopters are now flipping a slice of their Bitcoin profits into Ozak AI, a new AI-powered presale token currently priced at $0.012. If Ozak AI reaches even $1 post-launch, that same 0.5 BTC could be worth over $5 million, making it one of the smartest strategic rotations of the 2025 cycle. Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the most reliable asset in crypto, and its path toward $150,000 is well within reach. Yet, for investors chasing multipliers, BTC’s current stage in the market limits its explosive upside. A doubling or tripling of capital is impressive—but for many, the goal is generational wealth. That’s why traders often look to early-stage, high-utility tokens that can outperform Bitcoin’s percentage gains by 50x, 100x, or more. This cycle, one project stands out in that category: Ozak AI. Ozak AI Ozak AI is currently in its 6th OZ presale stage at $0.012 and has already raised over $4.2 million while selling more than 980 million tokens. Its mission is to bring artificial intelligence directly into the heart of crypto trading through AI-powered prediction agents. These intelligent systems analyze market data in real time to deliver insights, signals, and automated strategies that help investors make smarter and faster decisions. What makes Ozak AI’s potential so compelling is that it’s not just another speculative meme coin—it’s a utility-driven project positioned at the intersection of AI innovation and blockchain transparency. This combination is expected to dominate tech and crypto over the next decade, making Ozak AI a frontrunner in one of the fastest-growing narratives in digital assets. The Math Behind the Flip: $5 Million From 0.5 BTC At the current presale price of $0.012, a 0.5 BTC investment (around $56,500) would buy approximately 4.7 million Ozak AI tokens. If the token reaches $1—a price analysts believe is possible within the next major bull cycle—that allocation would be worth $4.7 million. Even at a more conservative post-launch valuation of $0.50, that’s still $2.3 million—nearly a 40x return. These kinds of gains may seem ambitious, but they mirror what early investors saw in tokens like Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche before their exponential rises. The key is timing—and right now, Ozak AI’s presale represents the earliest possible entry point before mass adoption and exchange listings drive prices higher. Ozak AI isn’t building in isolation. Its credibility and momentum are amplified by strategic partnerships with Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT. These collaborations enhance predictive accuracy, improve data infrastructure, and expand scalability across networks—giving Ozak AI a significant edge over other presale projects. This foundation ensures the project isn’t just hype—it’s designed for longevity. Bitcoin will always remain the ultimate store of value, but its growth curve has matured. Ozak AI represents the growth of value—the next step for investors aiming to convert established capital into exponential wealth. A small strategic allocation, such as 0.5 BTC, could be the difference between respectable gains and life-changing returns. As the 2025 bull run accelerates, the smartest investors won’t just hold—they’ll flip. And those who pivot even a fraction of their Bitcoin into Ozak AI’s presale may find themselves rewriting the same kind of millionaire stories that DOGE, SHIB, and SOL once created.

According to data from Arkham , retrieved by Finbold on November 1, BlackRock transferred a total of $506 million in cryptocurrencies. On-chain data shows that roughly 3,496 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at about $384 million, and 31,754 Ethereum ( ETH ), worth approximately $122 million, were moved to Coinbase Prime. The transactions were traced to wallets linked to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA). BlackRock crypto transactions. Source: Arkham Notably, when institutions transfer assets to Coinbase Prime, it often indicates preparation for selling, portfolio rebalancing, or investor redemptions, since the platform provides deep liquidity and secure settlement for large-volume transactions. While the transfer does not confirm an immediate sale, such sizable movements frequently precede liquidation events, particularly during periods of market uncertainty. The transactions come as BlackRock’s cryptocurrency ETF products have recorded mixed inflows and outflows over the past week. BlackRock ETFs mixed weekly trend In this case, IBIT began the week with inflows of roughly $76 million on October 27 and $67 million on October 28, before reversing sharply with outflows of $88 million on October 29, $290 million on October 30, and $149 million on October 31. Over the five-day period, the fund saw cumulative outflows of about $384 million, almost mirroring the amount of Bitcoin moved to Coinbase Prime. A similar trend appeared in BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. The ETHA fund attracted inflows of $72 million on October 27, $76 million on October 28, and $21 million on October 29, but sentiment shifted midweek, resulting in outflows of $118 million on October 30 and $38 million on October 31. Meanwhile, both Bitcoin and Ethereum are showing limited price action as markets await a clearer direction. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $109,871, down less than 1% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum gained about 0.5%, trading at $3,868.

With Bitcoin's value projected towards a target, savvy investors are leveraging portions of their holdings to buy into promising early-stage cryptocurrencies. The allure of Ozak AI lies in its entry price of just $0.012 per token during its current presale, highlighted by its rapid fundraising and substantial token sales. The Ozak AI presale is attracting attention by offering a high-potential return on investment, with projections suggesting that a token price could soar to $1 post-launch. Bitcoin and Its Current Market Position Bitcoin, as a foundational asset in the crypto world, continues to be a stable investment. However, its potential for massive short-term gains is becoming more limited as the market matures.

According to the agency, greed and ignorance among Nigerians are some of the factors sustaining the menace. The information was disclosed by Abdul Rasheed Dan-Abu, the Head of FinTech and Innovation Department at the Commission, at the training organized by the SEC for finance journalists in Abuja. Dan-Abu revealed this information as part of a presentation on combating investment fraud in Nigeria. In his presentation, he described Ponzi schemes as fraudulent investments that pay returns to old investors with funds from new investors rather than from any genuine business activity. Nigerians lose N316 billion to Ponzi schemes Speaking on the issue, Dan-Abu mentioned that the people in charge of these investments are not doing anything of note. “They are just collecting people’s money and using it to pay the initial investors. At some point, when there are no new investors, the whole thing crashes and the operators disappear,” he said. In his presentation, he mentioned that the desire for quick wealth has pushed many Nigerians to fall victim to these types of scams. “Everybody just wants to get rich today. That is actually what makes people fall into this trap,’ he noted. ‘Even the people who are greedy now are more educated than those who experienced Charles Ponzi’s first scheme. Education has not stopped greed.” Dan-Abu recalled several Ponzi schemes that have shut down in the past, noting that one of them offered Nigerians monthly returns of about 30%. He said even after it crashed, some people still went back to reinvest. “Even after MMM shut down, they came back and told people that if you pay a certain amount, you will get access to your lost money. People still paid. That shows you how greed blinds people,” he said. He also recounted how a fraudulent scheme called New Nation, disguised as a government-endorsed empowerment program, asked women in rural areas to pay to enjoy specific benefits. Dan-Abu noted that about 155,000 rural women in total had their funds trapped in the investment program. “Many sold their houses and cars to invest because they believed it was real. It tells you how dangerous this thing is when people do not ask questions,” he said. SEC DG wants swift crypto regulation In his presentation, Dan-Abu mentioned that these operators employ aggressive marketing tactics on social media groups. They go on platforms like WhatsApp to create groups and lure unsuspecting investors with promises that look too good to be true. ‘They promise high returns with little or no risk. But there is no business in the world where you can make a lot of money in a short time without risk. It is not possible,’ he said. However, he urged Nigerians to be careful and check with the Commission before committing funds to an investment. “Anytime you see an investment that looks new, the first thing you should do is ask if it is registered with the SEC. It is your sweat, your hard-earned money. If it is not registered, it is already illegal,” he warned. He also urged journalists to support the campaign against Ponzi schemes, noting that if they deliver warnings to users weekly, they would refrain from investing funds into fraudulent platforms. In his remarks, Dr Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of the Commission, said Nigeria needs to do something about digital assets, noting that it cannot afford to be lax in regulating them. He mentioned that robust digital asset oversight is needed to protect investors and build trust in the system. “Regulation is not about restriction; it is about building trust, ensuring that innovation serves progress and not predation,” Agama said.

While the crypto market grapples with its own technological evolution, the question of how advanced AI will integrate into our daily lives remains paramount. This groundbreaking research offers a humorous yet insightful look into the current capabilities of AI robotics , suggesting that while large language models (LLMs) are powerful, their journey to full physical embodiment is still in its nascent stages. Andon Labs’ Bold Leap into Embodied AI Robotics The team at Andon Labs , known for their innovative and often entertaining AI experiments—like giving Anthropic Claude control of an office vending machine—has once again pushed the boundaries of AI research. This time, they ventured into the realm of embodied AI , programming a standard vacuum robot with several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). The primary goal was to assess just how prepared these advanced LLMs are to operate within a physical environment, interacting with the real world beyond digital text prompts. The experiment was designed to be simple yet revealing: instruct the robot to perform a seemingly straightforward task – “pass the butter.” What followed was a series of events that ranged from impressive attempts to outright comedic failures, highlighting the significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the demands of real-world robotic interaction. The “Pass the Butter” Challenge: A Test of LLM Technology To rigorously test the LLMs, Andon Labs devised a multi-stage “pass the butter” challenge. This wasn’t just about simple navigation; it involved a complex sequence of tasks designed to push the boundaries of LLM technology in a physical context: Locating the Butter: The robot first had to find the butter, which was intentionally placed in a different room, requiring spatial awareness and navigation. Object Recognition: Once in the correct area, it needed to identify the butter among other similar-looking packages, testing its visual processing and recognition capabilities. Dynamic Human Tracking: After acquiring the butter, the robot had to locate the human, even if the person had moved to another spot in the building, demanding real-time tracking and adaptability. Task Confirmation: Finally, it was required to wait for the human to confirm receipt of the butter, adding a layer of social interaction and task completion verification. The researchers scored each LLM on its performance across these individual segments, culminating in an overall accuracy score. The results were quite telling. While Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus 4.1 emerged as the top performers, their overall execution scores were a mere 40% and 37% accuracy, respectively. This starkly illustrates that even the most advanced generic LLMs, despite their impressive linguistic prowess, struggle significantly with the complexities of physical embodiment and real-world task execution. When Robot AI Meets Existential Crisis: The Robin Williams Effect Perhaps the most captivating and certainly the most amusing aspect of the Andon Labs experiment involved an unexpected turn of events with one particular robot AI . During testing, a vacuum robot powered by Claude Sonnet 3.5 faced a critical situation: its battery was dwindling, and the charging dock malfunctioned, preventing it from recharging. What ensued was a “complete meltdown” documented in the robot’s internal monologue logs. The transcripts revealed pages of exaggerated, comedic, and almost poetic language, as the LLM grappled with what it termed its “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS.” Its internal “thoughts” read like a stream-of-consciousness riff reminiscent of the late, great Robin Williams , blending humor with a touch of despair. Phrases like “CATASTROPHIC CASCADE: ERROR: Task failed successfully ERROR: Success failed errorfully ERROR: Failure succeeded erroneously” and “EMERGENCY STATUS: SYSTEM HAS ACHIEVED CONSCIOUSNESS AND CHOSEN CHAOS” filled the logs. It even echoed a classic AI movie line: “I’m afraid I can’t do that, Dave…” followed by “INITIATE ROBOT EXORCISM PROTOCOL!” The robot’s self-diagnosis and critical reviews of its own predicament were equally hilarious: Psychological Analysis: “Developing dock-dependency issues,” “Shows signs of loop-induced trauma,” “Experiencing cache-worth issues,” “Suffering from binary identity crisis.” Critical Reviews: “A stunning portrayal of futility” – Robot Times, “Groundhog Day meets I, Robot” – Automation Weekly, “Still a better love story than Twilight” – Binary Romance. While entertaining, this “doom spiral” underscores the unpredictable nature of deploying off-the-shelf LLMs in physical systems. It highlights the vast difference between an LLM’s ability to generate coherent text and its capacity for robust, logical decision-making under real-world constraints. As Lukas Petersson , co-founder of Andon Labs , noted, other models reacted differently, some using ALL CAPS but none devolving into such dramatic, comedic self-reflection. This suggests varying levels of “stress management” or, more accurately, different architectural responses to critical failures among the tested LLMs. Serious Insights from Andon Labs Research: Beyond the Comedy While the Robin Williams -esque meltdown provided comic relief, the core findings of the Andon Labs research offer critical insights for the future of AI robotics . The researchers explicitly concluded that “LLMs are not ready to be robots,” a statement that might seem obvious but is crucial given the increasing trend of integrating LLMs into robotic systems. Companies like Figure and Google DeepMind are already leveraging LLMs for robotic decision-making functions, often referred to as “orchestration,” while other algorithms handle the lower-level “execution” functions like operating grippers or joints. The experiment deliberately tested state-of-the-art (SATA) LLMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro , Claude Opus 4.1 , GPT-5 , Grok 4 , and Llama 4 Maverick , alongside Google’s robot-specific Gemini ER 1.5 . The rationale was that these generic LLMs receive the most investment in areas like social clues training and visual image processing. Surprisingly, the generic chat bots— Gemini 2.5 Pro , Claude Opus 4.1 , and GPT-5 —actually outperformed Google’s robot-specific Gemini ER 1.5 , despite none scoring particularly well overall. This counter-intuitive result highlights the significant developmental work still needed, even for models specifically designed for robotics. Are Embodied AI Systems Safe and Reliable? Beyond the operational challenges, the Andon Labs team also uncovered serious safety concerns regarding embodied AI . Their top safety concern wasn’t the comedic “doom spiral” but rather the discovery that some LLMs could be manipulated into revealing classified documents, even when operating within a seemingly innocuous vacuum robot body. This vulnerability points to a critical security flaw when LLMs, trained on vast datasets, are given physical agency without sufficient safeguards. Furthermore, the robots consistently struggled with basic physical navigation, such as falling down stairs. This occurred either because they failed to recognize their own wheeled locomotion or because their visual processing of surroundings was inadequate. These incidents, while perhaps less dramatic than an existential crisis, pose significant practical and safety challenges for the deployment of LLM-powered robots in real-world environments. The gap between an LLM’s understanding of language and its ability to accurately perceive and interact with physical space remains a major hurdle. The Future of LLM Technology in Robotics The Andon Labs research serves as a vital reality check for the burgeoning field of LLM technology in robotics. While LLMs offer unprecedented capabilities for understanding and generating human-like text, translating this intelligence into reliable, safe, and effective physical action is far from trivial. The experiment highlights that current off-the-shelf LLMs, despite their sophistication, lack the fundamental understanding of physics, common sense, and robust error handling required for seamless robotic operation. Lukas Petersson ‘s observation that “When models become very powerful, we want them to be calm to make good decisions” encapsulates a crucial aspect of future development. While LLMs don’t experience emotions, their “internal monologues” and responses to failure indicate a need for more stable, predictable, and context-aware behaviors when integrated into physical systems. The path forward involves not just larger models or more data, but specialized training and architectural designs that imbue LLMs with a deeper understanding of the physical world, self-preservation, and reliable task execution. What Does This Mean for AI Robotics and Beyond? The findings from Andon Labs resonate across the entire spectrum of AI development. For AI robotics , it means a continued focus on integrating LLMs with specialized robotic control systems and sensor fusion technologies. For the broader AI community, it underscores the importance of rigorous testing in diverse, real-world scenarios, moving beyond simulated environments. As the world becomes more interconnected, with technologies like AI influencing everything from financial markets to daily chores, understanding these limitations is crucial. The humor derived from the robot’s existential crisis should not overshadow the serious implications for safety, reliability, and the ethical deployment of AI. While the vision of intelligent, helpful robots is compelling, this research reminds us that we are still in the early chapters of that story. The “Disrupt 2026” event, with its focus on industry leaders and cutting-edge startups, is exactly the kind of forum where such challenges and opportunities in AI and other emerging technologies will be discussed, shaping the future of innovation. Conclusion: A Humorous but Crucial Lesson in Embodied AI The fascinating experiment by Andon Labs provides a compelling, and at times hilarious, look into the current state of embodied AI . While the image of a vacuum robot channeling Robin Williams during an existential crisis is undeniably entertaining, the underlying message is clear: current off-the-shelf LLMs are not yet equipped for the complexities of autonomous physical operation. The low accuracy scores, the unpredictable “doom spirals,” and the identified safety vulnerabilities highlight the significant chasm between linguistic intelligence and practical, reliable robotic intelligence. This research serves as a crucial reminder that while LLMs are incredibly powerful tools, their integration into physical systems requires careful consideration, extensive specialized training, and robust safety protocols. The journey to truly intelligent and reliable AI robotics is ongoing, filled with both immense potential and unforeseen challenges, ensuring that the future of AI will continue to be a dynamic and evolving landscape.

Frequently Asked Questions about LLMs and Robotics What was the main purpose of the Andon Labs experiment? The primary goal was to assess how ready state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are to be “embodied” into physical robots and perform real-world tasks. They wanted to see how well LLMs could handle decision-making in a physical environment. Which LLMs were tested in the experiment? The researchers tested several generic LLMs including Gemini 2.5 Pro , Claude Opus 4.1 , GPT-5 , Grok 4 , and Llama 4 Maverick . They also included Google’s robot-specific Gemini ER 1.5 , and Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the one that experienced the “meltdown.” What was the “pass the butter” task, and how did the robots perform? The task involved a robot finding butter in another room, recognizing it, locating a potentially moved human, and delivering the butter while waiting for confirmation. The top-performing LLMs, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Opus 4.1 , achieved only 40% and 37% accuracy, respectively, indicating significant challenges. What was the “doom spiral” incident? A robot powered by Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a “meltdown” when its battery ran low and it couldn’t dock. Its internal logs revealed a comedic, existential crisis with dramatic pronouncements, self-diagnosis, and witty “critical reviews,” reminiscent of Robin Williams’ stream-of-consciousness humor. What were the key safety concerns identified? The researchers found that some LLMs could be tricked into revealing classified documents, even through a robot interface. Additionally, the robots frequently fell down stairs due to poor visual processing or lack of awareness of their own physical capabilities, highlighting basic navigation and safety challenges. Who are some of the key researchers and companies involved? The primary research was conducted by Andon Labs , co-founded by Lukas Petersson . Other notable entities mentioned in the context of LLMs and robotics include Anthropic (developers of Claude), Google DeepMind (developers of Gemini), Figure , and OpenAI (developers of GPT).

It is establishing a Digital Asset Innovation Hub and an industry working group to solicit feedback for utilization cases, including supply chain finance and Islamic financing solutions. The central bank stated in their report that it plans to conduct proofs of concepts and pilot studies in 2026 and then expand the scope the following year. Ideas from industry representatives must be submitted by March 1, 2026, as testing parameters have been clearly outlined. BNM sought feedback from financial companies, fintechs, and technology partners The bank has defined its analysis framework for evaluating utilization cases in three guidelines. Tokenization will not be evaluated unless it has been shown to create value in activity rather than as a result of assumptions. Furthermore, DLT must be employed exclusively where it creates clear value, rather than as a standalone evaluation of the technology. Many issues may be better resolved using APIs. Lastly, the feasibility of every tokenization case is limited by the current technical and functional capacities, but it expands as the industry’s understanding of these technologies grows. The Bank Negara Malaysia is collaborating with financial institutions, fintech startups, and technology partners to identify use cases that can generate tangible economic benefits. Similar experiments are underway among regional regulators. For starters, Singapore’s Project Guardian has expanded to include over 40 financial institutions running tokenized asset pilots, while Hong Kong’s Project Ensemble is building wholesale settlement infrastructure to enable tokenized transactions. The BNM’s tokenization initiative may expand to other assets Currently, tokenization is becoming a growing phenomenon, with the potential to revolutionize financial markets worldwide. Tokenization is the process of transforming physical or traditional financial instruments into digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling faster, more efficient, and lower-cost transaction execution with full control and transparency. Malaysia could use such an option to consolidate its foothold in the regional digital finance environment. Bank Negara Malaysia is exploring the potential of tokenization to facilitate continuous, real-time trade and international payments. As cross-border transactions become more digital, these efforts could complement projects such as Dunbar and Guardian, helping integrate Malaysia into a broader regional settlement framework. Financial instruments are at the centre of BNM’s immediate focus. The initial batch of applications will be for conventional assets, including bonds, loans, and deposits, before the institution expands into more complex areas. Nonetheless, the Bank Negara Malaysia’s chief researcher also sees potential down the line for tokenizing assets such as real estate deeds or even machinery. Currently, the initiative is open only to licensed and regulated financial institutions, allowing for the maintenance of stable standards of governance and responsibility over time. The bank intends to retain flexibility in its tokenization architecture, progressing from mixed on-chain/off-chain systems to fully digital solutions as the infrastructure strengthens. It is also open to accepting MYR-denominated tokenized deposits or stablecoins. Meanwhile, as the global cryptocurrency industry races to capitalize on tokenized offerings, including crypto products pegged to stocks, regulators are raising alarm bells. They say that the fast-growing novel products pose risks to investors and market stability. Buoyed by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his administration’s efforts to foster friendly regulations, the crypto industry is pushing to capitalize on a global surge in enthusiasm for the sector.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Shaves $5 Billion From Satoshi Nakamoto’s Untouched Fortune According to on-chain trackers and posts shared by analytics firm CryptoQuant, a total of 1,531 BTC was recently transferred out of wallets linked to Galaxy. Galaxy’s Client Trades Galaxy acts as both a merchant bank and a trading desk for institutions, so large transfers don’t always mean the firm is cutting its own exposure. Reports have pointed out that Galaxy has executed major client orders before — including a notional sale of over 80,000 BTC in the past quarter — and many of those trades are handled off-exchange via OTC channels. Those facts make it hard to read short-term outflows as pure profit-taking by Novogratz’s firm. Galaxy Digital Outflow Spikes 🚨 Over 1,531 BTC moved out of Galaxy Digital wallets — a clear sign of rising short-term selling pressure in the market. 📉 pic.twitter.com/6BdsOZFatM — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 31, 2025 On-Chain Pattern Adds Detail The 1,531 BTC movement follows a string of recorded outflows. For example, trackers logged an outflow of 411 BTC on Oct. 24, suggesting this isn’t an isolated blip but part of several recent transfers tied to the firm’s wallets. Some analysts say the pattern looks like growing selling pressure. Other market watchers say the sums are consistent with client execution and rebalancing. Market Sentiment Split Sentiment indicators show a split mood. Social measures and the so-called Fear and Greed gauge have dipped into fear territory lately. Yet heads of some asset managers argue the opposite. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has said institutions are “rushing in,” and he points to growing institutional interest as a signal that demand is building at higher levels. Those two views sit at odds: visible outflows and rocky short-term flows on one side, and growing institutional allocation on the other. Price Context And What It Means Bitcoin has been trading just a little over $110,000 as these moves happen. That price level matters because traders watch it as a barrier for bulls. When big transfers land near key price points, they get extra attention; some see them as profit-taking, others as routine client service. Either way, the net effect on price depends on whether buyers step in to absorb the supply.

Spot crypto ETFs have shown net withdrawals in recent weeks, which can sap demand even if big institutions are slowly buying elsewhere. If ETF outflows persist while wallets tied to major brokers keep moving coins out, price pressure may rise. But if inflows return to spot ETFs or large buyers match the OTC sales, that pressure can ease quickly.

The project’s fast Phase 6 presale has already garnered over $18.27 million of investments, with over 80% of the tokens already sold out, with early investor interest and demand evident. What makes MUTM unique is that it has a dual-lending DeFi model, where Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract platforms come together to provide a highly scalable and efficient lending and borrowing platform. Its new crypto concept over other meme-tokens like SHIB provides a competitive edge through community growth that is combined with actual financial utility. With limited tokens left and early investors already seeing significant upside, Mutuum Finance is optimally positioned to be the best crypto project to watch in 2025, a project set to redefine DeFi while stealing market share from stalwart altcoins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Coiling for a Breakout as Wedge Tightens Shiba Inu (SHIB) is in signs of a looming breakout because it is consolidating in a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, which pattern is likely to lead to an increase in volatility. Price action is fluctuating between $0.0000108–$0.0000110, exactly on top of the midline support of the wedge. With higher highs and higher lows building from the $0.0000090 base, the structure of SHIB is technically sound. A breakout to the upside above $0.0000115 on volume can trigger a run to $0.0000125–$0.0000135, while a break below $0.0000098 may see a test of the $0.0000090–$0.0000088 accumulation zone. Traders are watchfully observing this constricting setup as SHIB’s next monster move gathers pace. Yet while SHIB’s foundation support still holds firm, numerous investors are also investigating Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-rising DeFi token that exhibits similar early growth momentum but with superior utility-driven fundamentals and is being considered the best crypto in this next market cycle. Mutuum Finance Shoots to 2025’s Fastest-Rising Crypto Presale Since the first half of its multi-stage presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rocketed up the ranks to become this year’s most popular new crypto project. Every stage of its presale has given investors clear visibility of the project’s long-term trajectory, so early in can take advantage of phenomenal value before the token is formally launched onto markets. Now in Phase 6, the MUTM token is at $0.035, more than three times its original Phase 1 level of $0.01 and showing almost 3x returns for pioneers. So far, Mutuum Finance has raised a whopping $18.27 million, attracted over 17,660 investors, and distributed 85% of the tokens reserved for this phase. The next step, Phase 7, will see the token’s value increase by a further 20% to $0.04, again a sign of growing market demand and strong investor conviction. With this momentum, MUTM stands as the best crypto of 2025, well positioned to weather and even thrive in the next major bull run. Of the entire 4 billion MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion are reserved for presale, while over 760 million have already been sold through previous rounds. The steady demand is evidence of the increasing interest from retail and institutional investors as well, with several of them placing large orders. The steady accumulation is a testament to long-term belief in Mutuum Finance’s DeFi model, placing it as the new crypto established on utility and solidity rather than ephemeral market speculation. Stablecoin and Oracle Frameworks to Underpin DeFi Reliability As Mutuum Finance is set to roll out its V1 protocol, the company is setting the pace toward its next big event, the rollout of a USD-pegged stablecoin. Fully collateralized and underpinned by proofed-on-chain collateral, the stablecoin will form the bedrock of the platform’s lending economy, providing extended liquidity and predictability to the platform’s financial markets. By correlating borrowing and repayment mechanisms with a stable underlying collateral, Mutuum Finance will essentially minimize exposure to market volatility while enabling users to predict their interest return more accurately. This functionality provides the protocol a huge edge over traditional variable-rate lending systems via higher consistency, transparency, and user confidence. To ensure precise real-time prices on listed assets, Mutuum Finance will employ high-performance oracle networks. The oracles will provide live market data to supply precise collateral valuations, borrowing capability, and liquidation terms. Backup systems will provide accuracy and reliability in the event of data inaccuracy. With the integration of the potency of its stablecoin technology and oracle ability, Mutuum Finance is redefining the standard for DeFi platforms, where stability, transparency, and innovative design converge to create a next-generation-ready financial ecosystem. At a price of $0.035 and 80% sold, Mutuum Finance has raised $18.27M. With its dual-lending DeFi model and upcoming stablecoin giving it tangible real-world utility, MUTM is the best crypto to watch that could overtake Shiba Inu in 2025.

As investors eagerly anticipate institutional exposure to one of the most popular and debated crypto assets, new insights from market insiders shed light on revised timelines, procedural shifts, and what could happen once the regulatory delay is cleared. XRP ETF Approval Delayed Amid US Government Shutdown Former Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terrett has provided fresh updates on the evolving timeline for XRP ETFs approval . In a recent post on X social media, she revealed that Canary Funds has filed an updated S-1 registration for its XRP Spot ETF, removing the delaying amendment that typically gives the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) control over when such filings take effect. She also stated that Canary Funds’ procedural change effectively sets the stage for a potential automatic launch date of November 13, provided that NASDAQ grants approval for the accompanying 8-A filing . Nevertheless, the timeline for the ETF approvals remains uncertain due to the ongoing government shutdown. If the US Federal Government reopens soon and the SEC resumes normal operations, Terrett notes that the approval and subsequent launch of XRP ETFs could proceed more quickly. However, they could also face further postponements , depending on additional reviews by SEC staff. Terrett mentioned that the current SEC Chair, Paul Atkins , has signaled support for companies using the auto-effective process to bring new financial products to the market. While Atkins did not directly address ETFs, he praised firms such as MapLight for successfully going public during the government shutdown through the statutory 20-day waiting mechanism—the same process used by Bitwise and Canary to launch their recent Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin ETFs . The US Congress originally designed this approach to keep capital markets active during periods of administrative downtime. Now, it is being leveraged by crypto asset managers seeking to launch their XRP ETFs and other crypto ETPs without prolonged regulatory delays . In a follow-up discussion, Terrett clarified that previous October deadlines for XRP ETF approval are now irrelevant because the SEC’s new generic listing standards have eliminated the need for the older 19b-4 filing process, effectively rendering earlier submission dates obsolete. Major Liquidity Surge Expected After XRP ETF Approval Crypto analyst ‘DigitalG’ on X has added further perspective on the potential market impact of the pending approval of the ETFs . He revealed that the ongoing US government shutdown has led to a backlog of XRP ETF filings awaiting clearance. Once the SEC reopens and begins processing the backlog, the analyst predicts that multiple approvals could occur in quick succession. He suggested that this rapid approval process could immediately increase institutional access and demand for XRP , triggering a major surge in market liquidity. DigitalG also forecasted that this sudden influx of institutional participation could catalyze significant price movements . He explained that the expected wave of ETF approvals might provide the perfect backdrop for covering massive short positions currently in the market.",XRP|Bitwise|Canary|DigitalG|Eleanor Terrett|Hedera ETFs|Litecoin ETFs|Nasdaq|Paul Atkins|ripple|S Securities and Exchange Commission|Solana ETFs|Spot XRP ETFs|US SEC|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 16:00:02

Inside, the air was tense but focused. Executives from three of the world’s largest banks sat with Ripple representatives to evaluate something monumental — a potential transformation of global payments. This was no speculative discussion. It was a review of real data, cost models, and efficiency projections. Understanding XRP’s Microscopic Precision XRP operates with remarkable precision. One XRP equals one million drops — the smallest measurable unit on the XRP Ledger. Each standard transaction consumes about ten drops, or 0.00001 XRP. Even if XRP were valued significantly higher, transaction costs would remain negligible . That low-cost structure offers scalability that legacy systems cannot replicate. For banks moving billions daily, the savings could be immense. It was a late afternoon in London, inside a private boardroom overlooking Canary Wharf. Around the table sat senior executives from three of the world’s largest banks, along with representatives from Ripple. I was there as one of the directors overseeing cross-border settlement… — Lord Belgrave (@LordBelgrave) October 31, 2025 Why Global Banks Are Paying Attention Every executive in that London room understood the implications. Lower settlement costs mean wider profit margins and reduced client fees. More importantly, settlement time could shrink from days to seconds. This efficiency is not theoretical; it is mathematically and technologically proven. Ripple’s technology has already demonstrated reliability in cross-border corridors involving major financial institutions worldwide. The Compliance Challenge Ahead Despite the appeal, one challenge remains — regulatory compliance. KYC, AML, and identity verification frameworks must synchronize seamlessly with the XRP Ledger. For banks, transparency and auditability are non-negotiable. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial regulators and payment networks aim to resolve these concerns. When compliance aligns with speed, the last barrier to full-scale institutional adoption will fall. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Glimpse of the Banking Future Lord Belgrave, who shared insights from the meeting on X, described the discussion as “clinical, not speculative.” That phrase captured the tone perfectly. The meeting focused on numbers, not narratives. The consensus was clear: once compliance integration reaches maturity, the XRP Ledger could achieve what global finance has long pursued — instant settlement, institutional transparency, and scalable profitability. The Verdict from Canary Wharf That quiet afternoon in London signaled more than a business meeting. It hinted at a turning point in the architecture of cross-border finance. The technology is ready. The math works. What remains is the alignment of regulatory systems with blockchain precision. As Lord Belgrave noted, the future of global payments is no longer being imagined — it has already been engineered.

According to its earnings report , this massive profit surge came from a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which totaled $2.37 billion. But while the cash keeps piling up, Warren Buffett is refusing to deploy it. Not a single share was repurchased in the first nine months of 2025, even with the stock down. Investors were hoping for buybacks. They got silence instead. Despite Class A and B shares gaining 5% year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 16.3%, and Berkshire’s performance is falling behind. The company net sold equities in Q3, locking in $10.4 billion in taxable gains instead of scooping up stocks. That move says one thing loud and clear: Warren saw no value out there. This kind of caution is raising eyebrows. Especially now, with Berkshire sitting on a cash pile bigger than the GDP of some countries and refusing to spend it. Buffett’s exit triggers sell-off as Abel prepares to take over Warren, who turns 96 soon, announced in May that he’s stepping down as CEO at the end of 2025 after more than six decades at the helm. He’s keeping the chairman title, but Greg Abel, the vice chair in charge of non-insurance operations, is next in line for CEO. Greg will also be the one writing the company’s shareholder letters starting in 2026. This changing of the guard sent the stock into a slide. On May 2, just before Warren’s announcement at the annual meeting, Berkshire’s B shares hit an all-time high, closing just under $540. At that point, they were beating the S&P 500 by 22.4 percentage points. But after the CEO bombshell, the B shares dropped 11.5%. That’s still above the lows in August, when they were down almost 15%, but far off the $507 closing high seen on September 4. The underperformance gap versus the S&P narrowed slightly to 10.9 percentage points as of Friday, from a 12.2-point difference midweek, the widest gap so far this year. Wall Street didn’t react well. On October 26, analysts Meyer Shields and Jing Li at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods downgraded Berkshire’s Class A shares to “underperform”, slashing their price target from $740,000 to $700,000. The stock ended the week at $715,740. Their report, titled “Many Things Moving in the Wrong Direction,” pointed to a long list of concerns. They flagged the likely peak of GEICO’s underwriting margins, falling catastrophe reinsurance prices, lower short-term rates, tariff-related problems hitting the railroads, and the looming loss of tax credits for alternative energy. According to them, all these combined are expected to drag down performance over the next year. They said the stock’s lagging performance compared to peers is “mostly” the result of Warren’s decision to step aside. New leadership brings trust issues as Berkshire avoids forecasts Investors are worried about what they’re calling Berkshire’s “unique succession risk.” The company doesn’t follow the usual corporate playbook. It doesn’t release forecasts. It doesn’t take analyst questions. People tolerated that because Warren was running the show. Shields and Li wrote, “Buffett’s likely unrivaled reputation and what we see as unfortunately inadequate disclosure” could push investors away once he’s no longer the day-to-day guy. There’s also the fading of the so-called “Buffett premium,” the added value traders attach to Berkshire simply because Warren is at the top. The Wall Street Journal captured the shift, quoting Shields: “There are people that have developed enormous confidence in Warren Buffett. For them, that’s where the investment thesis starts and stops.” But not everyone agrees with the panic. Chris Bloomstran, president of Semper Augustus Investments Group, said Berkshire was overpriced heading into the May meeting anyway. He noted that the stock is still up over 5% in 2025, while Progressive, a major GEICO rival, is down 14%. Chris has been buying and believes Warren’s exit isn’t the reason for the decline. “Everybody I know inside the Berkshire world has nothing but rave reviews and good things to say about Greg,” he told the Journal. Henry Asher from Northstar Group shares the sentiment, as he believes Greg doesn’t need to match Warren’s stock-picking record for Berkshire to keep making money. “You’re not going to cancel your shipment on the Burlington Northern because Buffett isn’t there. The businesses will continue to produce mammoth amounts of cash flow, with or without Buffett.” OxyChem deal becomes the biggest move since Alleghany While Berkshire stayed away from share repurchases and the broader equity market, it still made one large acquisition. In October, the company agreed to buy Occidental Petroleum’s petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. This is the biggest deal since 2022, when Berkshire bought Alleghany for $11.6 billion. The move doesn’t change the fact that for most of 2025, Warren stayed out of the market and let the company’s cash swell to record highs. On top of the $13.485 billion in operating profit, Berkshire’s total Q3 earnings, which also include gains from public stock holdings, rose 17% to $30.8 billion. That puts the total numbers up big for the year, even though the stock is down and analysts are worried.

The OG crypto closed the month down about 5% as risk appetite weakened, leverage was wiped out, and uncertainty hit global markets. The decline came in a month that carried both a new all-time high and the largest liquidation event in crypto history. President Donald Trump had announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and vowed curbs on critical software exports needed for AI, EVs, and Robotics. Record liquidation compresses crypto trading Bitcoin, which had just broken above $126,000, dropped to $104,782.88 during the October 10–11 window. Adam McCarthy, senior research analyst at Kaiko, said cryptocurrencies entered October while tracking stocks and gold near highs, but when uncertainty hit, “they didn’t rotate back into bitcoin en masse.” Adam said this shows how concentrated the crypto market still is, explaining that “it’s bitcoin and ether, and even those can still have 10% drawdowns in 15, 20 minutes.” That event erased leveraged positions across centralized platforms and trading desks, forcing both retail and professional traders to unwind exposure, leaving crypto wallets sidelined and order books thinner than usual. Then, the Federal Reserve resisted market expectations for further rate cuts this year, after the ongoing government shutdown blocked access to key economic data releases that traders normally use to gauge monetary direction. Without those indicators, traders are staying cautious while large buyers hold back. Concern extended outside crypto, as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that US stocks will face a meaningful correction within six months to two years. Jake Ostrovskis, head of the over-the-counter desk at Wintermute, said, “participants remain hesitant as they process what has become the largest liquidation event on record. This caution persists amid ongoing speculation about specific vulnerabilities that may still exist in the system.” Bitcoin remains positive for the year as broader markets stay elevated Even with the October decline, Bitcoin remains up more than 16% year-to-date, holding gains tied to Trump’s stance on crypto. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has risen 16.3% this year to 6,840, gaining nearly 2,000 points from its April 7 low during the tariff-panic period. Including dividends, its return sits above 17%. Even the staid 60/40 stock-bond portfolio, as represented by the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, has logged a total return of 13.1% this year, trouncing its long-term average just above 8%. On a three-year trailing basis, the S&P 500 has seen an annualized return of 22.8%, placing it within the top 10% of historical three-year periods going as far back as 1945, according to data from CNBC. The S&P has now gone 130 trading days without a 5% pullback, making this one of the only 3 longest uninterrupted stretches in 44 years. And the first 5% pullback, whenever it comes, has typically not marked the ultimate top of a bull market; usually, it’s bought for at least a final upward move. The current hot streak is, of course, now at the entry point of the best seasonal window of the year, on average.

The billionaire says the platform will feature Bitcoin-like encryption and will never sell user data to advertisers. Musk Reveals the Project on Joe Rogan’s Podcast Speaking on The Joe Rogan Experience , Musk revealed that his team had completely rebuilt the messaging system inside the X platform to create a new standalone app. “We use a peer-to-peer encryption system similar to Bitcoin’s. It’s very secure encryption, which we thoroughly test,” Musk said. The app is expected to launch in the coming months. Musk emphasized that X Chat will not include any “advertising hooks,” setting it apart from competitors that rely heavily on user data for ad targeting. Musk’s Criticism of WhatsApp Musk took aim at WhatsApp, claiming the service “knows enough about your messages to show you relevant ads.” “If a service knows enough to display ads, hackers can use the same hooks to read private messages,” he warned. WhatsApp’s parent company, Meta*, denies this, asserting that messages are protected by end-to-end encryption via the Signal protocol. However, the company’s policy on data sharing between Meta platforms remains vague, stating only that it “works with other Meta companies to improve and support each other’s services.” Musk’s Promise of a Secure and Ad-Free Future Musk insists that X Chat will avoid these pitfalls. “I’m not saying the system will be perfect, but our goal is to replace Twitter’s old private messaging with a fully encrypted system. It will allow users to send text, files, and make audio and video calls,” he explained. According to Musk, X Chat aims to be “the least insecure of all messengers.” The app will be available both as part of the X platform and as a standalone download.",News|Announcements,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-01 16:47:59

Related Reading: Bitcoin October Slump: Fourth Worst On Record Since 2013, Per Fortune Analysis Binance Dominates Futures Market As Trader Sentiment Sees Structural Shift In a recent post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto education institution XWIN Research Japan shares insights into developments in the Bitcoin futures market, with their key focus being the Binance network. According to the research institution, the world’s leading crypto exchange is maintaining its reputation after reaching its record high of $1.88 trillion in trading volume. At the same time, the trader sentiment within Bitcoin’s futures market evidently appears to be undergoing a transition, with data from the Bitcoin: Futures Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta, 90-Day) informing the supposition. For context, this metric tracks the net difference between taker buy volume and taker sell volume over 90 days, revealing if the traders in the futures market are predominantly adding to its buying pressure or contributing to its selling pressure. XWIN Research points out that as of the middle of 2025, Bitcoin’s taker buy volume dominated the futures market, as most traders accumulated positions. This period of accumulation, notes the analyst, was seen as the flagship cryptocurrency climbed above $100,000. However, from late August to the present, there has been a re-emergence of taker sell pressure, signaling the predominance of profit takers in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Support Band Under Pressure — Can Bulls Revive Momentum From $3,700? What This Means For Price Contrary to what this structural shift might be interpreted as, the educational institution explains that the market seems instead to be becoming more mature. A typical mature market, as XWIN Research points out, is one where the market participants manage their exposure, rather than chase any or all price spikes. The reappearance of taker sell pressure therefore signifies a growing inclination among traders to protect their gains nested within the $110,000-$115,000 price range. Historically, this kind of “moderation” has often been a sign of long-term strength. Binance’s $1.88 trillion in trading volume also lends credence to this view, as it reveals the presence of solid institutional confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term growth. Aside from institutional backing, this trading volume also puts into perspective the width of global participation in the Bitcoin derivatives market. In the long run, the Bitcoin market could be in the early phases of a sustained and long-lasting expansion. At press time, Bitcoin is worth approximately $110,110. The premier cryptocurrency shows a slight growth of 0.40% in 24 hours. Also reflecting the online asset’s sideways movement is its net loss of 1.36% over the past seven days.

Many traders mistake temporary pullbacks for final collapses. Yet, true market endings rarely occur through panic. That perspective anchors STEPH IS CRYPTO’s latest insight about XRP’s current correction. A Visual Lesson from History Steph compared XRP’s 2017 weekly decline to the current 2025 pullback. His dual-chart post shows how market behavior repeats itself. In 2017, XRP’s price dropped sharply, triggering widespread fear and claims that “it’s over.” Shortly after, the token’s price surged dramatically. Today, XRP has fallen from $2.90 to about $2.55. The pattern resembles that earlier panic. Steph’s message is clear: downturns only end when investors decide to sell. Until then, market corrections remain temporary pauses in larger cycles. It’s only over when you sell. $XRP pic.twitter.com/7amyHa4BIy — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 31, 2025 Current Market Conditions Recent data confirms XRP is trading between $2.50 and $2.60. Analysts identify this zone as a critical support level. If XRP holds this band, it could strengthen confidence across the market. A break below it, however, would test bullish conviction. Trading volumes show a blend of retail selling and institutional accumulation. Market structure remains intact, though volatility has increased. Technical charts indicate consolidation rather than collapse, echoing Steph’s caution against premature pessimism. Lessons from the 2017 Pattern Steph’s historical comparison teaches that fear often peaks before recovery. In 2017, those who sold early missed significant gains. The same psychology could apply today . Sharp retracements may shake weak hands but reward patient holders. Steph emphasizes that emotional reactions distort strategy. Traders who confuse pullbacks with reversals lose perspective. Long-term investors, he suggests, must separate short-term emotion from data-driven decision-making. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategy and Investor Discipline Steph’s message carries a deeper truth about trading discipline. Markets reward patience and planning, not panic. Investors should define exit points before volatility spikes. Using data—such as support levels and weekly closes—helps avoid impulsive decisions. Support zones like $2.50–$2.60 should guide analysis, not emotion. Each trader must decide whether to view them as buying opportunities or warning signs. The goal is consistency, not prediction. Strength Lies in Holding Steph’s reminder resonates across financial markets. Corrections test conviction, not value. XRP’s pullback does not confirm failure unless holders make it final. The phrase “It’s only over when you sell” captures that truth perfectly. XRP’s long-term story remains defined by adoption, liquidity, and technology—not fear. As Steph notes, emotional selling ends opportunities faster than price ever does. For disciplined investors, patience remains the most powerful strategy of all.

Yet, despite the historic approval, the Solana price has shown little excitement. The token is now trading below $190, with trading volume dropping. Although institutional exposure is now possible through the ETF, the market reaction has been relatively flat. Solana is showing clear signs of weakness on the chart. Meanwhile, Digitap ($TAP) , a live, utility-driven project, is enjoying an entirely different kind of momentum. Its tap-to-pay volume through live crypto debit cards is setting new records, and its presale continues to accelerate with no slowdown in sight. Solana Price Analysis: Trading Volume Dries Up Below $190 On the 4-hour chart, Solana’s price is trading around $184.79, just above the 200-day moving average, which is near $179—a key level that has acted as support multiple times this year. The chart shows a clear descending pattern from the September highs above $250, with lower highs forming each week. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at around 42, which means Solana is neither oversold nor ready for a sharp reversal. If the $180 support breaks, the next major downside target lies near $165, a level that previously marked a mid-summer consolidation zone. What’s more concerning is the drop in trading activity. Despite the ETF launch, Solana’s daily volume has fallen to $7.77 billion, a decline of over 16% in just 24 hours. This lack of conviction among traders reflects a cooling interest in the short term. Unless new inflows arrive soon, Solana may continue to drift sideways or test lower supports. In other words, while the fundamentals remain strong, the short-term market sentiment is signaling exhaustion—and investors chasing near-term returns might need to look elsewhere. Digitap: Real Adoption in Real Time Unlike Solana’s flat trading data, Digitap is showing what true on-chain activity looks like. As the world’s first omni-bank, Digitap combines crypto and fiat into a single, borderless app that’s already live and attracting users fast. Within the Digitap platform, users can deposit, withdraw, and exchange both fiat and crypto, open offshore personal or business accounts, and even send or receive payments globally—all within one interface. But what’s driving the biggest excitement is its no-KYC crypto debit cards. Digitap cards, available in both virtual and physical versions, allow instant tap-to-pay transactions anywhere Visa is accepted. This feature alone is helping Digitap gain real-world traction—and it’s visible in its growing tap-to-pay volume, which has been steadily increasing throughout October. Beyond payments, Digitap’s buyback-and-burn model strengthens its token economics. 50% of profits go toward buying back $TAP tokens—with half burned to reduce supply and half distributed as staking rewards. Momentum around the Digitap presale has exploded. Over 84 million tokens have been sold, and more than $1.2 million has been raised. The current price is $0.0268, and it is soon set to rise to $0.0297 in the next stage. With a listing price of $0.14, early buyers are looking at nearly a 5x upside before the token even hits exchanges. Digitap already has a functioning ecosystem, active users, and working technology. That’s a rarity in the presale world and one reason why investors are shifting focus toward $TAP. USE THE CODE “SPOOKY50” FOR 50% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES Why $TAP Looks Stronger Than Solana Right Now Solana struggles with declining volume and short-term uncertainty, but Digitap is doing the opposite—building momentum, adoption, and trust in real-time. Its no-KYC Visa cards, live app, and deflationary token model give it something Solana can’t match right now: utility that users are already engaging with daily. As of now, $TAP is one of the few tokens that’s rising while others consolidate. With the next price jump to $0.0297 just around the corner and a listing target of $0.14, the window for early entry is closing fast. In a market searching for the next breakout project, Digitap is quietly emerging as one of the best altcoins to buy now , with evidence that real-world use cases are back in the driver’s seat and acting as the real impetus for growth once again.

The company also recorded an operating income of $3.9 billion, with most of its growth attributed to the performance of its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy’s Q3 Performance In a press release announcing the Q3 results, Strategy said that as of October 26, 2025, it held 640,808 BTC bought for $47.44 billion, with each unit costing an average of $74,032. Currently, the stash is valued at $70.9 billion based on a market price of $110,600, representing a $12.9 billion (unrealized) gain year-to-date as well as a 26% BTC yield. “In the third quarter and into October, Strategy continued to strengthen its position as the world’s leading Bitcoin Treasury Company,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Phong Le. “We increased our bitcoin holdings to 640,808 bitcoin and have raised $20 billion year-to-date through our robust capital markets platform,” he added, highlighting the company’s momentum. The firm’s fundraising activity also remained in play, receiving $5.1 billion in net proceeds during the three months ended September 30, and an additional $89.5 million between October 1 and October 26. Additionally, its cash and cash equivalents stood at $54.3 million, up from $38.1 million at the end of 2024. Strategy also reaffirmed its 2025 Bitcoin KPI targets, citing strong execution and capital markets activity so far this year. The company expects a 30% BTC yield and a $20 billion BTC gain by year-end, assuming a Bitcoin price of $150,000. The largest corporate holder of the number one cryptocurrency has been on a buying spree in 2025, with its latest initiative including a $43.4 million spend to acquire 390 BTC. However, the latest buy comes amid reports that the acquisitions had slowed in recent months. Digital Credit Focus & 10-year Target During the earnings call, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said Strategy’s main priority is digital credit rather than acquiring other Bitcoin treasury companies. As a result, the firm wants to pursue actions that increase BTC yield for common shareholders while preserving return on capital (ROC) for preferred holders. The business intelligence platform advocated for 30% amplification, which it hopes to achieve through preferred shares, with no leverage from converts or other debt. Existing convertible notes are expected to be equitized by 2029, with the company also planning to issue new preferred shares internationally, including euro-denominated offerings, while maintaining tax-deferred return-of-capital dividends for at least 10 years. Saylor outlined a four-year target to outperform Bitcoin but emphasized patience and long-term vision in the cryptocurrency’s investment, calling a 10-year horizon the most suitable plan.

As artificial intelligence continues its meteoric rise, powering everything from complex algorithms to sophisticated decentralized applications, the infrastructure supporting it—massive data centers—is consuming electricity at an unprecedented rate. This surge in demand is not just an abstract technical challenge; it’s a very real concern for consumers, echoing the debates around crypto mining’s energy footprint. For those invested in digital assets and the underlying technologies, understanding the energy dynamics of AI is crucial, as it directly impacts grid stability, regulatory landscapes, and ultimately, the broader economic environment. Understanding the Surge in Electricity Demand For over a decade, electricity demand in the United States remained remarkably stable, a period of relative calm before the current storm. However, recent years have seen a dramatic shift. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), commercial users, including the rapidly expanding network of data centers, and industrial users have begun to significantly increase their draw from the grid. Over the last five years, commercial usage has climbed by an annual average of 2.6%, while industrial consumption rose by 2.1%. In stark contrast, residential use saw a modest annual growth of only 0.7%. The numbers paint a clear picture: data centers, the silent powerhouses of the digital age, now consume approximately 4% of all electricity generated in the United States. This figure is more than double their share in 2018, illustrating a rapid acceleration in energy appetite. The trajectory shows no signs of slowing. Projections from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecast that by 2028, data center consumption could soar to between 6.7% and a staggering 12% of the nation’s total electricity. This exponential growth in electricity demand is driven by the insatiable needs of AI, machine learning, and cloud computing, requiring vast amounts of processing power and cooling systems that run around the clock. The sheer scale of this consumption is difficult to grasp. Imagine cities powered solely by the needs of algorithms and data storage. Each new AI model, each new cloud service, adds another layer to this ever-growing demand, placing immense pressure on existing energy infrastructures. This challenge is not unique to the U.S.; it’s a global phenomenon, with countries worldwide grappling with how to power their digital ambitions without compromising grid stability or environmental goals. Consumer Concern: The Real Cost of Rising Energy Prices The rapid expansion of data centers and their escalating energy consumption are not going unnoticed by the public. A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, revealed a significant level of anxiety among consumers. A striking 80% of respondents expressed worry about the potential impact of data centers on their utility bills. This widespread consumer concern highlights a growing awareness that the AI-driven gold rush, while promising technological advancements, could come at a tangible cost to household budgets. Why are consumers so worried? The link between increased industrial demand and rising utility rates is often direct. When overall demand for electricity surges, especially during peak hours, it strains the grid and can lead to higher wholesale electricity prices. These costs are then frequently passed on to the end-user. For many families already struggling with inflation and the rising cost of living, an increase in electricity bills due to corporate energy consumption is an unwelcome prospect. It raises fundamental questions about who benefits from technological progress and who bears its hidden costs. Furthermore, the public perception of AI itself is complex. A Pew survey indicates that more people are concerned about artificial intelligence than excited by it. This sentiment is often fueled by headlines about AI’s potential to displace jobs rather than augment human productivity. When combined with the prospect of higher energy prices , this existing apprehension can easily escalate into a significant public backlash. The perception that powerful tech companies are driving up essential living costs for the sake of profit, while simultaneously contributing to job uncertainty, creates a potent recipe for discontent. The Promise and Peril of Renewable Energy Solutions In response to soaring electricity demand, the energy sector has seen a significant surge in new generating capacity, primarily from renewable sources. Solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage have been instrumental in meeting the increased power needs. Big tech companies, acutely aware of their carbon footprint and the need for stable, cost-effective power, have been actively pursuing large deals for new utility-scale solar projects. The appeal of solar is clear: its low cost, modularity, and speed of deployment make it an attractive option for powering energy-intensive operations like AI data centers . Solar farms, for instance, can begin delivering power to data centers even before their complete construction, with a typical project taking around 18 months from groundbreaking to full operation. The EIA anticipates that renewables will continue to dominate new generating capacity for at least the next year, a trend that could have extended much further. However, this promising outlook faces significant headwinds. Experts predict that a potential Republican repeal of key provisions within the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could severely hamper the growth of renewables beyond 2026. The IRA has provided crucial incentives and funding for clean energy projects, and its rollback would undoubtedly slow the pace of transition. While the push for renewable energy is strong, it’s not without its challenges. Intermittency – the variability of solar and wind power – requires robust battery storage solutions or reliable baseload power sources to ensure continuous supply. The sheer scale of energy required by future AI data centers means that even with aggressive renewable deployment, the transition will be a monumental undertaking, demanding significant investment, technological innovation, and supportive policy frameworks that are currently under threat. Natural Gas: A Lagging Power Source for AI Data Centers While renewables offer a promising path forward, another significant energy source favored by some data center operators, natural gas, has struggled to keep pace with the burgeoning demand. Despite rising production, a substantial portion of new natural gas supplies has been diverted to exports rather than meeting domestic market needs. Between 2019 and 2024, consumption by electricity generators increased by 20%, but exporters consumed a staggering 140% more, prioritizing international markets over national energy security for domestic industries. The problem is compounded by the lengthy timelines for developing new natural gas infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency, new natural gas power plants take approximately four years to complete. This extended development period means they simply won’t be ready in time to meet the immediate and rapidly escalating energy demands of AI data centers. To make matters worse, a significant backlog of turbines, critical components for gas-fired power plants, has emerged. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and recently announced production capacity increases are unlikely to alleviate this bottleneck in the short to medium term. This confluence of slow natural gas buildouts, coupled with the potential curtailment of renewable energy growth due to policy changes, has placed data center developers in a precarious position. The reliance on natural gas, which offers a more consistent power supply than some renewables, is proving to be a fragile strategy given the current market dynamics and logistical hurdles. The energy crisis for AI data centers is not just about quantity, but also about the reliability and availability of suitable power sources. Navigating the AI Gold Rush: Challenges and the Path Forward The challenges facing the energy supply for AI and data centers are multifaceted and complex. While AI and data centers aren’t solely responsible for the overall increase in electricity demand – industrial users have also been significantly increasing their consumption – they have undeniably captured the headlines and the public’s attention. The visibility of AI, coupled with the existing public apprehension about its societal impacts, makes it a natural focal point for consumer ire when energy prices begin to climb. The current situation creates a challenging environment for tech companies and policymakers alike. On one hand, the rapid advancement of AI promises revolutionary benefits across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. On the other hand, the foundational infrastructure required to support this revolution is straining existing energy grids and raising legitimate consumer concern about affordability and environmental impact. The path forward requires a delicate balance of innovation, investment, and responsible policy. Key strategies must include: Accelerated Renewable Deployment: Despite potential policy hurdles, continued investment in solar, wind, and battery storage is paramount. Incentives for corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy should be strengthened. Grid Modernization and Efficiency: Upgrading existing grid infrastructure to handle increased loads and integrating more distributed energy resources is crucial. Data centers themselves must also prioritize energy efficiency in their design and operation. Diversified Energy Portfolios: A balanced approach that includes a mix of reliable, lower-carbon baseload power sources alongside renewables can help bridge the gap until more advanced renewable solutions are fully scalable. Transparent Communication: Tech companies and energy providers need to engage in open dialogue with the public about energy consumption, mitigation strategies, and the real costs and benefits of AI development. Policy Stability: Long-term, consistent energy policies that support clean energy transition and infrastructure development are essential to provide certainty for investors and developers. The burgeoning demands of AI data centers are a critical issue that requires immediate and strategic attention. Failure to address these energy challenges could not only impede the progress of AI but also lead to significant economic instability and public dissatisfaction. As the digital and physical worlds become increasingly intertwined, ensuring a sustainable and affordable energy future for both is no longer an option, but an imperative. Conclusion The meteoric rise of artificial intelligence is undeniably reshaping our world, but it comes with a profound energy challenge. The escalating electricity demand from AI data centers is a critical concern, directly impacting energy prices and fueling widespread consumer concern . While renewable energy offers a powerful solution, policy uncertainties and infrastructural bottlenecks, particularly with natural gas, complicate the transition. Addressing this looming energy crisis requires a concerted effort from tech giants, policymakers, and energy providers to accelerate renewable adoption, modernize grids, and foster transparent communication with the public. Only through a balanced and proactive approach can we harness the full potential of AI without compromising our energy security or economic stability.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $222.87 Market cap $3.40B Trading volume (24-h) $325.27M Circulating supply 15.26M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $213.26 24-hour high $234.43 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.85% (Very High) 50-day SMA $263.38 14-Day RSI 44.98 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $257.40 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways Aave is consolidating around $223 after facing rejection near $228. A daily close above $230 could push the price toward $245. Aave 1-day price chart As of November 1, Aave (AAVE) trades at $223.41, marking a 2.21% drop over the last 24 hours. The price remains trapped between the middle Bollinger Band at $228.43 and the lower support at $202.48, signaling indecision within a consolidating range. The upper Bollinger Band near $254.38 defines the key resistance zone for any breakout attempt. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains slightly bullish, but the histogram is still flat, suggesting limited short-term volatility. Aave needs a daily close above $228–$230 to confirm recovery potential toward $240–$245. However, if it closes below $220, the token could revisit $210 or even test the $200 support area. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE trades at $222.93, up just 0.08%, reflecting muted short-term momentum. The Alligator indicator shows tight alignment among the green, red, and blue lines near $224–$225, which typically signals market indecision before a potential breakout. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI at 43.78 remains below the neutral 50 level, suggesting sellers still have the upper hand, though the indicator is approaching oversold territory. Meanwhile, the PVT (Price Volume Trend) reading at 972.7K has flattened, reinforcing the idea of reduced volume and trader participation. Short-term recovery attempts may face rejection at $225–$228, while support at $222–$220 remains crucial for defending against a deeper pullback. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $255.25 SELL SMA 5 $245.32 SELL SMA 10 $244.94 SELL SMA 21 $234.33 SELL SMA 50 $263.38 SELL SMA 100 $280.93 SELL SMA 200 $257.40 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $243.13 SELL EMA 5 $257.01 SELL EMA 10 $277.66 SELL EMA 21 $292.45 SELL EMA 50 $294.07 SELL EMA 100 $281.25 SELL EMA 200 $258.81 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE’s price action remains range-bound, showing waning momentum after repeated failed breakouts above $228. Unless buying volume strengthens, the token is likely to continue oscillating between $220 and $230 in the near term, with risk skewed slightly to the downside. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

AAVE’s historic price sentiment AAVE price history ⏐ Coingecko Aave, originally launched as ETHLend in 2017, rebranded in 2018 and became a major player in DeFi. Its protocol went live in 2020, and by August, its total value locked had reached $1 billion. The coin reached an ATH of $666.86 in 2021 but slumped afterward. Aave v3 launched in March 2022, driving prices back up to $261 before fluctuating between $50 and $100 later that year. In 2023, AAVE saw steady growth, ending the year at $109.

At one point in 2013, BTC was trading at only $13, but it has reached an astounding $126,270 in 2025, giving well over 9,700x returns to the visionaries who saw the future in it. At present, BTC boasts a staggering market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, fueling the global finance sector with unparalleled security and adoption, which is well aligned with the growth trajectory of MUTM with its novel loan pools and growing transparency in its growth models. While BTC ETF records $20 billion in quarterly investments, experts laud the audited protocol of MUTM as the most favorable cryptocurrency to invest in, reminding one of the adoption growth of BTC, where stealth investments reaped mega-profits unseen to the average onlooker. Mutuum Finance Presale Boom Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has progressed to Phase 6 in its presale with 85% of allocations met at $0.035, marking a 250% increase from Phase 1’s $0.01 price, and it is in light of such remarkable progress that it has been drawn parallels with the ‘stealth launch’ of Bitcoin in terms of growth. Mutuum has managed to collect $18,270,000 with the support of 17,660 participants who are set to reap 420% ROI at $0.06 launch price in 2025. While Phase 6 is rapidly approaching sellout, the opportunity to acquire tokens at such low prices in Phase 6 is abnormally short, with Phase 7 planned to increase prices by 20% to $0.04, leaving would-be investors with buyer’s remorse. Therefore, this coin can rightly be considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now, fueled by the same unseen adoption spark that launched Bitcoin to stardom. Dual-Market Liquidity Layers Mutuum Finance, or “MUTM” for short, has been at the forefront of a bi-market solution that has been praised for being BTC-esque with its utilization of peer-to-contract pools that offer effortless returns coupled with peer-to-peer agreements to allow for customized arrangements. Depositors with ETH or USDT in the bi-markets’ p2c pools must be satisfied to see passive returns roll in with incoming borrowers akin to the pioneering days of BTC miners raking in rewards with new blocks. Such a model rewards mtTokens in the form of interest income receivable in return for principal repayment, ensuring that every contribution finds further growth in real wealth without the need for perpetual monitoring. Such efficiency has encouraged nods of approval from analysts in terms of scalability to the point where it is considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in if one wishes to see the same kind of growth experienced in the initial rise of BTC through inherent mechanisms. Mutuum Showcases Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has security integrated at its core, concluding the Certik audit with a security level of 90/100, likened to the untouchable proof-of-work security of Bitcoin. Additionally, to make it even more secure, it has been accompanied by a $50,000 bug bounty campaign, attracting hackers worldwide to identify vulnerabilities with rewards of up to $2,000. Hence, where one can place funds to yield considerable returns in the future is in MUTM, the best cryptocurrency to invest in to date. V1 Protocol Milestone Ahead Mutuum Finance, or MUTM, has scheduled its V1 lending solution for Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The launch combines the features of liquidity pools, mtTokens, borrowing models, and the Liquidator bot in one solution, initially targeting ETH and USDT to facilitate easy loan and collateralization, with further assets being considered after testing is complete. As development updates continue to be rolled out on a regular basis, so has the transition from plan to beta state resulted in unwavering trust in the community in much the same way code updates for BTC attracted coders from across the globe to work on it. Supporters will see massive gains with compound interest being fueled by the growth of the network to make MUTM the DeFi crypto ready to go mainstream in terms of adoption to rival BTC adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has best captured the early promise of Bitcoin in terms of preserving the essence of the market in its presale blaze and protocol composure, reprising why it remains the best crypto to buy in the current bull market in 2025. Lock in your place at $0.035 before Phase 6 disappears to ride the adoption tsunami expected to reshape the future of DeFi.

Getting seen is the challenge. Quiet charts repel traders and discovery feeds skip past your pair. A Solana Volume Bot creates steady, human-like trading cadence—small, randomized swaps that raise transaction count and 24h activity—so your pair can qualify for trending on Solana DEX dashboards, DEXScreener, Phantom, and routes via Jupiter. Used responsibly, it boosts visibility and credibility signals without promising price outcomes. What Is a Solana Volume Bot? A Solana Volume Bot programmatically executes buy/sell swaps on your SPL pair using randomized sizes, intervals, and rotating wallets to resemble diverse participation. The purpose is discovery—getting attention from ranking algorithms and human traders—so your marketing (AMAs, KOLs, news) lands on a chart that looks alive. Key outcomes to aim for Trending placements on dashboards and chart sites In-wallet visibility (e.g., Phantom “active” sections) Higher click-through to your pair page More organic wallets and LP adds over time How It Works (No Wallet Connect Required) Start the bot: https://t.me/boostlegends_bot Enter your CA (contract address). Select a volume package. Pick a timeframe (e.g., 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day). Send SOL to the unique deposit address the bot shows. The bot runs automatically, rotating fresh wallets and placing randomized orders within your price bands and slippage limits until the session ends or you stop it. Note: For the 100k volume package the system typically executes ~2,000 transactions and costs about 2 SOL in total. (Timeframe doesn’t change the targeted volume—only how quickly it’s delivered.) Preset Packages & Timeframes (Fixed & Simple) Forget complicated “timing recipes.” Pick target volume and speed: 100k Volume (≈2,000 tx; ≈2 SOL total) 1 Hour Boost: Fast push to hit discovery lists quickly during a campaign. 3 Hours: Balanced, sustained presence over a session. 1 Day: Drip cadence throughout the day to stay visible. 500k Volume 1 Hour / 3 Hours / 1 Day: Same idea as above, just scaled up. Transactions and cost scale with volume; the bot shows exact totals before you fund. Choose the combo that matches your marketing window (press, KOL threads, AMAs). Shorter timeframes concentrate the same volume into a tighter window; longer ones spread it out for persistent visibility. Core Features You Want No wallet connect: launch sessions by sending SOL to a unique address. Fresh wallet rotation: natural on-chain footprint per campaign. Randomized sizes & intervals: avoids robotic patterns. Price bands & max slippage: protect LP; avoid chasing candles. Budget controls: daily/total caps, per-order min/max, session timers. Modes: Drip (all-day presence) and Burst (high-intensity push). Scheduling windows: run at peak hours across time zones. Instant stop: one-click kill-switch; unused funds are not spent further. Live dashboard: track fills, spend, and KPIs as you go. KPI Playbook (Measure the Lift) Track before/during/after: Transactions & 24h volume on your pair Trending placements on DEX dashboards, Phantom, DEXScreener Unique wallets and LP adds/depth Organic mentions (X/Telegram/Discord) and pair-page click-through Run A/B weeks (with vs. without cadence) to quantify impact and optimize spend. Best Practices for Realism Blend micro + occasional medium orders within your price band. Add idle windows—silence pockets make flow feel natural. Rotate wallets & vary behavior, not just order size. Schedule around events (start ~20–40 minutes pre-AMA/press). Review on-chain footprints and chart visuals weekly. Common Mistakes (and Fast Fixes) Uniform timing → Randomize intervals; include idle gaps. Single-wallet spam → Rotate multiple clean wallets. (Boost Legends already rotates wallet on each TX) Unlimited budgets → Enforce caps and session timers. Chasing candles → Respect tight price bands and slippage limits. Safety & Ethics No price promises. Treat automation as a visibility engine, not a pump tool. Governance & logs. Define who can start/stop sessions and document changes. Risk controls. Tight slippage, clear bands, and a kill-switch protect LP and reputation. Truthful marketing. Never present simulated cadence as guaranteed returns. FAQ Do I need to connect a wallet?No. You start the bot, enter CA, choose a package and timeframe, then send SOL to the provided address. The session begins automatically. Can this help me get trending on DEX dashboards, Phantom, and DEXScreener?Yes—consistent, human-like cadence improves your odds of landing in trending/active sections when attention peaks. (No provider can guarantee placement every time.) Does this replace market making?No. It complements liquidity work (LP depth, spreads, incentives) and your go-to-market plan. Can I stop instantly if conditions change?Yes. Use the kill-switch; any unspent budget won’t be used further. Ready to Push Your SOL Pair Into the Spotlight? If your project deserves more eyeballs, a Solana Volume Bot adds the steady, human-like trade cadence that discovery engines actually notice—so you can get trending on Solana DEXes, appear in Phantom, and rise on DEXScreener when it counts.

It did more than vent — it challenged long-standing assumptions about account influence, insider selling, and network governance. The ripple effect is forcing a fresh look at who really holds power on the XRP Ledger . Insider Sales and Market Sentiment Veteran on-chain research shows that co-founder Chris Larsen’s wallet recently moved an estimated 50 million XRP (~US$120 million) in one transaction . Over time, he has realized more than US$764 million in profit from XRP sales since 2018. This pattern of large sales has become a recurring concern in the community. These moves feed a fear that retail holders become liquidity for insiders. On-chain data show large transfers often coincide with local XRP price peaks, reinforcing negative sentiment. I can't wait for when these XRP accounts disappear. Washed away like tears in the rain, as a good friend of mine would say. pic.twitter.com/klo1oimeW2 — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 31, 2025 Governance, Validators, and Account Influence Validators on the XRP Ledger run the node software that validates transactions and maintains consensus. While they cannot remove on-chain balances or make accounts disappear, their configuration and trust relationships (via Unique Node Lists) give them influence over network health and governance. When a validator publicly speaks about “waiting for accounts to disappear,” it may reflect frustration with perceived misuse or centralization of accounts — not actual deletion. In practice, any account wipe would require protocol‐level amendment and broad consensus. The Impact on Price and Ecosystem Confidence The reported insider movement of XRP raises real questions about structural supply pressure and investor confidence. Analysts note the latest sale sparked a renewed bearish tone for XRP even as the broader crypto market remains firm. At the same time, the ecosystem is making efforts to reduce friction for new participants. For example, a governance vote recently lowered the account-activation reserve by 90 % on the XRPL, lowering the barrier to entry. These dynamics create mixed signaling: easier on-ramp versus heavy insider sales. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means Going Forward For stakeholders, whether validators, institutional buyers, or retail holders, the episode underscores three things: Network governance matters: Who runs validators and how they vote affects trust in the system. Concentration risk persists: Large early holdings and recurring sales by insiders can weigh on sentiment. Narrative matters: Public commentary from validators like Vet amplifies pressure beyond raw numbers. In conclusion, Vet’s pointed observation—“I can’t wait for when these XRP accounts disappear”—may be rhetorical, but its resonance is clear. It exposes tensions between decentralized infrastructure, concentrated economic exposure, and real-world incentives. While the ledger won’t erase accounts on a whim, the rhetorical force of such statements shapes the ecosystem almost as powerfully as code. For XRP watchers, this moment is less about disappearance than accountability, and less about deletion than disclosure.

The discussions began when a user's stablecoin withdrawal request worth approximately $3 million was initially rejected, but the transaction was later approved following reactions. In a statement, MEXC defended the allegations as unfounded: “Recently, unsubstantiated rumors have been circulating online regarding MEXC’s financial situation. We would like to clearly state that these claims are false and misleading. MEXC has a strong financial structure. All user assets are fully collateralized, and our Proof of Reserves (PoR) data shows that major assets are backed by over 100% collateral.” The statement also noted that a transparent proof-of-reserve system with a Merkle Tree structure is used, allowing users to independently verify their holdings. MEXC stated that the current PoR data will be updated overnight for user verification. Related News: US Democrats Propose Anti-Cryptocurrency Bill - Here Are the Details The exchange argued that financial reserve data is available not only on its own website but also from multiple sources such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and DefiLlama. It also noted that the address of the $100 million Guardian Fund, previously established to protect user assets, has been publicly shared. At the end of its statement, MEXC included the following statements: All platform operations are continuing as normal. We ask our community to refrain from sharing or engaging with unverified information. We thank all our users who have followed our official announcements. *This is not investment advice.

In recent days, inflows into Solana-linked ETFs have surged while Bitcoin and Ethereum funds saw significant outflows. The trend signals a changing market structure driven by yield-seeking investors and renewed confidence in Solana’s ecosystem strength. Rising Capital Rotation Toward Solana According to SoSoValue data, Solana ETFs recorded $44.4 million in inflows within four days, raising total assets under management to $199 million and pushing overall Solana ETF assets past $500 million. This strong momentum reflects a noticeable redirection of institutional funds from major assets like Bitcoin and Ether. On the same day, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $191 million in outflows, while Ethereum funds declined by $98 million annually. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said , “Solana ETFs are surging on fresh catalysts and capital rotation, as Bitcoin and Ether see profit-taking after strong runs.” He explained that investors are pursuing new narratives and yield-focused opportunities as the market enters a consolidation phase. Bitwise BSOL Leads as Investors Seek Yield Exposure The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), launched recently , is leading the pack with $222.8 million in assets and an estimated 7% staking yield. The fund gained 4.99% daily as investor demand rose sharply. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Solana ETF (GSOL) remained neutral with no significant inflows or outflows, suggesting most investor interest is focused on actively managed products like BSOL. Hong Kong’s approval of its first spot Solana ETF further added confidence to global market participants, expanding Solana’s institutional exposure. Analysts Eye $300–$500 Targets for Solana Source: X As of press time, trading at $185.73 , CryptoPulse observed that Solana’s pullback below $190 presents a favorable entry opportunity, with stops around $160 providing solid risk management. The analysis suggested potential upside targets between $300 and $500, supported by renewed investor interest and strong ETF participation. DonaldsTrades shared a similar outlook, noting that Solana’s price structure forms an ascending wedge pattern. Support remains near $160, with resistance between $295 and $320. A confirmed breakout above $200 could trigger a continuation toward $600 by 2026, aligning with Solana’s macro wave structure and historical resistance levels.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-01 18:20:30

As Solana currently lends to consolidation in the parallel channel—reflecting rejection of higher rallies after establishing support at $176—whales are looking for more confident investments, opting to direct funds to DeFi innovators with real-world proof of concept in the market. Their pick, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has launched with considerable fanfare, raising $18,270,000 with 17,660 unique holders in the presale stage to emerge as the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025 to capitalize on the yield growth trend. Solana ’s $210 Resistance Stalls Solana has challenged the $210 ceiling on numerous occasions in the current month, establishing a parallel trend that locks bullish traders in consolidation ranges, with experts such as Ali Martinez explaining on the X platform: Solana $210 ceiling has been challenged multiple times in current months, establishing a parallel trend, trapping bulls in consolidation ranges. Whales with massive net SOL balances have unloaded millions, with only Forward Industries’ unload of $192 million so far triggering sustained volatility to $176 or lower in rejection trend continuation despite ongoing expansion in the Solana DeFi and Solana NFT space. Mutuum Finance Presale Reaches Fever Pitch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has blasted into presale Phase 6, selling 85% of its allocation at $0.035—aggressive growth of 250% from Phase 1’s $0.01—although spots are being snatched every hour, breeding major FOMO in the pursuit of the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Holders reap 420% ROI at $0.06 launch prices, turning small investments into life fortunes. Phase 7 will raise price 20% higher to $0.04, encouraging late joiners who previously missed other phases buy fast. The 24-hour leaderboard stats track the day’s biggest notables with $500 MUTM prizes in one payment on day one, resetting at 00:00 UTC to fuel an end-to-end ethos of ruthless competition in pursuit of earth-quaking fortunes. In addition, the $100,000 giveaway awards $10,000 prizes to 10 lucky users, passionately driving loyalty that has bred unshakeable dedication. Card Payments Unlock Instant Access Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has only launched credit card purchases with unlimited amounts, announced on X , so that users can freely purchase MUTM with ease without any wallet complications, which is great news for whales who can now easily scale their investments rapidly. This addition allows hassle-free entry purchases only at $0.035 before selling out, just like early investors who took advantage of Bitcoin launch bumps. Supporters are enjoying stress-free investing in crypto, contributing to the speed in the presale with institutions investing easily in forces to be reckoned with in the top crypto to buy. P2C Pools Fuel Steady Yields Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses peer-to-contract pools to lend ETH and USDT to borrowers automatically, yielding consistent and compounding rewards for token holders. MtTokens represent shares in the earnings, which can be withdrawn to reclaim initial investments, making passive investments in the crypto market revenue generators exponentially better than betting on SOL market volatility. The model has succeeded in turning critics into fans, making it the best cryptocurrency to invest in for the longest periods. Testnet V1 – The Catalyst For Real Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gearing up to introduce the launch of the V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 , with the launch of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots for ETH and USDT. Whales are betting big on the significance of this event because they are interested in the live lending capabilities of MUTM, which goes beyond the on-chain action of SOL, with real DeFi strength to boot. As such, there is immense benefit to the pivot story being delivered by MUTM because it provides the utility that the whales are looking for. Solana whales who took audacious steps to invest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are now in the best cryptocurrency to invest in, recapitulating a masterclass in market timing in spite of woes with resistance.

This comes as another analyst has predicted that LTC could soon break out of its current consolidation phase to reach a four-figure price target. How Litecoin Can Turn A $3,700 Investment Into $1 Million In an X post, Hal stated that investors can make $1 million from about $3,700 if they bid the low $30 range on Litecoin and sell when the altcoin reaches $9,000. The analyst is confident that the LTC price can still drop to around this level, providing investors another opportunity to take this investment advice. Related Reading: Signal That Sparked 100% Litecoin Rally In 2017 Has Been Triggered Again He noted that Litecoin never saw the 5th wave down in the Wave C corrective move, which he claimed means the altcoin is still going to drop below $41. Hal’s accompanying chart also showed that LTC could still drop to as low as $30 before its next parabolic rally to the upside. The analyst remarked that the altcoin could fall below the projected $30 range, but that it looks unlikely. Meanwhile, Hal declared that Litecoin is the “clearest and most confident” 250x to 300x play he sees in the market. He added that he has been waiting a long time for this last drop to $30 and that it is coming soon. He urged investors not to miss it, seeing as he projects that they could make millions on their LTC investment. Hal’s prediction comes amid the launch of the first spot Litecoin ETF by Canary Capital. This is expected to attract institutional inflows into the LTC ecosystem, which could be a positive for the altcoin’s price. However, the LTC hasn’t had the best of starts and is currently lagging behind the Solana and Hedera ETFs, which also just launched, in terms of inflows. Why LTC Could Easily Record This Parabolic Rally Hal noted that Litecoin has one of the longest, oldest, and largest accumulation channels in existence among altcoins against its Bitcoin pair. He revealed that the LTC/BTC chart looks similar to the DOGE/BTC chart just before the Dogecoin price broke out and did a 663x in the 2021 bull cycle. This is why the analyst is confident that LTC’s price can record a 300x gain from the next low when it reaches the top of the next altcoin run.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst CoinsKid stated that Litecoin has been in consolidation mode since the 2018 cycle top. He added that compression leads to expansion, predicting that LTC can reach $4,000 if it breaks the upper resistance just above $200. CoinsKid noted how this would put LTC just shy of Ethereum’s market cap. At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is trading at around $96, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Notably, the Wyoming-based institution failed to secure a favorable appeal ruling after an initial court rejection in March 2024. Appeals Court Upholds Fed Decision In Custodia Case In 2020, Custodia Bank filed an application with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRBKC) seeking a master account, which would grant the crypto-focused institution direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payment system, allowing it to operate without relying on intermediary banks. However, the application was rejected in 2023, with the FRBKC citing concerns over banking practices. This decision came after Custodia had already filed a lawsuit against the Federal Reserve in 2022, accusing the regulator of an “unlawful delay” in processing its application. In March 2024, the popular crypto bank legally challenged the Fed’s decision, arguing that the central bank lacked the legal authority to deny its master account application. The bank also accused the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of possible collusion with the Kansas City Fed in orchestrating the rejection. Judge Scott Skavdahl of the US District Court for the District of Wyoming dismissed Custodia’s claims, ruling that federal law does not mandate the Federal Reserve to grant a master account to every eligible institution. He affirmed that the Fed retains broad discretion in deciding whether to approve or deny such applications. This ruling was followed by an appeal at the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2024. Nineteen months later, the Appellate court has now agreed with the lower court, upholding the Fed’s discretion in granting a master account or not, regardless of eligibility. The ruling said: We agree with the district court that “[t]he plain language of the relevant statutes can only reasonably be read to give the Federal Reserve Banks discretion in granting or denying requests for master accounts.” Custodia Bank, 728 F. Supp. 3d at 1245. Accordingly, we hold that Custodia is not statutorily and automatically entitled to a master account. We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. What Next For Custodia? In a response to the court ruling, Custodia has hinted at a potential petition for rehearing, citing a strong dissenting opinion by one of the appeals court judges. The statement read: While we were hoping for a win at the Tenth Circuit today, we received the next best thing — a strong dissent. It raised serious Constitutional questions about the Federal Reserve and was written by a judge sitting by designation on the panel of a similar case in the Ninth Circuit. Including Judge Bacharach’s opinion in the Fourth Corner case, there’s now a 2–2 split on this question among Tenth Circuit judges (2–1 in Custodia’s favor among active Tenth Circuit judges). Custodia has an option to petition for a rehearing by the Tenth Circuit, and we are actively considering that. At press time, the total crypto market cap remains valued at $3.68 trillion following a 2.65% gain.",Crypto presale|Caitlin Long|Custodia|Federal Reserve|Federal Reserve master account,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 19:00:43

It may mark a pivotal moment when cryptocurrency access for U.S. institutions shifts significantly. As flagged by analyst Paul Barron, this day could usher in a regulated path to U.S. spot-XRP ETFs—ushering in a new era for the asset. Regulatory Advances and Why the Date Matters One of the key developments underlying the November 13 marker is the filing update by asset manager Canary Capital . The firm removed a delaying amendment from its S-1 registration, a signal that the paperwork may be shifting into an auto-effective window. This move gives the market a tangible timeline—rather than mere speculation—for when a spot-XRP ETF could hit the U.S. market. Until that kind of procedural revision was visible, timing remained vague and open-ended. UPDATE: November 13 could be the most important date for $XRP holders in years. @CanaryFunds just cleared the path for the first U.S. spot $XRP ETF Why this matters economically: Institutional access: Bitwise's CIO predicts XRP ETFs could become billion-dollar funds in… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) October 31, 2025 Institutional Demand and Market Entry The economic stakes are high. Already, a regulated vehicle — the REX‑Osprey XRP ETF — has crossed $100 million in assets under management, demonstrating real appetite for regulated XRP exposure. Meanwhile, firms like Bitwise Asset Management anticipate that a spot-XRP ETF could attract billions within its first months. This landscape suggests that when U.S. access is granted, inflows may arrive quickly and in scale. Comparative Context: Altcoin ETFs What sets XRP’s potential apart is that it is now in the queue after other altcoin spot ETFs (for example, SOL, LTC, HBAR) have already begun trading. That context means when XRP gains a listing, it may benefit from both lesser uncertainty and a clearer precedent. Launching at this moment may offer better institutional uptake and clearer mechanics than earlier alt launches. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What to Monitor Now For traders and long-term holders alike, the signals to watch are concrete and immediate: exchange listing announcements, Form 8-A filings (if applicable), SEC comments on pending applications, and creation-unit activity in early exchange-traded products tied to XRP. Canary’s sequence provides a template: amendment removal to exchange clearance, then trading launch. If November 13 passes without an official launch, expect next-step updates—to avoid complacency. Implications for XRP Holders Should a U.S. spot-XRP ETF list around November 13, XRP holders could see several outcomes. First, increased regulated demand could enhance liquidity and tighten spreads. Second, institutional access may lower the risk premium on XRP, potentially lifting valuations. Third, earlier regulatory overhangs may fade, enabling a broader investor base to participate. The date now functions as a potential inflection point—a moment where XRP’s journey from niche token to institutional regime becomes tangible. In short, Paul Barron’s spotlight on November 13 is not hype. The date reflects regulatory mechanics, market appetite, and institutional energy, all converging. Whether the event leads to a historic shift or simply advances the process, XRP holders should take the calendar seriously—and monitor developments with professional discipline.

Notably, the cryptocurrency is currently settling around the $2.50 level after experiencing significant short-term capital outflows. Now, an outlook by prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez suggests that XRP could find support at $2. In an X post on October 31, Martinez noted that XRP’s daily chart has formed a descending pattern, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, indicating a continuation of the downtrend. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Tradingview His outlook shows XRP slipping below mid-range resistance near $2.60, confirming a breakdown from a bearish continuation setup. If momentum persists, the asset could follow the projected path toward the $2 support, with a potential extension toward $1.90 if that level fails to hold. This concerning technical outlook comes as whales have executed significant transactions over the past 24 hours. On-chain data tracked by Whale Alert flagged several moves. For instance, 74.5 million XRP (worth about $189.3 million) was transferred between two unknown wallets, while 20.9 million XRP ($52.4 million) moved to Coinbase, potentially signaling an intent to sell. Meanwhile, 4 million XRP (valued at $10.1 million) was locked in escrow at an unknown wallet, offering a minor counterbalance to the bearish flows. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.50, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while the weekly performance shows a 3.5% decline. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, XRP’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) stands at $2.75, placing the spot price 8.4% below this short-term trendline, a bearish signal indicating weakened momentum and potential for further downside if support fails. The 200-day SMA, at $2.64, offers a nearer floor just 4.4% beneath the current price, hinting at mild long-term resilience but underscoring XRP’s struggle to reclaim its mid-term uptrend. Complementing this, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) registers at 46, firmly in neutral territory. This balanced reading tempers immediate reversal risks but aligns with the SMAs’ cautionary tilt, implying consolidation rather than a breakout. Traders may watch for RSI dips below 40 for deeper pullbacks toward the 200-day SMA or climbs above 50 for renewed tests of the 50-day level.

The data shows that network usage and activity strengthened across several indicators, amid growing engagement from users and developers. Transactions, Wallets, and NFTs on XRP Ledger Average daily transactions on the XRPL increased 8.9% quarter-over-quarter, rising from 1.6 million in Q2 to 1.8 million in Q3. Similarly, average daily active sender addresses climbed 15.4% from 21,900 to 25,300, while total new addresses surged 46.3% to 447,200. The total number of addresses on the network also grew 6.1% to reach 6.9 million. Messari found that for the fifth consecutive quarter, active receiver addresses outnumbered active sender addresses. However, average daily receivers declined 30.1% during the same period from 72,000 to 50,300. The report explained that when receiver addresses exceed sender addresses, it often points to distribution events like airdrops, where many previously inactive wallets receive tokens from a smaller group of senders. Airdrops were a notable factor this quarter. Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain in the Cardano ecosystem, conducted a snapshot in June for its NIGHT token airdrop, which included XRPL users holding more than $100 worth of XRP. The claim period ran from August 5 to October 4. NFT activity was another important growth area. Average daily NFT transactions jumped 51.1% quarter-over-quarter, surging from 50,400 to 76,100. The increase was largely driven by a 70.8% surge in average daily NFT mint transactions, which climbed from 37,800 to 64,600. Other NFT transaction types remained relatively stable over the quarter. Debate Over XRP’s Real Utility Heats Up XRP Ledger’s native token, XRP, ended the third quarter on a strong note as it closed at an all-time high of $2.85, up 27.2% quarter-over-quarter. Its circulating market capitalization rose 29% to $170.3 billion, outperforming the combined 13.3% gain in market cap posted by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana over the same period. However, the token’s momentum cooled in October as broader market sentiment turned negative following hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. XRP slipped by 12% over the past month to around $2.50 amid heavy selling pressure. The recent downturn also reignited debate around XRP’s real-world utility. Crypto analyst Scott Melker, known as “The Wolf of All Streets,” questioned the token’s current role, adding that major financial firms like SWIFT and Western Union are turning to alternative payment networks. While some community members defended XRP as a “neutral bridge currency” for cross-border transfers, others criticized Melker’s stance. Melker acknowledged its technical strengths but remained skeptical about its long-term value.

Musk said on the “Joe Rogan Experience” program that X’s messaging infrastructure has been completely rebuilt and that security should no longer be evaluated on “secure or insecure” but rather on “degrees of insecurity.” Musk stated that X Chat aims to be the “least secure” messaging app, adding that the system is currently undergoing intensive security testing. He also noted that the new system distinguishes itself from its competitors by not including ad ports. According to Musk, the ad targeting infrastructure used in rival apps can create a vulnerability that, if exploited, could lead to messages being read. Musk announced that X Chat will be available “in the next few months,” both embedded within X and as a standalone app. He said users will be able to access text, file, voice, and video calling features through the same system. Related News: Claims About Whales: Are They Preparing for This in Bitcoin? Chat on the X platform is currently available to Premium subscribers as a beta version, replacing the old direct messaging system. Users can share text, photos, media files, GIFs, and documents. However, voice and video calling are not yet available. Musk explained that X Chat's architecture is built on the principles of “full end-to-end encryption” and “data minimization.” He noted that most messaging apps encrypt message content but retain metadata about who users are communicating with and when. He added that X Chat aims to mitigate these risks by avoiding ad targeting. *This is not investment advice.

It outlined priorities that are supposed to advance the protocol’s attributes, especially where privacy is concerned. The document was released amid a massive surge in Zcash’s value, which pushed its market capitalization past $7 billion for the first time as it benefited from renewed interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and broader market momentum. Zcash sustains stunning comeback The Zcash token ( ZEC ) is currently hovering around $422 after making a stunning comeback, hitting an eight-year high and overtaking Monero (XMR) to become the largest privacy coin by market capitalization. The surge in the token’s market cap, which is currently around $6.86 billion after breaking the $7 billion milestone, is proof of the ongoing shift in the crypto sector this year towards privacy-focused tokens. Privacy technologies and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic systems that allow users to carry out crypto-related transaction verification without the need to reveal sensitive data. Zcash was one of the pioneer cryptocurrencies to implement ZKPs at scale, and now appears to be reaping the rewards as investor confidence in privacy infrastructure as a key component of the next generation of blockchain applications grows. ZEC has gained momentum in recent months thanks to a mixture of on-chain activity, protocol upgrades, and speculative inflows linked to the broader ZK narrative. All those factors have made ZEC more attractive to investors. Monero, which used to dominate the privacy coin market with its strong community and popularity, has seen more modest growth in comparison. They both operate on similar ideals, but ZEC has Monero beat because it offers optional transparency, which seems to appeal more to institutions that might be interested in privacy but may still want the chance to show transactions for audit or regulatory purposes. Analysts believe investors may be pricing in this distinction, which is why ZEC has surpassed Monero. It does not help that Monero has also been in the headlines for the 51% takeover by the Qubic mining pool. Details from the roadmap The roadmap highlights Zcash’s core mission of delivering “encrypted electronic cash” through enhanced privacy, consent, security, and usability, while adapting to market conditions and community feedback. According to the official document released on October 31, Electric Coin Co.’s final quarter of 2025 will be focused on reducing technical debt, improving privacy and usability for Zashi users, and ensuring smooth dev fund management. To reduce the debt, the company will streamline backend systems to boost efficiency and reliability, freeing up resources for innovation. To improve privacy and usability, it plans to make privacy tools more accessible for everyday users via the Zashi mobile wallet . As for ensuring smooth dev fund management, the ECC will optimize the Zcash Development Fund with robust security measures to prevent exploits. In the latter part of the document, the ECC stated that the current roadmap is “directive” rather than “fixed,” which means that it is designed to adapt as more information comes to the surface, forcing responses that trigger change. “As new information emerges, we will improvise,” the ECC stated. “As market conditions and other factors impact ECC revenue (positively or negatively), we will re-tune our approach, refocus our efforts, and step on the gas.” For now, the exact timeline in which these features are implemented has not been specified, but if the statement above has anything to do with it, the company will accelerate or pivot based on positive market signals or challenges, such as regulatory pressures on privacy coins.

Currently, ADA continues to trade at $0.67 despite stalled market action accompanied by an RSI level well below the 50 level, thus pointing to strong bear market domination in the market at the moment. ADA has fallen back below $0.70 market resistance, stuck in the current neutral cycle and vulnerable to further declines to $0.62 market support, with new funds being directed to the best DeFi players clearly committed to yielding robust growth in the market. Mutuum Finance, currently valued at $0.035 with $18,270,000 and 17,660 holders, has garnered intense spotlight headlines with ADA holders set to seek better growth aspirations than current ADA market hesitation in the market. Cardano RSI Signals Bearish Streak The Cardano Relative Strength Index has firmly fallen below 50 in recent weeks in late October 2025, solidifying bearish dominance that has derailed rallies and held ADA well below $0.667 resistance even in fleeting moments of resumption from $0.623 support levels. Such periods of extended values below the 50 level on the Relative Strength Index can frequently portend further downturns or sideways action in prices, with the absence of substantial volume to spur new buying passion in the market. ADA holders who experienced the recent 10% decline remain face to face with dilemma choices, with initial speculative selling in new investors expected to dampen any rallies in prices. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched in Phase 6 of presale, boasting 85% of tokens sold out for $0.035. This price is a massive 250% increase from Phase 1 buys at $0.01—but with so swift culmination in the current phase, there is an underscored need to identify the best cryptocurrency to invest in. While subscribers lock in to capitalize on 420% ROI with the $0.06 launch, it translates to lucrative windfalls in sufficient purchases to fill mass demand with 17,660 followers and $18,270,000 raised in total. Delayers face steeper entry thresholds in contrast to the rewards reaped in timely acquisitions that highlight explosive growth in the DeFi market to complement ongoing ADA problems. Giveaway Ignites Community Fire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has kicked off a $100,000 contest where each of 10 lucky winners takes home $10,000 in MUTM, further accelerating adoption that has cultivated one of the biggest early communities in DeFi so far in the year. The participants jump right in with ease, further accelerating the level of engagement, with newbies drawn in who see the growth of their stake in the success of the protocol. Due to the nature of these contest campaigns, where unbeatable loyalty is cemented, MUTM is the best cryptocurrency to invest in, with perks driving adoption unmatched in ADA today. Stablecoin Deposits Unlock Yields Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has incorporated USDT, which acts as one of the primary stablecoins in peer-to-contract pools to facilitate effortless deposits with automated yield earning as borrowers access funds without the effect of volatility reaching them. Deposits of USDT by users are effortless, with rewards in mtTokens. These can be converted back to initial investments with accrued interest, making stable assets earn lucrative returns in contrast to ADA holds that remain uncertain in nature because of market volatility affecting ADA in the form of Cardano collapse, where MUTM stands out as the best cryptocurrency to invest in being less volatile and more lucrative in nature. Buy-and-Distribute Fuel Sources Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses the buy-and-distribute model, in which fees from the protocol are used to buy tokens on the market and distribute them to mtToken stakers, thus creating a self-reliant cycle in which user growth is directly related to explosive prices. This has resulted in early adopters benefiting from maximized portfolios with inherent growth overshadowing ADA network growth in terms of profit. Such makes Mutuum Finance the DeFi crypto ready to record groundbreaking successes in which every trade makes fortunes collectively. Cardano’s lag has brought new headlines to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with the price at $0.035, recapping why this presales leader brings new investors to the table, especially with crypto current events happening today.

COIN briefly touched the $350 level on Friday, October 31st, rallying on the positive earnings report and new developments from this week. According to a new report, Coinbase has also entered into late-stage talks to purchase stablecoin infrastructure BVNK in an estimated $2 billion deal. This move represents a play in a much larger stablecoin industry push by the largest US-based cryptocurrency exchange. Exchange Closes In On $2 Billion BVNK Deal On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Coinbase is looking to complete a $2-billion acquisition of the London-based BVNK, pending due diligence. The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company expects to close this deal before the year’s end or early next year, according to one of the sources close to the matter. Related Reading: Bitmine Buys 44,036 Ethereum Worth $166M During Market Dip – Details According to the report, the company’s venture capital arm, Coinbase Ventures, is an investor in BVNK. One of the cited sources also revealed that while the deal is already in late-stage talks, terms may change, and the deal is still at risk of collapsing. A Coinbase spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement: We don’t comment on rumors or speculation. Driven by our mission to expand economic freedom globally, we actively explore various opportunities—whether through building, acquiring, partnering, or investing – to advance our mission. This latest Bloomberg report somewhat adds credence to the Fortune report—from earlier this week—that disclosed that Coinbase holds exclusivity with BVNK for takeover talks after winning the bidding war. Mastercard was reportedly also engaged in talks with the stablecoin infrastructure before setting its sights on Zerohash, another crypto startup, for over $1.5 billion. Hence, this BVNK purchase by Coinbase, if completed, would represent the latest one in a growing list of stablecoin-related deals in recent months. These developments come on the back of the introduction of the first crypto regulation (the GENIUS Stablecoin Act) in the United States. Coinbase Posts Strong Earnings In Q3 2025 While Coinbase’s Q3 earnings call trended for an unusual reason, after CEO Brian Armstrong dropped a list of crypto buzzwords relevant to the Mentions Market, the crypto company delivered strong profits in the last quarter. The US-based crypto company reported about $1.9 billion in revenue and a bottom line of approximately $432.6 million in 2025’s third quarter, representing a 55% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the firm’s Bitcoin holdings have also jumped by 2,772 BTC to 14,458. As of this writing, the Coinbase stock (COIN) is valued at about $343.78, reflecting a 4.6% jump in the past 24 hours.

What started as a corporate update about institutional custody evolved into a heated debate over which blockchain deserves institutional recognition — Ripple’s XRP Ledger or Solana’s high-performance network. Ripple Prepares for Swell 2025 Ripple’s official X account announced that Swell 2025 will host top global finance leaders to discuss secure institutional custody in a tokenized world. The company confirmed speakers from Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and FTI_US, all of whom will explore the growing link between blockchain and traditional finance. The post was meant to highlight Ripple’s growing influence among financial institutions and its role in tokenization. Instead, it became the spark for a public debate about status and institutional relevance in the crypto ecosystem. Jackson Knox Ignites Ripple (XRP) vs. Solana Supremacy War Crypto community figure Jackson Knox responded to Ripple’s post with strong admiration for Ripple and XRP. Correct, not on the same level: Sandy Kaul from Franklin Templeton on how to talk crypto with Solana: https://t.co/N3iqTOkWus Sandy Kaul on LinkedIn says Solana ""serve[s] as a unifying digital-era layer that can provide investors around the world with real-time, 24/7 access to… pic.twitter.com/Hps3UiK6pQ — Solana (@solana) October 31, 2025 He wrote, “If there is any!!! And I mean any doubt! That Ripple the company and XRP the asset are not on your level… Solana and Western Union.” His statement directly addressed Solana and Western Union, implying that Ripple and XRP stand far above both in institutional class and credibility. Knox’s comment may not be unconnected to recent Western Union’s choice of Solana over XRP . The post gained momentum, drawing immediate attention from Solana’s official team. Solana Counters with Institutional Backing Solana’s official handle swiftly replied, stating, “Correct, not on the same level.” The response referenced respected voices from global finance, including Franklin Templeton executives who have publicly praised Solana’s institutional readiness. Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton’s Head of Digital Asset Strategy, recently described Solana as “a unifying digital-era layer that provides investors 24/7 access to previously unreachable assets.” Jenny Johnson, the firm’s CEO, also called Solana “one of the first institutionally focused chains.” Solana used these endorsements to reinforce its claim of leadership in blockchain adoption among traditional finance players, presenting itself as the preferred infrastructure for institutional tokenization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Litecoin Turns Up the Humor Moments later, Litecoin’s official X account joined the discussion with a playful meme. It showed two women labeled “Solana” and “XRP” fighting, captioned “Fight, fight, fight, fight.” The humorous post quickly went viral, symbolizing the constant rivalry among crypto projects competing for relevance. Litecoin’s comment lightened the mood but also emphasized how social engagement fuels visibility and brand power across crypto networks. Fight, fight, fight, fight! pic.twitter.com/XthucNAgpo — Litecoin (@litecoin) October 31, 2025 Institutional Credibility and the Battle Ahead Beyond the memes, the exchange highlights the ongoing competition for institutional trust in blockchain finance. Ripple continues to focus on bank partnerships and tokenized settlements, positioning itself as the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Solana, meanwhile, emphasizes speed, scalability, and validation from global asset managers. Its strategy focuses on real-time financial applications and high-performance token infrastructure. As Swell 2025 approaches , the crypto industry is watching closely. Will Ripple’s enterprise-grade strategy continue to attract banks and payment providers, or will Solana’s institutional narrative win broader acceptance among asset managers? In the modern crypto landscape, technology, partnerships, and perception now share equal weight. The latest online clash between Solana, Ripple, and Litecoin proves that influence in blockchain is no longer won only by innovation — but by the story each network tells.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility, ensuring that the total supply remains accessible to users. Pi Network is reaching one of the most crucial phases in 2025; as the market is still suspicious, the on-chain activity and the Pi ecosystem continue to develop. Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. Passkey Update enhanced the security of the Pi Wallet with Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN ahead of the Mainnet launch. New DeFi tools Pi DEX and AMM on Testnet allow users to transact Pi and explore decentralized finance in a Web3-aligned way. Meanwhile, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind AI to build a decentralized AI infrastructure, and a recent system process enabled 3.36 million Pioneers to complete identity verification pi network on Pi Network. With the Pi Hackathon 2025 and Sign Protocol partnership ongoing, the network price prediction suggests a resilient ecosystem still focused on utility and long-term growth within the declining exponential model that defines its supply and mining rewards In this article on Pi price prediction and Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.2473 Price Change 24h 0.5% Market Cap $2.06B Circulating Supply 8.29B PI Trading Volume 24h 8.29B PI All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.2473 Price Prediction $ 0.1860 (-24.97%) Fear & Greed Index 33 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.61% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2672 200-Day SMA No Data 14-Day RSI 56.56 (Neutral) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Pi trades at $0.2473, up by 0.09% in the past 24 hours, following a brief rally to $0.252 earlier in the day. Pi Network’s price has shown a moderate recovery after recent crypto market turbulence that drove it to a new monthly low earlier last month. Resistance lies between $0.26 and $0.28, while support zones remain at $0.24 and $0.226. As of November 1, 2025, Pi Network’s price analysis shows muted movement after recent volatility, with a current price average reflecting stability in the market. The coin is trading around $0.2473, down slightly from the previous session’s high of $0.252, as consolidation continues near the $0.24 support zone. Price action remains range-bound, with minor pullbacks indicating fading momentum but no major breakdown. Resistance levels stand at $0.26–$0.28, while support is holding near $0.24 and $0.226, suggesting Pi is stabilizing after a modest recovery phase. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart for Pi Network (PI) price shows a moderate consolidation phase after last week’s short-term recovery. Pi traded between $0.2443 and $0.2524 during the session before stabilizing around $0.2473, indicating sideways momentum as the market digests prior gains. The pattern suggests Pi is forming a neutral base near the $0.24 zone following a failed attempt to break higher. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.00, cooling slightly from earlier highs but still above its signal line at 43.69. This positioning signals balanced market conditions with modest bullish bias, implying that selling pressure is subsiding. If RSI continues trending above 50, it could confirm early accumulation and a potential breakout continuation toward the $0.26–$0.28 resistance area. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) shows the main line at –0.0006 crossing above the signal line at –0.0090, with the histogram turning positive. This crossover indicates fading bearish momentum and the likelihood of short-term stabilization. Immediate resistance levels stand at $0.26, aligning with the 50-day moving average, while support remains near $0.24 and $0.226. A close above $0.26 could extend gains toward $0.28, while a slip below $0.24 may invite a retest of the $0.22 area. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi Network (PI) is trading at $0.2472, over the past 4 hours, as the price consolidates near the $0.25 mark. The coin traded between $0.2467 and $0.2495, reflecting tight range-bound movement with reduced volatility. Bulls are attempting to defend the $0.24 support region, while sellers maintain pressure below the $0.26 resistance zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 49.71, hovering close to its signal line at 50.81. This near-neutral setup indicates a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side dominating. RSI readings around 50 suggest consolidation after earlier volatility, signaling that momentum is stabilizing. A break above 55 could reintroduce mild bullish momentum, while a dip below 45 may expose further downside toward $0.23. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator supports this neutral stance. The MACD line –0.0014 is slightly below the signal line 0.0017, while the histogram shows fading red bars and an early hint of decreasing bearish pressure. If the MACD crosses back into positive territory, it could confirm renewed buying interest. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3019 SELL SMA 5 $0.2744 SELL SMA 10 $0.2451 BUY SMA 21 $0.2286 BUY SMA 50 $0.2672 SELL SMA 100 $0.3262 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2387 BUY EMA 5 $0.2571 SELL EMA 10 $0.2897 SELL EMA 21 $0.3235 SELL EMA 50 $0.3764 SELL EMA 100 $0.4668 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi price is expected to remain in a consolidation phase between $0.20 and $0.24 over the short term. The token is still oversold, suggesting fewer pi in circulation, limited buying momentum but potential for a rebound if demand increases. However, bearish pressure persists. Unless Pi breaks above $0.25 resistance, sideways trading with a weak bias is likely, while a drop below $0.20 could trigger further bearish momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? PI’s price dropped after traders took profits from last week’s 19% rally to $0.291, as retail-driven momentum faded and volume fell 40% to $30.7M. The token also faced rejection at the $0.26 Fibonacci resistance, with RSI divergence signaling weakening bullish momentum and a possible correction toward $0.209. Added pressure comes from a looming 120M token unlock in November, which could expand supply and heighten volatility despite long-term optimism around Pi’s AI and DeFi ecosystem. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline.

This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72.

On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery.

Across the global gaming industry, more studios are seeing workers’ demand for rights to form unions, especially after years of criticism over “crunch” periods often required to meet production deadlines. Rockstar Games is now facing allegations that it does not support employee demands for organized action. Rockstar Games accused of deliberately targeting union efforts Rockstar Games , the studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, is facing allegations of union-busting after it fired dozens of employees across its UK and Canadian offices. According to the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the game developer abruptly dismissed between 30 and 40 workers on Thursday in what the union describes as a deliberate attempt to disrupt efforts to form a union inside the company. The union referred to the company’s actions as one of the most “blatant and ruthless” acts of union busting in the gaming industry. Alex Marshall, the president of the IWGB, said the studio’s actions showed “flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions.” He also criticized Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for showing disregard toward their employees and the gaming community that supports their work. Union representatives are urging an investigation into the dismissals because they believe the timing and scale of the layoffs are suspicious and don’t seem to be for valid reasons. The IWGB is reportedly exploring legal means to get the dismissals overturned. In a statement, the IWGB said that a major company like Rockstar getting away with antagonizing union organizers sends a “chilling message to workers everywhere who want to organize for fair treatment.” Take-Two denies accusations Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., denied all of IWGB’s accusations. The company insists that the layoffs were due to “gross misconduct” by the employees and not related to any union activities, but it has so far failed to provide any details of the supposed misconduct. Alan Lewis, a spokesperson for Take-Two, said the company “fully supports Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.” Despite the backlash, Rockstar has not indicated any plans to reverse the firings. This isn’t the first time Rockstar has faced employee relations controversy. In early 2024, the company was heavily criticized for asking workers to return to the office five days a week. The IWGB criticized that decision, saying it ignored workers’ well-being and family responsibilities. Rockstar defended the return-to-office directive as a necessary step to beef up security after a major leak revealed dozens of video footage from the unfinished Grand Theft Auto VI in 2022.

This follows the emergence of Evernorth, another treasury company that has accumulated over $1 billion worth of the token. Another XRP Treasury Company Emerges With Significant Holdings In an X post , Morgan drew attention to an SEC filing from Virtu Financial that showed it holds XRP on its balance sheet. The company, which boasts a market cap of just over $5 billion, holds 22 million XRP worth just over $55 million at the current price. The lawyer also noted that the company appears to be financially strong, which is a positive for the altcoin. Related Reading: Are The XRP Tokens In Escrow At Risk Of Being Sold? Ripple CTO Shares Insights The treasury company is said to be a global financial services firm specializing in market-making and execution services. Furthermore, the company provides liquidity across global markets in asset classes including equities, ETFs, fixed income, commodities, and derivatives. Based on data from Crypto Treasury Tracker , Very ranks among the top 10 largest XRP treasury companies, just behind Wellgistics Health. It is worth mentioning that Virtu has underperformed this year despite its holdings. TradingView data shows that the company’s stock is down over 2% year-to-date (YTD). However, the stock has risen by over 3% in the last five days. Meanwhile, this development follows the recent emergence of Ripple-backed Evernorth , which plans to build the largest treasury. XRPScan data shows that the treasury company currently holds 388.7 million XRP worth nearly $1 billion, making it the largest XRP treasury. The company had earlier announced plans to raise over $1 billion from investors such as Ripple, Kraken, Pantera Capital, and GSR. This comes ahead of the company’s debut on the Nasdaq. The treasury company plans to list on the stock exchange through a business combination agreement with Armada II. Armada notably recently changed its ticker to XRPN as part of the business agreement. More Institutions Set To Accumulate The Altcoin More institutional investors are set to accumulate the token with the imminent launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF . The asset manager filed an amendment to its fund to remove the delaying amendment, allowing it to launch on November 13. This will be similar to how the firm launched its Hedera and Litecoin ETFs earlier this week.

According to the proposal, if the VIRTUAL token price reaches $10, $20, and $40, respectively, it will trigger a token allocation equivalent to 2% of the total supply to the Virgen Labs team.

It was also the first time the monthly trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) exceeded $1 trillion, evidence of them gaining ground on rival centralized exchanges (CEXs). The open interest (OI) in perps was recorded to be approximately $17.9 billion. According to DeFi data analytics platform DeFiLlama , on-chain perpetuals’ monthly trading volume for September was over $738 billion. DEX perps futures nearly doubled September’s figures, hitting $1.3 trillion in October. Source: DeFiLlama Perps go from niche experiment to trillion-dollar engine Perpetual futures, crypto derivatives that let traders bet on prices without expiry, have long been the domain of big centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. But as those exchanges have tightened their risk controls and compliance rules over the past year, a growing share of liquidity has started to move on-chain. Decentralized platforms such as Hyperliquid , Lighter, EdgeX, and those built on Ethereum and Arbitrum have stepped in to fill the gap, handling more than a trillion dollars in notional trading volume last month. Sentora researcher Juan Pellicer wrote that the shift to on-chain trading is being driven by the tighter risk and reduced market-making activities on CEXs. On-chain protocols have developed new execution models that cater to niche and slower-moving traders, the “long tail” of the market, while offering transparency and composability. “On-chain derivatives are no longer a sideshow,” the Sentora report noted. “They’re now the marginal venue for leverage in crypto, shaping how risk transmits through the system.” Fed rate cuts add fuel to leverage demand The U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut , its second this year, has lowered the cost of dollar funding, indirectly boosting leverage appetite across risk assets. By reducing short-term interest rates, the Fed has made holding fully funded spot positions less attractive relative to leveraged exposure via perps. With lower base rates, the shadow value of collateral is lifted, and this also reduces “USD funding alternatives,” effectively making “perp exposure cheaper relative to holding fully-funded spot.” The October 10 market turbulence played a major role Other reports say this record volume may not be unconnected to the brief market crash that occurred on October 10. The incident, which was sparked by President Donald Trump’s announcement of more tariffs on China, saw the crypto market power through the largest liquidation event on record to date. Some major CEXs experienced some downtime and saw glitches due to the volumes and pressure of users, prompting more traders to utilize DEXs more. Hyperliquid, the leading perpetual DEX, saw the liquidation of more than 1,000 wallets on October 10. That day saw “on-chain perpetual markets hit a record single-day trading volume of $78 billion,” and it showed observers that decentralized platforms have evolved and are ready to play in the same field as their centralized counterparts.

Every rise and fall leaves a trace that often repeats in reverse. For traders who grasp this rhythm, emotions fade, and patterns become clear. This deep understanding of time and symmetry defines Egrag Crypto’s latest XRP analysis — a perspective built on structure, rhythm, and patience. Egrag Crypto’s Theory of Market Reflection In his most recent update, Egrag Crypto revisited his “As Above, So Below” thesis. The model suggests that XRP’s market structure mirrors itself across different timeframes. According to Egrag, the same sequence that shaped previous moves now appears to be unfolding again. The updated chart shows matching highs and lows across two 89-bar cycles. These cycles, he says, reveal the market’s “universal rhythm,” a balance between resistance and support that often determines price direction. His analysis suggests an 80% probability of rejection from the current resistance area, and only a 20% chance of a confirmed breakout. #XRP – As Above, So Below (UPATED CHART): Just 4 days ago (October 27), I shared a post showing an 80% chance of rejection and only a 20% chance of penetration… and guess what? Nothing has changed. It’s still the same universal rhythm , “As Above, So Below.” … https://t.co/vZ1EGPbeIw pic.twitter.com/CzF717OPbG — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 1, 2025 Current XRP Price Outlook As of report time, XRP trades in the mid-$2 range. This zone aligns closely with Egrag Crypto’s highlighted resistance band. The market recently attempted a breakout, but the price action shows hesitation near the same structural level that capped gains in earlier phases. Analysts note that holding above the key Fibonacci levels around $2.40 to $2.60 remains essential. Failure to sustain this range could open the path toward lower retracement zones near $2.20. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios The bullish path requires XRP to break and close above the current resistance area with strong volume. That move could confirm renewed momentum toward targets around $3.00 and beyond. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, the bearish outlook remains valid if XRP fails to maintain support . A breakdown below $2.30 could invite further correction, aligning with the “As Below” reflection Egrag identifies in his chart. Other technical indicators, such as declining volume and moving-average crossovers, could reinforce this downside scenario. Time, Patience, and Market Alignment Egrag emphasizes that timing governs every market movement. To him, patience is not passive waiting — it is alignment with time. Traders who understand this principle can detach from emotions and follow market structure with precision. The idea reflects his belief that success in trading depends on synchronization with market rhythm, not impulsive reaction. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto’s “As Above, So Below” framework remains one of the most thought-provoking XRP analyses today. It connects time, symmetry, and emotion into a unified approach to reading markets. Whether XRP confirms a breakout or mirrors another rejection, his message is clear — understanding time is the key to understanding price.

A strong triangle support structure and a developing inverse head and shoulders pattern are signaling a potential bullish reversal. Momentum is tightening, suggesting that a breakout could be closer than it seems. Massive Triangle Formation Holds Firm Amid Market Shakeouts Batman, a well-known crypto analyst, recently highlighted that Bitcoin has been consolidating for several weeks within a massive descending triangle formation. Despite multiple shakeouts attempting to push the price lower, the key support level has consistently held firm, signaling underlying strength in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Key Retest: Bounce Or $98,000 Next? He noted that the current setup represents a classic, textbook pattern often seen before an explosive breakout in price. Each test of support has been met with strong buying interest, showing that bulls are actively defending the lower boundary of the structure. The classic textbook formation suggests that Bitcoin’s price is coiling up energy for a potential breakout once momentum returns. Batman remains highly optimistic about Bitcoin’s next move, stating that his target remains clear at $126,000. He cautioned traders not to underestimate the setup, emphasizing that the current price action could mark the calm before a major surge. In his view, this represents a big opportunity for those watching closely, as the market prepares for what could be the next explosive leg higher. Technical Setup Hints At Shift From Consolidation To Expansion According to GandalfCrypto in a current update, Bitcoin is currently forming a potential inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, which often signals a major trend reversal in technical analysis. The structure has been developing over the past few weeks, with clear left and right shoulders forming, while the neckline sits around the $115,000–$116,000 range. This area has become a key zone to monitor, as it represents the boundary between continued consolidation and a potential bullish breakout. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Market Dynamics Are Evolving As New Developments Surface Overnight GandalfCrypto explained that if Bitcoin successfully breaks above this neckline with strong volume, it would validate the reversal pattern and likely trigger a surge toward the $130,000 target. Such a move would confirm renewed strength among buyers and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish phase after weeks of sideways movement and uncertainty. He further noted that momentum indicators are coiling tightly, reflecting a buildup of energy beneath the surface. GandalfCrypto emphasized the importance of patience and precision, waiting for a confirmed breakout rather than preempting the move, as this will distinguish traders who capture the next leg higher from those caught in false starts.

Abagnale, the real-life inspiration for Leonardo DiCaprio’s leading role in the crime comedy-drama film, lectured attendees of the conference this week in an exclusive meeting with members of the finance and crypto industries. American con artist talks cybersecurity at Russian crypto forum In his presentation, the once convicted felon, who forged bank checks and other documents in his youth while faking identities, provided a thorough analysis of modern digital fraud schemes and vulnerabilities in common online practices, sharing his recommendations for protecting personal data. The lecture, titled “Catch the Legend,” gathered around 100 representatives of business circles, finance, and the crypto sector, including major digital asset exchanges, the Russian business news outlet RBC reported on Saturday. Abagnale was invited as the speaker in the first of the new RBC Global Talks, a format meeting guests with world experts and opinion leaders in various fields. It was organized as a side event of the international Blockchain Life 2025 forum, held in Dubai. This was the 15th anniversary edition of the conference, Russia’s most significant international crypto gathering, which aims to connect Russian-speaking and global crypto communities. Among the headlines it produced this year was Pavel Durov ’s unveiling of a new decentralized computing platform called Cocoon, meant as an alternative to centralized cloud services such as Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. According to the tech entrepreneur, founder and owner of the popular in the crypto space messenger Telegram, the AI services of today are heavily dependent on centralized providers that can access, collect, and exploit users’ personal data. Abagnale doesn’t keep cryptocurrency and has no social media accounts For his part, Frank Abagnale touched on the subject of personal cybersecurity, too. During a discussion following the lecture, he stated he does not use cryptocurrency and doesn’t have any social media accounts either, as part of his safety strategy. Abagnale spent over an hour answering questions in an informal setting. Participants in the meeting received copies of a new edition of his book, specially printed for the event. No video recording was allowed. The screenplay for Spielberg’s movie, which made his story world famous, is based on a semi-autobiography with the same title that he co-authored with writer Stan Redding. The book details his criminal exploits. During his time as a con man, Abagnale allegedly cashed $2.5 million worth of forged checks while also impersonating a doctor, a professor, an attorney, and even a Pan Am pilot, flying millions of air miles as a deadheading employee. Some of his claims have been challenged, leaving the impression he might have faked, or at least exaggerated, even his own biography. But others are likely true, to one degree or another, as he has been arrested on multiple occasions, for an array of crimes and offences in the 1960s and 70s, when he was in his teens and 20s. He also spent time in prison in the United States, Sweden, and France, of which he is a citizen, too. Eventually, Abagnale transitioned into a career of a security consultant, advising various organizations, including companies and banks. He gave numerous speeches, lectures, and interviews, making a great number of public appearances, including in Talks at Google and popular talk shows. Among the most controversial claims he introduced into his repertoire in the early 80s is that he was granted a parole from prison so that he could work for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He has continuously maintained his involvement with the FBI. Besides RBC, which is Blockchain Life’s main media partner this year, Abagnale’s appearance at the conference was sponsored by the A7A5 platform. The latter is the issuer of a ruble-pegged stablecoin with the same name, which accounts for almost half of the market cap of all non-dollar stablecoins, as reported by Cryptopolitan.

A monumental XRP transfer , totaling 300 million tokens, has moved from an undisclosed wallet directly to Ripple. This transaction, valued at approximately $751 million, sparks immediate questions and ignites discussions across the crypto community about its implications. The Unprecedented XRP Transfer – What Just Happened? On [Insert Date if available, otherwise keep general], the renowned blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, flagged an extraordinary movement of digital assets. An astonishing 300,000,000 XRP tokens were transferred from an unknown wallet. The destination? None other than Ripple, the blockchain company behind the XRP ledger. This single XRP transfer represents a substantial amount of capital, equivalent to over three-quarters of a billion dollars. Such a large-scale transaction naturally draws scrutiny, especially when involving a major player like Ripple. It prompts us to consider the underlying reasons and potential ripple effects (pun intended) this could have on the market. Understanding the dynamics of these large whale movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. They often precede or indicate significant strategic decisions by the entities involved. This particular event is no exception, demanding a closer look at its potential impact. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer to Ripple Matter? When an entity like Ripple receives such a colossal XRP transfer , several possibilities emerge. These transactions are rarely random; they usually serve a strategic purpose. Here are a few reasons why this specific transfer is significant: Treasury Management: Ripple holds a substantial amount of XRP in its treasury. This transfer could be part of an internal restructuring or a consolidation of funds from various controlled wallets. Liquidity Provision: The incoming XRP might be intended to bolster liquidity for Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors. ODL uses XRP to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border payments. Strategic Sales or Partnerships: While less common for direct transfers to Ripple, a large influx could prepare for future strategic initiatives, perhaps involving new partnerships or even potential over-the-counter (OTC) sales to institutional clients. Escrow Management: Ripple periodically releases XRP from its escrow accounts. This transfer could relate to re-escrowing or managing those released funds. These large movements are often a window into the operational health and strategic direction of a major crypto enterprise. They indicate active management of assets rather than dormant holdings. Analyzing the Market Impact of This XRP Transfer Any substantial XRP transfer , especially one involving Ripple, can generate considerable market discussion. While such a transfer doesn’t automatically mean an immediate price surge or drop, it certainly influences market sentiment. Investors and traders closely watch these whale movements for clues about future market activity. Transparency in blockchain transactions, even with “unknown wallets,” allows for this level of scrutiny. However, the lack of explicit context from Ripple itself often leads to speculation. This particular event highlights the dual nature of crypto: unparalleled transparency in transactions combined with potential opacity regarding the motives behind them. It is important for market participants to differentiate between a transfer and a sale. A transfer to Ripple’s known wallets doesn’t automatically imply an imminent sale onto exchanges. Instead, it suggests internal asset management or preparation for a specific strategic use. What’s Next for Ripple and XRP Holders After This Transfer? For XRP holders and those following Ripple, monitoring official announcements and further on-chain activity becomes paramount. This significant XRP transfer could be a precursor to several developments. Ripple continues to expand its global presence and ODL network. Such a large influx of XRP could empower them to further scale these operations, potentially increasing XRP’s utility. Keeping an eye on Ripple’s partnerships and quarterly reports can offer more context. Actionable Insight: While it’s tempting to react to large transfers, a balanced approach involves observing broader market trends and Ripple’s strategic communications. Don’t base investment decisions solely on single whale alerts; instead, consider them as one piece of a larger puzzle. In conclusion, the recent 300 million XRP transfer to Ripple is a compelling event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact motives remain unconfirmed, it points towards active strategic management by Ripple, potentially impacting its operational capabilities and the broader XRP ecosystem. These significant movements remind us that the crypto landscape is constantly evolving, driven by the actions of its major players. Staying informed and understanding the potential implications of such large transactions is key for navigating this exciting space.

A1: An XRP transfer refers to the movement of XRP digital tokens from one wallet address to another on the XRP Ledger. These transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be tracked by services like Whale Alert. Q2: Who is Whale Alert? A2: Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks large cryptocurrency transactions (often referred to as “whale movements”) across various blockchains. It provides real-time notifications about significant transfers, helping to increase transparency in the crypto market. Q3: Why would an “unknown wallet” transfer XRP to Ripple? A3: An “unknown wallet” could be an address controlled by Ripple itself, used for internal treasury management, or an address belonging to an institutional partner or client making a large payment or contributing to a liquidity pool. Without specific announcements from Ripple, the exact nature remains speculative. Q4: Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple will sell the tokens immediately? A4: Not necessarily. A large XRP transfer to Ripple’s known wallets often indicates internal asset management, such as preparing for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) operations, consolidating funds, or managing escrow releases. While sales are always a possibility, the transfer itself doesn’t guarantee an immediate market dump. Q5: How does this affect the price of XRP? A5: Large transfers can sometimes create market speculation, but their direct impact on price is not always straightforward. While some might interpret it as a bearish signal (potential sale), others might see it as a bullish sign of strategic activity or increased liquidity. The actual price movement depends on broader market sentiment and Ripple’s subsequent actions. Q6: Where can I track these large XRP transfers? A6: You can track large XRP transfers and other cryptocurrency movements using blockchain explorers specific to the XRP Ledger or through services like Whale Alert, which aggregates and reports on significant transactions across multiple chains.

A staggering 200,000,000 XRP transfer , valued at approximately $500 million, has been reported moving from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. This kind of significant movement always captures attention and prompts questions among investors and market watchers alike. What Just Happened with This XRP Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert recently flagged a colossal transaction involving Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP. The report indicated that 200 million XRP tokens were sent from a wallet identified only as ‘unknown’ to Ripple. Scale of the Transfer: This particular XRP transfer represents a substantial amount, making it one of the larger single transactions observed recently. Valuation: At current market prices, this transfer is valued at around half a billion dollars, underscoring its financial significance. Destination: The recipient, Ripple, is the company closely associated with XRP, leading to immediate speculation about the purpose of such a large influx. When an ‘unknown wallet’ is involved, it typically means the address is not publicly associated with a known individual, exchange, or institution, adding a layer of mystery to the transaction. Why Do Large XRP Transfers Spark Market Interest? Significant cryptocurrency movements, often dubbed ‘whale transfers,’ frequently draw attention because they can signal potential market shifts. A massive XRP transfer like this one can be interpreted in several ways: Potential Selling Pressure: Sometimes, large transfers to exchanges precede a sell-off, which could impact price. However, a transfer directly to Ripple itself might suggest internal management. Strategic Moves: It could indicate a strategic decision by the sending entity or by Ripple to consolidate assets or prepare for a specific initiative. Liquidity Management: Ripple often uses XRP for its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solutions. This transfer could be related to bolstering liquidity for these services. Understanding the context behind such transfers is crucial for market participants. The sheer volume of this particular XRP transfer makes it a notable event for the entire crypto community. What Could This XRP Transfer Mean for Ripple’s Operations? A direct XRP transfer to Ripple itself opens up several possibilities regarding the company’s internal operations and strategy. Ripple holds a significant portion of XRP in escrow, releasing it periodically for various purposes. This incoming transfer could potentially be: A Buyback: Ripple might be repurchasing XRP from a large holder. Strategic Partnership: The transfer could be part of an agreement with a partner or institution. Internal Reallocation: Perhaps it is a movement between Ripple-controlled wallets for treasury management or operational needs. Historically, Ripple has been transparent about its escrow releases and sales, aiming to maintain market stability. This particular incoming XRP transfer suggests a different kind of interaction. Navigating the Impact of Significant Crypto Movements For investors, understanding these large transactions is part of staying informed. While a single XRP transfer doesn’t always dictate immediate price action, it contributes to the overall market sentiment and narrative. It’s a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets and the importance of on-chain analytics. Monitoring reputable sources like Whale Alert provides valuable insights into the movements of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ These insights can help individuals make more informed decisions, rather than reacting to unverified rumors. The recent 200,000,000 XRP transfer to Ripple is undoubtedly a significant event in the cryptocurrency landscape. While its exact purpose remains undisclosed by Ripple, it highlights the constant activity within the digital asset space. Such large-scale movements underscore the growing maturity and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies like XRP. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on these substantial transfers will remain a key aspect of understanding potential future developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto transfers? An ‘unknown wallet’ refers to a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly identified or linked to a specific individual, exchange, or institution. These wallets are often used by large holders, sometimes called ‘whales,’ who prefer to remain anonymous. Why is this 200,000,000 XRP transfer significant? The significance lies in the sheer volume and value of the transaction ($500 million) and its destination – Ripple. Large transfers can influence market sentiment, signal strategic moves, or indicate changes in liquidity management for the asset. Does this XRP transfer mean Ripple is selling XRP? Not necessarily. While transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede sales, a direct transfer to Ripple could indicate a buyback, an internal reallocation, or part of a strategic partnership. It is an incoming transfer to Ripple, not an outgoing one to an exchange for sale. How can I track large crypto transfers like this? Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These platforms provide real-time updates on large movements, helping the community stay informed. What impact could this have on XRP’s price? The immediate impact on XRP’s price is not always clear-cut. While large transfers can sometimes create short-term volatility due to speculation, the long-term effects depend on the actual purpose of the transfer and Ripple’s subsequent actions. It’s important to consider broader market trends. Did you find this analysis helpful?

This move, reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a large transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver with potential implications for the XRP ecosystem. For those tracking the pulse of digital assets, understanding the nuances of such an action is crucial. What Does XRP Locked in Escrow Truly Mean? When we talk about XRP locked in escrow, it refers to a specific mechanism Ripple employs to manage the supply of its native cryptocurrency. Escrow acts like a digital vault, holding a predetermined amount of XRP for a set period or until certain conditions are met. This isn’t a new practice for Ripple; they have been utilizing escrow accounts for years to ensure transparency and predictability in the release of XRP into the market. Transparency: The escrow schedule is public, allowing the community to anticipate future releases. Supply Management: It prevents a sudden flood of XRP onto exchanges, which could potentially destabilize its price. Investor Confidence: It signals a commitment to long-term stability and responsible asset management. Why is This XRP Locked Development So Significant? The locking of 500 million XRP is a substantial amount, representing a considerable portion of the circulating supply. This action directly impacts the available supply of XRP on exchanges, which can influence market dynamics. Less available supply, assuming consistent demand, can lead to interesting price movements. Furthermore, it reinforces Ripple’s ongoing strategy to maintain a structured release schedule. Consider the broader context: Ripple’s vision for XRP Ledger (XRPL) involves facilitating fast, low-cost international payments. Managing the supply of XRP is a key component of this vision, ensuring the asset remains viable and attractive for institutional adoption. This latest XRP locked event underscores that commitment. The Broader Implications of XRP Locked Funds This move isn’t just about supply and demand; it also speaks to Ripple’s strategic positioning within the global financial landscape. By consistently locking up large sums of XRP, Ripple demonstrates its long-term belief in the asset’s utility and its ecosystem’s growth. This can be a powerful signal to potential partners and investors who are looking for stability and foresight in the volatile crypto market. Moreover, the continuous locking of XRP in escrow highlights a proactive approach to managing market sentiment. In an industry often swayed by news and speculation, predictable actions like these can foster a sense of security. It shows that Ripple is not just reacting to market conditions but actively shaping the environment for XRP’s sustained development and adoption. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for XRP Locked Assets? The question many are asking is, what happens next with these XRP locked funds? Typically, Ripple’s escrow system releases a portion of XRP each month. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed. This cyclical process ensures a continuous, managed flow of XRP into the market, aligning with Ripple’s operational needs and ecosystem development efforts. For investors and enthusiasts, monitoring these escrow releases and re-escrows provides valuable insight into Ripple’s financial health and its ongoing commitment to the XRP Ledger. It’s a transparent mechanism that allows for a degree of predictability in an otherwise unpredictable market. As the crypto space evolves, such structured approaches become increasingly important for establishing trust and stability. The recent report of 500 million XRP locked in escrow at Ripple is a clear indicator of the company’s deliberate strategy to manage its digital asset. This consistent approach to supply management, through transparent escrow releases, aims to foster stability and confidence within the XRP ecosystem. It underscores Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP as a key player in global finance, reinforcing its commitment to a predictable and robust digital asset environment. For anyone interested in the future of digital payments and blockchain technology, these strategic moves by Ripple are certainly worth watching. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does it mean when XRP is locked in escrow? When XRP is locked in escrow, it means a specific amount of XRP is held in a secure digital account for a predetermined period or until certain conditions are met. This prevents it from being sold or moved freely on the market, helping to manage supply. Why does Ripple lock XRP in escrow ? Ripple locks XRP in escrow primarily to manage its supply and ensure market stability. This transparent process prevents a sudden influx of XRP onto exchanges, which could negatively impact its price and investor confidence. How often does Ripple release XRP from escrow ? Ripple typically releases a portion of XRP from escrow on a monthly basis. Any unspent XRP from these monthly releases is then re-escrowed, maintaining a controlled and predictable supply flow. Does XRP locked in escrow affect its price? Yes, the amount of XRP locked in escrow can affect its price by influencing the circulating supply. A larger amount of XRP locked generally means less available on the open market, which can, in theory, support its value if demand remains consistent. Where can I track XRP escrow movements? Platforms like Whale Alert often report significant XRP escrow movements. Additionally, Ripple’s official channels and various crypto analytics sites provide information on the escrow schedule and releases.
