The image quickly made the rounds, until blockchain analysts stepped in and tore it apart. The Viral Claim The screenshot showed what looked like a massive sell-off: CZ supposedly dumping 35 million $ASTER tokens from his personal wallet. The timing? “This morning,” according to the image. Except… it never happened. The screenshot used real Binance hot wallet transactions from the past week but with a doctored timestamp. The image editor swapped out Binance’s official wallet address, 0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3, for a fake “CZ wallet.” That small change made it look like the transfers came directly from CZ himself. JUST IN: CZ Linked Wallet sells 35,000,000 $ASTER worth $30.42 million. pic.twitter.com/6rqiOWHCFJ — Farzad (@FarzadXBT) October 30, 2025 Analysts Call It Out Blockchain analysts @EmberCN and @lookonchain were quick to fact-check the claim, and their findings were clear. “It says here that CZ sold 35 million $ASTER, but I checked the on-chain data. There are no corresponding transfers as mentioned,” EmberCN wrote. The supposed “CZ sell” transactions? They actually corresponded to internal Binance hot wallet movements, not personal transfers. 这里说 CZ 出售了 3500 万枚 $ASTER ，不过我看了下链上数据，并没有他提到的对应链上转移。 对应到他提到的这三笔 $ASTER 转移，实际是币安热钱包之间的互转。有人把 0x889 这个币安热钱包 P 成了 CZ 的钱包。 https://t.co/IoGcVqpMOr 这里把数量设置 1000 万枚以上，就可以看到。 本文由… https://t.co/zROC2PRKAk pic.twitter.com/T6qvhw4iJg — 余烬 (@EmberCN) October 31, 2025 “Someone mistook the Binance wallet 0x889 for CZ’s wallet,” confirmed Lookonchain. Fake news! The 31.84M $ASTER ($34.53M) transfer was between #Binance hot wallets and has nothing to do with CZ( @cz_binance )'s wallet. https://t.co/mRGs56gItF pic.twitter.com/BZbBm1H3EA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 31, 2025 CZ didn’t waste time addressing the rumor. In his typical direct tone, he jumped on X to shut it down: “Fake news. Please unfollow people who spread this nonsense.” That’s about as clear as it gets. 4. Fake news! Unfollow the guys posting fake news. pic.twitter.com/Os8dF0dSjh — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 31, 2025 The Real Aster Update While FUD spread on social media, the Aster team dropped a genuine update, one that had nothing to do with CZ but could have a real impact on $ASTER’s tokenomics. In a statement, Aster announced refinements to its ongoing buyback and airdrop model as part of its effort to strengthen long-term value. Here’s the breakdown: 50% of all buybacks (S2 and S3) in the public buyback address will be burned, permanently reducing supply and reinforcing $ASTER’s market strength. The remaining 50% will move back to the locked airdrop address, effectively reducing circulating supply and allowing more allocation for future airdrops. This means more rewards for long-term holders and genuine Aster users, and less supply pressure overall. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance Aster’s token economy, we’re refining the S3 buyback and airdrop model to deliver stronger, long-term value for both users and holders: • 50% of all buybacks, including S2 and S3, in the public buyback address will be burned — reducing… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) October 31, 2025 Behind the Buyback Strategy Aster has been executing its S3 buyback plan, which focuses on strengthening its token economy after the earlier S2 round. The goal is straightforward, make $ASTER more sustainable by balancing deflationary burns with community-focused airdrops. The 50-50 split model ensures that half the tokens get permanently removed from circulation, while the rest go toward rewarding loyal users who hold and stake $ASTER. This approach not only enhances liquidity control but also creates a more resilient long-term ecosystem, especially in times of heightened speculation and fake news. Market Reactions Despite the false sell-off rumor, $ASTER remained relatively stable in trading. According to CoinMarketCap data, $ASTER was trading below $1 following the sell off saga, as investors realized the “CZ sell” story was a hoax, price is slightly recovering. The quick debunk from major analysts and the transparency from Aster’s team helped cool the panic. Still, the incident served as a reminder of how easily misinformation spreads in the fast-paced world of crypto. Lessons from the Chaos This episode highlights a growing issue in the industry, fake on-chain screenshots. With tools like Photoshop and basic blockchain explorers, anyone can craft a convincing “leak.” But as this case showed, on-chain truth always wins when verified by reputable trackers like Lookonchain and EmberCN. It also showed CZ’s consistent stance on transparency. Whether it’s a market rumor or an exchange controversy, his first response is to call out fake narratives directly, not let them fester. For Aster, the timing might have been inconvenient, but the fundamentals speak louder than FUD. With its evolving buyback and burn system, Aster is doubling down on its mission, to reward loyal holders and maintain long-term value stability. As the crypto space matures, such mechanisms, along with fast-acting transparency from leaders, are what separate real projects from noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The DeFi platform has raised a staggering $18,250,000 in funds from 17,600 investors, a 250% hike from its original price of $0.01 in Phase 1 of its presale, making MUTM the best crypto to invest in this season to achieve profits in the world of altcoins. Its phased investment strategy has enticed all investors to its side as it unlocks greater profits preceding its entrance priced at $0.06 that holds a promise of a whopping 400% return. But with 2026 on the horizon, will its price tags reach new milestones? Researchers have forecast its level to touch $1.50 come mid-year as it rides dual-market returns amidst market incentives. Presale Stages Fast-Track Investor Influx Mutuum Finance has designed its presale carefully to ensure that all investors are restricted in their allocations and that prices keep rising. Stage 6 is priced at $0.035 and has actually jumped an impressive 80% to near selling out. The number of investors sitting on a total of 17,600 has injected a total of $18,250,000 through this level and has witnessed its holdings increase a whopping 250% since its inception price of $0.01. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has kick-started the involvement through a 24-hour leaderboard system that rewards the top depositor with a prize of $500 in MUTM in a day, as long as one transaction is made before the 00:00 reset. This activity-igniting strategy has brought vitality to the pre-sale event that has turned a normal buying process into a winning experience for 17,600 token holders. Stories have emerged of how people have caught a bonus boost that cushions their holdings. In a field that is rife with passive holdings, this is a welcome respite that forces investors to think that MUTM is not only a high-quality investment platform but is a quick pulse on this vibrant defi crypto community. The scorching speed of Phase 6 leaves late bloomers grasping for air; with only 80% left and the 400% prize in sight, the $0.035 window opens and closes in a hurry to sentence latecomers to the steeper price point of Phase 7’s $0.04. To think of missing out on this opportunity while your 17,600 friends pocket 400% while you take out overpriced tickets. Money amounts reach $18,250,000. Giveaway Ignites Broader Appeal Mutuum Finance has brought some level of incentivization to this process with a prize giveaway worth $100,000 . The project has reserved MUTM tokens worth $10,000 for each of the 10 winners to take advantage of this presale frenzy. The reaction to this giveaway has not only contributed to its large number of members that stand at 17,600 but has even lifted moods as winners share their profits daily. Thus, promotions have added layers of bliss to functionality to make MUTM appear vibrant and very lucrative for beginners searching for top-notch opportunities in altcoin data. Professionals associate winning streaks with continued rally projections in 2026 due to passion for the token within communities. Yield Mechanisms Propel 2026 Targets Mutuum Finance has aggregated its platform with peer-to-peer lending contracts that auto-generate interest for ETH and USDT. The refunds are in mtTokens as a claim to capital and interest. The borrowers have unfettered access to this common reservoir. Peer-to-peer lending facilitates bespoke lending for specialized tokens. Mutuum Finance has set itself up for explosive growth as more and more people are tempted by lending that operates in the background but increases like compound interest. As of mid-2026, projections place MUTM’s price at $1.50 with a whopping 4200% surge from presale value, undergirded by DeFi’s 40% compound growth and V1’s release of its testnet in Q4 2025. The thinking is informed by security audits–CeriK level 90/100 and a bug bounty reward of a substantial $50,000—and serves as a protective imperative in its own right as its precursor, AAVE in 2020-2021. That asset initially dropped to a mere $26.03 in November 2020 but rocketed to a high of $665 in May 2021 in a mere six months as its lending platform garnered intense hype, registering a 2450% RO1 simply on lending platform hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has coupled its presale ingenuity with yield ingenuity to project a 2026 path to $1.50 in value and has outperformed stagnating altcoins through rightful DeFi activity. Strike this presale pulse—together with 17,600 members in Phase 6—acquire tokens for $0.035 and propel towards 400% returns that reshape your portfolio.

53879101,618005,1761948013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53879101.jpeg,Pundit Breaks Down The XRP Ledger: What To Know About How It Works,https://bitcoinist.com/what-to-know-about-xrp-ledger/,"A lively discussion about XRP’s true purpose and utility erupted on X after prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker posed a sincere question to his 1 million followers: what exactly is the current pitch for XRP? The token itself, not Ripple the company. His inquiry attracted different responses from both supporters and industry commentators on detailed explanations of how the XRP Ledger functions and what role XRP plays within it. The conversation drew in notable voices, including Santiago Velez and David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. How The XRP Ledger Works And The Role Of Rippling In his detailed response , crypto commentator Santiago Velez explained that XRP serves several foundational functions within the Ledger. At its core, the Ledger uses the token to prevent spam and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. Each transaction carries a small fee denominated in XRP to deter network abuse. However, its utility extends far beyond that technical safeguard. Velez also noted that XRP was designed to facilitate a process known as rippling, which allows users to exchange equivalent tokens under the same currency code through an intermediary account. This mechanism was central to the Ledger’s early design and was part of the system’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), the first of its kind in crypto history. As such, the token operates as a bridge currency that allows easy inter-currency pathfinding without relying on intermediaries or centralized issuers. According to Velez, no other large Layer-1 blockchain is built with this specific function in mind, apart from Stellar, which originated as a fork of XRP. Questions On The Long-Term Value Of The Altcoin After receiving the explanation, Melker acknowledged the Ledger’s technical sophistication, calling it an elegant and forward-thinking design that was far ahead of its time. He praised its built-in features, such as the anti-spam mechanism, native DEX, and neutral bridge function, noting that these innovations solved real-world problems in settlement and cross-border payments long before many of today’s leading blockchains were created. However, Melker posed another question about the token’s long-term economic sustainability: whether these design strengths translate into lasting demand for the token itself. He pointed out that while the ledger’s features serve technical purposes, they do not necessarily guarantee consistent price appreciation. In his view, spam prevention does not generate token demand. Pathfinding may bypass the altcoin in some cases, and stablecoins’ stability and simplicity have become more appealing to institutions than XRP. This opens the question of whether it is adopted anywhere near the scale that it’s being promoted. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, later joined the conversation to provide his perspective on the token’s value. He noted that the Ledger offers something no other blockchain can, which is an open system where users can act as their own banks, free from middlemen like stablecoin issuers that can tax transactions. According to Schwartz, the altcoin’s special place on the Ledger ensures that it captures some of the value generated by network transactions. As the only non-IOU asset accessible to every account worldwide, the asset holds a unique status that protects it from default, freezing, or clawback risks.",XRP|David Schwartz|DDos Attacks|Decentralized Exchange|Denial-of-service|DEX|ripple|ripple news|Santiago Velez|Scott Melker|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 22:00:13

All Signs Point to the Noomez ($NNZ) Presale,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-will-boom-in-2025-all-signs-point-to-the-noomez/,"In a year packed with speculation, one question dominates every crypto forum: Which crypto will boom in 2025? As investors scan the horizon for the next breakout coin, a new name is quietly gathering energy, $NNZ , the deflationary meme coin built on story, stages, and the power of the Noom Engine. While others chase hype, $NNZ is crafting a universe that unites holders through lore, token burns, and transparent presale mechanics. It’s more than a meme, it’s a movement. As 2025 approaches, the Noomverse is coming alive one stage at a time. Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025 and Why $NNZ Leads the Race Crypto analysts agree that 2025 could mark the beginning of the next major bull cycle. Yet, among the countless meme coins and utility tokens, $NNZ meme coin presale stands out for three key reasons: innovation, transparency, and community-driven growth. The Noom Engine gives $NNZ lasting utility; new projects can join its ecosystem, paying tribute to $NNZ holders through automatic token rewards. Meanwhile, its deflationary tokenomics ensure scarcity, with unsold tokens burned after each presale stage. And unlike typical short-term hype coins, $NNZ’s storytelling framework builds emotional engagement, transforming holders into “Noomies,” loyal participants in a growing universe. Understanding $NNZ’s Lunar Momentum As investors ask which crypto will boom next , $NNZ’s mechanics offer a compelling answer. The project’s design isn’t just creative, it’s strategic. 1. The Noom Gauge A glowing energy meter is divided into 28 segments, each representing a presale stage. With every stage completed, one segment lights up, signaling progress toward launch. 2. The Stage X Million Airdrop At the close of each presale stage, one lucky wallet wins a number of $NNZ tokens equal to the stage number (e.g., Stage 14 → 14M $NNZ). 3. The Noom Vault Hidden surprises await at Stage 14 and Stage 28, including massive airdrops, NFT rewards, and even strategic token burns. Together, these mechanisms keep $NNZ’s community engaged, energized, and eager for the next milestone, fueling organic buzz long before official launch day. Experts Eye $NNZ’s Deflationary Power Crypto watchers’ 2025 predictions highlight that deflationary coins with strong community roots often outperform pure speculation tokens. $NNZ fits this mold perfectly. Its fixed 280B supply , regular token burns , and locked liquidity create a stable foundation for growth. Add to that an audited contract, a KYC-verified team, and a transparent presale structure, and $NNZ’s credibility stands tall in a crowded market. For many, this combination signals not just a meme, but a movement poised for long-term success. What Crypto Will Boom in the Next 5 Years? $NNZ’s Vision Beyond 2025 For those wondering which crypto will boom in next 5 years , $NNZ delivers a clear, sustainable roadmap built for growth and longevity. Here’s how it stands apart: The Noom Engine Ecosystem: Every new partner project that joins the Noomverse contributes back to $NNZ holders. A portion of their tokens is distributed automatically; no staking or manual claiming is required. Automatic Holder Rewards: All $NNZ holders benefit from the Noom Engine’s token drops. Simply holding $NNZ qualifies you for future ecosystem rewards. Optional Staking Bonuses: While staking isn’t required, participants who do gain access to boosted yields, exclusive NFTs, and bonus multipliers — rewarding long-term loyalty. Deflationary Supply Model: With a fixed supply of 280 billion $NNZ and continuous token burns, scarcity grows over time, supporting steady price appreciation potential. Evolving Utility and Story: The $NNZ roadmap expands with each stage of the Noomverse, weaving together lore, NFT integration, and token-based partnerships to create lasting value beyond 2025.

In 2028, THETA will range between $2.03 and $2.32, with an average price of $2.18. In 2031, THETA will range between $3.49 and $3.78, with an average price of $3.63. THETA token is the native incentive of the Theta Decentralized Network, an open-source, public protocol focused on driving the next generation of content streaming platforms. Through Theta, developers and video aggregators can innovatively build, launch and deploy decentralized streaming apps on top of the blockchain. Theta’s applications focus on eSports, TV/Movies, enterprise conferencing, music, educational, and streaming content. The content-driven cryptocurrency remains one of the most undervalued coins out there right now, and I think it will continue to rise in price over time. Theta has already surpassed most older coins in the market cap, but what does this mean for its future value? Will Theta be more valuable than Bitcoin or Ethereum by 2031? This blog post will provide insights into Theta price prediction, how to buy Theta coin, and why it could surpass other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum within the next half a decade. Overview Cryptocurrency Theta Ticker THETA Current price $0.4838 Market cap $484.02M Trading volume $14.88M Circulating supply 1B THETA All-time low $0.03977 Mar 13, 2020 All-time high $15.90 Apr 16, 2021 24-hour low $0.4728 24-hour high $0.4961 Theta price prediction: Technical analysis Fear and Greed Index Value Volatility (30-day variation) 14.70% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.6769 200-day SMA $0.8201 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 29 (Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) Theta price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Theta is consolidating near $0.48 after a short-term drop. A move above $0.50 could trigger recovery toward $0.54 or higher. THETA/USD 1-day chart analysis As of October 31, Theta (THETA) is trading at $0.484, up a marginal 0.21%, as the price stabilizes near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.492. The upper band sits around $0.600, defining the broader resistance zone. The narrow squeeze of the Bollinger Bands suggests volatility has contracted, with the token consolidating after a recent sell-off. THETA/USD 1-day chart by TradingView The MACD line sits flat near zero with both lines almost overlapping, signaling market indecision and a possible pause before a directional move. The RSI at 37.98 shows Theta is still hovering near the oversold region, hinting that bearish momentum could be losing strength. If Theta manages to hold above $0.48, it could retest $0.51–$0.54 in the short term. However, a daily close below $0.47 may expose it to further downside, potentially reaching $0.45 or even $0.43. THETA/USD 4-hour chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, Theta is showing mild consolidation after multiple failed attempts to push past $0.49. The Alligator indicator lines remain spread downward, confirming the lingering bearish structure. The short-term moving averages act as resistance between $0.492–$0.499, while the upper boundary at $0.510 marks the next level for potential breakout validation. The MACD histogram remains slightly negative, while the OBV reading of 465M indicates relatively weak buying interest. A sustained move above $0.50 could trigger short-term recovery momentum, but rejection here may drag the token back toward $0.475.

Theta is attempting to stabilize after heavy selling pressure, but momentum remains weak. A firm rebound above $0.50 would confirm short-term strength. Otherwise, the token may continue to hover sideways within the $0.47–$0.50 range before a clearer direction emerges. Is Theta a good investment? Theta shows solid long-term potential with its expanding ecosystem in streaming, media, and edge computing. Its strong fundamentals and growing partnerships support future growth, but adoption is still moderate and competition remains high, making it a promising yet risky investment. Will Theta reach $5? Theta is gradually expanding its ecosystem through partnerships in media, entertainment, and edge computing, which supports its long-term growth outlook. If this progress continues alongside broader market recovery, reaching $5 is achievable over time, though it remains dependent on sustained adoption and real utility demand. Will Theta reach $10? Given Theta’s all-time high of around $15.72 in 2021, reaching $10 again is possible if market conditions turn strongly bullish and adoption improves. However, with current low trading levels and slower ecosystem growth, such a rebound would likely take significant time and renewed investor interest. Will Theta reach $50? Per the market estimates and Theta price predictions, Theta prices are unlikely to reach $50 soon. Does Theta have a good long-term future? Theta has strong long-term potential with its focus on decentralized streaming and edge computing, supported by solid partnerships and tokenomics. However, limited adoption and strong competition make it a high-risk, high-reward project.

Theta historic price sentiment Theta Price History by CoinGecko THETA, launched in 2018 as an ERC-20 token before migrating to its own blockchain, initially dropped from $0.183 to around $0.066, trading between $0.051 and $0.107 through 2019. In 2020, it gained momentum, reaching $0.428 mid-year, $0.749 by September, and $1.5 by December. Early 2021 saw a major bull run, pushing THETA from $1.9 to an all-time high of $15.72 before correcting to ~$4 by July. A second rally lifted the price to ~$8 by November. Throughout 2022, THETA fluctuated between $1.2 and $4 but declined to ~$0.7 by year-end. In early 2023, it rebounded above $1 but slipped to $0.619 by October, recovering to ~$1.4 by December. In 2024, THETA opened the year near $1, climbed steadily to about $3.4 in March, then declined through the rest of the year to around $1.02 by December. In 2025, the coin struggled to regain momentum, trading mostly between $0.50 and $1.00, and in October 2025, it is currently trading between $0.4728 and $0.4961.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|THETA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-31 22:06:46

The company behind the world’s largest stablecoin just published its Q3 2025 attestation report, confirming over $10 billion in profit for the year so far, and record exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Tether now holds $135 billion in Treasuries, making it the 17th largest holder globally. Its flagship token, USD₮, has also crossed a massive milestone, with $174 billion in circulation as of September 30. With $181.2 billion in total reserves and $6.8 billion in excess reserves, Tether is not just maintaining its lead in the stablecoin market, it’s extending it. Tether Attestation Reports Q1-Q3 2025 Profit Surpassing $10B, Record Levels in U.S. Treasuries Exposure, Accelerating USD₮ Supply Amidst World’s Macroeconomic Uncertainty Learn more: https://t.co/EH8ltqri27 — Tether (@Tether_to) October 31, 2025 A Record-Breaking Year The numbers speak for themselves. Tether’s Q3 report shows one of the most profitable stretches in its history. In just the first three quarters of 2025, the company generated more than $10 billion in profit, a figure that surpasses many traditional financial institutions. That performance is driven by Tether’s heavy exposure to U.S. Treasuries. The company’s $135 billion Treasury position now ranks it above major economies and sovereign funds in holdings. The majority of its reserves are short-term, liquid assets, a structure that provides both safety and strong returns. For a company with roughly 150 employees worldwide, the scale of these results is remarkable. USD₮ Supply Continues to Surge Tether’s attestation also shows a strong increase in USD₮ supply during Q3 2025. The total circulation jumped by $17 billion over the quarter, ending at 174.4 billion USD₮. That growth mirrors rising demand in global markets, where users continue to turn to stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. In emerging markets especially, USD₮ has become a lifeline. Today, Tether estimates over 500 million people use USD₮ worldwide, from freelancers in Asia to merchants in Africa and Latin America. It’s not just another crypto token. For many, it’s their most reliable form of digital money. $181B in Reserves, $6.8B in Cushion Tether’s balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. The company reported $181.2 billion in total assets, fully backing every USD₮ in circulation. On top of that, an additional $6.8 billion in excess reserves provides an extra safety layer, funds that go beyond the 100% liquid backing required. That surplus acts as a financial buffer, reinforcing market confidence. It’s also part of why USD₮ has remained stable through every market cycle, from bull runs to liquidity crunches. Transparency remains central to Tether’s operations. Each quarter, attestation reports confirm the composition of reserves and verify that every token is supported by equivalent assets. The 17th Largest Holder of U.S. Treasuries Perhaps the most striking number in the Q3 report is Tether’s $135 billion exposure to U.S. Treasuries. That figure officially makes Tether the 17th largest holder of U.S. government debt, larger than most central banks. This exposure has effectively tied Tether’s financial health to one of the most secure markets in the world. The interest generated from these holdings has become a key driver of the company’s profits. Tether’s Treasury-heavy portfolio shows how closely traditional and digital finance have become intertwined. The stablecoin market is now a major participant in global liquidity flows, and Tether sits at the center of that shift. Tether just released its quarterly attestation for Q3 2025. USDT has become the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity, with more than 500 million users across the emerging markets and developing countries. Highlights as of 30 September 2025: *… https://t.co/XVYeVq1u64 pic.twitter.com/nZ2V1EKZ3x — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) October 31, 2025 From Stablecoin to Global Financial Power For years, Tether has been viewed mainly as a stablecoin issuer. But 2025 marks the year that changed. With its growing profits and diversification plans, Tether is evolving into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. The company is already expanding into artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and P2P technology. These moves signal a broader vision, one that goes beyond crypto trading and into real-world infrastructure. By investing in AI and energy projects, Tether aims to support innovation and sustainability, while reducing reliance on traditional financial systems. It’s a long-term strategy that blends finance, technology, and global access. The World’s Digital Dollar The scale of USD₮’s adoption is unprecedented. In developing regions, where banking infrastructure often fails to meet demand, USD₮ fills the gap. It gives users access to digital dollars without needing a traditional bank account. From local traders in Nigeria to startups in Argentina, USD₮ enables stable transactions, remittances, and savings in markets hit by inflation or currency controls. This widespread use has made Tether a cornerstone of global financial inclusion. The company calls it “the biggest financial inclusion success story in history.” Numbers That Define 2025 Tether’s attestation lays out the picture clearly: $174.4B USD₮ issued as of Q3 2025 $181.2B in total assets and reserves $6.8B+ in excess reserves $135B+ in U.S. Treasuries $10B+ in profit across Q1–Q3 $17B USDT supply increase in Q3 alone These metrics don’t just show growth, they show dominance. The Most Profitable Company in Crypto The biggest surprise for many? The most profitable company in crypto isn’t an exchange, it’s Tether. With $10 billion in profit year-to-date, Tether has outperformed nearly every major crypto firm, including top trading platforms. Its business model, simple, transparent, and backed by liquid reserves, continues to generate consistent returns. Its ability to manage such vast holdings while maintaining full liquidity makes it one of the most efficient financial operations in the industry. With profit soaring, reserves expanding, and new investments underway, Tether is shaping itself into more than a stablecoin company. It’s becoming a global financial powerhouse, one that merges traditional stability with digital efficiency. The company’s focus on AI and renewable energy shows its intent to influence the future beyond crypto markets. Its USD₮ token continues to anchor the digital economy, while its profits and investments expand its role across sectors. As the world faces ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, demand for stability is rising. And for hundreds of millions of users, that stability comes in one form, USD₮.

XRP ($XRP): Claude AI Predicts Strong Double-Digit Growth According to Claude crypto report, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) stands out as one of the most promising breakout assets. The AI suggests the token could rally toward the $8 mark by year’s end, representing a 217% increase from its current price of $2.52. Source: Claude AI Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC earlier in the year reignited market optimism, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, the asset has climbed an impressive 380% year-to-date and 392% in the last 365 days, outperforming Bitcoin’s 55% growth and Ethereum’s 50% by nearly 7x to 8x. With the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s close contacts with the current pro-crypto US administration, Ripple has further cemented its status as a compliance-friendly digital payments provider, drawing strong investor interest in regulatory-aligned crypto solutions. Several bullish flag setups have formed across XRP’s 2025 price charts, hinting at sustained technical momentum. If additional market catalysts emerge, such as a wave of expected ETF approvals, new institutional partnerships, or the timely delivery of “Project Crypto”—an SEC initiative to provide clarity to the industry, a 12-month target of $8 could become a realistic target. Sui Network: Claude Calls This One an Easy 10X Crypto Sui Network ($SUI) continues to generate substantial buzz, positioning itself as a blockchain capable of outperforming Ethereum in speed and scalability. While the “Ethereum killer” label often depends on perspective, Sui’s standout feature is its extraordinary throughput, reportedly handling up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum’s average of just 15 TPS. In the last 24 hours, SUI has risen 3%, trading at $2.35. Claude’s report suggests the token could sustain this uptrend and potentially reach $25 next year, thanks to its sophisticated smart contract ecosystem, scalability, and interoperability. If current slow market conditions persist, Sui could feasibly touch $5 by Christmas. Technical indicators, however, support a breakout scenario, with the forming two bullish flag patterns over the last year, typically a precursor to prolonged upside potential. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Titan May Double Rapidly, Says Claude Aave ($AAVE) remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive returns through a secure, efficient platform. Renowned for its flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain accessibility, Aave has played a pivotal role in advancing the DeFi landscape. Its commitment to innovation, community governance, and growing institutional traction positions Aave not just as a survivor of the DeFi boom, but as one of its key architects. Claude AI envisions Aave’s price potentially soaring from current levels of $217 all the way up to to $1,000, a remarkable jump of 5x in 12 months. Currently, Aave’s price action is forming an expanding triangle pattern. It could actually reach the lower target of $600 early next year, which will be a strong psychological foothold on the way to $1,000. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Bold Meme Coin Presale with 4,900x Potential! Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been billed “the Dogecoin of this cycle” despite still only being in presale, and such buzz has already attracted over $3.8 million in funding from investors hoping for outsized gains. Claude’s crypto report believes his one is explosive, estimating potential returns of up to 4,900% from its current low fixed presale price of $0.0002655. If Claude’s analysis is correct, Maxi Doge could be worth $0.013275 in a year, which would still make it worth only a penny even after it has hypothetically gone to the moon. Marketed as Dogecoin’s more chaotic and high-energy relative, Maxi Doge thrives on crypto’s degen culture, leveraging viral memes, contests, and community interaction to fuel growth. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions than Dogecoin’s dated chain. Of the total 150.24 billion MAXI tokens, 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” aimed at supporting marketing efforts, strategic collaborations, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 79% APY, though yields will gradually decrease as staking participation rises. The current presale price is $0.0002655, with incremental increases set for upcoming rounds. Investors can acquire MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

October opened with “Uptober” optimism since the vast majority of Octobers in crypto’s 15 year history have resulted in serious gains However, there was no such luck this year. President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports caused one of the biggest crashes in crypto history, although old hands were unperturbed, noting that big crashes that flush out over-leveraged players often precede historic bull runs. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Wednesday has not prevented two consecutive dip days. Still, crypto has been here for 1.5 decades and it’s only growing by the day, whatever prices say. So, read on to find out why XRP, Bitcoin and Solana are three trending cryptos to jump on this halloween. Ripple (XRP): How the Global Payments Leader Became King of Trending Cryptos in 2025 Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , powers a lightning-fast, low-cost payments network designed to replace legacy cross-border systems such as SWIFT. Through partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and multiple major U.S. banks, Ripple has secured its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $150 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, marks a bold step in the crucial stablecoin sector. Over the past twelve months, XRP has jumped 381%, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-July, its first in seven years, while Bitcoin posted a comparatively modest 52% gain during the same period. Its price chart shows two bullish flag formations this summer. Pending ETF approvals and the passage of comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. could provide the final catalyst for XRP to hit the $5–$10 range this year. Bitcoin ($BTC): Gemini AI Forecasts a Climb Toward $250,000 Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s first and most recognized cryptocurrency, continues to dominate headlines after reaching a record high of $126,080 on October 6. wIf the US SEC delivers on the promise of “Project Crypto”, an initiative to modernise federal securities laws to give crypto firms clearer guidance, then Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2026. Even under normal conditions, Bitcoin could conceivably hit $150,000, given the fact that it has set multiple new all-time highs this year. Another development that could catalyse demand is Trump’s delivery of his pre-election promise for a Strategic US Bitcoin reserve. As the benchmark for the entire sector, Bitcoin attracts both institutional and retail, often viewed as a “digital gold” hedge against inflation. It currently accounts for $2.2 trillion of the global crypto’s $3.8 trillion capitalization. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its reputation as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in operation today. With a market capitalization over $102 billion and over $11 billion in total value locked , Solana is the second biggest DeFi network after Ethereum. Tuesday marked a major milestone as Grayscale and Bitwise launched spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange, a development expected to attract significant institutional investment, mirroring the inflows seen after recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Following a spring low near $100 in April, SOL has recovered to $186. A falling wedge pattern and a bullish flag formed across Solana’s support and resistance lines this year. These two formations typically precede major breakouts but they are as yet unrealized. Key technical levels show solid support near $150 and heavy resistance around $250. Should the recent ETF launches continue to drive demand, SOL could revisit its previous all-time high of $293.31, and, under strong bull market conditions, potentially advance toward $500 or even $1,000 by Christmas. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Timely Reminder that Next Year’s Trending Cryptos are in This Year’s Presales Market Finally, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) hasn’t listed yet, but it is likely to be one of the biggest trending cryptos of 2026. It merges Bitcoin’s security with high-performance Layer-2 capabilities, amplified by meme-driven community appeal. HYPER seeks to enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem through near-instant transactions, decentralized governance via a DAO framework, and native smart contract functionality powered by its proprietary Layer-2 architecture. The presale has already surpassed $25.3 million, with some analysts projecting 100x potential post-launch. Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates a high-speed Canonical Bridge that enables smooth BTC transfers and decentralized app (dApp) compatibility. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor trust in the project’s foundation. HYPER tokens form the backbone of the ecosystem, facilitating governance, staking, and transactional functions. Early investors can currently earn staking yields up to 46% APY.

Chase Early Stage Gains Before Prices Climb and Demand Goes Wild Solana Positioned for “Two Ways to Win” as Stablecoin and Tokenization Markets Expand Solana earns serious respect after Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated that the network has two powerful growth streams. First, stablecoins keep shifting to faster chains. Solana handles high transaction volumes at low cost, attracting new payment innovations. Western Union has already confirmed plans for a Solana-based stablecoin to support global money movement. Second, tokenization builds pace with institutions exploring real-world assets on the chain. Solana controls around 14 percent of this sector, leaving significant upside. If adoption continues to rise while network activity remains strong, Solana could enjoy a catch-up run similar to Bitcoin’s once-explosive rally during dual market success. Frequently Asked Questions about Solana Why are institutions interested in Solana? Institutions need fast settlement and predictable fees. Solana offers both while supporting secure token issuance for digitized assets. These strengths attract large players seeking efficient payment infrastructure and asset innovation. Is Solana a long-term investment option? Yes. Solana benefits from growing developer activity, strong liquidity, and the expansion of stablecoins. While volatility continues, the chain’s performance edge supports strong competitiveness in the long-term ecosystem race. BullZilla: Best Crypto Presales with 100x Potential Driven by Scarcity, Hype, and ROI BullZilla builds its appeal around progressive price increases and fast-moving demand that investors associate with the best crypto presales with 100x potential .

Specific exchange names, including Coinbase, are not officially confirmed yet. Listing decisions depend on compliance, liquidity, trading demand, and partner readiness. Why Staking Can Supercharge Gains in Presale Projects? Holding tokens through staking allows users to earn additional rewards and reduce selling pressure at launch. These programs help boost momentum and assist price discovery. They build loyalty and encourage longer conviction among holders. Lock Tokens Early While Massive ROI Remains in Sight Aster Sinks but Volume Remains Strong as Traders Watch for Recovery Aster recently declined by more than 17% over 24 hours, dropping to $0.86. Volatility hit the newly launched network, which now trades over 64 percent below its high. Strong volume around $688M shows traders are still active. Confidence remains because Aster still has more than 920% gains from its September lows. Investors watch whether support forms to keep growth valid. Aster continues to build adoption, which may provide stability going forward, with development momentum supporting better market reactions. Frequently Asked Questions about Aster Why did Aster drop recently? Prices corrected due to high volatility and profit-taking after significant gains. Substantial volume signals persistent interest, though recovery depends on buyers maintaining confidence as development progresses. Is Aster still promising? Yes. Despite pullbacks, Aster remains far above earlier lows. As long as utility and ecosystem activity continue to grow, the project can recover strongly and resume long-term upward momentum. Conclusion – Is BullZilla the Best Crypto Presale with 100X Potential Market news reflects two clear themes shaping the crypto environment today. Solana pushes deeper into institutional finance through stablecoin innovation and tokenization momentum, reinforcing its role as a major ecosystem contender. At the same time, Aster shows that newly launched tokens can move aggressively in either direction due to heightened volatility and increased trader attention. Participation rises as adoption expands across payment systems, smart contract networks, and tokenized real-world assets. The entire industry evolves, with more utilities supporting stronger, long-term market health overall. BullZilla, meanwhile, captures peak opportunity interest as hype accelerates and entry points disappear quickly. Its fast-climbing presale and high ROI projections make it one of the best crypto presales with 100x potential in Q4. Scarcity grows as stages advance, and staking provides lasting income strength that appeals to committed holders. Delay raises cost, which pressures users to join before the Stage 9 price increases limit upside. The next bull wave is forming, and BullZilla positions itself to lead momentum and attract significant attention.

Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Coinbase’s third‑quarter revenue surged to $1.87 billion, which came in above the $1.8 billion expectation, triggering a 9% rally on the COIN stock rose by 9% by Friday’s close. The company has been partnering with Wall Street giants like JP Morgan, Citi, and PNC, who are all using Coinbase to provide crypto access inside their platforms, calling it a foundational build, not a short‑term revenue lift. Banks adopt Coinbase infrastructure In late July, Coinbase said it would integrate its institutional Crypto‑as‑a‑Service platform into PNC, allowing its clients to buy, hold, and sell crypto directly from their existing bank environment. Later in the month, Coinbase announced multiple product offerings with J.P. Morgan. These offerings link Chase bank accounts to Coinbase wallets. Customers can move funds directly between the two. They can also transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points into Coinbase accounts. Users can also fund their Coinbase accounts with Chase credit cards. This is where Coinbase moves from being an exchange people log into separately to being a built‑in layer inside normal banking activity. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote that Coinbase is “fast becoming the AWS of crypto financial infrastructure as big banks such as JPM, Citi, PNC choose Coinbase as their crypto partner.” Chhugani refers to Amazon Web Services, which is the unseen backend behind most major tech products. This framing is being used to describe Coinbase’s position as financial systems adopt blockchain rails for processing. Analysts outline expected upside Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase with a price target of $510, which would represent 55% upside. Bernstein analysts wrote that Coinbase is “executing on its crypto dream, where blockchain rails would re‑architect capital markets, banking and payments.” They also stated that the company’s path is not based on token price cycles but on building a business that services institutional financial systems. Barclays holds an equal‑weight rating with a price target of $357, which implies 8.7% upside. Barclays analysts said its management expressed confidence in active developments across payments, exchanges, and capital formation. Needham has a buy rating and a $400 price target, implying 21.8% upside. Needham analysts wrote that management is seeing strong demand for stablecoin infrastructure. They stated that Coinbase continues to receive partnership mandates from large firms such as Citi and BlackRock while also seeing increased interest from small and medium‑sized businesses. Rosenblatt has a buy rating and a $470 price target, which implies 43.1% upside. Rosenblatt analysts wrote that over 1,000 businesses are currently using Coinbase for stablecoin payments and that another 1,000 businesses are on the waitlist. They listed partnerships with Citi, Stripe, PayPal, Revolut, Webull, and Shopify as examples of how Coinbase is now being used as the on‑chain payments gateway for companies building crypto‑based transaction flows.

The sudden decline followed an initial post-Fed volatility spike, as traders reacted to the US Federal Reserve’s 25bps rate cut and announcement of an impending end to quantitative tightening. With uncertainty still lingering, BTC briefly slipped into a risk-off spiral, testing investor conviction and flushing out leveraged positions in the process. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite the market turbulence, several analysts argue this move may represent a classic shakeout, rather than the beginning of a larger breakdown. Historically, Bitcoin has often seen sharp pullbacks immediately before renewed upside momentum, especially during early liquidity-expansion phases. For now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can stabilize and reclaim the $110K zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot throughout the past month. As markets digest the Fed’s decision, the focus turns to whether Bitcoin can wake up from this sudden sell-off and reclaim strength heading into November. PoC Becomes Critical Battleground as Market Signals Indecision According to top analyst On-chain Mind, Bitcoin’s current price structure is being defined by a major volume cluster centered around $117,000, which now serves as the Point of Control (PoC) in the local market profile. This level represents the price zone with the highest traded volume in the recent range — effectively the point where buyers and sellers have shown the strongest interest and where the market has spent considerable time balancing liquidity. In practical terms, the PoC functions as a fair value zone for market participants. When the price trades below it, bulls need to reclaim the level to regain trend strength; when the price trades above it, the zone tends to act as support. Today, BTC remains beneath the $117K PoC, signaling that the market has yet to re-establish bullish dominance after the recent shakeout. On-chain Mind notes that reclaiming $117K would likely trigger renewed momentum, opening the door for a retest of the $120K–$123K range. Until then, however, the structure remains indecisive, with price hovering in a neutral zone where neither bulls nor bears hold a clear advantage. This aligns with broader market behavior: reduced leverage, mixed sentiment, and trader caution following aggressive liquidations earlier in October. The market is digesting macro shifts, recalibrating position sizes, and waiting for a clearer signal. If Bitcoin can stabilize above recent support and begin rotating back toward the PoC, reclaiming $117K could mark the moment the next leg up begins.

The price managed to reclaim the $110K level, suggesting buyers stepped in at intraday lows around $108,500, an important local demand zone that has repeatedly supported the price since mid-October. However, the recovery remains fragile, with BTC now approaching a cluster of short-term resistance levels. The 50-period EMA sits just above the current price, and the 100- and 200-period moving averages remain overhead, stacked bearishly. This alignment indicates that momentum has not fully shifted back to the bulls yet. To regain control, BTC must break above $112,000–$113,000, where multiple moving averages converge and prior support now acts as resistance. Clearing this zone would open the path toward the critical $117,500 Point of Control — the key level bulls need to reclaim to re-establish medium-term strength.

For now, BTC remains in a neutral recovery posture, trying to build a base while navigating overhead pressure from macro uncertainty and recent leverage unwinds.

53882327,618253,1761951656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53882327.jpeg,Is Zcash Quantum-Resistant Yet? Experts Weigh In,https://bitcoinist.com/is-zcash-quantum-resistant-yet-experts/,"A debate on X this week exposed a core question for on-chain privacy: when quantum computers are able to break elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), will they be able to retroactively deanonymize every transaction ever made of privacy coins like Zcash? Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics and partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that the answer is effectively yes for most privacy coins. “For privacy coins, even if they migrate to post-quantum cryptographic schemes, all historical transactions prior to that migration can be decrypted,” he said on October 30, 2025. “So all historical txns will be stripped of privacy in >~5y. Everything is built on ECC.” Carter’s point is based on “harvest now, decrypt later.” Attackers don’t need to break you today. They just copy the data now and crack it once quantum is strong enough. On blockchains, that problem is worse because the data is already public and permanent. “Blockchains are uniquely bad for quantum because normally the quantum thing is ‘harvest now decrypt later’ so adversaries have to be preemptively harvesting traffic but blockchains just.. publish.. everything.. forever.” He warned specifically that even if a privacy coin upgrades to quantum-resistant signatures in the future, old activity is still exposed once ECC falls. “While privacy coins can adopt post quantum sigs, understand that all previously hidden addresses, relationships between addresses, etc, will be revealed once ECC is broken,” Carter said. “And obviously everything is on chain so you don’t even need to harvest traffic today.” Is Zcash Already Quantum-Resistant? That claim triggered pushback from Zcash supporters, who argue Zcash is structurally different from something like Monero. Mert Mumtaz (Helius) agreed that Carter’s warning applies to “many privacy coins like Monero ,” but said it’s “not necessarily true for zcash’s privacy, given advanced opsec.” He acknowledged that “advanced opsec is not the norm,” but said that if it is followed, Zcash users “get you certain guarantees w.r.t information leakage.” He also said “some things are in the works to make this even stronger,” pointing to research by Zcash engineer Sean Bowe. Bowe’s position is that Zcash’s fully shielded pool simply does not put critical sender/receiver information on the ledger in the first place. “There is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe said in July this year. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” His condition is clear: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” Carter partially credits that. “Zec is definitely ahead of anyone when it comes to quantum preparedness, not denying that,” he said. But he called the “already quantum-proof” framing unrealistic in practice. He argued that Zcash’s long-term privacy story depends on very strong assumptions that often break in the real world: “assumes pubkey never being known. assumes: no metadata collection, no exchange key leaks, perfect metadata privacy.” He added that Zcash’s shielded pools — Sprout, Sapling, Orchard — still “rely on ECC for key exchange, viewkeys, proof verification, which are all broken” under a powerful quantum adversary. His conclusion: “unrealistic to say zec privacy is perfectly q resistant. linkages between addrs are forever encoded on the blockchain, you and Sean know that. store now decrypt later still applies.” In other words: Zcash builders say that if you stay fully shielded, the chain itself won’t hand quantum attackers a clean map of who paid whom. Carter says that in the real world, users leak, exchanges leak, metadata leaks — and once ECC breaks, those leaks plus the permanent ledger are enough to unwind the privacy anyway. One final note: when asked directly, Carter denied holding ZEC. “Nope.” At press time, ZEC traded at $366.",Crypto News|Quantum Computing|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|WALLET|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 23:00:56

In a decision filed Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed an earlier ruling from the District of Wyoming that sided with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Source: Court Listener Tenth Circuit Upholds Fed’s Decision to Block Custodia’s Access to U.S. Payment System The judgment marks the latest setback in Custodia’s five-year effort to obtain a Federal Reserve “master account,” a critical gateway for direct participation in the U.S. banking system. “This case comes clothed in 21st Century terms: cryptocurrency, digital assets, instant wire transfers, and master accounts,” the judges wrote in the opinion. “But there is nothing new about this issue. Courts have probed the legality of our nation’s central bank and interpreted the relevant statutes since the founding.” The three-judge panel, composed of Circuit Judges Tymkovich, Ebel, and Rossman, upheld the lower court’s conclusion that the Federal Reserve acted within its authority when it denied Custodia’s application. The ruling effectively leaves the central bank’s decision intact, confirming that the Fed retains broad discretion in determining which financial institutions can access its payment infrastructure. Custodia, previously known as Avanti Bank, first applied for a master account in October 2020 after receiving a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter from the state of Wyoming. The application, typically processed within a week, languished for over 19 months without resolution. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City formally rejected the request, citing “safety and soundness” concerns tied to the bank’s focus on digital assets. U.S. digital asset-focused bank Custodia has filed a lawsuit against the FED Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City over “unlawfully” delaying its application for a master account with the FED. Read more https://t.co/8rpBp5piaM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2022 The Fed argued that Custodia’s business model relied too heavily on volatile crypto markets and lacked sufficient controls to manage illicit finance risks. It also pointed to the bank’s limited experience in traditional risk management and the potential systemic implications of granting direct access to a crypto-centered institution. Custodia sued the Federal Reserve in June 2022 , claiming an “unlawful delay” and arguing that eligible institutions are entitled to a master account under federal law. After the Wyoming court ruled in favor of the Fed in March 2024 , Custodia appealed, asserting that the decision gave the central bank excessive discretion over market access. Judge Rules Against Digital Asset Bank Custodia’s Bid for Federal Reserve Master Account Custodia Bank has been denied a U.S. Federal Reserve master account by the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. #CryptoNews https://t.co/lHtNJ69ZdW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 31, 2024 Friday’s ruling reaffirmed the lower court’s position, dealing another blow to Long’s push to integrate crypto banking into the U.S. financial system. In a statement posted to X following the judgment, Custodia said it was “actively considering” petitioning for a rehearing. Statement of @custodiabank : pic.twitter.com/6U0FPzaKCm — Custodia Bank (@custodiabank) October 31, 2025 “While we were hoping for a win at the Tenth Circuit today, we received the next big thing — a strong dissent,” the company wrote, referring to a partial dissent that raised constitutional questions about the Federal Reserve’s authority. Why Won’t the Fed Grant Crypto Firms a Master Account? A Federal Reserve master account would have allowed Custodia to connect directly to core U.S. payment systems such as Fedwire and the Automated Clearing House (ACH). Such access enables banks to settle transactions, hold reserves, and participate directly in monetary policy operations, benefits currently limited to regulated depository institutions. Crypto-focused firms have long sought similar access to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on intermediary banks. However, the Federal Reserve has not approved any master account applications from crypto-native institutions to date. The central bank has repeatedly cited the sector’s high volatility, potential for fraud, and insufficient consumer protection as reasons for caution.

Long said the initiative proved that banks could “tokenize demand deposits on a permissionless blockchain in a regulatorily compliant manner.” Despite such efforts, federal regulators have maintained a cautious stance. Speaking in March, Long said that under the current administration, no meaningful changes have been made to rules labeling digital asset exposure as “unsafe and unsound” for banks.

The US and UK have both targeted Chen this month with coordinated sanctions on 146 entities and individuals tied to Prince Group, including Chen and key associates, in what has been tagged the largest such action ever against a cybercriminal network. The US Department of Justice charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia, responsible for stealing billions in cryptocurrency from global victims. The US Treasury Department has reportedly seized over $15 billion in assets, including Bitcoin, London properties worth £100 million, and holdings in Palau, it for being linked to him in what marks the largest ever crypto seizure. He is now just as popular in law enforcement circles in Singapore, with reports claiming Singaporean police are moving against the Cambodian Prince Group. On October 31, Singaporean police revealed they had launched an enforcement operation against Chen Zhi and his accomplices on October 30, which led to the seizure of assets worth more than $115 million (approximately RMB 800 million). As part of the enforcement operation, Singapore police have issued restraining orders against a total of six properties and various financial assets registered under the names of Chen Zhi and his accomplices. These assets included bank accounts, securities accounts, and cash, with a total estimated value exceeding S$165 million. The cops also seized a yacht, 11 vehicles, and numerous bottles of alcohol. Chen acquires Cambodian citizenship, drops Chinese nationality On his company website, Chen Zhi is described as “a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist” whose “vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards.” He was raised in Fujian province in south-eastern China, and started out with a small internet gaming company that did not have much success. Then he moved to Cambodia around late 2010 or 2011, where he secured employment in the real estate sector According to BBC News, this was also around the time Chinese folks were gathering in Cambodia for various reasons, including the fact that new casinos sprang up, as well as gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. Things become bizarre when you consider the status he held in Cambodia. Not only did he become a citizen of other countries like Vanuatu and Cyprus, he also had thriving businesses linked to the Prince property arm, including five-star hotels in Sihanoukville. Chen was even awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia’s king, that of “Neak Oknha”, which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government, in 2020. Despite all this, Chen kept a low profile and was an enigma, saying little in public spaces. “Everyone I’ve spoken to who’s worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,” says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three-year-long investigation of Chen Zhi. “I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.” Since news of his sanctions was announced last week, Chen has been AWOL.

Using the Gaussian Channel, EGRAG projected that the cryptocurrency might rise as much as 244% from its present value, challenging the view held by some analysts that the bull market may already be over.

He compared the current market structure to XRP’s performance during the 2017–2018 bull run , when the token rose by roughly 3,700%, reaching around $0.39 before entering a consolidation phase. #XRP – Math, Numbers & a Touch of Sarcasm : This post for those who think logically (well… kinda ) — a mix of numbers, patterns, and a dash of mockery toward a few “TA masters” out there 1⃣ The 10% Theory: Based on the Gaussian Channel (2-week timeframe), I… pic.twitter.com/GkWlQdJZ6L — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 30, 2025 By contrast, EGRAG noted that XRP has advanced by only about 370% in the current cycle, a fraction of its previous rally. He then applied the same ratio observed in 2017’s final surge, when XRP jumped 2,440% to hit $3.30. Based on that relationship, his model suggests a potential range between $5.50 and $6.00 this time around. EGRAG also rejected the popular “diminishing returns” argument that claims each cycle produces smaller percentage gains. He highlighted XRP’s 1,700% rise during the 2021 cycle, which occurred despite regulatory pressure from the SEC lawsuit and an overall bearish market mood. He contends that advancements in technology and growing global adoption make larger gains feasible once again. According to his calculations, repeating the 2021 rally could push XRP above $5 in the coming months. Diminishing Bear Market Losses EGRAG further pointed to a pattern of shrinking losses in XRP’s historical downtrends, describing it as evidence of long-term market maturity. The first major downturn saw a 96% fall from the top, while the next dropped by 86%, showing a gradual 10% improvement. If the pattern holds, the next decline could limit losses to around 76%. This pattern also allows EGRAG to estimate potential bottoms for future cycles. If XRP reaches $5–$6 at the top of the current run, he predicts the next market low could form between $1.20 and $1.40.

Investors who accumulated below $0.50, he noted, remain well-positioned regardless of near-term fluctuations. Other analysts share EGRAG’s optimism about XRP’s long-term outlook but anticipate short-term weakness. DustyBC, for example, believes the asset may first complete a corrective phase before beginning a major third wave upward. His chart analysis places XRP between $2.00 and $2.40 to finalize the second wave before resuming its broader uptrend. Similarly, Casi Trades has identified nearby support and resistance zones that could guide XRP’s next move. After rejecting resistance around $2.68, XRP turned slightly bearish, with Casi noting support levels at $2.42, $2.03, and $1.65. A close below $2.42, she warned, could extend the decline toward $1.65, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. However, she believes this pullback would likely mark the end of the correction and prepare the asset for a sustained breakout to new highs. While the short-term picture for XRP remains mixed, EGRAG’s Gaussian Channel analysis presents a strong case for further gains, potentially lifting the asset above $5 if historical patterns persist. Though other analysts expect a temporary dip before the next upward move, the consensus remains that XRP’s broader structure continues to strengthen, signaling room for a significant rally before this cycle concludes.

His commentary shifts the focus from short-term trading and speculative exits to planning, tax efficiency, and wealth preservation strategies that allow holders to retain exposure while generating cash flow. Claver begins by stressing the importance of having a concrete plan before prices surge. He observes that many retail investors keep tokens on exchanges and liquidate positions as soon as targets are hit, often incurring large tax bills and spending windfalls without a long-term strategy. By contrast, disciplined planning can preserve capital and enable ongoing income generation while allowing the underlying asset to appreciate further. Do you have a plan for your crypto profits? Most people reading this won't do any of it. They'll keep their XRP on an exchange, sell when it hits their number, pay a bunch in taxes, buy liabilities, and wonder where it went. That's fine. More assets for the people who see it… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 30, 2025 Leveraging Institutional Lending A central element of Claver’s approach is borrowing against appreciated crypto rather than converting it to fiat. Institutional-grade crypto lending markets now permit qualified borrowers to use digital assets as collateral and obtain cash without triggering taxable events from sales. Claver suggests that investors who expect a substantial valuation increase can borrow a conservative percentage; he cites an example of borrowing roughly 30% against a position to access funds for living expenses, investment, or business needs. Properly structured, this method preserves the growth potential of the collateral while providing liquidity. Tax and Legal Structures Claver warns that holding sizable crypto balances in an individual’s personal name exposes assets to tax events, litigation risk, and estate complications. He recommends establishing appropriate legal entities, such as properly administered limited liability companies or trusts, and, when applicable, using institutional custody solutions. These measures can provide creditor protection, clearer succession planning, and easier onboarding with banks and service providers that service high-net-worth digital portfolios. He cautions that improperly maintained entities (for example, co-mingling personal and entity funds) can void protections and create additional legal exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For individuals or families with material crypto exposure, Claver recommends operational controls typically used by institutional investors. These include multi-signature custody, independent audit trails, segregation of duties, and working with custodians that provide insurance and compliance reporting. He also advises building relationships with financial institutions that understand digital assets so that lending and banking needs can be met without friction. Accessing Liquidity Without Selling To illustrate, Claver uses a hypothetical; an investor holding 10,000 XRP at a future $100 price would nominally hold $1,000,000 in value. Rather than liquidating, the investor could protocol a loan for a portion of that value, say $300,000, using the XRP as collateral. The loan proceeds could be allocated to living costs, investments that produce income, or business opportunities, while the XRP position remains intact and continues to participate in any further upside. Interest payments and loan structure determine the net cash flow. The key advantage is avoiding a taxable sale that permanently reduces exposure. Claver also outlines the risks. Borrowing against volatile collateral requires margin management and contingency plans for price declines. Lenders may demand additional collateral or liquidate positions if values fall below maintenance thresholds. Legal structures and custody arrangements have costs and administrative requirements. He stresses that such strategies are not suitable for all holders, particularly small retail positions, and recommends seeking competent legal, tax, and financial advice before implementation. Claver argues that the difference between a one-time windfall and enduring family wealth is strategy and execution. Investors who prepare legal structures, adopt institutional-grade custody, and use lending facilities responsibly can potentially access ongoing liquidity without selling their core holdings. For those seeking to convert crypto gains into sustained financial security, the emphasis should be on preservation, tax efficiency, and controlled leverage rather than immediate monetization.

Although altcoins have recently lagged behind Bitcoin, bullish factors from data and macroeconomic parallels are building optimism that a change in liquidity conditions might trigger a strong market-wide rally for altcoins. Altcoin Dominance Hits Record Oversold Levels According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, altcoin dominance has entered oversold conditions for the first time in history. Marks highlighted in his post that the indicator, which measures the market share of all altcoins, is now the most oversold it’s ever been. The OTHERS.D chart shows the market dominance percentage of all cryptocurrencies except the top 10 by market capitalization. It is a measure of the combined market share of smaller altcoins and can be used to identify broader altcoin rallies. His long-term chart of the OTEHRS.D movement spans over a decade, with each major low followed by an extended period of recovery and massive market gains. The chart reveals that dominance has declined sharply since its 2021 peak of around 20%. At the time of writing, the OTHERS.D dominance is around 7%. A wave trend indicator at the bottom of the chart is in deep negative territory around negative 50%, which is its lowest in history. Marks noted that such oversold conditions often precede strong reversals. It means that selling pressure has been exhausted and that a major rebound could soon begin. If this pattern repeats, altcoins may be entering one of their most attractive accumulation phases in years. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Top 10 Dominance. Source: Javon Marks on X Fed’s Monetary Shifts And Their Impact On Crypto Liquidity Another technical perspective came from analyst Ted Pillows, who compared current market conditions to the 2019-2020 cycle when the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening (QT) and later resumed quantitative easing (QE). His chart of the crypto total market cap excluding Bitcoin shows a 42% decline following the end of QT in late 2019, followed by an explosive recovery after the Fed initiated QE in March 2020. Pillows explained that while ending QT may ease financial pressure, it does not directly inject liquidity into the economy, something altcoins need to rally. In contrast, QE or Treasury General Account (TGA) releases flood the market with liquidity and allow inflows into cryptocurrencies. He noted that ending QT isn’t enough for alts to rally. It is either the Fed starts another QE or the Treasury releases TGA liquidity into the economy. The most feasible option right now is the second one. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC. Source: Ted Pillows On X With the US government currently in a shutdown, he suggested that a TGA-driven liquidity release may occur once the fiscal impasse is resolved, and this will serve as the next major driving force for the altcoin market.

He explains that the value of XRP stems from its foundational role in the XRP Ledger. He believes many people misunderstand XRP by comparing it to stablecoins or other tokens, but that view misses the main point. Mickle Says XRP’s Value Is ‘Foundational,’ Not Just A Pitch In a recent X post, Mickle said that most people in crypto still do not understand what makes XRP special . He explained that when people ask, “What’s the current pitch for XRP?” they are asking the wrong question. To him, XRP does not need a sales pitch because its value is foundational. The cryptocurrency doesn’t depend on price movements, short-term excitement, or temporary stories. Instead, it is part of the very system that powers the XRP Ledger. Mickle compared XRP to well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that they share common traits. They are native, non-issued assets that exist without a counterparty, meaning they are not created or backed by any one company or government. Like these leading cryptocurrencies, XRP provides the liquidity that allows value to move and settle across its decentralized network. According to Mickle, this is what gives XRP a lasting importance. It is not a token that depends on external promises or a central authority, but the heart of a decentralized system that operates independently. XRP Ledger Depends On XRP’s Native Role In Decentralized Settlement Mickle also suggests that the XRP Ledger cannot exist or operate without XRP. He said this is what many people miss when they compare XRP to other digital assets. The XRP ledger was built in a way that makes XRP an important part of how value moves and settles across the network. He noted that XRP’s speed, ability to handle many transactions, and connection with other systems make it stand out from most blockchains in the crypto space. Using Ripple’s payment tools as examples, Mickle showed how XRP plays a key role in helping different kinds of assets, like stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cryptocurrencies, move smoothly across decentralized systems. These tools make it possible to send money anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply, without going through banks or middlemen. Mickle added that XRP is a native digital asset, while stablecoins are tied to fiat money and rely on traditional financial systems to keep their value. He said this is what makes XRP unique and gives it real independence in the digital economy. This distinction, he said, is the very essence of crypto and the reason XRP continues to matter as a foundational digital asset . According to Mickle, understanding this difference is what separates those who genuinely understand crypto from those who do not.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 00:00:25

Billions of people across the world are going to be left out due to various reasons like language barriers and electricity availability, and fuel inequalities, as outlined in the tech firm’s “AI Diffusion Report,” which outlines how AI use, infrastructure, and innovation are spreading globally. Language barriers worsen the global inequality in AI While Microsoft acknowledges that AI tech is fast growing and spreading like no other tech before, there are fears this AI wave will not be experienced by everyone in the world therefore “deepen global inequality.” According to the Microsoft report , most AI models are trained in English, which means billions across the world cannot access the technology in their native languages. According to Microsoft, AI speaks English. The report indicates that while English and other high-resource languages are used to train AI, the majority of the world’s 7,000 languages are effectively excluded from AI systems, therefore limiting access for billions of people. According to Microsoft, low-resource languages like Hausa, Bengali, and Chichewa are under-represented in major AI developments, therefore limiting access to users in those regions who cannot interact with tools that cannot understand them. The tech giant opines that unless digital infrastructure and education catch up, “this gap will define who benefits from AI for decades to come” and could cement a new technological divide. Microsoft cites the stark infrastructure gap as problematic In this report, Microsoft indicated that over 1.2 billion people now use AI tools, which the tech giant admitted the adoption rate far outpaced electricity, computers and the internet. However, despite this rapid adoption and spread of the technology, Microsoft maintains that the diffusion is not even. In the report, Microsoft highlights the widening gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots” citing countries with power, data, and skills to use AI, and those that still lack the basics. Countries like UAE, with 59.4% adoption, Singapore at 58.6%, and Norway with 51.9% are leading the world in AI use. According to Microsoft, these countries have vast electricity, near-universal internet access, and while their populations are digitally fluent. Yet in some parts of Sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, fewer than 10% of the populations use AI due to factors like low internet penetration, unreliable power, and limited access to the devices as well as the basic education to needed to use new technologies. In Africa, Microsoft recently highlighted the vast opportunities for AI developments. It however demands coordinated, inclusive effort involving governments, education systems, industry and civil society, according to Microsoft. “The challenge is not only scale, but also coordination. Fragmented efforts and a lack of unified strategy continue to slow momentum and dilute impact,” said Microsoft. “To fully realize AI’s potential for job creation, Africa must build a coordinated, inclusive skilling ecosystem, where government, education, industry, and civil society work together to shape the AI economy,” added Microsoft . The report also highlights the infrastructure gap that exists between countries, which has an impact on AI adoption. In terms of energy, the US leads with 53.7 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity followed by China with 31.9GW, then Germany with 8.5GW, and the United Kingdom with 7.4GW. According to the report the AI diffusion is dependent on electricity and computing capacity as much as on algorithms or data, and that over 700 million people still lack reliable power.

Nasdaq-listed Bitmain, a company increasingly focused on digital asset investments, has just made another substantial Bitmain ETH investment . This latest acquisition signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future, capturing the attention of investors and market watchers alike. What Does Bitmain’s Latest ETH Investment Entail? According to a report by Onchainlens, Bitmain recently acquired an additional 7,660 Ethereum (ETH) tokens. This impressive purchase is valued at approximately $29.54 million, executed through the well-known digital asset financial services firm, Galaxy Digital. This transaction underscores Bitmain’s continued strategy to bolster its holdings in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This substantial Bitmain ETH investment is not an isolated event. It reflects a growing trend among institutional entities to diversify their portfolios with leading digital assets. For Bitmain, which has historically been a dominant force in Bitcoin mining hardware, this consistent accumulation of Ethereum represents a strategic pivot and a clear belief in the platform’s long-term potential. Why is Bitmain Deepening Its Ethereum Commitment? Bitmain’s decision to continuously invest in Ethereum stems from several compelling factors. Ethereum is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is a robust blockchain platform that powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its utility and innovation continue to attract significant developer activity and user adoption. Moreover, Ethereum’s successful transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with ‘The Merge’ has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. This upgrade makes Ethereum an even more attractive asset for long-term holders like Bitmain. The company likely views its Bitmain ETH investment as a way to capitalize on Ethereum’s ongoing evolution and its pivotal role in the future of Web3. Impact of Bitmain’s ETH Investment on the Broader Market When a prominent, Nasdaq-listed firm like Bitmain makes such a significant investment, it sends a powerful signal to the entire crypto market. This move can boost investor confidence, particularly among institutional players who often look for cues from their peers. Such large-scale acquisitions can also contribute to positive price momentum for Ethereum, as demand increases.

The latest update on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that fear continues to grip the cryptocurrency market. This crucial indicator, which provides a snapshot of investor sentiment, recently rose four points to 33. While a slight increase, it still firmly places the market in a state of ‘fear,’ according to data from Alternative.me. Understanding this index is vital for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market. It operates on a simple principle: extreme fear can signal a buying opportunity, while excessive greed often indicates a market correction is imminent. This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly emotional, which can lead to irrational decisions. How exactly does this index arrive at its score? It’s a sophisticated calculation, pulling data from various corners of the crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of its key components: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. Higher volatility often suggests a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): Analyzing current trading volumes and momentum helps determine if there’s strong buying or selling pressure. Social Media Mentions (15%): Tracking keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter can reveal widespread emotional responses. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin market cap dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived ‘safer’ asset. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for crypto-related terms helps identify public interest and potential panic or excitement. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does a Score of 33 Imply? A score of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market is experiencing significant fear. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, many seasoned investors view periods of high fear as potential opportunities. When fear is high, prices often drop, creating a chance to acquire assets at lower valuations. However, it also presents challenges: Potential for Panic Selling: New or inexperienced investors might sell their holdings at a loss due to widespread fear. Increased Volatility: Fearful markets can be unpredictable, with sharp price swings. Uncertainty: The future direction of the market becomes less clear, demanding careful research. Conversely, a score closer to 100, indicating ‘extreme greed,’ often signals that the market might be overheated and due for a correction. Historically, buying during extreme fear and selling during extreme greed has proven to be a successful strategy for some. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Respond to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index points to fear, it’s a signal to act thoughtfully, not impulsively. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Use this time to delve into projects you believe have strong fundamentals. Lower prices can make strong assets more attractive. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consistently invest a fixed amount over time. This strategy helps mitigate risk in volatile markets. Manage Emotions: The index itself is a reminder that emotions drive markets. Avoid making decisions based purely on fear or excitement. Stick to your investment plan. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help weather market downturns. Remember, the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. It provides valuable context, but individual investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. The Enduring Value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in a Dynamic Market In conclusion, the current reading of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index underscores a market still wrestling with apprehension. While this state of fear can be daunting, it also presents a unique opportunity for those who approach it with a well-informed and disciplined strategy. By understanding the components of this index and its historical implications, investors can make more rational decisions, potentially turning market anxiety into long-term gains. It’s a powerful reminder that in the world of crypto, emotional intelligence can be as valuable as market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a low score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicate? A low score, particularly below 25, indicates ‘extreme fear.’ This suggests that investors are highly anxious, often leading to panic selling and lower asset prices. Historically, these periods have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment based on the latest data points from volatility, trading volume, social media, and other factors. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index solely based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market cap dominance is one factor, the index considers broader market sentiment indicators, including social media mentions and Google search trends that often reflect overall cryptocurrency interest, not just Bitcoin specifically. Q4: Can I rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used as one of many tools in your investment analysis. It provides valuable insight into market psychology but should be combined with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your personal financial strategy.

Tokens sit at $0.035 in Phase 6, 80% filled after a 250% climb from $0.01, setting up 400% gains to the $0.06 launch. This setup echoes Solana’s early surge, where utility met timing for massive returns. As the best crypto to buy now, MUTM offers DeFi entry at a fraction of future value, urging quick action before Phase 7’s 20% jump to $0.04. What crypto to buy now? One that mirrors proven winners like SOL, blending accessibility with growth potential that savvy holders have already spotted. Solana’s 2020-2021 Run: A Blueprint for Explosive Gains Solana has had an astonishing growth rate since its inception in 2020. The coin hit a nadir of $0.51 in May but soon rocketed to $260 in November 2021. The growth took a whopping 18 months to achieve a staggering 51,000% return on investment. The lucky few that invested in SOL when it hit rock bottom cashed in on its scalability and made life-changing gains. As the best crypto to buy now fades into yesterday’s news, echoes of SOL’s rise prompt a hunt for the next altcoin ready to replicate such multiples. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has stepped into that spotlight, offering DeFi crypto seekers a comparable launchpad at today’s $0.035. MUTM’s Presale Phases Lock in Early Advantages Mutuum Finance has structured its presale in 11 distinct phases to cap sales at a predefined price as a token of appreciation for contributors. However, Phase 6 is racing past incredibly as 80% has sold out for delivering tokens to buyers worth $0.035. There has been a phenomenal 250% increase in token value from Phase 1’s price of $0.01. The number of holders is 17,600 and has pumped in a total of $18,250,000 to this structure that has proved its allure as the top crypto to invest in to ensure a gradual growth. The DeFi crypto community has joined hand in hand since Phase 6 is close to completion. Community Giveaways Add to Holder Enthusiasm MUTM Finance has really kick-started its presale with a giveaway event where a total of $100,000 reward is given out in a way that $10,000 is won by 10 lucky winners out of its 17,600 holders. The event has really helped to attract more funds to MUTM. As a powerhouse in the world of altcoins, MUTM has made passive investment an active pursuit, where a single entry can yield a windfall over and above your foundation. Quickly realized gains in this area have led investors to understand that better gains come with a deeper level of loyalty. Thus emerges MUTM as the top crypto to buy and hold. Buy-and-Distribute Fuels Token Demand Mutuum Finance has a buy-and-distribute system in place where it directs all fees from its protocol to buy back MUTM tokens on open markets and subsequently distribute to stakers. As a result, this has created a value loop that enhances MUTM tokens. Currently, with a total of $18,250,000 raised for this project, MUTM has emerged as a DeFi crypto specially designed to increase in value. Stakers have watched distributions pad their yields, turning protocol success into personal wins that keep capital locked in. As altcoin cycles heat up, this loop has promised compounding edges, where fees from expanding use recycle into holder benefits. Early movers at $0.035 have positioned for 400% to launch, but this feature elevates long-term holds, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now for effortless upside. Security Audits Forge Unshakable Trust Mutuum Finance has emphasized safety as a well-audited project with a CertiK audit with a safety level of 90/100 for its tokens and a total bug bounty reward of $50,000 that urges security specialists to investigate for vulnerabilities even prior to its launch. The bounty reward amounts are tiered: $200 to $2,000 for critical vulnerabilities has reassured some 17,600 investors of its mutual fund safety. Thus, MUTM is solidified as a worthy choice for risk-averse DeFi cryptocurrency traders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured Solana’s essence at $0.035, where presale smarts and trust mechanisms promise 51,000%-style leaps for the best crypto to buy now. This DeFi crypto has primed portfolios for altcoin dominance, recapping SOL’s blueprint with modern edges.

The sharp sell-off on October 10 not only flushed leveraged positions across the market but also disrupted the uptrend ETH had been building throughout the summer. Since then, price action has weakened, and momentum has shifted toward the downside, raising concerns among analysts that a deeper correction could unfold if buyers fail to defend key demand levels in the days ahead. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite these technical challenges, on-chain and institutional flow data tell a different story beneath the surface. Large-scale investors — including funds, corporate entities, and crypto-native institutions — continue to accumulate ETH during the pullback. The divergence between price weakness and institutional accumulation creates a pivotal setup for Ethereum. If ETH can stabilize and reclaim the $4,000 threshold, it may re-ignite bullish momentum. But failure to hold support could open the door to further downside before a sustainable recovery emerges. Bitmine Adds ETH as Institutional Accumulation Climbs According to data tracked by Lookonchain, institutional player Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation strategy. Purchasing 44,036 ETH — worth approximately $166 million — during the recent market pullback. This purchase lifts Bitmine’s total holdings to roughly 3.16 million ETH, valued at around $12.15 billion, reinforcing the company’s position as one of the largest Ethereum holders globally. Such sizeable buying activity during periods of price weakness highlights a notable divergence between institutional behavior and short-term market sentiment. While retail traders and leveraged participants may be shaken by Ethereum’s inability to reclaim the $4,000 level, long-horizon buyers appear unfazed. For them, price dips represent accumulating opportunities rather than reasons for concern. This duality is becoming increasingly evident across the market: spot inflows, exchange outflows, and whale accumulation metrics all point to growing long-term conviction, even as the chart reflects hesitation and downward pressure. This divergence underscores a familiar pattern in crypto market structure. Price action often lags underlying fundamentals, particularly during transitional phases where macro catalysts and liquidity shifts are still being digested. Ethereum remains structurally supported by rising institutional participation, increasing staking demand, and expanding Layer-2 ecosystems — all of which strengthen its long-term investment thesis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Records Over $300B Spot Volume In October – Investors Shift Away From Leverage Ethereum Tests Key Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $3,847, testing a critical support zone after failing to hold above $4,000 and rejecting from the $4,200 resistance area earlier this week. The daily chart shows ETH breaking below both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling weakening momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market posture. This breakdown places increased pressure on bulls to defend the $3,800 region — a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point over the past two months. If ETH loses this support, the next meaningful demand zone lies near $3,500, followed by the 200-day moving average around $3,200, which would serve as a deeper structural retest within the longer-term uptrend. For now, however, ETH remains above its long-term trend line, meaning the broader bullish structure is intact despite short-term weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens After 8 Years – 1,500 ETH Sent to Kraken After 8 Years On the upside, bulls need to reclaim $4,000 and then $4,150–$4,200 to revive bullish momentum and break the series of lower highs forming since September. Until that happens, price action favors consolidation and caution. With macro shifts underway and institutional accumulation rising, Ethereum’s chart suggests a wait-and-see phase, where holding support becomes crucial before any renewed upside attempt.

His recent statements have drawn sharp attention across the broader crypto community, particularly for their bold claims about XRP’s role in a truly decentralized financial ecosystem. Ripple CTO Highlights XRP Ledger’s Unique Autonomy An X social media account named ‘Stellar Ripple’ has spotlighted a statement from Schwartz, underscoring what he sees as a defining difference between the XRP Ledger and other blockchain networks. Stellar Ripple stated in its post on Thursday that the Ripple CTO dropped a “truth bomb,” cutting deep into the philosophy of decentralization within blockchains. In his post, Schwartz questioned whether users want to be their own bank or empower another intermediary in disguise. According to him, despite the decentralized branding of blockchain networks , they are ultimately designed for control, allowing certain participants to set the rules, impose transaction fees, and maintain leverage over users’ financial autonomy. In contrast, he described the XRP Ledger as a space free from such mediators, government influence , and protocols that could freeze or reverse transactions. This suggests that XRPL represents a purer or more superior interpretation of the decentralization narrative, where every transaction remains unalterable, resistant to censorship, and uncontrolled . Schwartz went on to explain that, unlike most digital assets, XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, exists as the only counterparty-free currency that anyone in the world can access without risk of default or confiscation. He noted that this unique feature helps XRP gain value from the activity generated on the blockchain network . Essentially, this implies that XRP’s price is intertwined with the growth of the ledger itself, providing a foundational layer that ensures liquidity and stability across every transaction. XRPL Expands Into Genomic Data Anchoring As the XRPL ecosystem continues to grow , real-world adoption is gaining momentum. Crypto commentator John Squire recently pointed out an exciting new development from DNA Protocol, a system that anchors DNA to the XRP Ledger. According to the report, DNAOnChain has officially launched operations in Tunisia, extending its reach to broader markets. Notably, this project marks a significant expansion of XRPL’s use cases by anchoring genomic identity data directly on the blockchain. Through DNAOnChain, Squire states that certified laboratories can now securely record and verify genomic data on XRPL, effectively bridging biotechnology with blockchain innovation. The integration is expected to enhance transparency and immutability in medical and genetic research , ensuring that sensitive information is permanently verifiable without compromising privacy. More importantly, this new development signals XRPL’s versatility beyond cross-border payments , highlighting its potential as a data integrity layer for real-world applications. It also demonstrates XRP’s growing adoption in new industries beyond digital assets and finance.","Ripple|David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz|DNA Protocol|DNAOnChain|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 01:00:19

A significant sum of 250 million USDC minted has been reported at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a signal indicating shifts in market demand and liquidity within the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the implications of such a large issuance is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Understanding Why USDC Gets Minted When we hear about new USDC minted , it means new stablecoins have been created. But why does this happen? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It maintains a stable value, making it a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. The minting process is typically demand-driven. Increased Demand: Investors want to convert fiat currency into USDC to participate in DeFi, trade on exchanges, or hold a stable asset. Market Liquidity: More USDC means more liquidity for trading pairs, lending, and borrowing protocols. On-ramping: It serves as a gateway for new capital entering crypto, moving large sums efficiently. Circle, the issuer of USDC, mints new tokens only when there is a corresponding deposit of US dollars into their reserve accounts. This ensures each USDC is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. What Does This USDC Minted Event Signify? The minting of 250 million USDC minted is a substantial event, often pointing to several potential market scenarios. Such a large influx of stablecoins can have various ripple effects.

A significant event recently caught the attention of the crypto community: a massive 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This report, flagged by Whale Alert, signals substantial activity within the stablecoin ecosystem. When such a large amount of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency like USDC is created, it often sparks questions about market demand, liquidity, and the broader implications for digital finance. Let’s explore what this significant minting event truly means for investors and the wider crypto landscape. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Event Signify? The creation of 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is more than just a number; it reflects dynamic forces at play in the cryptocurrency market. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is backed by fully reserved assets, primarily cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. When new USDC is minted, it typically indicates a rising demand for dollar-denominated digital assets. This demand can stem from various sources: Increased Investor Inflow: New capital entering the crypto market, often converted into stablecoins before being deployed into other cryptocurrencies. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: More users participating in DeFi protocols, requiring stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions or corporations using stablecoins for settlement, remittances, or as a treasury asset. Essentially, this minting suggests that more people or entities want to hold or use digital dollars within the blockchain ecosystem. It’s a clear indicator of growing confidence and utility for stablecoins. The Mechanics Behind a USDC Mint How exactly does USDC minted come into existence? The process is straightforward and regulated. Circle, the issuer of USDC, works with regulated financial institutions. When an authorized participant wants to acquire USDC, they deposit an equivalent amount of US dollars into a Circle-managed bank account. Once the funds are verified, Circle instructs the smart contract to mint the corresponding amount of new USDC. These newly created tokens are then delivered to the participant’s crypto wallet. This mechanism ensures that every USDC token in circulation is backed by an actual dollar or dollar-equivalent asset held in reserve, providing its stability. This transparent, auditable process is crucial for maintaining trust in USDC as a reliable stablecoin. Regular attestations by independent accounting firms further verify these reserves. Implications for the Crypto Market and Beyond A significant amount of USDC minted can have several ripple effects across the crypto market: Enhanced Liquidity: More USDC in circulation means greater liquidity, making it easier and more efficient to trade between different cryptocurrencies. This can reduce slippage and improve overall market efficiency. Fueling DeFi Growth: Stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi. Additional USDC can be deployed into various DeFi protocols, increasing total value locked (TVL) and potentially boosting yields for participants. Gateway for Traditional Finance: For institutions looking to enter the crypto space, stablecoins like USDC offer a less volatile entry point compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Large mints can signal increasing institutional interest and readiness to engage with digital assets. Global Remittances and Payments: USDC facilitates faster and cheaper international transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Increased supply can support greater adoption in these use cases. While the immediate impact might be a boost in market liquidity, the long-term implications point towards a maturing and expanding digital economy where stablecoins play a central role. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: What Users Should Know Understanding the dynamics of USDC minted and its role is important for any crypto participant. Here are some key takeaways: Stability: USDC offers a haven from crypto market volatility, making it suitable for storing value or executing trades without exposure to price swings. Utility: It’s widely accepted across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it a versatile asset for various financial activities. Transparency: Circle’s commitment to regular audits and public attestations provides a level of transparency regarding its reserves, which is vital for trust. However, it is also important to consider the centralized nature of USDC. While this offers stability and regulatory compliance, it also means reliance on a central issuer. Users should always be aware of the underlying mechanisms and potential regulatory shifts that could impact stablecoins. The recent minting of 250 million USDC underscores the growing demand for stable, reliable digital assets in the evolving financial landscape. This event highlights increased market activity, whether from individual investors or institutional players, seeking the benefits of blockchain technology without the inherent volatility of other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to expand, stablecoins like USDC will undoubtedly remain a crucial component, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of decentralized applications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC, or USD Coin, is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. It is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability makes it a popular choice for traders and investors looking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why is USDC minted? A2: USDC is minted in response to demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire USDC, they deposit US dollars with Circle, the issuer. For every dollar deposited and verified, a new USDC is created, or “minted,” ensuring that each USDC in circulation is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. Q3: Who issues USDC? A3: USDC is issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company. Circle collaborates with various financial institutions to manage the reserves that back USDC and ensure its operational integrity and compliance. Q4: How does a large USDC mint affect the crypto market? A4: A large amount of USDC minted often indicates increased demand for stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. This can lead to enhanced market liquidity, making it easier for traders to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies. It can also signal new capital entering the market or increased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Q5: Is USDC safe to use? A5: USDC is generally considered one of the safer stablecoins due to its regulatory compliance, transparent reserve attestations, and backing by high-quality assets. However, like all financial instruments, it carries some risks, including potential regulatory changes or reliance on the central issuer, Circle. Users should always conduct their own research.

Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss Hit Just 1.3% Recently In a new post on X, senior researcher at on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, CryptoVizArt, has talked about how Bitcoin currently compares to past bearish periods in terms of Relative Unrealized Loss . The Unrealized Loss is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss (in USD) that BTC investors as a whole are carrying in their wallets. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the blockchain to find what price it was last moved at. If this previous transaction price was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token could be assumed to be sitting on some net unrealized loss right now. The exact amount of loss that the coin carries is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Unrealized Loss sums up this value for all loss tokens on the blockchain. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the indicator is of interest, called the Relative Unrealized Loss. This metric calculates the holder loss as a percentage of BTC’s market cap . The advantage of the Relative Unrealized Loss over the usual metric is that it makes a comparison across two different BTC cycles more reliable. Bitcoin has seen significant growth in stored capital with each cycle, so the absolute amount of loss held by investors in bear markets also rises with each cycle. By accounting for the market cap, the indicator normalizes the Unrealized Loss across cycles. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss has remained at low levels during the past few months, indicating that loss among holders has stayed low in comparison to the market cap. Even during the cryptocurrency’s latest drop, the indicator only reached a value of 1.3%, corresponding to investor loss being just 1.3% of the market cap. “In mild bear markets, this typically exceeds 5%, and in severe ones, it exceeds 50%,” explained the Glassnode researcher. “The market pain is still far from what defines a true bear phase.” It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin will develop in the coming days, and whether the Relative Unrealized Loss will cross one of the bear market thresholds. BTC Price Bitcoin fell below $107,000 during its recent decline, but the coin has since seen a small rebound back to $109,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bear Market|Bitcoin Pain|Bitcoin unrealized loss|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 02:00:58

Dogecoin Whales Shed 440 Million Tokens Over Last 72 Hours As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, whales have reduced their Dogecoin supply over the past few days. The indicator cited by the analyst is the “Supply Distribution” from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of DOGE that investors belonging to a given coin range are holding as a whole. In the context of the current topic, “whales” are the traders of interest. Their wallet range is typically defined as 10 million to 100 million tokens. At the current DOGE exchange rate, the lower end converts to $1.8 million and the upper end to $18 million. Given the scale, only big-money holders would be able to qualify for the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Hold Key Support: Could $88,000 Be Next? Such investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so movements related to them can be worth watching. Their behavior doesn’t always impact the memecoin’s price, but it can still be revealing about the sentiment among this key cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution of the whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales have seen a sharp decline in their supply recently, indicating that these humongous holders have been distributing. In total, the group has shed 440 million DOGE (worth $81.4 million) from its collective holdings during the last 72 hours. Alongside this trend, the DOGE price has slid down, implying that the whale selloff may have had a role to play. The Supply Distribution of this cohort could now be monitored, as where it goes next could potentially contain hints about what’s coming for the cryptocurrency’s price. Earlier in the week, Martinez shared another chart related to Dogecoin, this one showing a technical analysis (TA) pattern that DOGE has been trading inside on the 12-hour timeframe. From the graph, it’s visible that the pattern in question is an Ascending Channel, a type of consolidation channel that appears whenever an asset trades between two parallel trendlines sloped upward. The support line of the channel is located at $0.18. In the post, the analyst noted that holding this level could be key for DOGE. Following the whale selling, the coin is now retesting the level, with a brief fall below it even happening on Thursday, before the memecoin recovered back above it on Friday.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published Friday, Scott said both governments had reached a kind of balance before China decided to “fire shots” by threatening to cut off exports of critical minerals. That, he warned, crossed a line. He said China will not be able to keep using rare earths as a tool of pressure, especially now that it showed its hand. Scott pointed out that the United States sees the move as a major miscalculation.By showing its willingness to use rare earths to hit back, China exposed itself. Washington is already pushing for alternatives, and this new escalation has only sped things up. Scott said the U.S. and its partners no longer have the luxury of assuming those minerals will be freely available. Scott, the soybean farmer, says he’s felt the pain too Scott also took a moment to talk about the other front in this trade fight: soybeans. During an interview with Martha Raddatz on ABC News, Scott said, “I’m actually a soybean farmer… I have felt this pain, too.” China’s been effectively blocking U.S. soybeans for months, and Scott happens to be one of the people impacted. Sort of. He owns farmland in North Dakota where soybeans and corn are grown. His holdings are worth somewhere between $5 million and $25 million, and they generate between $100,000 and $1 million a year, based on his financial disclosure. But let’s not pretend Scott’s depending on those crops. Forbes says his net worth is about $600 million. So when China, once America’s biggest buyer, slapped heavy tariffs on soybeans in May, after President Donald Trump imposed duties on Chinese imports, the pain wasn’t evenly spread. Since the tariffs, China hasn’t bought any American soybeans at all. Regular farmers, the ones who depend on crop sales, are the ones really feeling it. Scott said the embargo is hurting, but the truth is, he can take the hit better than most. Still, the fact that the Treasury Secretary is directly affected by a trade standoff with China adds a strange twist. TikTok deal moves forward after Trump order On top of the rare earths and soybeans, Scott said the TikTok deal is finally getting off the ground. During an interview with Fox Business, he confirmed that in Kuala Lumpur, both sides finalized the agreement and are waiting for it to move ahead. “I would expect that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we’ll finally see a resolution to that,” he said. The fight over TikTok has dragged on for more than a year and a half. In 2024, Congress passed a law ordering TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell off the app’s U.S. assets by January 2025. Trump followed that up with an executive order on September 25, saying the sale plan meets the law’s national security conditions. The clock’s ticking. Buyers have 120 days to seal the deal, and Trump pushed the final deadline to January 20, 2026. Under the new plan, ByteDance will only hold less than 20% of TikTok U.S. and get just one seat out of seven on the new board. The other six will be Americans. The app’s algorithm, used by 170 million Americans, will be retrained and monitored by U.S. cybersecurity partners, with full control shifting to the new joint venture. Even so, John Moolenaar, the Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, is still not sold. He said the licensing agreement for the algorithm, which is part of the deal, “would raise serious concerns.” China’s Commerce Ministry, on its end, said it plans to “properly handle” the matter and will work with the U.S. to sort out remaining issues.

The discussions are still under due diligence though, so nothing is finalized. The deal may close later this year or early next year, but terms could still change and the entire plan could fall apart. This has not been announced publicly, and those speaking on the matter apparently requested anonymity. Coinbase Ventures, the venture capital arm of Coinbase, is already an existing investor in BVNK. Representatives for BVNK did not respond to inquiries. The largest US crypto exchange said: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation. Driven by our mission to expand economic freedom globally, we actively explore various opportunities — whether through building, acquiring, partnering, or investing — to advance our mission.” The tone is neutral, but the move fits with Coinbase’s push to expand outside pure trading revenue. Coinbase pushes deeper into stablecoins and payments Reports earlier this week said Coinbase has exclusivity in the takeover talks.That means no other bidders are actively in the running now.The talks followed a full bidding process. The timing lines up with increased activity in the stablecoin market after the first U.S. regulation for stablecoins passed in July. Since then, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, along with major banks, have been testing blockchain‑based tools for faster and cheaper payments. Almost 20% of Coinbase’s Q3 revenue came from stablecoins, according to the company’s shareholder letter released Thursday. The exchange has been pushing to drive more usage of USDC, the stablecoin it earns revenue from in partnership with Circle. One example: a payments integration with Shopify. On a call after earnings, Coinbase executives said they are actively searching for acquisitions in the payments sector, confirming that this direction is a core expansion plan. BVNK runs a platform that lets merchants accept payments, including in stablecoins. This is where the deal matters. Earlier this year, Coinbase launched Coinbase Business, a service for payments, invoicing, and financial operations. BVNK’s system could be plugged into that to create a stablecoin‑based banking and payments experience for companies that do not want to depend on traditional banking rails. BVNK was founded in 2021 and has raised $90 million in funding. Its investors include Citi Ventures, Haun Ventures, and Visa. If the deal closes, Coinbase would take another step away from depending on trading volumes. If it fails, nothing changes except that we all now know exactly what direction Coinbase is steering toward; payments built on stablecoins. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Bitcoin dropped below $109,000, highlighting the fragility of investor confidence. High leverage positions fueled the cascade, erasing gains made over the past week. While traders panic and market sentiment swings between extreme fear and false optimism, one project seems untouched: Noomez ($NNZ) . Its off-exchange presale structure protects investors from price swings, proving that not every market dip means danger. Why Did Crypto Crash? A mix of overleveraged longs and uncertainty around macroeconomic indicators triggered this correction. When Bitcoin’s chart broke below key support levels, automated liquidations accelerated across the market. The entire ecosystem followed as altcoins tumbled, and liquidity evaporated. Noomez , however, operates on its own timeline. It isn’t tied to centralized exchange volatility or speculative whale movements. Each presale stage runs independently, giving early backers clear visibility on price, supply, and distribution. Why Did Crypto Crash Today? Short-term data shows that the recent drop came after another spike in Bitcoin open interest, followed by a sudden flush-out. On platforms like CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s 24-hour volume jumped, reflecting panic selling more than organic trading. Meanwhile, Noomez continues its presale momentum. The live tracker shows over $4,500 raised and 39 holders in its first stage, a sign of steady early participation even as the broader market contracts. Such a quiet confidence underscores how structured presales, like Noomez, are designed to withstand volatility. Will Crypto Crash Again? What Comes Next Market corrections are a natural part of every bull cycle. The key isn’t predicting the next fall but positioning before the recovery. Historically, markets that shed excess leverage early tend to rebound stronger once liquidity returns. That’s why seasoned investors are allocating small, calculated portions of their portfolios into early-stage tokens like Noomez ($NNZ) . It’s a strategy based on timing and entering while others hesitate, before prices begin their inevitable climb. The Noomez Presale: Structure Amid Chaos Unlike hype-driven tokens, Noomez built a system that rewards patience and transparency. The Noomez presale accepts multiple blockchains: ETH, BTC, BSC, SOL, and BASE, making it accessible to a wider audience. Every transaction updates in real-time, with total raised and holder counts publicly displayed. At its current token price of $0.00001 , early participants are securing positions before the next price bump. Each phase has a fixed supply, and unsold tokens are burned at end‑of‑stage, adding a deflationary element. With 28 stages in total, each structured phase ensures sustainable growth instead of artificial spikes. A Safer Haven for Uncertain Times While centralized exchanges flash red and sentiment collapses after the Crypto Crash , Noomez keeps building. Its deflationary tokenomics, locked liquidity, and real-time data feed create a transparent foundation that traditional projects lack. Investors are committing to a long-term system built for steady growth rather than short-term speculation. Countless projects rise and fall through cycles, but few manage to stay grounded when volatility peaks. Noomez ($NNZ) feels like one of those rare cases where preparation meets opportunity. Pro Tip: Watch how fast the early presale stages fill. In volatile markets, consistent progress is often the clearest signal of investor trust.

53887192,618046,1761966014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53887192.jpeg,Bitcoin Flatlines As LTH Distribution Hits 810K Coins: Demand Still Absorbing Supply,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-flatlines-lth-distribution-hits-810k-demand/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim the $110,000 level after a sharp downside move pressured markets and triggered renewed volatility across the crypto landscape. While this pullback has been uncomfortable for short-term traders, it remains modest compared to the October 10 liquidation crash, which forced out excessive leverage and marked one of the most aggressive sell-offs of the year. Despite the short-term turbulence, Bitcoin remains within its broader consolidation range — but the market now enters a critical phase where direction must soon resolve. Over the coming weeks, macro developments, liquidity flows, and investor positioning will likely determine whether the next impulse is upward or downward. Fresh CryptoQuant data shows that since July 1, long-term holders (LTHs) have been steadily distributing coins, selling into strength as BTC approached and later tested all-time highs. This supply overhang has contributed to muted upside momentum, even as demand has proven strong enough to absorb much of the selling. Bitcoin Market Still Absorbs Supply According to analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin continues to navigate a complex supply-demand environment defined by steady profit-taking from long-term holders (LTHs). Since July 1, LTHs have distributed roughly 810,000 BTC, reducing their total holdings from 15.5 million to 14.6 million BTC. This represents one of the most significant distribution phases in the current cycle — a clear indication that seasoned holders have been locking in profits after years of accumulation and strategic positioning. What makes this dynamic particularly striking is that Bitcoin has printed new all-time highs twice during this distribution phase, demonstrating that market demand has remained robust enough to absorb the substantial supply being offloaded. Historically, similar phases of distribution from long-term holders often accompany major cycle inflection points, as capital shifts from early investors to new participants entering the market. Adler emphasizes that while this absorption reflects market strength, it also sets a ceiling on aggressive upside momentum. As long as long-term holders continue to realize profits, the path higher is likely to remain gradual and choppy rather than explosively parabolic. Strong demand is supporting prices and preventing deeper corrections — but supply pressure is simultaneously preventing sustained breakout acceleration. The takeaway is clear: Bitcoin is not lacking demand; it is working through supply once long-term distribution slows — whether due to exhaustion or macro reinforcement — upside potential could expand meaningfully. Until then, price action may continue to grind sideways with upside attempts meeting resistance as supply transitions to new owners. Bitcoin Holds Above Key MA Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $109,900, attempting to stabilize after a recent downside move pushed price back toward the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that currently sits near $108,000. This region has become an important defense line for bulls, structuring the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s consolidation range. Each time BTC has approached this zone over the past month, buyers have stepped in, signaling continued demand despite short-term weakness. However, reclaiming momentum remains a challenge. BTC continues to struggle below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, which have converged overhead and now act as layered resistance between $112,000 and $114,000. A sustained break above this cluster is required to re-establish bullish momentum and set up another attempt toward the $117,500 resistance — the cycle’s key Point of Control and the level that has repeatedly capped upside moves since summer. If Bitcoin loses the $108,000 support, a deeper correction toward $105,000–$103,000 becomes likely, where liquidity and previous reaction levels sit. For now, the technical picture remains neutral-to-cautious: bulls are holding essential support, but the burden remains on buyers to reclaim lost moving averages and flip market structure back in their favor.

SBET's ETH holdings generate yield through staking and more advanced DeFi strategies, enhancing returns beyond basic asset appreciation. Management is actively buying back shares and exploring DeFi opportunities, signaling confidence and strategic capital allocation to support shareholder value. Upgrading SBET from 'sell' to 'buy' due to its discounted valuation, productive ETH strategy, and potential for outperformance even if ETH trades sideways. Dare I say it, but the DAT craze of 2025 appears to have come back to reality. Maybe more than necessary, to be honest. When I initiated coverage of SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) back in July, I called the stock a 'sell' based essentially entirely on the idea that buying SBET at 4x the value of the company's Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) holdings was a silly idea. This has turned out to be another good call : Data by YCharts With Ethereum up over 9% since my July SBET piece, if you picked SBET over ETH thinking one of these DATs was going to get the Strategy ( MSTR ) treatment from the market forever, it hasn't worked out for you. SBET shares have given back over 50% since that July 18th article. Which by itself is notable because even at that time the stock was already well off its high prices from May - which at one point went well over $100 per share. Valuation To Holdings Today we find a drastically different setup. One where, rather than trading at several multiples over its ETH assets, shares of SBET are currently trading at a fairly large discount to the ETH that the company holds. As of intraday October 31st, SBET shares are trading at a significant discount to mNAV. The company holds roughly 860k ETH, which gives SharpLink an ETH net asset valuation of $3.6 billion. This is well ahead of the $2.9 billion market capitalization of the company's shares. ETH Holdings & NAV (SharpLink) At an average paid price of $3,609 per ETH, the company has about a $240 million unrealized ETH gain and has generated over 6.1k ETH in staking rewards. The key difference between Ethereum or even Solana ( SOL-USD ), based DATs compared to the presumably more familiar Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) DATs is that ETH and SOL can be productive assets beyond transaction payment tokens. For instance, ETH can be staked natively on chain or through a staking service to generate passive yields and help boost the security of the networks where they reside. This is a perfectly fine way to utilize PoS digital assets, but it doesn't necessarily make a DAT a better investment than a simple spot ETF that allows for staking . The latter of which is theoretically much safer and eliminates operational or dilution risk. But because of things like re-staking and DeFi lending, there are more complex ways to generate greater returns than basic staking yields, and SharpLink appears poised to do exactly that. Capital Allocation Strategy Back in early September , SharpLink began buying back shares and cited undervaluation as the primary reason for doing so. At that time, the company had bought back 939k shares at a price just under $16 per. At an intraday price on October 31st under $14 as of writing, these purchases don't look that great in hindsight. Yet, the ability to buy back its own stock when shares are at depressed levels on an mNAV basis are what separate ETH DATs from BTC DATs. If/ when MSTR begins to trade under an mNAV of 1 again , Strategy will have to either simply allow it, raise capital through debt or preferreds to buy back common, or sell Bitcoin to protect its equity valuation. Since the ETH that SharpLink has purchased is generating yield with very little overhead, management arguably has far better optionality in defending its share price than most BTC-based DATs do. SharpLink can realistically put a floor on its mNAV should it choose to do so. Since the company has reiterated that it won't tap the ATM to buy more ETH when SBET trades at an mNAV discount, dilution concerns should be fairly mitigated at current levels. More recently, SharpLink has expressed a willingness to go further out on the DeFi risk curve through ether.fi and EigenCloud . Through either.fi, SharpLink is essentially staking ETH for the passive network yield while also taking a more liquid derivative token of that ETH that can be utilized for lending or re-staking. Doing so adds a small amount of additional risk to the ETH holdings but it does allow the company to generate a small premium on the yield that it would generate from simply staking the ETH passively and leaving it locked. Rather than 3%, SharpLink could be looking at closer to 5% in a conservative re-staking strategy. At $200 million deployed capital, this is not a large amount of SharpLink's ETH hoard, as it's actually less than the company's unrealized gain from its ETH position. But it does allow management to show a competency in DeFi prowess and prove out the concept for shareholders before engaging with these types of networks to a larger degree. Closing Takeaways I actually kind of like SBET at this price. Even though I think Ethereum is arguably overpriced at 1,100x fees , the degree to which SharpLink can monetize that ETH beyond basic staking strategies is interesting. To be sure, more complex yield strategies introduce an additional element of risk to the company's operations. But I think those risks are necessary to make the company something worth investing in. Truthfully, it may no longer be fair of me to refer to SharpLink simply as an ""Ethereum Wrapper."" The fact of the matter is the company is starting to put its assets to work in a way that should benefit shareholder returns even in the event Ethereum somehow trades sideways for a considerable amount of time. I don't think sideways action is the most likely scenario for a variety of reasons. But if we're speculating on the prospects of new financial rails gaining wider adoption in global settlement, I believe Ethereum is a good network to wager on. And the companies that already hold substantial ETH and put that ETH to work could find themselves well positioned for the future. That we can now buy productive ETH at a discount to liquidation value is compelling. I'm upgrading SBET from 'sell' straight to 'buy.'",ETH-USD|MSTR|SBET,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-01 03:14:28

Every market cycle has a project that starts small and ends up dominating portfolios. The trick is catching it before everyone else does. Traders are chasing the next 100x crypto presale like it’s the last golden ticket. Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) remain strong contenders with solid fundamentals and growing ecosystems, but only one project is currently in presale and generating real excitement: MoonBull ($MOBU). With a mix of meme appeal, utility, and solid mechanics, it’s quickly becoming the community’s favorite underdog story. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Star of the Next 100x Crypto Presale MoonBull ($MOBU) is shaking up the crypto scene with a presale that’s both transparent and high-energy. Built on Ethereum, it’s a community-driven meme token with real mechanics like auto-liquidity, reflection rewards, and steady token burns that support long-term value. Its 23-stage presale model allows early believers to secure better prices with each round, making it one of the few tokens structured to actually deliver on the next 100x crypto presale potential. MoonBull’s fundamentals set it apart from typical meme coins. It’s fully audited, liquidity is locked, and community voting begins at Stage 12, allowing holders to vote on critical actions like surprise burns or marketing campaigns. These features show that MoonBull values trust and transparency from day one. MoonBull Presale Snapshot MoonBull’s presale is currently in its 5th stage at a price of $0.00006584, with over $500,000 raised and more than 1,700 holders. The projected ROI at listing ($0.00616) stands at an impressive 9,256%, while early buyers are already up by 163.36%. The next stage will raise the price by another 27.40%, adding even more urgency for new investors to secure their spot early. A $20,000 investment today would buy about 303,766,707.17 $MOBU tokens, which could be worth $1.87 million at listing. Cardano (ADA): Building Strength Through Upgrades Cardano (ADA) remains a leader in blockchain innovation. Its latest Hydra upgrade aims to boost scalability and make ADA transactions faster and cheaper. Recent analysis places ADA near a resistance of $0.88, with potential to rally toward $1.20 if buying momentum increases. The project’s focus on peer-reviewed development and real-world integration continues to earn it institutional respect. However, Cardano isn’t a presale project. It’s already a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem focused on maturity and adoption, not early-stage explosive growth. While whales have recently sold over 100 million ADA, analysts see this as market rotation rather than weakness. ADA’s consistent updates, governance improvements, and focus on interoperability position it as a long-term hold. Polkadot (DOT): The Interoperability Powerhouse Polkadot (DOT) remains a top-tier network focused on connecting multiple blockchains. It recently announced a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano to expand enterprise adoption across Europe, and DOT’s inclusion in several ETF proposals shows growing institutional interest. The network also decided to cap its supply at 2.1 billion tokens, ending its inflation model and improving long-term token value. DOT’s technical outlook remains bullish, with analysts expecting a price range between $3.25 and $4.50 after a strong consolidation phase. These developments make Polkadot a reliable long-term investment, particularly for those who believe in multi-chain infrastructure. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, MoonBull ($MOBU) leads the pack as the next 100x crypto presale in 2025 . Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) remain strong and respected blockchains focused on scaling, governance, and institutional growth, but their days of exponential gains are behind them. MoonBull, on the other hand, offers early access, massive staking rewards, referral bonuses, and community control, all wrapped in a presale model that rewards early believers. The MoonBull presale is live right now, with new stages filling quickly and prices rising with each round. Every missed stage means paying more later. For those serious about spotting the next big mover before it lists, this could be the one. Early entry could turn modest investments into life-changing profits.

53887991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=847228,1761967810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53887991.jpeg,Analyst Predicts The ‘Unthinkable’ For XRP – Here’s What It Is,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/the-unthinkable-for-xrp/,"Crypto analyst @BullrunnersHQ on X social media has issued a new market update, suggesting that XRP may be on the verge of a major rally as traditional markets reach record highs. His latest technical breakdown links the recent strength in the NASDAQ to potential moves within the crypto sector, warning that the “unthinkable” is about to occur for XRP soon. The analyst highlighted that XRP’s price structure and broader crypto signals are aligning for a decisive move that could determine whether the current bull market cycle continues or starts to reverse. XRP Set For Unthinkable Upside Rally According to @BullrunnersHQ, the equity market is approaching critical levels that could dictate the next major trend in the crypto market and XRP price. Despite the crypto market struggling to reach similar highs, XRP remains firmly above the $2.50 range. He described this setup as “the unthinkable” moment for XRP, where the asset could finally break free from its prolonged consolidation and rally by “multiple hundreds of percent.” Related Reading: Forget Cardano, Why Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Is The Real Ghost Chain Notably, @BullrunnersHQ asserts that XRP’s price structure remains technically healthy despite market volatility. The analyst also noted that the overall crypto market cap and sentiment indicators have improved, with the Fear & Greed Index climbing to 42 from mid-October lows. He further emphasized that Bitcoin continues to hold comfortably above its 50-week EMA, showing a pattern consistent with previous rallies that led to new peaks. The analyst added that BTC’s new local high around $116,000 and a bullish crossover between the 10 EMA and 20 EMA suggest that momentum is returning to risk assets, setting the stage for XRP to outperform potentially. Notably, this period mirrors earlier market cycles where Bitcoin’s consolidation above key levels triggered explosive altcoin rallies. XRP, which has held its support much longer than most cryptocurrencies in the market, could climb to a new all-time high once momentum shifts. To support his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ has referenced crypto market expert and Chartist Peter Brandt’s discussion about whether the NASDAQ’s recent price action represents a breakaway or an exhaustion gap. While Brandt leans cautiously bearish from an equities standpoint, @BullerunnersHQ remains confident that even if stocks slightly pull back or halt temporarily, money could still rotate into cryptocurrencies, potentially fueling XRP’s next major rally. Analyst Warns Of Exhaustion Gap And End Of Bull Market In his analysis, @BullrunnersHQ also referenced crypto trader Abdullah, who believes that the NASDAQ’s rally also shows signs of an exhaustion gap, a signal often seen near the end of a bull market uptrend. Absullah points to overbought readings in both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic RSI on the weekly timeframe, indicating that the markets could be nearing the end of their current bull market phase. Related Reading: What The XRP RSI Making Higher Highs Means For The Price @BullrunnersHQ agreed that the market may be nearing exhaustion but reiterated that XRP’s position offers more upside potential compared to other assets. He also emphasized that Bitcoin must continue to hold between $107,000 and $109,000 on the weekly timeframe. A failure to do so could signal the end of the broader bull market.

With staking rewards, referral perks, and viral fun, it’s easy to see why it’s being considered one of the top altcoins to invest in 2025, turning tiny bites into jackpot-sized opportunities. Meanwhile, not all crypto bites come in mosquito size. Some are more like elephants sneaking into your wallet, or the slow drip of coffee funding your Netflix binge. Chainlink (LINK) quietly powers smart contracts, connecting real-world data to blockchain, while Monero (XMR) moves like a ninja, keeping transactions private and stealthy. Together, these coins illustrate that the crypto world balances viral mischief with strategy and stability, showing why investors exploring the top altcoins to invest in 2025 might include $CULEX alongside established coins. La Culex ($CULEX): The Swarm of Tiny Tokens with Giant Dreams La Culex is not your typical meme coin. Dubbed the “mosquito” of the crypto world, it combines playful branding with real mechanics: referrals to grow the swarm, high-yield staking to reward holders, and systematic token burns to create scarcity. According to the La Culex whitepaper, these mechanisms aim to keep the ecosystem buzzing and sustainable. Current stats as of October 29, 2025, show that La Culex is in Stage 3, called the Bug Spray Dip. The La Culex presale tally has already raised over $8,000, with 431 million tokens sold. A $5,000 investment nets approximately 219,876,869 tokens, and if the listing price hits $0.007, that could theoretically balloon to $1,539,138.08, a mind-boggling ROI of roughly 30,683% from Stage 3 to listing. Investors should note the risks: meme coins are volatile, presale tokens may not list immediately, and liquidity might be limited. Smart contract audits and tokenomics transparency are crucial. A well-informed investor treats La Culex like a mosquito, strike smart, avoid getting swatted by hype. Circulating supply is low relative to potential demand, which can fuel scarcity. Upcoming price surges (8.091% from $0.00002274 to $0.00002458) signal short-term momentum, but speculative swings remain high. Referral and staking incentives encourage long-term holding, while token burns create deflationary pressure. The combination of virality and financial mechanics makes La Culex a prime candidate for those exploring high-risk, high-reward top altcoins to invest in 2025. Meme culture adds another layer of engagement. Viral mosquito memes, like “tiny but mighty” or “bite today, profit tomorrow,” have helped the project gain social traction, showing the power of branding alongside tokenomics. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Powerhouse Unlike La Culex, Chainlink is a mature, utility-driven altcoin. LINK functions as a decentralized oracle network, bridging smart contracts with real-world data. As of today, Chainlink trades at $16.99 with a market cap of $11.84 billion. Its daily trading volume of $1.23 billion represents approximately 10.4% of its market cap, reflecting robust liquidity. LINK ranks #12 on CoinMarketCap, with 86% bullish sentiment among almost 875,000 community votes, signaling confidence from long-term holders. Key indicators for Chainlink investors include its circulating supply of 696.85 million LINK coins, high daily liquidity, and a well-established community. Analysts often watch LINK’s adoption in smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, which drives real utility and supports long-term price stability. Chainlink’s contrast to La Culex highlights the spectrum of altcoin risk: LINK offers slower, steadier growth with lower volatility, whereas La Culex promises rapid, speculative upside. Together, they illustrate why diversifying across meme coins and utility-driven altcoins can be a smart strategy for identifying top altcoins to invest in 2025. Monero (XMR): Privacy Meets Blockchain Monero is the veteran privacy-focused altcoin. XMR trades at $324.34, with a market capitalization of roughly $5.98 billion and a daily volume of $176.52 million (≈2.95% of market cap). XMR’s unlimited maximum supply does not dampen its appeal, as demand is driven by anonymity, security, and fungibility. Community sentiment shows 74% bullish vs. 26% bearish, indicating steady investor confidence in privacy-centric assets. Key indicators for Monero include its privacy protocol upgrades, circulating supply of 18.45 million XMR, and consistent adoption in privacy-conscious transactions. Analysts highlight XMR’s long-term sustainability, as regulatory scrutiny and censorship resistance become more important in the crypto space. For financial students and analysts, Monero exemplifies a lower-risk, utility-driven altcoin to complement high-risk meme tokens like La Culex. Combining privacy-focused coins with viral meme coins and mainstream utilities can provide a well-rounded portfolio for 2025. Final Thoughts: Let the Swarm Guide Your Crypto Journey Investing in the top altcoins to invest in 2025 is a mix of strategy, fun, and a little bit of daring. La Culex ($CULEX) shows how tiny, playful ideas can swarm into massive opportunities when paired with smart tokenomics, staking, and referral incentives. Chainlink offers a steady hand, bridging blockchain with real-world utility, while Monero adds the security and privacy every serious portfolio needs. Just like a mosquito can turn a peaceful night into a memorable nuisance, these coins prove that small moves, done wisely, can lead to big financial buzz. Diversifying across high-risk meme coins and utility-driven altcoins lets investors enjoy both the thrill of viral gains and the comfort of stability. Remember, the goal isn’t to chase every bite, but to identify which swarms can actually grow your nest egg while keeping the journey fun, engaging, and informed.

The thread includes screenshots, DMs, and direct allegations, none of which have not been independently verified, either by law enforcement, a recognized regulatory body, or Cryptopolitan. According to Mystral, many crypto projects including CateCoin were charged over $60,000 in listing fees, only to be asked for additional payments prior to listing. When they refused, tokens were never launched on the platform. A screenshot of an email from an MEXC listing manager shows alleged communication with CateCoin offering “marketing exposure” and urging for a quick reply. But the most serious accusation from Mystral was that MEXC froze over $10 million in user withdrawals, then closed support tickets without explanations. Source: Mystral/X One post from user @Tradecelb says he lost $18,500 USDT. Another, from @nitwitkook, claims MEXC froze $14,000 and only offered $3,000 back after public backlash, and still hasn’t paid. A third user on Reddit wrote that $30,000 in USDT and ETH were allegedly drained via internal MEXC wallets, with no 2FA and no support response. Claims of retaliation, manipulation, and fake engagement flood Mystral thread Mystral also accuses MEXC of trading against its own users, specifically opening short positions right before orchestrated liquidation spikes on low-cap tokens. Many X accounts backed this, alleging MEXC manipulates spot and futures markets, even shorting tokens it lists, and then blocking withdrawals once profits hit. User @van00sa posted that MEXC had been dumping tokens while shorting them at the same time, and then freezing funds to cover losses. Posts from CryptoVikings, MDXCrypto, and @OxNnachet accuse the exchange of silently profiting off user trades and blocking access when traders become too successful. One viral post from Mystral’s screenshots claims, “If you lose money, they keep it. If you win big, they lock your funds and accuse you of fraud.” Mystral also included screenshots alleging MEXC uses bot services to inflate likes, comments, and followers. According to Mystral, 40–50% of MEXC’s engagement across platforms is fake, citing analytics tied to social media botting panels. Mystral also shared a WhatsApp thread where a whistleblower supposedly claimed that MEXC exec Cecilia Hsueh’s X account was hacked, and that the hacker found “weird orgy vids” on her phone, allegedly involving many other MEXC senior execs. Source: Mystral/X A video referencing that material was included in the thread , with the X user claiming that the woman in the video was Cecilia, though Cryptopolitan could not confirm that, and some in the comments are saying the video was posted by a porn page on X over a year ago. Other big accounts, including @zachxbt, have since been demanding more transparency from MEXC, especially around the alleged “shadow owner” named Tony, who, according to Zach, remains hidden behind layers of offshore entities. Zach publicly asked, “Why does MEXC hide its beneficial owner from the public?” MEXC executive responds to some of Mystral’s accusations, admits internal failures Roughly one hour after the thread gained traction, Cecilia posted on X: “We f**ked up. We apologize to @TheWhiteWhaleV2, and his money is already released.” She also admitted that:- “I messed up in communicating with him. I got emotional, and I shouldn’t have. Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up.” Cecilia also acknowledged that the company’s risk, operations, and PR systems haven’t scaled with growth and promised change was coming. She didn’t address any sexual misconduct allegations, the leaked images, or the claims about botting or internal wallet theft. However, in a separate post shortly after, she claimed that:- “There’s a difference between risk control disputes and insolvency. MEXC’s financials are solid. The issue is operational.” Swing trade CryptoVikings replied to her apology saying: “If it took this much for an influencer to get funds back, what hope does a regular user have? There are 1,000+ cases like this.” When Cecilia replied “We are going to release them,” CryptoVikings pushed back again: “Why now? Why did it take months of backlash for you to act?” Cecilia went silent after that. User claims $3.3M of his funds were frozen on MEXC with no timeline for release Still, the backlash continues. Trader @maxleebtc came forward after Cecelia and Mystral’s posts with a separate case of his own, posting screenshots that show 3,300,000 USDT locked in his MEXC account for 20 days, with every withdrawal attempt marked “Withdrawal Failed.” Max said he originally thought it was just a system issue, but support kept telling him to “please be patient” before later claiming his account showed “abnormal profit.” Source: MaxleeBTC/X The chat log he shared shows MEXC staff allegedly telling him the funds were “crawled back” because of his futures trading performance, with no breakdown of how that decision was made. Max said that he reached out to MEXC’s support many times, but their response has so far been either automated or vague, and the funds remain frozen, allegedly.

Tether Discloses Billions In Gold And Bitcoin Holdings The third quarter of 2025 marked a significant milestone for the firm, with over $17 billion in new USDT issued—one of the company’s strongest performances to date. This surge has increased the total circulating supply of USDT to over $174 billion. In terms of financial exposure , Tether’s holdings in US treasuries, both direct and indirect, have reached an all-time high of approximately $135 billion. This positions the company as one of the largest holders of US government debt, surpassing South Korea to rank as the 17th largest among nations holding US Treasuries. As of September 30, 2025, the company reported that the reserves backing Tether tokens in circulation amounted to approximately $181.2 billion, while liabilities totaled about $174.4 billion. This indicates that the value of assets supporting Tether exceeds its liabilities by approximately $6.8 billion. Additionally, Tether’s reserves include $12.9 billion in gold and $9.9 billion in Bitcoin (BTC), together representing about 13% of total reserves. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, commented on the Q3 results, stating: These results reflect the continued trust and strength behind Tether, even amid a challenging global macroeconomic environment. They reinforce Tether’s brand as the ‘Stable Company.’ He highlighted that both investors and users are increasingly turning to USDT as the most reliable and liquid digital dollar, which underscores enduring confidence in the stablecoin issuer’s operational model. T3 Financial Crime Unit Freezes Over $300 Million In Criminal Assets In a related effort to maintain financial integrity, the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU)—a collaborative initiative from Tether, TRON, and TRM Labs—has reportedly frozen more than $300 million in criminal assets globally. The largest volumes of assistance were documented in the United States, where $83 million was frozen across 37 cases, followed by assistance in countries such as Spain, Germany, and Brazil, among others. The most common types of crimes investigated included illicit goods and services (39%), fraud, hacks, and activities linked to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), which accounted for $19 million from the Bybit hack alone. Ardoino emphasized the firms dedication to preserving the integrity of the financial system, stating, “Reaching the $300 million milestone demonstrates the real-world impact of blockchain technology in combating financial crime.” He reiterated the company’s commitment to collaborating with more than 280 law enforcement agencies worldwide, aiming to monitor transactions and disrupt criminal activity effectively.

Announcing the launch during The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which aired on Friday. Musk said the entire messaging stack had been rebuilt from scratch. “On X, we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack into what’s called ‘X Chat,” said Musk Musk prepares to launch ‘X Chat’ to rival WhatsApp and Telegram According to Musk, it utilizes peer-to-peer encryption technology, similar to that used by Bitcoin. For now, it is being evaluated to establish if it is ready for deployment. Musk said he believes the new messaging app will be available in a “few months,” and that it will not have any “hooks for advertising,” citing competitors such as WhatsApp, which “knows enough about what you’re texting to know what ads to show you,” he said. He cautioned that this poses a tremendous security threat, as having enough material to display targeted advertisements indicates that they possess a massive amount of confidential information, including users’ private messages, that hackers could use to gain access. Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, maintains it does not have access to private conversations, stating in its FAQ that messages between people are end-to-end encrypted with the Signal Protocol. This also includes voicemails, media, and documents. However, many believe that “metadata,” such as who you contacted and how frequently you spoke with them, is not encrypted. WhatsApp does not automatically encrypt backups of your chat history. WhatsApp’s FAQ section on “Does WhatsApp collect or sell your data?” does not address the latter portion of the issue, instead stating that “we work with other Meta companies to help provide, improve, and support each other’s services.” The company also notes that users who integrate WhatsApp with other Meta products consent to some data sharing between platforms. Musk aims to be different and stated that X Chat will avoid such advertising “hooks.” He notes that his main goal is to create a fully encrypted system capable of sending messages, files, and conducting audio or video calls. According to Musk, it will be “the least insecure of any messaging system.” The new service will be integrated into the X platform and also released as a standalone app. Musk expands his digital empire with AI-powered Grokipedia launch Separately, on Monday, Musk introduced Grokipedia , his version of Wikipedia powered by his AI company, xAI. The crowdsourced encyclopedia, which Musk says will “purge out the propaganda” found on Wikipedia, briefly crashed after launch but already featured more than 800,000 AI-generated entries, compared to Wikipedia’s nearly eight million human-written articles. Visitors to the website, grokipedia.com, were welcomed with a bare-bones logo and a search bar that enabled them to query topics. One entry on Musk himself describes him as “a blend of innovative visionary with irreverent provocateur”. It continues to showcase details of his diet, noting his consumption of “occasional indulgences like morning donuts and multiple Diet Cokes daily.” Grokipedia also has entries on OpenAI, a competitor of xAI, as well as political figures such as President Trump and the New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The new site expands the billionaire’s online media ecosystem, which closely aligns with his personal political views. Still, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales wasn’t keen on Grokipedia. Speaking at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York, Jimmy noted he did not need to study Grokipedia’s content to predict how it would turn out.“I’m not optimistic he will create anything very useful right now,” he said. Jimmy stressed he was not worried about competition. According to the executive, his lack of interest in reviewing Grokipedia is not a personal matter. He continues to state that the core problem is the technology behind it. He said the large language models Musk is using turn out to be big blunders. On X, Mr. Musk has reinstated right-wing creators and expanded their reach to many audiences, utilizing the platform as a bully pulpit to advocate for government funding cuts. He has also tweaked xAI’s chatbot, Grok, to a more conservative tone. According to Ryan McGrady, a senior research fellow at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies encyclopedias and social media platforms, t he impulse to control knowledge is as old as knowledge itself. He continues to say that controlling what gets written is a way to gain or keep power. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-to-xrp-holders-you-need-to-lock-in-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld highlighted the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent policy decision, noting that the central bank plans to conclude its quantitative tightening program on December 1. This announcement marks a major turning point in monetary policy after an extended period of liquidity contraction. Rietveld emphasized that halting quantitative tightening historically precedes a return to asset price growth across multiple sectors, including equities, cryptocurrencies, and real estate. The termination of quantitative tightening effectively signals the Federal Reserve’s intention to expand the money supply once again. Rietveld noted that each previous instance of monetary expansion has coincided with positive performance in financial markets. He referenced historical trends showing that, within three months of such a shift, U.S. asset classes—ranging from stocks to digital currencies—have consistently recorded higher valuations. YOU NEED TO LOCK IN!! #XRP #ripple #crypto #cryptonews #BTC #ETH #SOL pic.twitter.com/WdsEsb5A87 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 30, 2025 Historical Context of Money Supply Expansion The expert underscored that there has rarely been a period in U.S. history when prices surged during an increase in the money supply. From his perspective, this policy shift presents a clear opportunity for investors who are positioned in risk-on assets. Rietveld’s message was straightforward: when liquidity flows back into the economy, nearly all major asset classes tend to appreciate. Such a stance aligns with traditional economic theory, which connects monetary expansion to inflationary pressures that typically lift nominal asset prices. The anticipation of renewed liquidity may also encourage speculative momentum, particularly within the cryptocurrency market, where sentiment often reacts to macroeconomic cues. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Advice to Crypto Investors In his message, Rietveld addressed holders of digital assets directly, noting that this may be a critical moment for those invested in XRP , Bitcoin , and other cryptocurrencies. He suggested that investors should “lock in” their positions ahead of what could be a broad-based rally, consistent with historical outcomes following previous policy shifts. Market participants have responded with optimism. One X user, Evelyn, commented that now is the ideal moment to solidify holdings, expressing confidence that XRP may soon experience significant movement . She added that the broader cryptocurrency sector is likely entering a phase of renewed energy driven by monetary expansion and increased investor activity. Rietveld’s remarks reflect a broader market expectation that the end of quantitative tightening will mark the beginning of a liquidity-driven growth phase. While economic outcomes remain dependent on a range of global factors, his analysis suggests that the combination of easing monetary policy and renewed investor confidence could set the stage for a strong close to the year across financial markets.

ChatGPT’s Bull vs Bear Scenarios,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-networks-pi-price-recovery-continue-in-november-chatgpts-bull-vs-bear-scenarios/,"Pi Network’s native token went on the run in the past couple of weeks, skyrocketing from its October 10 all-time low of $0.172 to roughly $0.29 before it settled at around $0.25 as October closed. This impressive rally came after months of prolonged correction and several positive developments in the Pi Network ecosystem, such as new updates, features, and AI implementations. All eyes are now on November as the year is coming to a close, and the question we asked ChatGPT is whether PI has the ability to continue its recent run and double down on its price recovery attempts. Yay or Nay in November? Before it made its predictions for the upcoming 30 days, the AI chatbot outlined the two reasons behind PI’s 50% surge in late October: “ renewed community activity (AI and utility-app pilots) and a pickup in off-exchange trading volume.” It remains relatively bullish on the asset for November, placing a 60% “base case” that it will keep climbing, slowly and gradually. It noted that in this most likely scenario, its current price level would be the lower boundary of a broader range between $0.24 and $0.34. “Modest continuation as ecosystem headlines keep interest alive but liquidity remains thin,” it described this scenario. Those hoping for a more sustainable and impressive increase, one that can send PI beyond $0.40, received a 25% chance from the AI solution. Such a bullish case would be possible if the token breaks the $0.35 resistance following listings on new exchanges or additional and more tangible improvements within the ecosystem. ChatGPT’s bear case (15% probability chance) envisions another drop below $0.20 and possibly retesting the ATL if “hype fades and no network-progress news lands before mid-month.” What to Watch The popular AI chatbot outlined several factors that can influence PI’s price in the next month: App-ecosystem traction – new Pi-based apps or AI integrations could sustain the recovery. Liquidity & listings – volumes remain small and mostly OTC; broader exchange support would be the single biggest bullish catalyst. Broader market mood – a stronger BTC/alt recovery this month would amplify any upside in PI. In addition, it outlined the token unlock schedule, which shows the number of coins to be released in the following month. It could be used to get a broader perspective on whether the immediate selling pressure from investors awaiting their tokens could ease or increase. Current data from PiScan shows that the average daily unlock is around 4.160 million tokens, which is nowhere near as high as 8-9 million during the summer. As such, this could ease the immediate selling pressure and allow the asset to stabilize in November as predicted above. Pi Unlock Schedule.

53890474,618135,1761973217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53890474.jpeg,Fed Cut Triggers 10K Bitcoin Sell-Off – Yet Zero Panic From Long-Term Holders,https://bitcoinist.com/fed-cut-triggers-10k-bitcoin-sell-off-zero-panic/,"Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market slipped into the red following the Federal Reserve’s recent 25bps interest rate cut, igniting a familiar debate across trading desks: is this simply a “sell the news” shakeout, or the early stages of a more sustained downturn — a possible prelude to another crypto winter? BTC is currently struggling beneath the $110,000 level, signaling uncertainty and hesitation among traders as volatility rises and sentiment weakens. The initial optimism that typically follows pro-liquidity policy shifts was overshadowed by renewed selling pressure, suggesting that markets may be recalibrating after months of aggressive speculative positioning and a historic liquidation earlier in October. For now, analysts are split. Some argue this pullback reflects normal market digestion following a major macro catalyst, consistent with previous rate-cut cycles where risk assets dipped before resuming higher. Others warn that loss of key technical levels may open the door to deeper downside if demand fails to re-emerge quickly. With Bitcoin hovering near critical support and macro conditions in transition, the coming weeks are expected to be crucial. Whether this move marks a temporary flush or the start of a broader risk-off phase will likely define the next chapter of the crypto cycle. Short-Term Speculators Drive Sell-Off as Long-Term Holders Stay Strong According to a recent CryptoQuant analysis by CryptoOnchain, the sharp market drop on October 30th was driven overwhelmingly by short-term traders rather than long-term investors. As volatility surged, more than 10,000 BTC flowed into Binance — typically a bearish signal, as rising exchange inflows often precede selling pressure. But digging deeper into the on-chain data reveals a very different story beneath the surface. The Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) metric shows that 10,009 BTC of that inflow came from coins held for less than 24 hours. In other words, nearly the entire wave of selling originated from “hot money” — short-term traders reacting emotionally and quickly to macro headlines and market turbulence. These are speculative participants, not long-term strategic holders. In contrast, inflows from Long-Term Holders — coins held for six months or more — were negligible. The market’s most resilient participants, often referred to as diamond hands, did not rush to sell. They did not send BTC to exchanges, did not panic, and did not contribute to the downturn. This divergence is crucial. It confirms that the sell-off was a liquidity flush, not a shift in long-term conviction. Investor psychology, not fundamentals, drove the move. Far from signaling the start of a crypto winter, this pattern aligns with historical shakeout behavior seen before larger continuation moves. When short-term holders capitulate while long-term holders remain steady, it typically reflects market cleansing rather than structural weakness. In short, on-chain signals suggest the foundation of the market remains strong — and this correction appears to be a clearing event, not the beginning of a long-term downtrend. Bitcoin Holds Mid-Range on 3D Chart Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $109,800 on the 3-day timeframe, holding mid-range after a volatile month marked by macro reactions and leveraged shakeouts. Despite recent downside pressure, the broader structure remains intact, with BTC still comfortably above the 100-period moving average (green line) and well above the 200-period moving average (red line) — signaling that the long-term trend remains bullish. Price continues to consolidate between $108,000 support and the critical $117,500 resistance zone, which has acted as a major supply barrier throughout this consolidation phase. Each attempt to break above $117,500 has been met with selling, confirming it as the cycle’s Point of Control and the key level for bulls to reclaim to regain momentum. On the downside, the $108,000–$105,000 area has repeatedly served as a demand region, supported by buyers stepping in during pullbacks. Losing that zone on the 3D close would introduce risk of deeper correction toward $100,000–$102,000, where structural support and prior breakout levels converge.

Instead, Bitcoin finished the month down, creating a gap of approximately 13% from its all-time high. Historical Trends Suggest Bitcoin Could Rebound Joel Kruger, a market strategist at LMAX Group, noted that while October was a letdown compared to historical trends, it’s essential to contextualize the price movements. He remarked, “Prices have held up well overall, especially after a September that actually bucked the usual weakness.” Related Reading: Coinbase, Strategy Mark Major Profit Surges In Q3: Unveiling The Numbers Notably, on the 6th of this month, the market’s leading cryptocurrency reached an all-time high just beyond $126,000. Additionally, the current downturn has failed to erase the year-to-date gains, with Bitcoin still recording a 55% uptrend during this period. However, according to a recent analysis by Fortune, this October marks the fourth-worst performance for Bitcoin since 2013 and the worst in the past seven years. Bitcoin’s performance lagged behind that of the S&P 500, which saw a gain of roughly 2.3% during the same period. Despite this under performance, Kruger remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential recovery in the upcoming months. “Historically, Q4 has been one of the best periods for crypto performance,” he stated, expressing hope for a push toward record highs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) as the year draws to a close. October Challenges The month proved challenging not only in terms of price but also due to significant market events. Adam McCarthy, a senior research analyst at digital market data provider Kaiko, observed that cryptocurrencies entered October tracking gold and stocks at near all-time highs. However, as uncertainty crept into the market, investors did not flow back into Bitcoin as anticipated. In addition, October witnessed the largest liquidation event in cryptocurrency history, triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, alongside threats of export controls on crucial software. Related Reading: dYdX Eyes US Market Entry: Decentralized Crypto Exchange Plans Year-End Debut, Reuters McCarthy commented on the impact of this liquidation, stating, “That washout on the 10th really reminded people that this asset class is very narrow.” He emphasized that even dominant cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can experience sharp drawdowns, citing instances of 10% declines occurring in just 15 to 20 minutes. Amid these developments, concerns have been raised by several figures regarding the high valuations in equity markets. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, recently warned of a heightened risk of a significant correction in the US stock market within the next six months to two years. Jake Ostrovskis, head of trading at Wintermute’s over-the-counter desk, noted that participants in the market remain hesitant as they grapple with the implications of the largest liquidation event on record. He added that this caution persists amid ongoing speculation about vulnerabilities that might still exist within the financial system.

Bitcoin Is Retesting The 0.85 Supply Quantile In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin is retesting a level that has historically been a “make-or-break” one for the asset. Related Reading: Dogecoin Plunges To $0.18 As Whales Sell 440 Million DOGE The level in question is part of Glassnode’s “Supply Quantiles Cost Basis Model.” The model reflects price levels corresponding to important investor profitability thresholds. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the levels of this model have changed over the last few years. Looks like BTC is currently trading around the middle band | Source: Glassnode on X As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin surged above the 0.95 quantile during the recent rally to the all-time high (ATH). This level corresponds to 95% of the supply being in profit. With the market downturn that has followed since, however, the cryptocurrency has slipped under the level. Recently, the asset has been making retests of the 0.85 quantile, situated at $109,000. BTC has already seen brief drops below this mark, but so far, it has managed to climb back above it each time. At present, the coin is trading right around the level, indicating that about 85% of the supply is carrying a net unrealized gain. In the past, Bitcoin’s interactions with this level have tended to carry consequences for its trajectory. “Holding it has sparked major rallies, but losing it often sees a slide toward the 0.75 band,” noted Glassnode. The 0.75 quantile is equivalent to $98,000 at the moment. It now remains to be seen whether BTC can hold above the 0.85 quantile, or if a retrace to this level is coming. In some other news, the latest decline in Bitcoin below $107,000 came alongside negative values on the Coinbase Premium Gap, as pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X post. The Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The metric basically tells us about how the behavior of the users on the former exchange differ from that of the latter platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Hold Key Support: Could $88,000 Be Next? As the below chart shows, the metric was at positive levels on Wednesday, but the indicator turned red on Thursday. The trend would imply that Coinbase traders, primarily made up of American institutional entities, sold the cryptocurrency at a higher intensity than Binance’s global whales during the Bitcoin drawdown. BTC Price Since the wave of selling on Coinbase, Bitcoin has witnessed some recovery back to the $109,500 level, reclaiming the 0.85 quantile once again.

The post reflects on how similar conditions preceded XRP’s notable price appreciation last year, suggesting that market sentiment may once again be misreading the implications of recent policy moves. On September 18, 2024, the Fed cut the rates by 50 bps. #XRPArmy was dead silent, as was the rest of the Crypto communities. XRP was at $0.50 before the $3.66 run! We addressed the Bull Run 6 weeks before the Surge. Now, the Fed cut the rates by 25 We have the same panic We… https://t.co/efK0OLCKfn — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) October 30, 2025 Historical Context and Market Behavior Dark Defender referenced the September 18, 2024, rate cut, when the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points. At that time, XRP was trading near $0.50, before a sharp increase that took it to $3.66. According to the analyst, the broader crypto market, including XRP supporters, initially reacted with hesitation rather than optimism. The subdued sentiment that followed the rate reduction was soon replaced by a sustained bullish phase, which Dark Defender claims had been anticipated weeks in advance. This historical comparison serves as the foundation of the analyst’s current outlook. The Federal Reserve recently reduced rates again, this time by 25 basis points, triggering renewed uncertainty within crypto markets. Dark Defender interprets this as a repeat of past behavioral patterns, where short-term anxiety masks underlying conditions conducive to a broader uptrend. The analyst emphasizes patience, implying that a comparable market response could emerge before the next Federal Reserve meeting. Market Reactions and Community Insights The post generated differing perspectives from members of the XRP community. Eloise, an X user, expressed that price volatility often discourages investors, noting that repeated cycles of panic tend to eliminate those unprepared for market turbulence. She added that her biggest regret was failing to accumulate more XRP during previous periods of low valuation. Sigifredo Marcelino presented a contrasting opinion. He asserts that the current political landscape has shifted from last year’s conditions, referencing the uncertainty about whether President Donald Trump would return to office. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Tyson Weller, questioned whether the previous XRP surge was influenced more by the Federal Reserve’s actions or by developments such as the lawsuit resolution and political expectations tied to the presidential race. Dark Defender’s analysis aligns with a broader view that macroeconomic shifts, including rate adjustments, can serve as catalysts for renewed momentum in digital assets. The suggestion that XRP could experience a similar pre-meeting surge underscores the analyst’s confidence in recurring market behavior. While past performance does not guarantee repetition, the argument underscores how investor psychology often amplifies short-term reactions to policy moves. The coming weeks will determine whether this latest Federal Reserve decision will produce the same kind of buildup observed before XRP’s major rally in 2024.

Following two tie votes, one to advance and another to kill the bill, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 4–2 to refer it for interim review. Lawmakers claimed before Tuesday’s proceedings that the bill had received an unprecedented amount of public interest and input since it was last discussed during the spring. The bill, specifically, would prohibit local governments from enacting certain laws that would inhibit cryptocurrency mining businesses, such as noise-prohibition zoning. It will also prevent digital money transactions from being taxed differently by state and local authorities, and it concurs that people have the right to mine digital money. Furthermore, a superior court would establish a blockchain conflict docket and assign a justice to hear crypto-linked conflicts under the legislation. Senators claimed they had seen unusually high volumes of public engagement on the bill In May, senators opted to send the bill back to committee after its first vote to clarify certain provisions and secure additional support. Senators are expected to revisit the legislation in the new year. According to the bill’s lead sponsor, New Boston Republican Rep. Keith Ammon, the legislation will protect blockchain and cryptocurrency companies from bias. The legislation aligns with a model policy written by the Satoshi Action Group, which advocates for the use of Bitcoin and has successfully advanced similar laws in several U.S. states. During the Commerce Committee’s Oct. 30 meeting, Sen. Denise Ricciardi, a Republican from District 9, pointed to Arkansas as an example, seeing that it strengthened its mining regulations after facing community noise complaints and fears over environmental harm and foreign control. Senators said Thursday that their constituents have voiced strong opinions about the bill since it was last debated in the chamber. Ricciardi commented, “I don’t want to vote against it, but we heard from so many constituents, and I would like to have it worked on further and then move it forward next session.” The Concord Democrat Senator Reardon also shared that she’d never seen so much public engagement on a single bill, noting that the messages she received focused on the loss of local authority and community-level concerns. Senator Keith Murphy, one of the bill’s backers, said the legislation would make clear that New Hampshire is ready to embrace the digital asset sector. Coal use in Bitcoin mining has reduced There are still concerns about the environmental cost of crypto mining. However, the industry’s energy profile is improving. The MiCA Crypto Alliance and Nodiens report shows that coal use in Bitcoin mining has decreased from 63% in 2011 to 20% in 2024, alongside a 5.8% yearly increase in renewable energy reliance. Some U.S. states are also using taxation to mitigate the energy demands of digital asset mining. On October 2, Sen. Liz Krueger of New York proposed legislation introducing a tiered tax on electricity consumption, exempting miners who use less than 2.25 million kWh annually and charging 2 cents per kWh for those using up to 5 million kWh per year. At the same time, Russian government officials have launched a special registry of cryptocurrency mining equipment to help identify and tackle the increasingly popular illegal mining operations on a domestic level. According to Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko, the registry, compiled jointly by the Ministry of Energy, the Federal Tax Service (FNS), and the Ministry of Digital Development, contains detailed information on devices used for crypto mining, RIA Novosti reported. Konyushenko mentioned that the information is quite detailed, and they have shared it with Law enforcement and authorities in some territories. Authorities in those regions are currently working hard to coordinate their actions. “The creation of such a register will allow us to identify consumers using electricity for mining needs accurately. This is necessary to apply special regulation and taxation to those.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

In most cases, these paid tiers usually mean better stats, faster progress, and unfair advantages in the game’s universe. SACHI is pitching the framework that gives gamers all the charisma upgrades, reputation boosts, and exclusive cosmetic drops that set them apart in lobbies and throughout the metaverse without interfering with the fairness that makes gameplay engaging and rewarding for everyone. So, whether gamers are free roaming in SACHI’s immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe or exploring the VIP Floor , they can always be confident that they can compete freely and fairly with any and all comers — noob and pros alike. SACHI’s VIP Floor opens up the visible and shareable bling and dazzle of its exclusive social layer, where players can unlock private rooms, invitation-only events, and special moments through play, community engagement, or token-backed achievements. What it does not do is interfere with competitiveness and fair play. Prestige Without Power Players who reach the VIP Floor can expect: Private lounges for networking, strategy, and cultural drop reveals. Exclusive skins, emotes, and badges tied to $SACHI holdings and achievements. Limited events and social moments that put community status on display. But one thing they won’t find is power imbalance. SACHI’s leaderboards, matchmaking, and core gameplay remain untouched, keeping the ecosystem competitive and fair. “We wanted to show the traditional and Web3 gaming gallery, with our VIP Floor that you can have a wide variety of offers on your exclusive layer without actually corrupting the game universe with cheat codes,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “It’s about culture, exclusivity, and identity, a reward you can proudly share because you earned it fair and square. Prestige in SACHI is earned, never bought.” SACHI Continues to Deliver for Gamers Popular culture, regardless of origin (fashion, art, or music), can have far-reaching influence on different aspects of life, including digital identity. The market for cosmetic upgrades like skins, emotes, outfits and exclusive access like battle passes and season passes in games is worth between $60 and 100 billion annually as of 2025. However, as much as players want these status symbols to set themselves apart in their gaming metaverses, they still demand fairness. SACHI’s model ensures the VIP layer becomes an aspirational part of the community, not a pay-for-play crutch that allows players to exchange economic status for in-game advantage. Enter the SACHI universe and earn your way to the VIP Floor, where your full digital identity awaits. Fair play stays intact, but your status will never go unnoticed. About SACHI SACHI is an immersive Web3 competitive gaming universe that merges AAA-quality gameplay with real-time social features and blockchain-powered economies. Built on Unreal Engine 5 and powered by pixel streaming , SACHI is accessible on any device without downloads or high-end hardware. With its fair-play economy and prestige-driven VIP Floor, SACHI balances competition with culture, making gaming both thrilling and socially rewarding.

We’re talking about a significant ETH transfer involving a major player, Galaxy Digital. This event highlights the dynamic nature of digital asset movements and the growing sophistication of on-chain analytics. What Does This Massive ETH Transfer From Galaxy Digital Mean? According to a detailed report from Onchain-Lense, a new address has just received a substantial amount of Ethereum. Specifically, 9,272 ETH, valued at approximately $35.77 million, was transferred from Galaxy Digital. This kind of large-scale ETH transfer from a prominent institutional firm like Galaxy Digital often signals strategic moves within the crypto ecosystem. Galaxy Digital is a well-known financial services and investment management company specializing in digital assets. Their actions are closely watched, as they can provide insights into broader institutional sentiment and market trends. When such a large sum of Ethereum changes hands, it naturally raises questions about the purpose and the parties involved. Who Are the Suspected Recipients of This ETH Transfer? The mystery surrounding the recipient address adds another layer of intrigue to this transaction. Onchain-Lense’s analysis suggests that the receiving address might be linked to either Bitmine (BMNR) or Sharplink Gaming (SBET). Both are publicly traded entities, albeit in different sectors. Bitmine (BMNR): This company is typically associated with Bitcoin mining operations. A large ETH transfer to such an entity could indicate a diversification of assets, an investment in Ethereum-related projects, or perhaps a treasury management strategy. Sharplink Gaming (SBET): As a Nasdaq-listed company focused on sports betting and iGaming technology, an association with this Ethereum transfer could point towards integration of blockchain technology, expansion into Web3 gaming, or even a strategic investment in the underlying asset. It’s important to remember that these are currently suspicions based on on-chain data analysis. The exact nature of the relationship or the purpose of the transfer remains unconfirmed by the entities themselves. Why Are Large ETH Transfers So Closely Monitored? Large ETH transfers , especially those involving institutional players, are often scrutinized for several reasons. They can provide early indicators of market sentiment, potential investments, or even liquidity management strategies. For example, a significant move could precede a new product launch, a major partnership, or simply a rebalancing of portfolios. On-chain analytics tools, like those used by Onchain-Lense, allow us to track these movements with precision. This transparency is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, enabling a level of insight into financial flows that is often unavailable in traditional markets. Understanding these movements helps investors and analysts anticipate potential market shifts and institutional adoption trends. How Does This ETH Transfer Impact the Broader Market? While a single ETH transfer of this size might not immediately trigger a massive market swing, it contributes to the overall narrative of institutional engagement with Ethereum. As more traditional financial firms and public companies interact with digital assets, it lends credibility and maturity to the crypto space. The potential involvement of entities like Bitmine or Sharplink Gaming further underscores the diverse applications of blockchain technology beyond just speculative trading. It highlights a growing trend where companies are exploring how Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies can integrate into their existing business models or open up new opportunities. This evolution is key to the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market. In conclusion, this substantial ETH transfer from Galaxy Digital to a new address, potentially linked to Bitmine or Sharplink Gaming, is a fascinating development. It reinforces the importance of on-chain monitoring and offers a glimpse into the strategic maneuvers of institutional players in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. Keep an eye on these movements, as they often paint a clearer picture of where the market is headed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an ETH transfer?

BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and TAO are drawing real capital, while market HYPE around AI, speed, and real-world utility is rising again. One payments-focused challenger has quietly lined up a wallet reveal and Q3 rollout that could turn sentiment into adoption. This guide gives you a clear, price-led snapshot on BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and TAO, then shows why a payment rail built as an ERC-20 coin may be the overlooked winner. Expect firm numbers, clean takeaways, and a subtle hint at the payments upstart that analysts are calling the best crypto to buy now for early stage investment where hype finally meets usage. BTC | Momentum Into 2026 BTC cooled into month end but still hovered near six figures, trading around $108,000 to $110,000 today. BTC remains the benchmark risk signal for funds rotating into digital assets. If funding calms, BTC keeps a bullish tilt into 2026; if macro tightens, BTC may retest lower without breaking its structural trend. Institutional allocators still anchor around BTC due to deep liquidity and regulated market rails. For portfolio core exposure, BTC remains the default. When HYPE spikes across sectors, BTC often benefits first as capital re-enters, and BTC dominance can rise before altflows resume. ETH | Building While Price Consolidates ETH held near the mid-$3,800s today, priced around $3,800 to $3,860. ETH keeps absorbing app demand through rollups while fees trend more predictable. When BTC sets the tone, ETH usually follows with higher beta moves once confidence returns. Into 2026, ETH has multiple flywheels: restaking debates, rollup economics, and growing app-layer adoption. If HYPE rotates into real fee growth, ETH can lead the next leg. Desk flows still treat ETH as a programmable counterpart to BTC, and ETH is central to multi-chain liquidity routing. SOL | Throughput, Fees, and Flows SOL traded in the high-$180s today, with spot levels near $185 to $188 after a pullback. SOL continues to screen well as a high-throughput chain with fast confirmation and low fees. When NFT and DeFi volumes re-accelerate, SOL often sees the earliest volume spikes. For 2026 setups, SOL is still on trader dashboards that favor speed and user experience. If HYPE on fast finality lines up with rising fees and on-chain activity, SOL can outperform. Portfolio builders who want growth-chain exposure often keep a SOL allocation beside BTC and ETH. SUI | Base-Building At Key Support SUI defended the low-$2 region today, trading near $2.30 to $2.37 while liquidity stabilized. SUI sits on multiple watchlists as newer capital studies its developer momentum and throughput design. If the market rotates into newer L1 experiments, SUI could benefit from incremental risk appetite. In 2026, SUI will be judged on usage, not slogans. If SUI grows real transactions and fee capture, the risk-reward improves. Traders watching HYPE cycles will want SUI confirmations on volumes, address growth, and integrations before pushing size. TAO | Where AI Meets Crypto TAO (Bittensor) extended its AI-linked advance with prints near $480 to $490 today and stronger volumes. TAO is the cleaner way for some funds to express AI-on-chain exposure. If inference demand and AI spending trend higher into 2026, TAO’s network economics remain in focus. That said, TAO is sensitive to HYPE in the AI trade. For disciplined entries, traders often wait for TAO to align with on-chain KPIs, not just headlines. Still, TAO sits near the front of the pack among AI players alongside BTC, ETH, SOL, and SUI as macro liquidity shifts. HYPE | Sentiment Check You Cannot Ignore HYPE can power big moves when it matches usage. When HYPE outruns data, reversals follow. Watch how HYPE behaves around BTC and ETH trend days, how HYPE lifts SOL and SUI when fees rise, and how HYPE swings TAO when AI headlines break. The right way to use HYPE is as a timing tool, not a thesis. In 2026, HYPE will keep rotating.

Global Regulators To Review Crypto Standards On Friday, Bloomberg affirmed that global regulators are in talks to review and potentially overhaul rules on banks’ crypto holdings, set to come into force in 2026. The US is reportedly leading the pushback against the original measures following the rapid surge of the stablecoin sector. In 2022, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) released its standard for the “prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets,” including tokenized traditional assets, stablecoins, and unbacked digital assets. Senior finance executives reportedly affirmed that banks have largely interpreted the standards as “a signal to avoid crypto since they imposed a heavy capital burden on such holdings.” However, the crypto industry’s adoption has evolved in the past few years, with key players like the US changing their regulatory stance to embrace the sector. According to people familiar with the talks, the shift has prompted debates at the BCBS regarding the suitability of these rules under the current environment, as major global jurisdictions, including the US and UK, haven’t committed to implementing them on time. The news media outlet noted that the Basel Committee updated its crypto standards in 2024 but delayed its implementation by one year. As a result, the US has been seemingly leading calls to amend the standards, Bloomberg sources said, arguing that the rules are “incompatible with the industry’s evolution,” especially in the stablecoin sector. Some countries allegedly see the US’s logic and favor reviewing the standards before they are widely implemented. Notably, the Bank of England (BoE) has stated that it “continues to work on the implementation of its prudential framework for cryptoasset exposures, and is engaging internationally with other jurisdictions to promote regulatory consistency.” Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently announced a one-year delay of its new crypto prudential standards, which are based on the BSCS’s measures. On the contrary, the European Central Bank (ECB) considers that it’s best to implement the current standards and explore a revision later. Global Stablecoin Regulatory Landscape It’s worth noting that stablecoin regulation has faced challenges despite the global push to adopt the sector. The ECB has called for a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins in the bloc and other jurisdictions, following a recommendation by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Additionally, the US banking industry has pushed back against the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act for potential loopholes that could pose major risks to the financial system. Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, recently vowed to address the evolving threats from private finance and the growing use of stablecoins. In June, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) expressed concerns about the increasing risks associated with the stablecoin adoption, arguing that the use of the digital assets by criminal parties poses a growing challenge to global financial security. As reported by Bitcoinist, BoE Governor and FSB Chairman Andrew Bailey pledged earlier this month to increase the global watchdog’s policy response to the emerging risks related to the private finance sector and stablecoins, aiming to make it “more flexible and quicker to recognise, and respond to, emerging vulnerabilities.” Bailey affirmed that the international watchdog will have “open and frank discussions among members” about the next steps, and will “increase outreach to the private sector to benefit from their expertise and perspectives on risks and vulnerabilities.”",Crypto News|Basel Committee on Banking Supervision|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto adoption|crypto regulation|crypto standards|FSB|Singapore regulation|stablecoin adoption|UK regulators|US|US Regulators,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 06:00:35

Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-crypto-boring-now-bitwise-ceo-says-the-market-is-changing/,"As the early ‘Uptober’ buzz fizzles and Bitcoin struggles to hold $110,000, the overall crypto market sentiment has seemingly taken a beating. According to online reports, market participants are disappointed with the recent performance, but some experts argue that this means the industry is “winning.” Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) November Rally At Risk? Analysts Say This Week’s Close Holds The Key Crypto Vibes Are ‘Sad’ Despite Industry Adoption On Thursday, investor and analyst Will Clemente shared on X that “the vibes in the crypto groupchats are just sad.” He explained that investors seem “jaded, depressed, and defeated,” adding that they are “completely giving up” and switching to other asset classes after BTC’s performance this year. Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, weighed in on the matter, affirming that “Crypto natives are now in a multi-month bear market sentiment,” while the “off-Twitter” sentiment is the “best it’s ever been.” Horsley detailed that the offline positive outlook is fueled by the notable decrease in regulatory risk, which has led to the recent spike in institutional adoption and mainstream recognition. Notably, the second wave of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) started trading this week, with Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) stealing the spotlight. Moreover, the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend, led by Strategy, continues to pour millions of dollars into cryptocurrencies. “The market is changing,” the CEO asserted in his Friday X post, pointing out JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s recent approach shift. Dimon has been a long-time crypto skeptic, calling the flagship crypto a “Ponzi scheme” and dismissing it as “useless as a pet rock.” Nonetheless, he recently admitted that he was wrong and that crypto, stablecoins, and blockchain are “real.” Is The Market ‘Boring’ Or Mature? In a response to Clemente’s post, Nic Carter stated that the sentiment shift highlights a deeper truth about the market: the space has matured significantly. He explained that crypto is “boring” now because most of the questions and uncertainties that drove much of the historical volatility have been answered. So many of the open questions have been answered, will stablecoins be allowed? yes. will we be banned? no. will we all go to jail for writing software? no. will we be incorporated into tradfi? yes. can tokens have cashflows and not be securities? Apparently. (…) There are still some unanswered questions, particularly around cash-flowing pseudoequity tokens, but we will probably get answers to those in the coming years. He also argued that the crypto industry has been largely derisked as a technological substrate, bringing large corporations to adopt these tools, which shows that “crypto natives no longer control the narrative, there’s more serious businesses (which don’t require tokens), there’s less chaos, the whole space has matured significantly.” Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Prepares For ‘Last Euphoric Run’ As Whales Go On $135M Buying Spree To Carter, this means that the industry has “won.” However, he noted that clarity and maturity come with less excitement, as “winning means the inherent volatility in the space is highly reduced! This applies to both startups and the underlying assets themselves.” “So if you’re sad that volatility has been dampened smile through the tears. it means we won,” he concluded.

In a Thursday post on X, Murphy claimed Coinbase had contributed to political action committee (PAC) Fairshake and helped fund Trump’s 2025 inauguration, implying a link between the donations and the SEC’s decision to drop a previous enforcement action against the company. Coinbase Pushes Back Against Accusations Responding to the allegations, Shirzad denied any political bias or wrongdoing. He explained that Coinbase was “proud to have supported the building of a new ballroom through the Trust for the National Mall,” emphasizing that many companies contributed to the same fund. “Note that we’re not the general contractor, so we’re not the right target if you’re unhappy about how the project is proceeding,” Shirzad said. He added that Fairshake was “non-partisan,” stressing that many public donations have supported inauguration events for past administrations. Trump’s Ballroom Project and Controversy Trump first announced plans in July to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom on White House grounds, estimating the cost at $200 million and assuring the project wouldn’t affect the East Wing. However, recent photos revealed the East Wing had been demolished as part of the construction, and Trump later said costs had risen to $350 million. Murphy’s criticism focused on what he saw as corporate favoritism — but Coinbase maintains its involvement was part of a broader civic project, not political influence. Coinbase’s Growing Political Footprint The ballroom funding issue isn’t the first time Coinbase’s relationships with Washington have drawn scrutiny. In June, the company was listed among sponsors for a U.S. Army 250th anniversary parade coinciding with Trump’s birthday. Coinbase said its participation was a one-time contribution to America250, a nonpartisan initiative marking the nation’s semiquincentennial. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also recently visited lawmakers in Washington to discuss crypto regulation as the U.S. government shutdown entered its 31st day. The visit focused on advancing the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act,” aimed at providing clearer crypto market structure rules. While the bill was expected to move forward by late October, the ongoing shutdown has stalled legislative progress, leaving Coinbase’s regulatory ambitions uncertain.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-01 06:01:29

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-the-calm-before-the-xrp-buying-storm-heres-what-is-coming/,"Financial expert Levi Rietveld has emphasized what he describes as a coordinated phase of institutional accumulation behind XRP’s recent market behavior. In a recent post , he analyzed the cryptocurrency’s notable dip to around $1.32 across multiple exchanges, followed by a steady rebound. According to his assessment, this movement was not random but rather part of a larger structural pattern influenced by major financial entities positioning themselves ahead of anticipated regulatory and market developments. Rietveld highlighted that following the sharp liquidation event, institutional investors began purchasing significant quantities of XRP, signaling strong confidence in the asset’s medium-term outlook. He noted that these are not minor participants but large-scale investors managing billions in capital who are strategically preparing for the next phase of XRP’s market cycle. While retail investors have also engaged in the recent rebound, he emphasized that their participation remains modest compared to institutional volumes observed during the accumulation phase.

According to him, these ETF approvals are likely to occur once the current U.S. government shutdown concludes. The initial decision deadline was reportedly set for October 18, but was delayed due to the administrative pause caused by the shutdown. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that approval could take place in November, aligning with the end of governmental interruptions. Rietveld compared the potential impact to what occurred in the Bitcoin market when spot ETFs were introduced, resulting in increased market access and institutional inflows. In his view, the same pattern could emerge for XRP, with regulated investment products opening the door for broader participation from traditional finance. Market Reaction and Broader Outlook The video gained attention among XRP supporters. Many of them are optimistic regarding the potential for an ETF-driven rally. But not all responses aligned with Rietveld’s assertion. One user, identified as PivaTerci, questioned whether XRP’s growth should depend entirely on the reopening of the government. This indicates that political gridlock between parties could prolong the situation and delay ETF decisions. Despite differing opinions, Rietveld’s analysis underscores the growing expectation of institutional involvement as a defining element in XRP’s future price trajectory . His perspective aligns with a broader narrative that major financial actors are preparing for deeper integration of XRP into regulated markets, positioning it for potential long-term growth once policy clarity is achieved.

Sun, founder of TRON, CEO of BitTorrent, and majority shareholder of exchanges HTX (formerly Huobi) and Poloniex, controls a multi-billion dollar fortune with both on-chain and off-chain assets. A comprehensive analysis by analytics platform Arkham Intelligence estimates Sun's net worth to be between $5 billion and $8 billion, based on both his holdings in verified crypto wallets and his holdings on exchanges. A significant portion of Sun's wealth is tied to the cryptocurrency exchanges he owns. HTX, in particular, stands out as a significant factor in Sun's overall wealth. The company's average daily trading volume of $3.4 billion translates to an annual volume of approximately $1.2 trillion. This suggests HTX's market capitalization could be between $6 billion and $10 billion. Given Sun's large stock market holdings, this investment is thought to account for the majority of his wealth. Poloniex, on the other hand, is smaller, with a daily trading volume of around $1 billion and a total value estimated at $150-200 million. According to Arkham's data, Sun's verified on-chain assets exceed $2.1 billion. This portfolio includes approximately $600 million in TRX, $400 million in Bitcoin, and investments in various stablecoins and DeFi protocols. It's also been reported that Sun may be linked to 142 wallet addresses; if these wallets are verified as his, his total wealth could reach much higher levels. Related News: Danger of a “Golden Pocket” in Solana: Analysis Firm Says, “It Shouldn't Fall to This Level” Some sources, notably Bloomberg, estimate Sun's net worth much higher, around $12.5 billion. However, due to the high volatility of crypto asset prices and the lack of transparency surrounding off-chain investments, this estimate is difficult to verify. Sun's wealth is closely tied to the TRON ecosystem, which he founded. The TRON network, which he launched in 2017, stands out among smart contract platforms, while the price performance of the TRX token directly impacts Sun's personal fortune. His purchase of BitTorrent for approximately $140 million in 2018 and subsequent launch of the BTT token are considered other strategic moves to diversify his wealth. Ultimately, while Justin Sun's wealth is well over the billion-dollar mark, it's impossible to provide a definitive figure. While his verified on-chain assets exceed $2 billion, his total net worth is estimated to be between $5 billion and $8 billion, taking into account his holdings on exchanges like HTX and Poloniex, his art collections, and other private investments. *This is not investment advice.

For the first time in seven years, Bitcoin has concluded the month of October with a significant decline, a development that has certainly caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. This Bitcoin October loss , confirmed by data from Coinglass, marks a surprising shift from what has historically been a strong month for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Understanding this rare event is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. Unpacking the Bitcoin October Loss: A Historical Perspective To truly grasp the significance of this recent downturn, it helps to look back. The last time Bitcoin finished October in the red was during the 2018 bear market. Back then, it saw a modest 3.83% dip in October, which unfortunately preceded a much steeper 36% plummet in November. This historical context makes the current Bitcoin October loss particularly noteworthy, as October has traditionally been a period of growth for the digital asset. Historically, October has earned a reputation among crypto enthusiasts as ‘Uptober’ due to its consistent positive performance. Many investors have come to anticipate a bullish trend during this month, often positioning themselves for potential gains. This year’s outcome challenges that long-held perception, prompting a deeper look into the underlying market dynamics. Why Did Bitcoin See an October Loss This Year? Several factors might contribute to this unexpected Bitcoin October loss . Pinpointing a single cause can be challenging, as the cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of global economic trends, regulatory news, and investor sentiment. However, we can identify some key areas that likely played a role: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global inflation concerns and rising interest rates from central banks often lead investors to seek safer, less volatile assets, impacting riskier investments like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions and evolving regulations in major economies can create an atmosphere of caution, causing investors to hold back or even liquidate positions. Profit-Taking: After periods of strong performance in previous months, some investors might have opted to take profits, contributing to selling pressure throughout October. Broader Market Sentiment: A general downturn in traditional financial markets can sometimes spill over into the crypto space, affecting investor confidence across the board. These combined pressures likely created a challenging environment for Bitcoin, leading to its unusual monthly close. What Are the Market Implications of This Bitcoin October Loss? The immediate implication of the Bitcoin October loss is increased market volatility. Investors might experience heightened uncertainty, which can lead to rapid price swings. This sentiment can also extend beyond Bitcoin, potentially influencing altcoins and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, it is also important to consider the long-term perspective. Bitcoin has a history of resilience and recovery following downturns. While short-term fluctuations are part of the market, many analysts view these periods as natural corrections within a larger growth trajectory. This particular October performance serves as a reminder that even established trends can shift, requiring investors to remain adaptable and informed. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights After Bitcoin’s October Loss For investors, understanding how to react to such market movements is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider following the recent Bitcoin October loss : Stay Informed: Keep abreast of global economic news, regulatory updates, and cryptocurrency-specific developments. Knowledge is your most powerful tool. Consider Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes, not just cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by numerous corrections and recoveries. A long-term investment horizon often helps to weather short-term market turbulence. Practice Risk Management: Only invest capital you are prepared to lose. Setting stop-loss orders and having a clear exit strategy can protect your portfolio. By focusing on these strategies, investors can approach the market with greater confidence, even when unexpected events like this occur. In conclusion, the Bitcoin October loss is a rare occurrence, breaking a seven-year streak of positive monthly closes. While it signals a departure from historical patterns and prompts questions about immediate market direction, it also reinforces the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency. For seasoned and new investors alike, this event underscores the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a balanced perspective on market volatility. Bitcoin’s journey is rarely linear, and adapting to its unpredictable path is part of the crypto experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is this Bitcoin October loss a sign of a prolonged bear market? A1: While the Bitcoin October loss is notable, it’s too early to definitively declare a prolonged bear market. Market conditions are constantly evolving, and a single month’s performance does not dictate long-term trends. Many factors influence Bitcoin’s price, and a recovery is always possible. Q2: How does this October loss compare to previous downturns? A2: The last time Bitcoin closed October with a loss was in 2018, during a significant bear market. While the percentage drop this year was less severe than the subsequent November drop in 2018, its rarity makes it a point of interest for historical comparison. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin holdings after this news? A3: Investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor and conduct thorough research rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements like the Bitcoin October loss . Q4: What role do macroeconomic factors play in Bitcoin’s performance? A4: Macroeconomic factors, such as inflation rates, interest rate changes by central banks, and global economic stability, can significantly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets face uncertainty, crypto often experiences correlated movements. Q5: What is ‘Uptober’ and why is this year different? A5: ‘Uptober’ is a colloquial term among crypto investors referring to October’s historical tendency for Bitcoin to show positive price performance. This year is different because Bitcoin, for the first time in seven years, closed October with a loss, breaking this established trend.

However, for those keen on gaining an edge, looking at specific data points like Bitcoin futures long/short ratios offers invaluable insights. These metrics reveal the collective sentiment of traders on major exchanges, providing a glimpse into potential price movements. What Are Bitcoin Futures Long/Short Ratios, and Why Do They Matter? In the dynamic world of crypto, perpetual futures contracts are a popular way to speculate on price without owning the underlying asset. A ‘long’ position bets on a price increase, while a ‘short’ position anticipates a decrease. The long/short ratio, therefore, is a powerful tool. It calculates the proportion of traders holding long positions versus those holding short positions on a given exchange. This ratio is not just a number; it’s a barometer of market sentiment. When the ratio leans heavily towards longs, it suggests a bullish outlook among traders. Conversely, a predominant short ratio indicates bearish sentiment. For active traders, understanding these Bitcoin futures dynamics is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. A Snapshot of Current Bitcoin Futures Sentiment: The Latest Ratios Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour data for Bitcoin futures long/short position ratios across the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges by open interest. This snapshot provides a real-time look at how traders are positioning themselves: Overall: Long 50.18%, Short 49.82% Binance: Long 51.52%, Short 48.48% OKX: Long 50.99%, Short 49.01% Bybit: Long 47.96%, Short 52.04% These figures reveal a fascinating picture. Overall, the market is almost evenly split, with a slight lean towards long positions. However, individual exchanges show distinct patterns, highlighting varying sentiment across platforms. Deciphering the Data: What Do These Bitcoin Futures Ratios Tell Us? At first glance, the overall ratio of 50.18% long to 49.82% short suggests a relatively balanced market, albeit with a marginally bullish tilt. This indicates that while many traders expect a price increase, a significant portion remains cautious, anticipating a potential downturn or hedging against it. On platforms like Binance and OKX, we observe a clearer long bias. This could imply stronger bullish conviction among their user bases. In contrast, Bybit stands out with a noticeable short bias. This divergence might reflect different trading strategies or demographics on Bybit, perhaps more active hedgers or contrarian traders who believe the market is due for a correction. It’s vital to remember that these ratios are snapshots. They provide a moment-in-time perspective and can shift rapidly. While a high long ratio might suggest over-optimism and a potential for a ‘long squeeze,’ a high short ratio could signal excessive pessimism, possibly leading to a ‘short squeeze.’ These insights are invaluable when navigating the volatility of Bitcoin futures . Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Futures Strategy How can you leverage this Bitcoin futures long/short ratio data in your own trading? Firstly, consider it as one piece of a larger puzzle. Don’t rely solely on this metric. Instead, combine it with other key indicators such as funding rates, open interest, and traditional technical analysis. For instance, if you see a high long/short ratio alongside negative funding rates, it could indicate that longs are paying shorts to maintain their positions, suggesting potential weakness despite bullish sentiment. Conversely, a low long/short ratio with positive funding rates might signal a strong bullish conviction. Always remember to manage your risk effectively, as market sentiment can change quickly, especially in the fast-paced crypto environment. Understanding Bitcoin futures long/short ratios is an essential skill for any serious crypto trader. It offers a powerful lens through which to view collective market sentiment, providing context for price movements and potential reversals. While not a standalone predictor, integrating this data into your analysis framework can significantly enhance your decision-making and provide a clearer picture of where the market might be heading. Stay informed, stay strategic, and navigate the crypto seas with confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? A1: Bitcoin perpetual futures are derivatives contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. Q2: How is the long/short ratio calculated? A2: The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or total long volume by total short volume) on an exchange. Q3: Does a high long/short ratio always mean the price will go up? A3: Not necessarily. While it indicates bullish sentiment, an extremely high long ratio can sometimes precede a price correction as the market becomes overextended. Q4: Why do different exchanges have different long/short ratios? A4: Ratios can vary due to differences in user demographics, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and even slight delays in data aggregation. Q5: How often should I check Bitcoin futures long/short ratios? A5: For active traders, checking ratios regularly (e.g., every few hours or daily) is beneficial, as sentiment can shift quickly in volatile markets.

For the third consecutive day, these popular investment vehicles have experienced significant net outflows. On October 31st, a substantial $191.59 million exited Spot Bitcoin ETFs , according to detailed figures from TraderT. This ongoing trend raises crucial questions about investor sentiment and the immediate future of the crypto landscape. What’s Driving the Recent Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? Understanding these movements requires a closer look at individual fund performances. BlackRock’s IBIT, a major player, led the charge with a significant $149.32 million in outflows. This single fund accounted for a large portion of the total withdrawals, indicating a notable shift in investor behavior. BlackRock’s IBIT : Saw the largest outflow at $149.32 million. Ark Invest’s ARKB : Experienced an outflow of $19.30 million. Bitwise’s BITB : Recorded $17.88 million leaving its fund. Fidelity’s FBTC : Noted $11.97 million in net outflows. Interestingly, amidst this sea of red, Grayscale’s GBTC stood out. It was the only fund to attract capital, bringing in a net inflow of $6.88 million. This divergence suggests varying strategies or investor preferences within the broader Spot Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. Such contrasting movements can offer valuable insights into market dynamics. Why Do Spot Bitcoin ETF Movements Matter for Investors? The consistent net outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just numbers; they serve as a crucial indicator of investor sentiment. When large amounts of capital exit these funds, it often signals a decrease in demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated investment products. This can, in turn, put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, affecting the broader market. Moreover, these trends can influence institutional adoption. Many institutional investors utilize Spot Bitcoin ETFs for regulated exposure to the digital asset. Sustained outflows might suggest a cautious approach from these larger players, impacting the overall market narrative. It’s a key barometer for broader market confidence and participation. Understanding these flows helps investors make informed decisions. Observing which funds are gaining or losing traction can provide clues about market leadership and potential shifts in investment strategies. Therefore, monitoring Spot Bitcoin ETFs becomes an essential part of any crypto investor’s toolkit for navigating market complexities. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? The current streak of outflows presents both challenges and potential opportunities. While three consecutive days of net withdrawals might seem concerning, it’s important to view these movements within the larger context of the volatile cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin itself has seen price fluctuations, which can directly influence ETF flows and investor reactions. Looking ahead, several factors could impact the future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Regulatory developments, broader economic conditions, and shifts in global investor appetite for risk assets will all play a significant role. It’s not uncommon for new investment products to experience periods of adjustment as the market matures and finds its equilibrium. For those invested in or considering Spot Bitcoin ETFs , staying informed is key. Diversification and a long-term perspective often prove beneficial in navigating the dynamic world of digital assets. These outflows are a snapshot, not necessarily the entire story of Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The recent $191.59 million net outflow from U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs over three days highlights a period of cautious investor sentiment, particularly with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the withdrawals. While Grayscale’s GBTC saw a small inflow, the overall trend signals a temporary pullback. These movements are vital indicators for understanding market dynamics and institutional interest in Bitcoin. As the market evolves, continuous monitoring of Spot Bitcoin ETFs will remain crucial for investors seeking to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be influenced by various factors, including broader market sentiment, Bitcoin’s price performance, macroeconomic indicators, and investor risk appetite. A consistent outflow often indicates a decrease in demand for the ETF shares. Q3: Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs were most affected by the recent outflows? BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest outflow, followed by Ark Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and Fidelity’s FBTC. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only fund to see a net inflow. Q4: How do Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows impact Bitcoin’s price? Significant outflows from Spot Bitcoin ETFs can signal reduced institutional and retail demand for Bitcoin exposure, potentially contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s market price. Q5: Is Grayscale’s GBTC performing differently? Yes, Grayscale’s GBTC recorded a net inflow, contrasting with the outflows seen in other funds. This could indicate a unique investor base or specific market dynamics affecting GBTC differently.

Barron noted that the XRP Ledger, once dismissed by critics as a “zombie blockchain,” is now being recognized by Forbes as a $180 billion infrastructure leader. Barron’s remarks came in response to the publication’s latest feature on Ripple’s evolution . The report detailed Ripple’s transformation into an infrastructure powerhouse, highlighting its feats and acquisitions, and the growing role of XRP as a core liquidity asset supporting tokenized finance across institutional markets. However, Barron questioned why such recognition arrived only after the company had already achieved significant progress. His message suggested that Forbes may be late in recognizing Ripple’s strategic progress, noting that “isn’t Forbes supposed to predict winners, not report on them after they’ve already won?” Update: @Forbes just discovered that @Ripple went from ""zombie blockchain"" to a $180B infrastructure play. Wait, isn't Forbes supposed to predict winners, not report on them after they've already won? After years in regulatory hell, Ripple is now: Acquiring licensed custody… — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) October 31, 2025 Ripple’s Expanding Institutional Role According to Barron, Ripple has repositioned itself in recent years by acquiring licensed custody and tokenization firms and developing institutional-grade settlement systems. These initiatives strengthen Ripple’s role in providing secure, compliant infrastructure for digital assets. Barron noted that the company is “building institutional-grade settlement rails” and “positioning XRP as plumbing for tokenized finance,” highlighting how XRP’s utility has expanded beyond retail speculation to form part of the underlying structure of financial networks. Ripple’s acquisition strategy signals a long-term plan. By aligning its XRP-powered product offerings with the needs of financial institutions, Ripple has moved closer to becoming a key service provider for institutional payment rails. This shift places XRP at the center of global liquidity operations, giving it a foundation that few other digital assets currently possess. From Regulatory Challenges to Strategic Dominance Barron also alluded to Ripple’s endurance through years of regulatory uncertainty, describing how the company went from “regulatory hell” to one now valued at $180 billion. That history adds weight to its current market standing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the context of financial infrastructure, XRP’s design as a settlement and liquidity asset is gaining renewed relevance. Ripple’s global partnerships and licensing efforts indicate a clear shift toward institutional adoption, supported by its operational clarity following years of legal battles . Recognition from Established Media Barron argued that Forbes is “just documenting the present,” noting that Ripple’s achievements are already established. He said comparing Ripple’s current status to Amazon’s “online bookstore” era understates its scale. He believes Ripple is an institutional infrastructure leader , and not a recovering firm.

In addition to Ripple’s long-term liquidity plan, this event has brought attention to new DeFi initiatives like Remittix (RTX), who are still developing practical payment solutions that are reminiscent of Ripple’s early innovations. With investors searching for the next big altcoin of 2025, the parallel rise of Remittix signals a growing shift toward utility-driven cryptocurrencies. XRP Price Prediction: Market Awaits Impact of Ripple’s $1B Token Unlock Ripple’s upcoming release of $1 billion XRP from its monthly escrow is expected to really impact short-term trading dynamics. Historically, these unlocks have introduced additional liquidity into the market, sparking debate about their effect on price momentum. Currently, XRP is currently trading at $2.53 following a significant gain of about 3.06%, with a market capitalization of $151.68 billion. Analysts tracking XRP suggest the unlock could trigger moderate sell pressure before stabilizing as market absorption takes effect. Others view the event as a reminder of Ripple’s growing influence in the payments sector — a factor that continues to sustain confidence among institutional holders. Institutional Demand and Broader Market Position Despite periodic unlocks, XRP remains one of the top crypto assets by market cap and continues to play a leading role in blockchain-based settlements. Its consistent partnerships with financial institutions have positioned it as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized networks. Market participants are also comparing Ripple’s trajectory to rising DeFi projects that combine cross-border capability with real-world integration — a category now led by Remittix. As attention shifts to crypto with real utility, XRP’s liquidity framework serves as both a precedent and an opportunity for newer entrants innovating on similar principles. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one of the best DeFi projects of 2025, introducing a practical crypto-to-fiat payment network designed for seamless global transfers. The project has raised over $27.7 million in private funding, with 681 million+ tokens sold at a current price of $0.1166 per token. Its early traction shows growing interest from investors seeking crypto solving real-world problems and low gas fee payment systems. CertiK Verified: Ranked #1 globally for pre-launch tokens, ensuring transparency and security. Expanding Wallet Beta: iOS users now joining the Remittix Wallet testing program. CEX Partnerships: Confirmed future listings with BitMart and LBank to boost liquidity. Referral Rewards & Bonuses: Ongoing 50% token bonus and a $250,000 giveaway campaign for community growth. Global Payments Utility: Supports direct crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries. Remittix’s progress highlights why it’s increasingly seen as the next 100x crypto and a low cap gem among early-stage investors. Looking Ahead: Utility Over Hype As Ripple prepares for its next major liquidity event, the XRP price prediction narrative will likely center on how markets absorb new supply and maintain long-term confidence. Yet beyond XRP’s movements, projects like Remittix are redefining what real-world crypto adoption looks like. With strong funding, verified security, and upcoming exchange listings, Remittix is shaping up to be a standout crypto to invest in for 2025. While XRP continues to anchor blockchain-based remittances, RTX’s rapid rise shows how the next generation of digital assets is built — secure, utility-driven, and ready for mass adoption.

The U.S. Treasury’s praise for Singapore’s regulatory leadership and Venezuela’s plan to integrate Bitcoin and stablecoins into its banking system signal a growing institutional embrace of digital assets, a shift that could redefine Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape.

This integration strengthens Bitcoin’s role as a practical hedge in inflation-hit economies and may drive long-term global demand for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Marks 17 Years With First ‘Red October’ Since 2018 As Bitcoin’s white paper turns 17, the world’s largest cryptocurrency faces its first red October in seven years, slipping over 3.5% this month amid a $19 billion market correction. Despite the decline, Bitcoin remains a $2 trillion asset, ranking among the world’s top eight by market value. Published on October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” introduced blockchain and proof-of-work technology, a concept that revolutionized global finance.

Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Triangle Pattern Near Breakout On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading within a descending triangle, confined between resistance near $119,750 and support around $106,375. This compression hints at an imminent breakout. The 20-period EMA continues to cap rallies, while spinning top and Doji candles show indecision among traders. The RSI at 46 suggests neutral momentum but is ticking upward, often a precursor to recovery. A close above $111,675 would confirm a bullish breakout, exposing targets at $116,350 and $119,750. Conversely, a drop below $106,300 could deepen the correction toward $103,500 and $100,250. Trade Setup Summary: Entry: Buy above $111,675 (confirmed breakout) Stop-Loss: Below $106,300 Targets: $116,350 and $119,750 BTC remains coiled within a tightening structure — a decisive breakout in early November could define its next major move toward reclaiming $120K or retesting deeper support.

Investors are closely watching as these investment vehicles experienced a significant third consecutive day of net outflows, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. This trend, amounting to a notable $97.8 million, raises important questions about investor confidence and the immediate future of Ethereum-backed products. What’s Behind the Latest Outflow Trend in Spot Ethereum ETFs? On October 31, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $97.76 million, a figure that translates to approximately 139.8 billion Korean Won. This marked the third straight trading day where more money left these funds than entered, according to data compiled by TraderT. Such a sustained outflow often indicates a cautious approach from investors or a period of profit-taking. Several prominent funds contributed to this significant movement: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the outflows with $38.19 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw $27.12 million exit. Grayscale’s ETHE: Experienced outflows of $13.73 million. Grayscale’s Mini ETH: Contributed $12.07 million to the total. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded $6.65 million in outflows. These figures highlight a broad-based movement across various providers of Spot Ethereum ETFs , rather than an isolated incident with a single fund. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, as they often reflect underlying market sentiment or broader economic pressures. How Do Spot Ethereum ETFs Influence the Broader Crypto Market? The performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs is a key indicator of institutional interest and investor confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. When these funds experience outflows, it can suggest that institutional investors or large retail participants are reducing their exposure to Ethereum, at least in this specific investment vehicle. This can, in turn, create a ripple effect across the wider crypto market. ETFs are designed to offer a regulated and accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the assets. Therefore, their performance is often seen as a barometer for mainstream adoption. While these outflows might seem concerning, it is important to consider them within the context of the overall market. Sometimes, investors reallocate funds to other assets or simply take profits after a period of gains. Moreover, the long-term outlook for Ethereum’s ecosystem, including its scalability upgrades and increasing utility, remains a strong fundamental driver. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Know About Spot Ethereum ETFs? Investing in cryptocurrencies, even through regulated products like Spot Ethereum ETFs , always carries a degree of volatility. For investors, staying informed about market trends and understanding the factors that influence fund flows is paramount. The recent outflows serve as a reminder that even established digital assets can experience periods of price fluctuation and investor hesitation. Key considerations for investors include: Market Analysis: Regularly review market data and expert analysis to understand potential drivers of inflows and outflows. Diversification: Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks associated with single-asset investments. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise and long-term investment theses for Ethereum. Risk Tolerance: Assess your personal risk tolerance before investing in volatile assets. These strategic approaches can help investors make more informed decisions, especially when faced with periods of market uncertainty. The digital asset landscape is dynamic, and continuous learning is the best tool for navigating its complexities. In conclusion, the recent $97.8 million net outflow from Spot Ethereum ETFs over three consecutive days is a significant event for the crypto market. While it reflects a period of caution or profit-taking among investors, it’s crucial to view this trend within the broader context of Ethereum’s strong fundamentals and the evolving landscape of institutional crypto adoption. Investors should remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and consider a diversified approach to navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment product that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of ETH without having to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are outflows from Spot Ethereum ETFs significant? Outflows indicate that more money is being withdrawn from these funds than invested. This can signal a decrease in investor confidence, profit-taking, or a shift in investment strategy, particularly among institutional investors who often use these vehicles. Q3: Which funds saw the largest outflows? BlackRock’s ETHA led the outflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH, Grayscale’s ETHE, Grayscale’s Mini ETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW, indicating a broad trend across major providers. Q4: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will drop? While significant outflows from ETFs can put downward pressure on the underlying asset’s price, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. Many factors influence Ethereum’s price, including overall market sentiment, development updates, and macroeconomic conditions. Outflows are one data point among many. Q5: What should individual investors do in response to these outflows? Individual investors should conduct their own research, assess their risk tolerance, and consider their long-term investment goals. It’s often wise to avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements and instead focus on a well-thought-out investment strategy.

Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracker, recently reported an enormous movement of 273,125,240 USDT from the popular exchange Binance to an unknown wallet. This single transaction, valued at approximately $273 million, has naturally sparked considerable interest and speculation across the digital asset community. Such a substantial USDT transfer often indicates major shifts in the market or significant strategic moves by large holders, commonly known as whales. What Exactly Was This Massive USDT Transfer? Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert detected and reported a colossal movement of stablecoin. Specifically, 273,125,240 Tether (USDT) was transferred out of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The destination? An address that remains unidentified to the public. This substantial sum, equivalent to over a quarter of a billion US dollars, represents a considerable chunk of liquidity and raises immediate questions about its purpose and the entity behind it. Understanding the nature of this USDT transfer is crucial for market observers. Here are the key details of this transaction: Amount: 273,125,240 USDT Origin: Binance Exchange Destination: An unknown wallet address Value: Approximately $273 million USD Source: Reported by Whale Alert Why Do Large USDT Transfers Matter in the Crypto World? Large USDT transfers , especially those involving hundreds of millions of dollars, are often closely watched by investors and analysts alike. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. Therefore, these movements are not typically about price speculation of USDT itself, but rather about what the holder intends to do with such a large sum. A massive outflow from an exchange like Binance can signify several things: Potential Buying Power: The funds might be moved to an over-the-counter (OTC) desk for a large purchase of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, indicating bullish sentiment. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, a transfer to a completely “unknown” wallet suggests a non-exchange controlled destination. Strategic Positioning: A whale might be preparing for a significant market event, moving funds off-exchange to a private wallet for long-term holding or to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Who Could Be Behind This Mystery USDT Transfer? The identity of the recipient of this massive USDT transfer remains a mystery, adding an intriguing layer to the event. While it’s impossible to pinpoint the exact entity without further information, several possibilities are often considered when such large sums move: It could be: An Institutional Investor: Large financial institutions or hedge funds often make substantial moves in the crypto space, often utilizing OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. A High-Net-Worth Individual (Whale): Wealthy individual investors, or “whales,” frequently move large amounts of capital to position themselves for future market movements. Another Exchange or Custodian: Though less likely if the wallet is truly “unknown” and not publicly associated with an entity, it could be a transfer to a new custodial service or another exchange’s cold storage. A Private Fund or Project: Funds raised for new projects or ongoing operations could also account for such a large movement. The lack of public identification for the wallet keeps the crypto community guessing, highlighting the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of Such a USDT Transfer? While a USDT transfer itself doesn’t directly impact the price of USDT, the sheer volume of this transaction could have ripple effects across the broader crypto market. The key impact lies in what the recipient plans to do next. If these funds are intended for buying other cryptocurrencies, it could signal an impending surge in demand, potentially driving up prices. Conversely, if the funds are being moved for reasons unrelated to immediate market purchases, the impact might be more subdued or even neutral. Observing the subsequent movements from this unknown wallet will be critical. If the USDT starts flowing into other exchanges or specific DeFi protocols, it could provide clues about the whale’s intentions and potential market trends. For now, the crypto community is on high alert, watching for any follow-up actions that might shed light on this intriguing $273 million mystery. This event underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. While individual transactions rarely dictate the entire market, a transfer of this magnitude certainly warrants attention and careful analysis from investors and traders. Summary: Unraveling the Mystery of the Massive USDT Transfer The recent $273 million USDT transfer from Binance to an unknown wallet has captured the crypto world’s attention. While the immediate implications are still unfolding, such a substantial movement by a “whale” can often precede significant market activity. Whether it signals institutional buying, strategic positioning, or something else entirely, this transaction highlights the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. Staying informed about these on-chain activities provides valuable context for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Keep an eye on further developments to truly understand the ripple effects of this intriguing event. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is USDT? USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US dollar. This means that 1 USDT is intended to always be worth $1 USD, making it a stable asset often used for trading, transferring value, and hedging against crypto market volatility. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks. It provides real-time alerts on significant movements, helping market participants understand potential whale activity and its implications. Why are large USDT transfers significant? Large USDT transfers are significant because they often signal major moves by wealthy investors or institutions. Since USDT is stable, these transfers usually indicate an intent to buy other cryptocurrencies, rebalance portfolios, or move funds for strategic purposes, rather than speculating on USDT’s price. Does a large USDT transfer always mean a market pump or dump? Not necessarily. While such transfers can precede significant market movements, they don’t guarantee them. The funds could be for long-term holding, moving to a different platform, or even for non-trading purposes. It’s one data point among many that analysts consider. How can I track large crypto transfers? Services like Whale Alert provide real-time updates. Additionally, blockchain explorers for various networks (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum, Tronscan for Tron, BscScan for Binance Smart Chain) allow users to look up specific transactions and wallet addresses.

53893677,618765,1761980438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53893677.jpeg,Michael Saylor Increases Yield On Strategy Shares To Reinforce Multibillion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet,https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-increases-yield-on-strategy-shares/,"Michael Saylor, the chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest corporate Bitcoin (BTC) holding company, is intensifying his multibillion-dollar investment in BTC. In a recent report by Bloomberg, it was revealed that Saylor is increasing the yield on preferred shares, which he has designated as the primary funding source for the company going forward. Investor Confidence Dips During an earnings conference call, Saylor indicated that the company is at a critical juncture. He noted that the multiple of net asset value has been declining over time as the Bitcoin asset class matures and volatility decreases. As part of its latest financial developments, Strategy announced that the yield on its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) will rise by 25 basis points to 10.5% starting in November. On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.8 billion for the quarter, largely attributed to an unrealized gain from its substantial cryptocurrency holdings, which are valued at approximately $70 billion. Despite Bitcoin reaching record highs during the third quarter and many public firms mimicking Saylor’s treasury model established five years ago, investor confidence is waning. Strategy’s shares (MSTR) have plummeted about 45% since reaching a record high last November, diminishing much of the premium the stock previously enjoyed over its Bitcoin assets . Furthermore, demand for the preferred shares has been lukewarm, with recent sales falling short of Saylor’s expectations for significant capital raises. This has led to a slowdown in Bitcoin purchases recently. In response to these challenges, Strategy is exploring international markets for capital and is considering launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by the preferred shares, as outlined by CEO Phong Le during the earnings call. Saylor Open To Strategy Equity Sales Following the release of second-quarter results, Strategy had committed to not issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times its net asset value, except to cover debt interest or preferred dividends . However, Saylor indicated a willingness to opportunistically tap into the market when the premium is favorable, using equity sales to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite attempts to reassure shareholders, the company subsequently issued more common shares, prompting skepticism. Gus Gala, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co., expressed concerns regarding potential dilution, stating that if current sales are executed, the dilution could become substantial. In the latest earnings report, Strategy confirmed that it did not issue shares under its Common Stock ATM Program this month and reiterated its commitment to a disciplined approach in raising funds through equity. The company also adopted new accounting standards in January that require it to include the fair value of its Bitcoin holdings in its earnings reports. This change has resulted in significant fluctuations between profits and losses over the past two quarters, including a loss of approximately $340 million in the same period last year.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-analysis-update-ema-ribbons-rejection-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst STEPHISCRYPTO highlighted a clear technical development on the daily XRP chart: price encountered resistance at the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons and failed to break higher. The analyst’s post was accompanied by a chart that overlays a dense set of short- and medium-term EMAs, showing price touching the upper band of the ribbons and subsequently reversing. On the timeframe presented, this interaction is framed as a rejection at a structurally significant moving-average zone, which the analyst interprets as a cautionary signal for near-term upside momentum. WARNING: $XRP got rejected at the EMA-Ribbons! pic.twitter.com/KC5Kf89UT9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 30, 2025 Chart evidence and interpretation The attached image displays the daily price action with multiple EMAs closely packed as a ribbon. The most recent candles approach the ribbon’s upper boundary before retreating, and the analyst emphasized that this pattern constitutes a rejection rather than a successful breakout. From a technical standpoint, the EMA ribbons in the chart act as a dynamic resistance cluster; the failure to sustain a close above that cluster is read as evidence that sellers retain control at these levels. The analyst’s commentary implies that traders should treat the current structure conservatively until a definitive breakout above the ribbons is confirmed by sustained higher closes and supportive volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market reaction and sentiment Responses to the analyst’s post reflect heightened sensitivity among participants. One commenter suggested the move was the result of manipulation and urged a focus on longer-term objectives while expressing frustration with short-term price action. The reaction underscores a broader tension between traders who emphasize technical levels and holders prioritizing long-term fundamentals. STEPHISCRYPTO’s analysis focuses on the technical facts visible on the chart rather than on social sentiment. However, the captioned image and subsequent replies demonstrate how rapidly technical commentary can intersect with community takes. Advice to traders Based on the analyst’s assessment, the prudent approach for traders is to wait for confirmatory price behavior before assuming renewed upside. Key confirmations would include clear daily closes above the EMA ribbon cluster and evidence of buying volume supportive of a trend change. Conversely, the inability to reclaim and hold the ribbons increases the probability of further consolidation or lower support tests. The analyst’s message is primarily technical: the current price interaction with the EMA ribbons should guide position sizing and risk management decisions until a new structural development alters the technical outlook.

And, it delivered in the first week. Bitcoin’s price, which was already on the rebound in late September, broke past $120,000 and its previous all-time high and set a new record of just over $126,000. But then it all started to go wrong for the entire cryptocurrency market, and BTC was at the forefront of losses, especially on two bloody Fridays. More precisely, the largest digital asset plunged from over $121,000 to $101,000 (on some exchanges) on October 10 and, despite a brief recovery attempt, plummeted again to $104,000 a week later. The month continued with some more positive developments, such as lower-than-expected inflation numbers for September, rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and promising trade deal news on the Washington-Beijing front. These helped BTC recover some ground, but not as much as many expected, and the asset still closed October, a historically highly bullish month, slightly in the red. Is This a Bad Prophecy? With a 3.69% decline in October 2025, BTC broke a six-year streak of green months. Data from CoinGlass shows that the asset charted double-digit gains in five of those previous six Octobers, with the only exception being the bear market in 2022. We need to rewind the clocks to October 2018 to see the previous such month with a price decline, which was quite similar to the 2025 edition. At the time, BTC closed with a 3.83% drop. However, what followed was quite painful and, if history repeats, suggests that BTC could plunge to as low as $70,000 in November. Last time October closed at -3% for $BTC , it was followed by a -36% drop in November pic.twitter.com/eRuW88XPBp — 𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗼𝗽 (@nobrainflip) October 30, 2025 $70K Next? In November 2018, the month after the previous red October, bitcoin’s price plunged by 36.57%. The 2018 bear market was particularly harmful as the cryptocurrency culminated with a dump below $3,000 in December, which also saw a 5% decline. Of course, the landscape now is entirely different. BTC is no longer just a “fake internet coin;” instead, it’s a multi-trillion-dollar behemoth backed by institutions, prominent investors, and even governments. Also, we know that history is not an adequate price prediction tool, but it’s still worth observing given BTC’s movements in the previous November that followed a bloody October.

The lack of confidence is despite efforts by Adobe to integrate rival AI models into its products. Adobe Inc. is trying to prove it can remain a key player in the creative industry as artificial intelligence changes how people make content. The company gathered about 10,000 marketers, filmmakers, and creators at its annual conference this week to highlight how its software is adapting to the AI era. Adobe is attempting to retain investor confidence Many on Wall Street are unsure if Adobe can maintain its dominance as new AI-powered tools make it easier for people to create videos, posters, and graphics without professional software. Citigroup analyst Tyler Radke warned that Adobe is “at risk of structural AI-driven competitive and pricing pressure,” even though the company has a strong strategy. The company’s shares have lost roughly a quarter of their value this year. Other software firms like Salesforce Inc. and Workday Inc.’s stock prices have also struggled. Many of the popular AI tools used for creating videos and images, such as OpenAI’s Sora or Google’s Veo, are made outside Adobe’s ecosystem. Consumer-focused platforms like Canva are also growing in popularity, allowing people to design without needing Adobe’s professional software. Bloomberg’s analyst estimates suggest Adobe’s Digital Media revenue growth will slow over the next few years. Despite this, analysts like Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI described Adobe’s recent move as “another step toward addressing the ‘existential risk’ question” about the effect of generative AI on its business. Adobe’s strategy At the conference in Los Angeles, Adobe introduced several new features aimed at keeping AI-focused creators within its platform. One of the biggest additions is of AI models from competitors like Google and OpenAI into Adobe’s tools, including Photoshop. For years, the company promoted its in-house Firefly AI models, which were trained to avoid copyright issues and offensive content. Firefly has already been used to create more than 29 billion images and other assets since launch. However, Adobe is now also buying access to third-party AI models and offering them directly to its customers. This allows creators to choose between Adobe’s Firefly and external AI systems depending on their needs. Adobe makes about $250 million a year from its AI products, but it says AI helps its business in more ways than that. The company now uses a broader term called “AI-influenced revenue,” which means any money earned with help from AI, such as charging higher prices or keeping more customers. By Adobe’s estimate, AI affects about $5 billion of its yearly revenue. Adobe’s chief technology officer for its creative business, Ely Greenfield, pointed out that many customers use Firefly for commercial projects but turn to other AI models for brainstorming or experimental work. “People are getting more comfortable with the idea that models are trained on a large number of things,” Greenfield said. Jackson Ader from KeyBanc noted that customers at the event were enthusiastic about the expanded AI options. “We welcome the strategy as we have been skeptical of Adobe’s ability to compete on the like-for-like merits of AI image and video generation,” he wrote. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, insisted that his firm’s software remains essential for creators who want professional-quality results, and its stock price struggles are mainly due to investors’ distraction with semiconductor companies and AI model developers.

In an interview, Waller said, “The biggest concern we have right now is the labor market,” he told Larry Kudlow on Fox Business Network. “We know inflation is going to come back down, so this is why I’m still advocating that we cut policy rates in December, because that’s what all the data is telling me to do.” A group of Federal Reserve bank presidents shared their concerns on Friday, October 31, regarding the US central bank’s decision to reduce interest rates this week. Sources pointed out that the situation illustrates disagreement among Fed policymakers, creating difficulties for their chair, Jerome Powell. This is because he is required to find common ground during his final six months in the position. Fed’s disagreement on rate cuts sparks controversy Following the disagreement among Fed policymakers, analysts noted that it is common to have conflicting views on policy, especially when economic data are unclear. However, they argued that the Fed’s move to openly discuss their disagreements and clearly focus on what they should decide at their next meeting, scheduled for December 9-10, was significant. In the meantime, during a banking conference, Lorie Logan, the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, mentioned that she did not see a reason to lower rates this week. Based on her argument, supporting another rate cut will be difficult unless there is clear evidence that inflation will drop faster than expected or the job market will decelerate sharply. The president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Beth Hammack, also weighed in on the situation. At the same conference, Hammack mentioned, “Considering our recent decision, I think we are close to my idea of neutrality: we’re only slightly restrictive if at all.” Although she did not participate in this year’s vote on policy, like Logan, the CEO disagreed with the rate cut this week, and both will have the right to vote next year. Hammack expressed her belief that they need to maintain some level of restriction to help bring inflation back down to their target. On the other hand, Waller, who has a permanent vote and is one of the candidates that US President Donald Trump could choose for Fed chair when Powell’s term ends in May, expressed a very different perspective. According to him, the country’s main current challenge is the job market. Interestingly, both Waller and Logan suggested that Trump’s tariffs are unlikely to lead to a surge in inflation. However, while Waller believes that this backs the idea of rate cuts, Logan expressed her concerns about the increasing costs of services. They also agreed that the absence of official economic data during the government shutdown does not cause the uncertainty Powell talked about earlier this week as a reason to hold off on rate cuts. Waller stresses the importance of further rate cuts Logan mentioned that private-sector figures, state-level unemployment entitlements, and the Fed’s own business and societal surveys give visibility into the state of the economy. She believed these elements support her argument that the job market is not slowing down enough to necessitate the Fed’s intervention, especially because inflation continues to be too high and is taking too long to hit the Fed’s 2% target . “The fog story has to end: it may imply that you need to take it easy, but it doesn’t mean you should stop completely,” Waller said. According to him, it is advisable to exercise caution due to economic uncertainties, but this situation should not prompt policymakers to halt rate cuts; instead, he urges that the best way to handle policy is to continue making cuts.

Analysts Predict 35x Potential by 2027,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-cryptocurrency-to-buy-under-0-05-right-now-analysts-predict-35x-potential-by-2027/,"With Bitcoin stabilizing and the next bull cycle approaching, investors are scanning the market for early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and high upside potential. While most top tokens are already priced far above the $1 mark, analysts say one project under $0.05 could deliver the kind of exponential gains not seen since Solana or Aave’s early days. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol that combines audited smart contracts, yield-based utility, and transparent tokenomics to create one of the most promising crypto launches of 2025. Many experts now call MUTM one of the potential best cryptocurrencies to buy under $0.05, pointing to its rising presale momentum, audited security, and clear path to becoming a live product in just a few months. If current projections hold, analysts estimate that the token could rise up to 35x by 2027, driven by adoption and the rollout of its decentralized lending ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its presale in Phase 6. The price of every token has increased to $0.035 from the initial $0.01. Phase 1 participants already witnessed a 250% token appreciation since early 2025. Price will be increased by nearly 20% moving into stage phase 7 at $0.04 and the launch price is set at $0.06. As of now, the total sales of the tokens are over 785 million, as well as increasing the amount of money raised by over $18 million from the very beginning by 17,600 holders around the world. The succession of each stage is sold quicker than the previous one, as there is increasing confidence in the product and demand. MUTM is not just a presale token. This project is establishing a non-custodial lending and borrowing system that is efficient and transparent in crypto lending. Participants are able to lend assets and get interest with no intermediaries or borrow against holdings directly. The system incorporates decentralized security with true yield potential, something new projects can hardly achieve. V1 Protocol Launch, mtTokens, and Buy-and-Distribute Model The initial significant milestone of Mutuum Finance is the V1 protocol , which will launch into the Sepolia testnet on Q4 2025. It will launch some fundamental infrastructure: a liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens and an automated liquidator bot to stabilize the situation. The design of Mutuum Finance revolves around mtTokens. Users that deposit assets such as ETH or USDT are given an equivalent amount of mtToken plus accrued interest. As an example, providing 1 ETH will result in 1 mtETH, which increases with the repayment of loans by the borrowers. Lenders get passive income that is completely transparent and under smart contracts. Borrowers will either opt to use the variable interest rates or use the stable interest rates. Every loan is over-collateralized and the software automatically sells off the positions that drop below the safety level. This system maintains the solvency and rewarding liquidity providers. The buy-and-distribute mechanism is an important aspect of the Mutuum Finance economy. The purchase of the MUTM tokens in the open market is done by revenue generated through lending. These tokens are redistributed to stakers of mtTokens to create a self-reinforcing cycle that makes the use of tokens dependent on demand. According to analysts, this tokenomics framework can provide MUTM with an advantage against most of its competitors in DeFi at an early stage. The purchasing power is added with every loan sale and this spurs internal growth. According to some valuation estimates, MUTM is predicted to be valued at $0.50 in 2026. Oracles, Layer-2 Expansion and Stablecoin According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance is going to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin that is over-collateralized with ecosystem loans. Minting and burning will ensure that the price does not fluctuate due to off-chain assets that can lead to the failure of the peg. The project intends to use Layer-2 networks after the testnet. It will reduce transaction costs and increase speed, making the platform more affordable to users, a necessary shift in DeFi protocols vying against each other in scalability. The team is planning to adopt a decentralized oracle system, probably beginning with Chainlink, to be able to price all of its supported assets correctly in real-time. Trustworthy oracle data will avoid unwarranted liquidations and fallback. Many analysts think that such integrations will drive the protocol usage to large proportions and hence push the demand of MUTM via the buy-distribute model. This scalability and revenue connection imply Mutuum Finance among the potential best projects in DeFi to follow. Analysts estimate that MUTM may fetch between $1.00 and $1.20 two years into the market, 35x more than its current presale price should it be adopted successfully. It would put it in the same growth path as early-stage giants such as Solana and Aave. Final Outlook Mutuum Finance is currently $0.05, which has earned people’s attention due to well-developed tokenomics, rigorous security audits, and an established product vision that facilitates long-term expansion. Mutuum Finance can enter a rich DeFi ecosystem right at the start, where every transaction causes the demand to rise on the tokens. The project is rapidly achieving milestones as Phase 6 becomes fully allocated, and the V1 protocol becomes operational in the fourth quarter of 2025. Considering predictions of analysts that a 35x increase over the next couple of years may occur, Mutuum finance is possibly one of the new success stories of DeFi.

Tether’s direct and indirect exposure to U.S. government debt reached an all-time high of about $135 billion, as the firm catapulted ahead of countries such as South Korea to become the 17th largest holder of Treasuries globally. In its press release, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief executive, stated, “Q3 2025 results reflect the continued trust and strength behind Tether, even amid a global challenging macroeconomic environment, reinforcing Tether’s brand as the ‘Stable Company’,” He added that the company’s record exposure to U.S. Treasuries and its disciplined growth “position Tether as a pillar of stability in the financial and tech ecosystem.” Tether diversifies reserves with BTC, gold Tether reportedly held $12.9 billion in gold and $9.9 billion in Bitcoin, both of which represent roughly 13% of total reserves. The company also issued a record number of new USDT tokens worth over $17 billion in the third quarter alone, and this brought the total circulating supply to more than $174 billion. Tether stated that it now serves over 500 million users globally. Its growing user base and issuance figures further entrench USDT’s dominance over other stablecoins such as USDC and USDe, among others, consolidating Tether’s role as the leading digital dollar of the crypto economy. In October, Tether completed a settlement with bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network using its proprietary investment capital, without affecting reserves backing issued tokens, which have since surpassed $183 billion in circulation. It has also launched a share buyback initiative, signaling a new phase in corporate structuring aimed at attracting institutional investors through a private placement. Tether Holdings, the group’s parent entity, has applied for an Investment Fund License in El Salvador under the country’s new Private Alternative Investment Fund law. Tether also has other investments in artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and communications infrastructure through its subsidiaries Tether Holdings and Tether Investments, and they are not included in the reserves backing USDT.

Remember when Ethereum hit a high of around $4K after a sweltering 56% rally in July? Three months later, Ethereum finds itself hovering around the same price level, sparking speculation over whether we could be heading into a deep consolidation zone or possibly even a downtrend. Amid this uncertainty, institutional investors are making the most of the dip to beef up their Ethereum holdings. Bitmine, easily the biggest Ethereum holder globally, has reportedly added another 44,036 $ETH ($166M) to its kitty, according to blockchain analytics platform LookOnChain. This now brings the firm’s total Ethereum holdings to over 3.3M $ETH, currently valued at more than $12.7B. Also, this isn’t Bitmine’s only purchase during Ethereum’s current downtrend. Just over 10 days ago, the firm scooped up $250M worth of Ethereum . Ethereum Price Prediction: Long-Term Bullish Picture Remains Intact So, what is Tom Lee seeing that retail investors are not? For one, Ethereum currently appears to be finding strong support at the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Even more important is the fact that the last time this happened, $ETH spent nearly two months consolidating around the 200 EMA before triggering a 100% rally. Going by this alone, we could be in for another month of consolidation before a new rally ensues. Additionally, the token is currently retesting an important breakout zone – a former resistance turned support level that it broke out of during its August rally. This particular zone, around the $4K mark, has been one of Ethereum’s most important levels recently. Most notably, it sparked a nearly 70% downtrend in December last year. All in all, even though Ethereum’s current choppy price action looks sheepish, its long-term bullish picture remains firmly intact. This, in fact, means now’s the best to load up on low-cap, high-upside tokens. Here are our top three suggestions for the best altcoins to buy now . 1. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Exciting Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Offering Real Rewards Currently available at just $0.0011272, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is one of the best cheap cryptos to buy right now. What makes it even more attractive is its potential to churn out life-changing returns. According to our PepeNode price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $642 by the end of 2026, as the token could hit a high of $0.0072. What is PepeNode, you ask? It’s a unique mine-to-earn cryptocurrency project that makes crypto mining accessible to everyday users, while also offering them real rewards in return. Simply put, you get an empty virtual server room as soon as you become a $PEPENODE holder . From there, your job is to stack the room with the most optimal combination of mining nodes. The trick is to experiment with different meme nodes, as each one has its own characteristics, mining capabilities, and compatibility with other nodes. Getting this combination right is absolutely crucial if you want to maximize your earnings from PepeNode’s gamified mining ecosystem. Then, once PepeNode’s TGE (Token Generation Event) is complete and its virtual mining simulator goes live, the top players on the leaderboard will receive free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens as rewards. Given that it offers a low-cost, user-friendly way to engage in crypto mining – albeit virtual – it’s no surprise PepeNode has already pulled in over $2M in its presale. Join the PepeNode presale today – and be part of the biggest virtual crypto mining platform. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Viral Doge-Themed Meme Coin Eyeing 1000x Returns If you’ve watched Dogecoin struggle to rally to new highs and wondered if this is the end of dog-themed meme coins, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is here to give you some hope. With over $3.8M already raised in its ongoing presale, $MAXI is in a strong position to become the next 1000x crypto . According to our $MAXI price prediction , it could hit a high of $0.0058 by the end of 2026, giving early adopters a mind-boggling 2,000% return on their investment. Take a look at our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MAXI for just $0.000266 . What is Maxi Doge ? On the surface, he’s a furious Shiba Inu out for revenge on his distant cousin, Dogecoin. Under the hood, though, his insatiable desire for revenge stems from an emotional backstory – one where Dogecoin hogged all the limelight, leaving Maxi to grow up in loneliness. That’s when Maxi decided to hit the gym, bulk up, and inject his veins not just with protein shakes, but with the charts themselves, preparing to become the ultimate meme coin for degen investors. Looking ahead, $MAXI plans to dominate the space through its masterfully crafted tokenomics, which allocates 40% of its total token supply to marketing. This includes PR pushes, influencer collaborations, and social media campaigns, as well as holder-exclusive benefits such as weekly trading events and leaderboard prizes. On top of that, $MAXI also plans to list on futures platforms, positioning itself right alongside Dogecoin as the perfect gateway for meme coin traders seeking liquid markets, leveraged bets, and life-changing returns. Join the next big ‘dawg’ in its journey to 1000x – buy $MAXI tokens today! 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Donald Trump’s Meme Coin Surges Again Donald Trump’s popularity among crypto investors is on the rise again, evident from the recent surge in his official meme coin, OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) . The token is up nearly 32% this week after finding strong support around the $5.7 mark. Most importantly, $TRUMP has now broken out of a long-standing downward sloping resistance line, one that had capped its momentum since February. According to this trading pattern, if the token holds its breakout, we could see a sharp move toward $24.5 – a massive 200% gain from current levels. On the fundamentals side, the biggest reason behind this surge could be Trump’s recent warming up to China and efforts to bring the U.S. closer to a trade deal – a move that could ease tensions across not just crypto but also global stock markets. Furthermore, Trump’s pro-crypto stance continues. Most recently, he even pardoned Binance’s founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao , calling his prosecution an ‘overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,’ and ‘a war on cryptocurrency.’ Interested? Buy $TRUMP on Binance or any of the other crypto exchanges. Recap : With Ethereum likely consolidating before potentially finding renewed momentum, now could be the perfect time to hit a home run by scooping up low-cap gems like PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP). Disclaimer : Please do your own research before investing in crypto. It’s a highly volatile market, and this article is not financial advice.

This single deal dramatically boosted the month’s overall crypto fundraising figures. But what exactly is Polymarket?

If so, there will likely be a shift in investors’ interest. This is because a handful of smaller altcoins, including Algorand, Floki Inu, and Remittix , are being highlighted as possible alternative picks, thanks to their lower cap and higher reward. For those willing to embrace risk and a long-term horizon, this altcoin chapter might just be beginning, and these three represent distinct angles in that story. Let’s quickly flesh out the details of how they might all play out over the coming weeks. Why Bitcoin May Be Running Out of Steam Multiple sources now argue that BTC could be nearing a short-term ceiling. For instance, analysts at VanEck maintain a forecast near $180,000, but also note that derivative indicators (such as CME basis rates) suggest speculative extremes already. What this implies is: for many investors, the question isn’t just “how high can BTC go?” but also “what if this is as far as the rally goes before rotation?” If BTC peaks near $133K, capital may begin to rotate out of the king coin and into altcoins, setting the stage for the next act. Altcoins in Focus: ALGO, FLOKI & RTX Algorand: Although most investors overlook it, the token’s fundamentals appear to be gaining attention. Its staking participation recently hit around 67%, up 121% year-over-year. Some bullish modelling puts ALGO’s 2025 range much higher than its current price, though most forecasts are modest ($0.17-$0.33) for the near term. Floki Inu: For those willing to risk more of their portfolio on meme tokens, recent technical commentary highlights a breakout setup in Floki near $0.00008, following a period of consolidation. While conventional models are far from 2,000% gains, the market dynamic (if altcoins heat up) could see exaggerated moves for a token with a low base price. Remittix: And then there’s Remittix. Built as a payment-infrastructure token enabling crypto-to-fiat global transfers, supporting bank-account payouts in multiple currencies. In a scenario where BTC stalls, utility-driven altcoins like RTX may attract capital under the real-world use case theme. With execution and listings still ahead, this kind of altcoin could see outsized gains relative to BTC. Why this Matters Right Now If Bitcoin peaks or stalls, we may see capital rotation from large-cap ‘safe bets’ into altcoins, especially those with lower valuations or clear utility. In that scenario, altcoins like ALGO, FLOKI, and RTX become more appealing. For example, if BTC’s rally is capped and growth flows begin seeking higher-beta assets, returns of 2 000% or more for certain altcoins aren’t impossible (though highly speculative). That potential is greater when the base price is low (e.g., FLOKI) or when utility is strong and valuations modest (e.g., RTX). Is BTC done for now? If yes, which altcoins could benefit most from the next leg? That’s the lens through which ALGO, FLOKI and RTX should be viewed.

What Happened At MEXC? Market analyst J.A. Maartun was among the first to draw attention to the situation, sharing a chart on social media that indicated a significant spike in withdrawal transactions around midday. Researcher Hanzo also shed light on the unfolding drama, revealing the plight of a user known as “The White Whale.” This individual claimed that his account was suspended despite engaging in trading without the use of bots or APIs, leaving him unable to access his funds, which he estimated at between $3 million and $5 million. The White Whale alleged that customer support was unresponsive and that when he engaged with Cecilia Hsueh, MEXC’s new Chief Strategy Officer, he was pressured to admit to breaking the rules to have his funds released, a claim he firmly denied. Related Reading: Coinbase, Strategy Mark Major Profit Surges In Q3: Unveiling The Numbers Cecilia later responded that their conversation should have remained private and accused The White Whale of misrepresenting the facts. MEXC subsequently announced its intention to take legal action against him for alleged misinformation. However, as the situation escalated, a wave of support emerged from the cryptocurrency community, including notable figures like ZachXBT, as many users reported similar issues with MEXC. This collective response led to warnings on social media urging users to withdraw their funds immediately, fueling the growing unrest. CSO Issues Apology In a rapid development, Cecilia issued an apology and confirmed that The White Whale’s withdrawal had been processed. She stated: We fucked up. We apologize to @TheWhiteWhaleV2, and his money is already released. He can claim it at any time. I messed up in communicating with him. I got emotional, and I shouldn’t have. Since I joined MEXC 2 months ago I’ve been fighting behind the scenes to get MEXC to change. We grew really fast—a few years ago, we were a very small exchange, but given our current scale, our risk, operations, and PR teams have not kept up. She noted that MEXC has experienced rapid growth, but its operational and public relations teams had struggled to keep pace. “We’re going to change that,” she stated, emphasizing that leadership has begun to recognize the need for improvement in transparency and operations. Related Reading: dYdX Eyes US Market Entry: Decentralized Crypto Exchange Plans Year-End Debut, Reuters In response to the swirling rumors of bankruptcy, MEXC took to social media to clarify its financial status. The exchange stated, “Recent online discussions have circulated unverified rumors regarding MEXC’s financial status. We would like to clearly state that these claims are false and misleading.” They assured users that MEXC remains financially healthy, with all user assets fully backed.

Here’s what has usually followed this trend in the last two months. Ethereum Funding Rate Suggests Traders Are Now Bearish As explained by analytics firm Santiment in a new post on X, shorts are dominating the Ethereum derivatives market now. The indicator of relevance here is the “ Funding Rate ,” which measures the amount of periodic fee that traders are exchanging between each other on the various derivatives platforms. When the value of this metric is positive, it means long holders are paying a premium to those with short bets in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is dominant. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the derivatives traders as a whole may be holding a bearish mentality as short positions outweigh the long ones. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Ethereum Funding Rate across all exchanges over the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Funding Rate has witnessed a decline into the negative zone recently, which implies derivatives market balance has shifted toward bearish positions. The market sentiment turning red, however, may not actually be a negative for the cryptocurrency’s price. In the chart, the analytics firm has highlighted the pattern that the asset has followed with this metric during the past two months. It would appear that ETH has tended to go against the Funding Rate in this window. That is, a notable positive level has led into price corrections, while a negative one into price rebounds. The explanation behind the trend may lie in the fact that the dominant side of the market is more likely to get entangled in a liquidation squeeze . Such an event tends to be violent, involving a cascade of liquidations that feeds back into price volatility. While the Ethereum Funding Rate has turned red, its value is still not as negative as some of the previous lows that resulted in short squeezes, so it only remains to be seen whether one will follow this time. In some other news, Ethereum saw significant net exchange outflows of about $643 million over the past week, as revealed by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora in an X post . Bitcoin saw even greater exchange withdrawals of more than $2 billion. “This is a strong bullish signal despite market uncertainty, as investors are moving coins into self-custody for long-term holding,” explained Sentora.

His point was clear to those following the market closely. XRP is not in disarray, and the available data supports that view. Hey guys bad news. I just found out we’re in shambles right now. $XRP I didn’t know that, but disappointed to learn. https://t.co/FocHR2JApX — Moon Lambo (@MoonLamboio) October 31, 2025 What’s Happening to XRP? On October 30, XRP was hit with major decline , hitting its lowest point in almost a week. However, this decline was short-lived. The digital asset briefly dipped below BNB due to this decline, but its rebound has pushed it up. With a margin between the assets now exceeding $2 billion, XRP is now the fourth-largest digital asset. The recovery came amid renewed optimism surrounding institutional products tied to XRP, particularly the progress of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF . Its debut marks a milestone for XRP, aligning it more closely with mainstream financial infrastructure. Additional spot ETF filings currently under SEC review further contribute to the anticipation that institutional adoption could accelerate in the months ahead. Market Position and Recovery XRP’s return above BNB demonstrates its sustained investor support and the strength of the XRP army. The recovery reflects confidence in its liquidity, established network utility, and expanding institutional interest . Despite fluctuations typical of the crypto market, XRP’s stability in recent sessions has contrasted with the volatility affecting several top assets. This rebound follows a period of increased skepticism from segments of the crypto community, which often interprets short-term movements as long-term shifts. However, XRP’s trading data shows the opposite trend.

XRP has also seen consistent market engagement, and many in the community joined Moon Lambo to mock the idea of the XRP army being in shambles. What to Expect from XRP Moon Lambo’s post highlighted the disconnection between social media narratives and actual market conditions. Far from being in shambles, XRP’s metrics and institutional progress show the network is regaining momentum. With its price recovery, strengthened market rank, and growing ETF exposure, XRP’s position remains stable. The sarcastic tone of Moon Lambo’s post serves as a reminder that sentiment on social platforms often diverges from real performance, and XRP appears firmly back on track for another uptrend .

Peterson noted that Bitcoin's price action over the past four months has been highly similar to that of 2011, 2014, 2018, and 2022. The analyst said the sharp declines experienced in November during these years indicate a historically recurring “seasonal risk.” “The price action is 91%, 90%, 92%, and 82% correlated with previous years,” Peterson said. “In most of these periods, Bitcoin experienced heavy losses in November.” The analyst specifically highlighted the period around November 8th, stating that Bitcoin has historically experienced declines around this date, coinciding with the “30th percentile price path.” He also argued that the second and third weeks of November have been challenging for Bitcoin over the past four years, and that this is no coincidence. Related News: Tron Founder Justin Sun's Net Worth Revealed Peterson said that downside risk is not only associated with technical but also macroeconomic factors: “Mid-November is the period when companies announce their third-quarter earnings and revised earnings expectations for next year. Lowering expectations usually leads to a flight from risky assets, and this is reflected in Bitcoin.” The analyst also highlighted significant past events. The 2018 crypto winter began in November, and the FTX crash occurred on November 8, 2022. The first signs of the Mt. Gox scandal also emerged in November 2013. “Markets have been jittery in recent weeks, with the VIX rising and stocks selling off sharply in the face of weak earnings. It appears the market is looking for a sell signal,” Peterson concluded. *This is not investment advice.
