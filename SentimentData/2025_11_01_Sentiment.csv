The image quickly made the rounds, until blockchain analysts stepped in and tore it apart. The Viral Claim The screenshot showed what looked like a massive sell-off: CZ supposedly dumping 35 million $ASTER tokens from his personal wallet. The timing? “This morning,” according to the image. Except… it never happened. The screenshot used real Binance hot wallet transactions from the past week but with a doctored timestamp. The image editor swapped out Binance’s official wallet address, 0x8894E0a0c962CB723c1976a4421c95949bE2D4E3, for a fake “CZ wallet.” That small change made it look like the transfers came directly from CZ himself. JUST IN: CZ Linked Wallet sells 35,000,000 $ASTER worth $30.42 million. pic.twitter.com/6rqiOWHCFJ — Farzad (@FarzadXBT) October 30, 2025 Analysts Call It Out Blockchain analysts @EmberCN and @lookonchain were quick to fact-check the claim, and their findings were clear. “It says here that CZ sold 35 million $ASTER, but I checked the on-chain data. There are no corresponding transfers as mentioned,” EmberCN wrote. The supposed “CZ sell” transactions? They actually corresponded to internal Binance hot wallet movements, not personal transfers. 这里说 CZ 出售了 3500 万枚 $ASTER ，不过我看了下链上数据，并没有他提到的对应链上转移。 对应到他提到的这三笔 $ASTER 转移，实际是币安热钱包之间的互转。有人把 0x889 这个币安热钱包 P 成了 CZ 的钱包。 https://t.co/IoGcVqpMOr 这里把数量设置 1000 万枚以上，就可以看到。 本文由… https://t.co/zROC2PRKAk pic.twitter.com/T6qvhw4iJg — 余烬 (@EmberCN) October 31, 2025 “Someone mistook the Binance wallet 0x889 for CZ’s wallet,” confirmed Lookonchain. Fake news! The 31.84M $ASTER ($34.53M) transfer was between #Binance hot wallets and has nothing to do with CZ( @cz_binance )'s wallet. https://t.co/mRGs56gItF pic.twitter.com/BZbBm1H3EA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 31, 2025 CZ didn’t waste time addressing the rumor. In his typical direct tone, he jumped on X to shut it down: “Fake news. Please unfollow people who spread this nonsense.” That’s about as clear as it gets. 4. Fake news! Unfollow the guys posting fake news. pic.twitter.com/Os8dF0dSjh — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) October 31, 2025 The Real Aster Update While FUD spread on social media, the Aster team dropped a genuine update, one that had nothing to do with CZ but could have a real impact on $ASTER’s tokenomics. In a statement, Aster announced refinements to its ongoing buyback and airdrop model as part of its effort to strengthen long-term value. Here’s the breakdown: 50% of all buybacks (S2 and S3) in the public buyback address will be burned, permanently reducing supply and reinforcing $ASTER’s market strength. The remaining 50% will move back to the locked airdrop address, effectively reducing circulating supply and allowing more allocation for future airdrops. This means more rewards for long-term holders and genuine Aster users, and less supply pressure overall. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance Aster’s token economy, we’re refining the S3 buyback and airdrop model to deliver stronger, long-term value for both users and holders: • 50% of all buybacks, including S2 and S3, in the public buyback address will be burned — reducing… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) October 31, 2025 Behind the Buyback Strategy Aster has been executing its S3 buyback plan, which focuses on strengthening its token economy after the earlier S2 round. The goal is straightforward, make $ASTER more sustainable by balancing deflationary burns with community-focused airdrops. The 50-50 split model ensures that half the tokens get permanently removed from circulation, while the rest go toward rewarding loyal users who hold and stake $ASTER. This approach not only enhances liquidity control but also creates a more resilient long-term ecosystem, especially in times of heightened speculation and fake news. Market Reactions Despite the false sell-off rumor, $ASTER remained relatively stable in trading. According to CoinMarketCap data, $ASTER was trading below $1 following the sell off saga, as investors realized the “CZ sell” story was a hoax, price is slightly recovering. The quick debunk from major analysts and the transparency from Aster’s team helped cool the panic. Still, the incident served as a reminder of how easily misinformation spreads in the fast-paced world of crypto. Lessons from the Chaos This episode highlights a growing issue in the industry, fake on-chain screenshots. With tools like Photoshop and basic blockchain explorers, anyone can craft a convincing “leak.” But as this case showed, on-chain truth always wins when verified by reputable trackers like Lookonchain and EmberCN. It also showed CZ’s consistent stance on transparency. Whether it’s a market rumor or an exchange controversy, his first response is to call out fake narratives directly, not let them fester. For Aster, the timing might have been inconvenient, but the fundamentals speak louder than FUD. With its evolving buyback and burn system, Aster is doubling down on its mission, to reward loyal holders and maintain long-term value stability. As the crypto space matures, such mechanisms, along with fast-acting transparency from leaders, are what separate real projects from noise. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The DeFi platform has raised a staggering $18,250,000 in funds from 17,600 investors, a 250% hike from its original price of $0.01 in Phase 1 of its presale, making MUTM the best crypto to invest in this season to achieve profits in the world of altcoins. Its phased investment strategy has enticed all investors to its side as it unlocks greater profits preceding its entrance priced at $0.06 that holds a promise of a whopping 400% return. But with 2026 on the horizon, will its price tags reach new milestones? Researchers have forecast its level to touch $1.50 come mid-year as it rides dual-market returns amidst market incentives. Presale Stages Fast-Track Investor Influx Mutuum Finance has designed its presale carefully to ensure that all investors are restricted in their allocations and that prices keep rising. Stage 6 is priced at $0.035 and has actually jumped an impressive 80% to near selling out. The number of investors sitting on a total of 17,600 has injected a total of $18,250,000 through this level and has witnessed its holdings increase a whopping 250% since its inception price of $0.01. Moreover, Mutuum Finance has kick-started the involvement through a 24-hour leaderboard system that rewards the top depositor with a prize of $500 in MUTM in a day, as long as one transaction is made before the 00:00 reset. This activity-igniting strategy has brought vitality to the pre-sale event that has turned a normal buying process into a winning experience for 17,600 token holders. Stories have emerged of how people have caught a bonus boost that cushions their holdings. In a field that is rife with passive holdings, this is a welcome respite that forces investors to think that MUTM is not only a high-quality investment platform but is a quick pulse on this vibrant defi crypto community. The scorching speed of Phase 6 leaves late bloomers grasping for air; with only 80% left and the 400% prize in sight, the $0.035 window opens and closes in a hurry to sentence latecomers to the steeper price point of Phase 7’s $0.04. To think of missing out on this opportunity while your 17,600 friends pocket 400% while you take out overpriced tickets. Money amounts reach $18,250,000. Giveaway Ignites Broader Appeal Mutuum Finance has brought some level of incentivization to this process with a prize giveaway worth $100,000 . The project has reserved MUTM tokens worth $10,000 for each of the 10 winners to take advantage of this presale frenzy. The reaction to this giveaway has not only contributed to its large number of members that stand at 17,600 but has even lifted moods as winners share their profits daily. Thus, promotions have added layers of bliss to functionality to make MUTM appear vibrant and very lucrative for beginners searching for top-notch opportunities in altcoin data. Professionals associate winning streaks with continued rally projections in 2026 due to passion for the token within communities. Yield Mechanisms Propel 2026 Targets Mutuum Finance has aggregated its platform with peer-to-peer lending contracts that auto-generate interest for ETH and USDT. The refunds are in mtTokens as a claim to capital and interest. The borrowers have unfettered access to this common reservoir. Peer-to-peer lending facilitates bespoke lending for specialized tokens. Mutuum Finance has set itself up for explosive growth as more and more people are tempted by lending that operates in the background but increases like compound interest. As of mid-2026, projections place MUTM’s price at $1.50 with a whopping 4200% surge from presale value, undergirded by DeFi’s 40% compound growth and V1’s release of its testnet in Q4 2025. The thinking is informed by security audits–CeriK level 90/100 and a bug bounty reward of a substantial $50,000—and serves as a protective imperative in its own right as its precursor, AAVE in 2020-2021. That asset initially dropped to a mere $26.03 in November 2020 but rocketed to a high of $665 in May 2021 in a mere six months as its lending platform garnered intense hype, registering a 2450% RO1 simply on lending platform hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has coupled its presale ingenuity with yield ingenuity to project a 2026 path to $1.50 in value and has outperformed stagnating altcoins through rightful DeFi activity. Strike this presale pulse—together with 17,600 members in Phase 6—acquire tokens for $0.035 and propel towards 400% returns that reshape your portfolio.

53879101,618005,1761948013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53879101.jpeg,Pundit Breaks Down The XRP Ledger: What To Know About How It Works,https://bitcoinist.com/what-to-know-about-xrp-ledger/,"A lively discussion about XRP’s true purpose and utility erupted on X after prominent crypto analyst Scott Melker posed a sincere question to his 1 million followers: what exactly is the current pitch for XRP? The token itself, not Ripple the company. His inquiry attracted different responses from both supporters and industry commentators on detailed explanations of how the XRP Ledger functions and what role XRP plays within it. The conversation drew in notable voices, including Santiago Velez and David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer. How The XRP Ledger Works And The Role Of Rippling In his detailed response , crypto commentator Santiago Velez explained that XRP serves several foundational functions within the Ledger. At its core, the Ledger uses the token to prevent spam and distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. Each transaction carries a small fee denominated in XRP to deter network abuse. However, its utility extends far beyond that technical safeguard. Velez also noted that XRP was designed to facilitate a process known as rippling, which allows users to exchange equivalent tokens under the same currency code through an intermediary account. This mechanism was central to the Ledger’s early design and was part of the system’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), the first of its kind in crypto history. As such, the token operates as a bridge currency that allows easy inter-currency pathfinding without relying on intermediaries or centralized issuers. According to Velez, no other large Layer-1 blockchain is built with this specific function in mind, apart from Stellar, which originated as a fork of XRP. Questions On The Long-Term Value Of The Altcoin After receiving the explanation, Melker acknowledged the Ledger’s technical sophistication, calling it an elegant and forward-thinking design that was far ahead of its time. He praised its built-in features, such as the anti-spam mechanism, native DEX, and neutral bridge function, noting that these innovations solved real-world problems in settlement and cross-border payments long before many of today’s leading blockchains were created. However, Melker posed another question about the token’s long-term economic sustainability: whether these design strengths translate into lasting demand for the token itself. He pointed out that while the ledger’s features serve technical purposes, they do not necessarily guarantee consistent price appreciation. In his view, spam prevention does not generate token demand. Pathfinding may bypass the altcoin in some cases, and stablecoins’ stability and simplicity have become more appealing to institutions than XRP. This opens the question of whether it is adopted anywhere near the scale that it’s being promoted. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, later joined the conversation to provide his perspective on the token’s value. He noted that the Ledger offers something no other blockchain can, which is an open system where users can act as their own banks, free from middlemen like stablecoin issuers that can tax transactions. According to Schwartz, the altcoin’s special place on the Ledger ensures that it captures some of the value generated by network transactions. As the only non-IOU asset accessible to every account worldwide, the asset holds a unique status that protects it from default, freezing, or clawback risks.",XRP|David Schwartz|DDos Attacks|Decentralized Exchange|Denial-of-service|DEX|ripple|ripple news|Santiago Velez|Scott Melker|stablecoin|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 22:00:13

All Signs Point to the Noomez ($NNZ) Presale,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-will-boom-in-2025-all-signs-point-to-the-noomez/,"In a year packed with speculation, one question dominates every crypto forum: Which crypto will boom in 2025? As investors scan the horizon for the next breakout coin, a new name is quietly gathering energy, $NNZ , the deflationary meme coin built on story, stages, and the power of the Noom Engine. While others chase hype, $NNZ is crafting a universe that unites holders through lore, token burns, and transparent presale mechanics. It’s more than a meme, it’s a movement. As 2025 approaches, the Noomverse is coming alive one stage at a time. Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025 and Why $NNZ Leads the Race Crypto analysts agree that 2025 could mark the beginning of the next major bull cycle. Yet, among the countless meme coins and utility tokens, $NNZ meme coin presale stands out for three key reasons: innovation, transparency, and community-driven growth. The Noom Engine gives $NNZ lasting utility; new projects can join its ecosystem, paying tribute to $NNZ holders through automatic token rewards. Meanwhile, its deflationary tokenomics ensure scarcity, with unsold tokens burned after each presale stage. And unlike typical short-term hype coins, $NNZ’s storytelling framework builds emotional engagement, transforming holders into “Noomies,” loyal participants in a growing universe. Understanding $NNZ’s Lunar Momentum As investors ask which crypto will boom next , $NNZ’s mechanics offer a compelling answer. The project’s design isn’t just creative, it’s strategic. 1. The Noom Gauge A glowing energy meter is divided into 28 segments, each representing a presale stage. With every stage completed, one segment lights up, signaling progress toward launch. 2. The Stage X Million Airdrop At the close of each presale stage, one lucky wallet wins a number of $NNZ tokens equal to the stage number (e.g., Stage 14 → 14M $NNZ). 3. The Noom Vault Hidden surprises await at Stage 14 and Stage 28, including massive airdrops, NFT rewards, and even strategic token burns. Together, these mechanisms keep $NNZ’s community engaged, energized, and eager for the next milestone, fueling organic buzz long before official launch day. Experts Eye $NNZ’s Deflationary Power Crypto watchers’ 2025 predictions highlight that deflationary coins with strong community roots often outperform pure speculation tokens. $NNZ fits this mold perfectly. Its fixed 280B supply , regular token burns , and locked liquidity create a stable foundation for growth. Add to that an audited contract, a KYC-verified team, and a transparent presale structure, and $NNZ’s credibility stands tall in a crowded market. For many, this combination signals not just a meme, but a movement poised for long-term success. What Crypto Will Boom in the Next 5 Years? $NNZ’s Vision Beyond 2025 For those wondering which crypto will boom in next 5 years , $NNZ delivers a clear, sustainable roadmap built for growth and longevity. Here’s how it stands apart: The Noom Engine Ecosystem: Every new partner project that joins the Noomverse contributes back to $NNZ holders. A portion of their tokens is distributed automatically; no staking or manual claiming is required. Automatic Holder Rewards: All $NNZ holders benefit from the Noom Engine’s token drops. Simply holding $NNZ qualifies you for future ecosystem rewards. Optional Staking Bonuses: While staking isn’t required, participants who do gain access to boosted yields, exclusive NFTs, and bonus multipliers — rewarding long-term loyalty. Deflationary Supply Model: With a fixed supply of 280 billion $NNZ and continuous token burns, scarcity grows over time, supporting steady price appreciation potential. Evolving Utility and Story: The $NNZ roadmap expands with each stage of the Noomverse, weaving together lore, NFT integration, and token-based partnerships to create lasting value beyond 2025.

In 2028, THETA will range between $2.03 and $2.32, with an average price of $2.18. In 2031, THETA will range between $3.49 and $3.78, with an average price of $3.63. THETA token is the native incentive of the Theta Decentralized Network, an open-source, public protocol focused on driving the next generation of content streaming platforms. Through Theta, developers and video aggregators can innovatively build, launch and deploy decentralized streaming apps on top of the blockchain. Theta’s applications focus on eSports, TV/Movies, enterprise conferencing, music, educational, and streaming content. The content-driven cryptocurrency remains one of the most undervalued coins out there right now, and I think it will continue to rise in price over time. Theta has already surpassed most older coins in the market cap, but what does this mean for its future value? Will Theta be more valuable than Bitcoin or Ethereum by 2031? This blog post will provide insights into Theta price prediction, how to buy Theta coin, and why it could surpass other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum within the next half a decade. Overview Cryptocurrency Theta Ticker THETA Current price $0.4838 Market cap $484.02M Trading volume $14.88M Circulating supply 1B THETA All-time low $0.03977 Mar 13, 2020 All-time high $15.90 Apr 16, 2021 24-hour low $0.4728 24-hour high $0.4961 Theta price prediction: Technical analysis Fear and Greed Index Value Volatility (30-day variation) 14.70% (Very High) 50-day SMA $0.6769 200-day SMA $0.8201 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 29 (Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) Theta price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Theta is consolidating near $0.48 after a short-term drop. A move above $0.50 could trigger recovery toward $0.54 or higher. THETA/USD 1-day chart analysis As of October 31, Theta (THETA) is trading at $0.484, up a marginal 0.21%, as the price stabilizes near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.492. The upper band sits around $0.600, defining the broader resistance zone. The narrow squeeze of the Bollinger Bands suggests volatility has contracted, with the token consolidating after a recent sell-off. THETA/USD 1-day chart by TradingView The MACD line sits flat near zero with both lines almost overlapping, signaling market indecision and a possible pause before a directional move. The RSI at 37.98 shows Theta is still hovering near the oversold region, hinting that bearish momentum could be losing strength. If Theta manages to hold above $0.48, it could retest $0.51–$0.54 in the short term. However, a daily close below $0.47 may expose it to further downside, potentially reaching $0.45 or even $0.43. THETA/USD 4-hour chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, Theta is showing mild consolidation after multiple failed attempts to push past $0.49. The Alligator indicator lines remain spread downward, confirming the lingering bearish structure. The short-term moving averages act as resistance between $0.492–$0.499, while the upper boundary at $0.510 marks the next level for potential breakout validation. The MACD histogram remains slightly negative, while the OBV reading of 465M indicates relatively weak buying interest. A sustained move above $0.50 could trigger short-term recovery momentum, but rejection here may drag the token back toward $0.475.

Theta is attempting to stabilize after heavy selling pressure, but momentum remains weak. A firm rebound above $0.50 would confirm short-term strength. Otherwise, the token may continue to hover sideways within the $0.47–$0.50 range before a clearer direction emerges. Is Theta a good investment? Theta shows solid long-term potential with its expanding ecosystem in streaming, media, and edge computing. Its strong fundamentals and growing partnerships support future growth, but adoption is still moderate and competition remains high, making it a promising yet risky investment. Will Theta reach $5? Theta is gradually expanding its ecosystem through partnerships in media, entertainment, and edge computing, which supports its long-term growth outlook. If this progress continues alongside broader market recovery, reaching $5 is achievable over time, though it remains dependent on sustained adoption and real utility demand. Will Theta reach $10? Given Theta’s all-time high of around $15.72 in 2021, reaching $10 again is possible if market conditions turn strongly bullish and adoption improves. However, with current low trading levels and slower ecosystem growth, such a rebound would likely take significant time and renewed investor interest. Will Theta reach $50? Per the market estimates and Theta price predictions, Theta prices are unlikely to reach $50 soon. Does Theta have a good long-term future? Theta has strong long-term potential with its focus on decentralized streaming and edge computing, supported by solid partnerships and tokenomics. However, limited adoption and strong competition make it a high-risk, high-reward project.

Theta historic price sentiment Theta Price History by CoinGecko THETA, launched in 2018 as an ERC-20 token before migrating to its own blockchain, initially dropped from $0.183 to around $0.066, trading between $0.051 and $0.107 through 2019. In 2020, it gained momentum, reaching $0.428 mid-year, $0.749 by September, and $1.5 by December. Early 2021 saw a major bull run, pushing THETA from $1.9 to an all-time high of $15.72 before correcting to ~$4 by July. A second rally lifted the price to ~$8 by November. Throughout 2022, THETA fluctuated between $1.2 and $4 but declined to ~$0.7 by year-end. In early 2023, it rebounded above $1 but slipped to $0.619 by October, recovering to ~$1.4 by December. In 2024, THETA opened the year near $1, climbed steadily to about $3.4 in March, then declined through the rest of the year to around $1.02 by December. In 2025, the coin struggled to regain momentum, trading mostly between $0.50 and $1.00, and in October 2025, it is currently trading between $0.4728 and $0.4961.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|THETA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-31 22:06:46

The company behind the world’s largest stablecoin just published its Q3 2025 attestation report, confirming over $10 billion in profit for the year so far, and record exposure to U.S. Treasuries. Tether now holds $135 billion in Treasuries, making it the 17th largest holder globally. Its flagship token, USD₮, has also crossed a massive milestone, with $174 billion in circulation as of September 30. With $181.2 billion in total reserves and $6.8 billion in excess reserves, Tether is not just maintaining its lead in the stablecoin market, it’s extending it. Tether Attestation Reports Q1-Q3 2025 Profit Surpassing $10B, Record Levels in U.S. Treasuries Exposure, Accelerating USD₮ Supply Amidst World’s Macroeconomic Uncertainty Learn more: https://t.co/EH8ltqri27 — Tether (@Tether_to) October 31, 2025 A Record-Breaking Year The numbers speak for themselves. Tether’s Q3 report shows one of the most profitable stretches in its history. In just the first three quarters of 2025, the company generated more than $10 billion in profit, a figure that surpasses many traditional financial institutions. That performance is driven by Tether’s heavy exposure to U.S. Treasuries. The company’s $135 billion Treasury position now ranks it above major economies and sovereign funds in holdings. The majority of its reserves are short-term, liquid assets, a structure that provides both safety and strong returns. For a company with roughly 150 employees worldwide, the scale of these results is remarkable. USD₮ Supply Continues to Surge Tether’s attestation also shows a strong increase in USD₮ supply during Q3 2025. The total circulation jumped by $17 billion over the quarter, ending at 174.4 billion USD₮. That growth mirrors rising demand in global markets, where users continue to turn to stablecoins as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. In emerging markets especially, USD₮ has become a lifeline. Today, Tether estimates over 500 million people use USD₮ worldwide, from freelancers in Asia to merchants in Africa and Latin America. It’s not just another crypto token. For many, it’s their most reliable form of digital money. $181B in Reserves, $6.8B in Cushion Tether’s balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. The company reported $181.2 billion in total assets, fully backing every USD₮ in circulation. On top of that, an additional $6.8 billion in excess reserves provides an extra safety layer, funds that go beyond the 100% liquid backing required. That surplus acts as a financial buffer, reinforcing market confidence. It’s also part of why USD₮ has remained stable through every market cycle, from bull runs to liquidity crunches. Transparency remains central to Tether’s operations. Each quarter, attestation reports confirm the composition of reserves and verify that every token is supported by equivalent assets. The 17th Largest Holder of U.S. Treasuries Perhaps the most striking number in the Q3 report is Tether’s $135 billion exposure to U.S. Treasuries. That figure officially makes Tether the 17th largest holder of U.S. government debt, larger than most central banks. This exposure has effectively tied Tether’s financial health to one of the most secure markets in the world. The interest generated from these holdings has become a key driver of the company’s profits. Tether’s Treasury-heavy portfolio shows how closely traditional and digital finance have become intertwined. The stablecoin market is now a major participant in global liquidity flows, and Tether sits at the center of that shift. Tether just released its quarterly attestation for Q3 2025. USDT has become the biggest financial inclusion success story in the history of humanity, with more than 500 million users across the emerging markets and developing countries. Highlights as of 30 September 2025: *… https://t.co/XVYeVq1u64 pic.twitter.com/nZ2V1EKZ3x — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) October 31, 2025 From Stablecoin to Global Financial Power For years, Tether has been viewed mainly as a stablecoin issuer. But 2025 marks the year that changed. With its growing profits and diversification plans, Tether is evolving into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. The company is already expanding into artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and P2P technology. These moves signal a broader vision, one that goes beyond crypto trading and into real-world infrastructure. By investing in AI and energy projects, Tether aims to support innovation and sustainability, while reducing reliance on traditional financial systems. It’s a long-term strategy that blends finance, technology, and global access. The World’s Digital Dollar The scale of USD₮’s adoption is unprecedented. In developing regions, where banking infrastructure often fails to meet demand, USD₮ fills the gap. It gives users access to digital dollars without needing a traditional bank account. From local traders in Nigeria to startups in Argentina, USD₮ enables stable transactions, remittances, and savings in markets hit by inflation or currency controls. This widespread use has made Tether a cornerstone of global financial inclusion. The company calls it “the biggest financial inclusion success story in history.” Numbers That Define 2025 Tether’s attestation lays out the picture clearly: $174.4B USD₮ issued as of Q3 2025 $181.2B in total assets and reserves $6.8B+ in excess reserves $135B+ in U.S. Treasuries $10B+ in profit across Q1–Q3 $17B USDT supply increase in Q3 alone These metrics don’t just show growth, they show dominance. The Most Profitable Company in Crypto The biggest surprise for many? The most profitable company in crypto isn’t an exchange, it’s Tether. With $10 billion in profit year-to-date, Tether has outperformed nearly every major crypto firm, including top trading platforms. Its business model, simple, transparent, and backed by liquid reserves, continues to generate consistent returns. Its ability to manage such vast holdings while maintaining full liquidity makes it one of the most efficient financial operations in the industry. With profit soaring, reserves expanding, and new investments underway, Tether is shaping itself into more than a stablecoin company. It’s becoming a global financial powerhouse, one that merges traditional stability with digital efficiency. The company’s focus on AI and renewable energy shows its intent to influence the future beyond crypto markets. Its USD₮ token continues to anchor the digital economy, while its profits and investments expand its role across sectors. As the world faces ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, demand for stability is rising. And for hundreds of millions of users, that stability comes in one form, USD₮.

XRP ($XRP): Claude AI Predicts Strong Double-Digit Growth According to Claude crypto report, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) stands out as one of the most promising breakout assets. The AI suggests the token could rally toward the $8 mark by year’s end, representing a 217% increase from its current price of $2.52. Source: Claude AI Ripple’s courtroom victory against the SEC earlier in the year reignited market optimism, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, the asset has climbed an impressive 380% year-to-date and 392% in the last 365 days, outperforming Bitcoin’s 55% growth and Ethereum’s 50% by nearly 7x to 8x. With the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s close contacts with the current pro-crypto US administration, Ripple has further cemented its status as a compliance-friendly digital payments provider, drawing strong investor interest in regulatory-aligned crypto solutions. Several bullish flag setups have formed across XRP’s 2025 price charts, hinting at sustained technical momentum. If additional market catalysts emerge, such as a wave of expected ETF approvals, new institutional partnerships, or the timely delivery of “Project Crypto”—an SEC initiative to provide clarity to the industry, a 12-month target of $8 could become a realistic target. Sui Network: Claude Calls This One an Easy 10X Crypto Sui Network ($SUI) continues to generate substantial buzz, positioning itself as a blockchain capable of outperforming Ethereum in speed and scalability. While the “Ethereum killer” label often depends on perspective, Sui’s standout feature is its extraordinary throughput, reportedly handling up to 297,000 transactions per second (TPS), compared to Ethereum’s average of just 15 TPS. In the last 24 hours, SUI has risen 3%, trading at $2.35. Claude’s report suggests the token could sustain this uptrend and potentially reach $25 next year, thanks to its sophisticated smart contract ecosystem, scalability, and interoperability. If current slow market conditions persist, Sui could feasibly touch $5 by Christmas. Technical indicators, however, support a breakout scenario, with the forming two bullish flag patterns over the last year, typically a precursor to prolonged upside potential. Aave (AAVE): Ethereum’s DeFi Titan May Double Rapidly, Says Claude Aave ($AAVE) remains a cornerstone of decentralized finance, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive returns through a secure, efficient platform. Renowned for its flash loans, liquidity pools, and multi-chain accessibility, Aave has played a pivotal role in advancing the DeFi landscape. Its commitment to innovation, community governance, and growing institutional traction positions Aave not just as a survivor of the DeFi boom, but as one of its key architects. Claude AI envisions Aave’s price potentially soaring from current levels of $217 all the way up to to $1,000, a remarkable jump of 5x in 12 months. Currently, Aave’s price action is forming an expanding triangle pattern. It could actually reach the lower target of $600 early next year, which will be a strong psychological foothold on the way to $1,000. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Bold Meme Coin Presale with 4,900x Potential! Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has been billed “the Dogecoin of this cycle” despite still only being in presale, and such buzz has already attracted over $3.8 million in funding from investors hoping for outsized gains. Claude’s crypto report believes his one is explosive, estimating potential returns of up to 4,900% from its current low fixed presale price of $0.0002655. If Claude’s analysis is correct, Maxi Doge could be worth $0.013275 in a year, which would still make it worth only a penny even after it has hypothetically gone to the moon. Marketed as Dogecoin’s more chaotic and high-energy relative, Maxi Doge thrives on crypto’s degen culture, leveraging viral memes, contests, and community interaction to fuel growth. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions than Dogecoin’s dated chain. Of the total 150.24 billion MAXI tokens, 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” aimed at supporting marketing efforts, strategic collaborations, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 79% APY, though yields will gradually decrease as staking participation rises. The current presale price is $0.0002655, with incremental increases set for upcoming rounds. Investors can acquire MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

October opened with “Uptober” optimism since the vast majority of Octobers in crypto’s 15 year history have resulted in serious gains However, there was no such luck this year. President Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports caused one of the biggest crashes in crypto history, although old hands were unperturbed, noting that big crashes that flush out over-leveraged players often precede historic bull runs. The Fed’s decision to cut interest rates on Wednesday has not prevented two consecutive dip days. Still, crypto has been here for 1.5 decades and it’s only growing by the day, whatever prices say. So, read on to find out why XRP, Bitcoin and Solana are three trending cryptos to jump on this halloween. Ripple (XRP): How the Global Payments Leader Became King of Trending Cryptos in 2025 Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , powers a lightning-fast, low-cost payments network designed to replace legacy cross-border systems such as SWIFT. Through partnerships with the UN Capital Development Fund and multiple major U.S. banks, Ripple has secured its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $150 billion. The company’s launch of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, marks a bold step in the crucial stablecoin sector. Over the past twelve months, XRP has jumped 381%, reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-July, its first in seven years, while Bitcoin posted a comparatively modest 52% gain during the same period. Its price chart shows two bullish flag formations this summer. Pending ETF approvals and the passage of comprehensive crypto regulation in the U.S. could provide the final catalyst for XRP to hit the $5–$10 range this year. Bitcoin ($BTC): Gemini AI Forecasts a Climb Toward $250,000 Bitcoin ($BTC) , the world’s first and most recognized cryptocurrency, continues to dominate headlines after reaching a record high of $126,080 on October 6. wIf the US SEC delivers on the promise of “Project Crypto”, an initiative to modernise federal securities laws to give crypto firms clearer guidance, then Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2026. Even under normal conditions, Bitcoin could conceivably hit $150,000, given the fact that it has set multiple new all-time highs this year. Another development that could catalyse demand is Trump’s delivery of his pre-election promise for a Strategic US Bitcoin reserve. As the benchmark for the entire sector, Bitcoin attracts both institutional and retail, often viewed as a “digital gold” hedge against inflation. It currently accounts for $2.2 trillion of the global crypto’s $3.8 trillion capitalization. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to solidify its reputation as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains in operation today. With a market capitalization over $102 billion and over $11 billion in total value locked , Solana is the second biggest DeFi network after Ethereum. Tuesday marked a major milestone as Grayscale and Bitwise launched spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange, a development expected to attract significant institutional investment, mirroring the inflows seen after recent Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. Following a spring low near $100 in April, SOL has recovered to $186. A falling wedge pattern and a bullish flag formed across Solana’s support and resistance lines this year. These two formations typically precede major breakouts but they are as yet unrealized. Key technical levels show solid support near $150 and heavy resistance around $250. Should the recent ETF launches continue to drive demand, SOL could revisit its previous all-time high of $293.31, and, under strong bull market conditions, potentially advance toward $500 or even $1,000 by Christmas. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Timely Reminder that Next Year’s Trending Cryptos are in This Year’s Presales Market Finally, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) hasn’t listed yet, but it is likely to be one of the biggest trending cryptos of 2026. It merges Bitcoin’s security with high-performance Layer-2 capabilities, amplified by meme-driven community appeal. HYPER seeks to enhance Bitcoin’s ecosystem through near-instant transactions, decentralized governance via a DAO framework, and native smart contract functionality powered by its proprietary Layer-2 architecture. The presale has already surpassed $25.3 million, with some analysts projecting 100x potential post-launch. Leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER integrates a high-speed Canonical Bridge that enables smooth BTC transfers and decentralized app (dApp) compatibility. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor trust in the project’s foundation. HYPER tokens form the backbone of the ecosystem, facilitating governance, staking, and transactional functions. Early investors can currently earn staking yields up to 46% APY.

Chase Early Stage Gains Before Prices Climb and Demand Goes Wild Solana Positioned for “Two Ways to Win” as Stablecoin and Tokenization Markets Expand Solana earns serious respect after Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated that the network has two powerful growth streams. First, stablecoins keep shifting to faster chains. Solana handles high transaction volumes at low cost, attracting new payment innovations. Western Union has already confirmed plans for a Solana-based stablecoin to support global money movement. Second, tokenization builds pace with institutions exploring real-world assets on the chain. Solana controls around 14 percent of this sector, leaving significant upside. If adoption continues to rise while network activity remains strong, Solana could enjoy a catch-up run similar to Bitcoin’s once-explosive rally during dual market success. Frequently Asked Questions about Solana Why are institutions interested in Solana? Institutions need fast settlement and predictable fees. Solana offers both while supporting secure token issuance for digitized assets. These strengths attract large players seeking efficient payment infrastructure and asset innovation. Is Solana a long-term investment option? Yes. Solana benefits from growing developer activity, strong liquidity, and the expansion of stablecoins. While volatility continues, the chain’s performance edge supports strong competitiveness in the long-term ecosystem race. BullZilla: Best Crypto Presales with 100x Potential Driven by Scarcity, Hype, and ROI BullZilla builds its appeal around progressive price increases and fast-moving demand that investors associate with the best crypto presales with 100x potential .

Specific exchange names, including Coinbase, are not officially confirmed yet. Listing decisions depend on compliance, liquidity, trading demand, and partner readiness. Why Staking Can Supercharge Gains in Presale Projects? Holding tokens through staking allows users to earn additional rewards and reduce selling pressure at launch. These programs help boost momentum and assist price discovery. They build loyalty and encourage longer conviction among holders. Lock Tokens Early While Massive ROI Remains in Sight Aster Sinks but Volume Remains Strong as Traders Watch for Recovery Aster recently declined by more than 17% over 24 hours, dropping to $0.86. Volatility hit the newly launched network, which now trades over 64 percent below its high. Strong volume around $688M shows traders are still active. Confidence remains because Aster still has more than 920% gains from its September lows. Investors watch whether support forms to keep growth valid. Aster continues to build adoption, which may provide stability going forward, with development momentum supporting better market reactions. Frequently Asked Questions about Aster Why did Aster drop recently? Prices corrected due to high volatility and profit-taking after significant gains. Substantial volume signals persistent interest, though recovery depends on buyers maintaining confidence as development progresses. Is Aster still promising? Yes. Despite pullbacks, Aster remains far above earlier lows. As long as utility and ecosystem activity continue to grow, the project can recover strongly and resume long-term upward momentum. Conclusion – Is BullZilla the Best Crypto Presale with 100X Potential Market news reflects two clear themes shaping the crypto environment today. Solana pushes deeper into institutional finance through stablecoin innovation and tokenization momentum, reinforcing its role as a major ecosystem contender. At the same time, Aster shows that newly launched tokens can move aggressively in either direction due to heightened volatility and increased trader attention. Participation rises as adoption expands across payment systems, smart contract networks, and tokenized real-world assets. The entire industry evolves, with more utilities supporting stronger, long-term market health overall. BullZilla, meanwhile, captures peak opportunity interest as hype accelerates and entry points disappear quickly. Its fast-climbing presale and high ROI projections make it one of the best crypto presales with 100x potential in Q4. Scarcity grows as stages advance, and staking provides lasting income strength that appeals to committed holders. Delay raises cost, which pressures users to join before the Stage 9 price increases limit upside. The next bull wave is forming, and BullZilla positions itself to lead momentum and attract significant attention.

Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Coinbase’s third‑quarter revenue surged to $1.87 billion, which came in above the $1.8 billion expectation, triggering a 9% rally on the COIN stock rose by 9% by Friday’s close. The company has been partnering with Wall Street giants like JP Morgan, Citi, and PNC, who are all using Coinbase to provide crypto access inside their platforms, calling it a foundational build, not a short‑term revenue lift. Banks adopt Coinbase infrastructure In late July, Coinbase said it would integrate its institutional Crypto‑as‑a‑Service platform into PNC, allowing its clients to buy, hold, and sell crypto directly from their existing bank environment. Later in the month, Coinbase announced multiple product offerings with J.P. Morgan. These offerings link Chase bank accounts to Coinbase wallets. Customers can move funds directly between the two. They can also transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points into Coinbase accounts. Users can also fund their Coinbase accounts with Chase credit cards. This is where Coinbase moves from being an exchange people log into separately to being a built‑in layer inside normal banking activity. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote that Coinbase is “fast becoming the AWS of crypto financial infrastructure as big banks such as JPM, Citi, PNC choose Coinbase as their crypto partner.” Chhugani refers to Amazon Web Services, which is the unseen backend behind most major tech products. This framing is being used to describe Coinbase’s position as financial systems adopt blockchain rails for processing. Analysts outline expected upside Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase with a price target of $510, which would represent 55% upside. Bernstein analysts wrote that Coinbase is “executing on its crypto dream, where blockchain rails would re‑architect capital markets, banking and payments.” They also stated that the company’s path is not based on token price cycles but on building a business that services institutional financial systems. Barclays holds an equal‑weight rating with a price target of $357, which implies 8.7% upside. Barclays analysts said its management expressed confidence in active developments across payments, exchanges, and capital formation. Needham has a buy rating and a $400 price target, implying 21.8% upside. Needham analysts wrote that management is seeing strong demand for stablecoin infrastructure. They stated that Coinbase continues to receive partnership mandates from large firms such as Citi and BlackRock while also seeing increased interest from small and medium‑sized businesses. Rosenblatt has a buy rating and a $470 price target, which implies 43.1% upside. Rosenblatt analysts wrote that over 1,000 businesses are currently using Coinbase for stablecoin payments and that another 1,000 businesses are on the waitlist. They listed partnerships with Citi, Stripe, PayPal, Revolut, Webull, and Shopify as examples of how Coinbase is now being used as the on‑chain payments gateway for companies building crypto‑based transaction flows.

The sudden decline followed an initial post-Fed volatility spike, as traders reacted to the US Federal Reserve’s 25bps rate cut and announcement of an impending end to quantitative tightening. With uncertainty still lingering, BTC briefly slipped into a risk-off spiral, testing investor conviction and flushing out leveraged positions in the process. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite the market turbulence, several analysts argue this move may represent a classic shakeout, rather than the beginning of a larger breakdown. Historically, Bitcoin has often seen sharp pullbacks immediately before renewed upside momentum, especially during early liquidity-expansion phases. For now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can stabilize and reclaim the $110K zone, a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot throughout the past month. As markets digest the Fed’s decision, the focus turns to whether Bitcoin can wake up from this sudden sell-off and reclaim strength heading into November. PoC Becomes Critical Battleground as Market Signals Indecision According to top analyst On-chain Mind, Bitcoin’s current price structure is being defined by a major volume cluster centered around $117,000, which now serves as the Point of Control (PoC) in the local market profile. This level represents the price zone with the highest traded volume in the recent range — effectively the point where buyers and sellers have shown the strongest interest and where the market has spent considerable time balancing liquidity. In practical terms, the PoC functions as a fair value zone for market participants. When the price trades below it, bulls need to reclaim the level to regain trend strength; when the price trades above it, the zone tends to act as support. Today, BTC remains beneath the $117K PoC, signaling that the market has yet to re-establish bullish dominance after the recent shakeout. On-chain Mind notes that reclaiming $117K would likely trigger renewed momentum, opening the door for a retest of the $120K–$123K range. Until then, however, the structure remains indecisive, with price hovering in a neutral zone where neither bulls nor bears hold a clear advantage. This aligns with broader market behavior: reduced leverage, mixed sentiment, and trader caution following aggressive liquidations earlier in October. The market is digesting macro shifts, recalibrating position sizes, and waiting for a clearer signal. If Bitcoin can stabilize above recent support and begin rotating back toward the PoC, reclaiming $117K could mark the moment the next leg up begins.

The price managed to reclaim the $110K level, suggesting buyers stepped in at intraday lows around $108,500, an important local demand zone that has repeatedly supported the price since mid-October. However, the recovery remains fragile, with BTC now approaching a cluster of short-term resistance levels. The 50-period EMA sits just above the current price, and the 100- and 200-period moving averages remain overhead, stacked bearishly. This alignment indicates that momentum has not fully shifted back to the bulls yet. To regain control, BTC must break above $112,000–$113,000, where multiple moving averages converge and prior support now acts as resistance. Clearing this zone would open the path toward the critical $117,500 Point of Control — the key level bulls need to reclaim to re-establish medium-term strength.

For now, BTC remains in a neutral recovery posture, trying to build a base while navigating overhead pressure from macro uncertainty and recent leverage unwinds.

53882327,618253,1761951656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53882327.jpeg,Is Zcash Quantum-Resistant Yet? Experts Weigh In,https://bitcoinist.com/is-zcash-quantum-resistant-yet-experts/,"A debate on X this week exposed a core question for on-chain privacy: when quantum computers are able to break elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), will they be able to retroactively deanonymize every transaction ever made of privacy coins like Zcash? Nic Carter, co-founder of Coin Metrics and partner at Castle Island Ventures, argued that the answer is effectively yes for most privacy coins. “For privacy coins, even if they migrate to post-quantum cryptographic schemes, all historical transactions prior to that migration can be decrypted,” he said on October 30, 2025. “So all historical txns will be stripped of privacy in >~5y. Everything is built on ECC.” Carter’s point is based on “harvest now, decrypt later.” Attackers don’t need to break you today. They just copy the data now and crack it once quantum is strong enough. On blockchains, that problem is worse because the data is already public and permanent. “Blockchains are uniquely bad for quantum because normally the quantum thing is ‘harvest now decrypt later’ so adversaries have to be preemptively harvesting traffic but blockchains just.. publish.. everything.. forever.” He warned specifically that even if a privacy coin upgrades to quantum-resistant signatures in the future, old activity is still exposed once ECC falls. “While privacy coins can adopt post quantum sigs, understand that all previously hidden addresses, relationships between addresses, etc, will be revealed once ECC is broken,” Carter said. “And obviously everything is on chain so you don’t even need to harvest traffic today.” Is Zcash Already Quantum-Resistant? That claim triggered pushback from Zcash supporters, who argue Zcash is structurally different from something like Monero. Mert Mumtaz (Helius) agreed that Carter’s warning applies to “many privacy coins like Monero ,” but said it’s “not necessarily true for zcash’s privacy, given advanced opsec.” He acknowledged that “advanced opsec is not the norm,” but said that if it is followed, Zcash users “get you certain guarantees w.r.t information leakage.” He also said “some things are in the works to make this even stronger,” pointing to research by Zcash engineer Sean Bowe. Bowe’s position is that Zcash’s fully shielded pool simply does not put critical sender/receiver information on the ledger in the first place. “There is no quantum computer or powerful AI that will be able to look back at the Zcash blockchain 1000 years from now and figure out who made every fully shielded transaction,” Bowe said in July this year. “That information, among other things, never even touches the ledger. It’s already gone.” His condition is clear: “To be certain about your privacy you must start by using shielded Zcash. You almost cannot even begin otherwise.” Carter partially credits that. “Zec is definitely ahead of anyone when it comes to quantum preparedness, not denying that,” he said. But he called the “already quantum-proof” framing unrealistic in practice. He argued that Zcash’s long-term privacy story depends on very strong assumptions that often break in the real world: “assumes pubkey never being known. assumes: no metadata collection, no exchange key leaks, perfect metadata privacy.” He added that Zcash’s shielded pools — Sprout, Sapling, Orchard — still “rely on ECC for key exchange, viewkeys, proof verification, which are all broken” under a powerful quantum adversary. His conclusion: “unrealistic to say zec privacy is perfectly q resistant. linkages between addrs are forever encoded on the blockchain, you and Sean know that. store now decrypt later still applies.” In other words: Zcash builders say that if you stay fully shielded, the chain itself won’t hand quantum attackers a clean map of who paid whom. Carter says that in the real world, users leak, exchanges leak, metadata leaks — and once ECC breaks, those leaks plus the permanent ledger are enough to unwind the privacy anyway. One final note: when asked directly, Carter denied holding ZEC. “Nope.” At press time, ZEC traded at $366.",Crypto News|Quantum Computing|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|WALLET|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 23:00:56

In a decision filed Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed an earlier ruling from the District of Wyoming that sided with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Source: Court Listener Tenth Circuit Upholds Fed’s Decision to Block Custodia’s Access to U.S. Payment System The judgment marks the latest setback in Custodia’s five-year effort to obtain a Federal Reserve “master account,” a critical gateway for direct participation in the U.S. banking system. “This case comes clothed in 21st Century terms: cryptocurrency, digital assets, instant wire transfers, and master accounts,” the judges wrote in the opinion. “But there is nothing new about this issue. Courts have probed the legality of our nation’s central bank and interpreted the relevant statutes since the founding.” The three-judge panel, composed of Circuit Judges Tymkovich, Ebel, and Rossman, upheld the lower court’s conclusion that the Federal Reserve acted within its authority when it denied Custodia’s application. The ruling effectively leaves the central bank’s decision intact, confirming that the Fed retains broad discretion in determining which financial institutions can access its payment infrastructure. Custodia, previously known as Avanti Bank, first applied for a master account in October 2020 after receiving a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter from the state of Wyoming. The application, typically processed within a week, languished for over 19 months without resolution. In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City formally rejected the request, citing “safety and soundness” concerns tied to the bank’s focus on digital assets. U.S. digital asset-focused bank Custodia has filed a lawsuit against the FED Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City over “unlawfully” delaying its application for a master account with the FED. Read more https://t.co/8rpBp5piaM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2022 The Fed argued that Custodia’s business model relied too heavily on volatile crypto markets and lacked sufficient controls to manage illicit finance risks. It also pointed to the bank’s limited experience in traditional risk management and the potential systemic implications of granting direct access to a crypto-centered institution. Custodia sued the Federal Reserve in June 2022 , claiming an “unlawful delay” and arguing that eligible institutions are entitled to a master account under federal law. After the Wyoming court ruled in favor of the Fed in March 2024 , Custodia appealed, asserting that the decision gave the central bank excessive discretion over market access. Judge Rules Against Digital Asset Bank Custodia’s Bid for Federal Reserve Master Account Custodia Bank has been denied a U.S. Federal Reserve master account by the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. #CryptoNews https://t.co/lHtNJ69ZdW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 31, 2024 Friday’s ruling reaffirmed the lower court’s position, dealing another blow to Long’s push to integrate crypto banking into the U.S. financial system. In a statement posted to X following the judgment, Custodia said it was “actively considering” petitioning for a rehearing. Statement of @custodiabank : pic.twitter.com/6U0FPzaKCm — Custodia Bank (@custodiabank) October 31, 2025 “While we were hoping for a win at the Tenth Circuit today, we received the next big thing — a strong dissent,” the company wrote, referring to a partial dissent that raised constitutional questions about the Federal Reserve’s authority. Why Won’t the Fed Grant Crypto Firms a Master Account? A Federal Reserve master account would have allowed Custodia to connect directly to core U.S. payment systems such as Fedwire and the Automated Clearing House (ACH). Such access enables banks to settle transactions, hold reserves, and participate directly in monetary policy operations, benefits currently limited to regulated depository institutions. Crypto-focused firms have long sought similar access to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on intermediary banks. However, the Federal Reserve has not approved any master account applications from crypto-native institutions to date. The central bank has repeatedly cited the sector’s high volatility, potential for fraud, and insufficient consumer protection as reasons for caution.

Long said the initiative proved that banks could “tokenize demand deposits on a permissionless blockchain in a regulatorily compliant manner.” Despite such efforts, federal regulators have maintained a cautious stance. Speaking in March, Long said that under the current administration, no meaningful changes have been made to rules labeling digital asset exposure as “unsafe and unsound” for banks.

The US and UK have both targeted Chen this month with coordinated sanctions on 146 entities and individuals tied to Prince Group, including Chen and key associates, in what has been tagged the largest such action ever against a cybercriminal network. The US Department of Justice charged him with running scam compounds in Cambodia, responsible for stealing billions in cryptocurrency from global victims. The US Treasury Department has reportedly seized over $15 billion in assets, including Bitcoin, London properties worth £100 million, and holdings in Palau, it for being linked to him in what marks the largest ever crypto seizure. He is now just as popular in law enforcement circles in Singapore, with reports claiming Singaporean police are moving against the Cambodian Prince Group. On October 31, Singaporean police revealed they had launched an enforcement operation against Chen Zhi and his accomplices on October 30, which led to the seizure of assets worth more than $115 million (approximately RMB 800 million). As part of the enforcement operation, Singapore police have issued restraining orders against a total of six properties and various financial assets registered under the names of Chen Zhi and his accomplices. These assets included bank accounts, securities accounts, and cash, with a total estimated value exceeding S$165 million. The cops also seized a yacht, 11 vehicles, and numerous bottles of alcohol. Chen acquires Cambodian citizenship, drops Chinese nationality On his company website, Chen Zhi is described as “a respected entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist” whose “vision and leadership have transformed Prince Group into a leading business group in Cambodia that adheres to international standards.” He was raised in Fujian province in south-eastern China, and started out with a small internet gaming company that did not have much success. Then he moved to Cambodia around late 2010 or 2011, where he secured employment in the real estate sector According to BBC News, this was also around the time Chinese folks were gathering in Cambodia for various reasons, including the fact that new casinos sprang up, as well as gaudy, luxury hotels and apartment blocks. Things become bizarre when you consider the status he held in Cambodia. Not only did he become a citizen of other countries like Vanuatu and Cyprus, he also had thriving businesses linked to the Prince property arm, including five-star hotels in Sihanoukville. Chen was even awarded the highest title bestowed by Cambodia’s king, that of “Neak Oknha”, which requires a donation of at least $500,000 to the government, in 2020. Despite all this, Chen kept a low profile and was an enigma, saying little in public spaces. “Everyone I’ve spoken to who’s worked with him directly, been in the room with him, they all describe him as very courteous, very calm, very measured,” says Jack Adamovic Davies, a journalist who did a three-year-long investigation of Chen Zhi. “I think not being the kind of flamboyant person that people will write tabloid-y things about was smart. Even those who no longer want to be associated with him are still impressed by his quiet charisma, his gravitas.” Since news of his sanctions was announced last week, Chen has been AWOL.

Using the Gaussian Channel, EGRAG projected that the cryptocurrency might rise as much as 244% from its present value, challenging the view held by some analysts that the bull market may already be over.

He compared the current market structure to XRP’s performance during the 2017–2018 bull run , when the token rose by roughly 3,700%, reaching around $0.39 before entering a consolidation phase. #XRP – Math, Numbers & a Touch of Sarcasm : This post for those who think logically (well… kinda ) — a mix of numbers, patterns, and a dash of mockery toward a few “TA masters” out there 1⃣ The 10% Theory: Based on the Gaussian Channel (2-week timeframe), I… pic.twitter.com/GkWlQdJZ6L — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 30, 2025 By contrast, EGRAG noted that XRP has advanced by only about 370% in the current cycle, a fraction of its previous rally. He then applied the same ratio observed in 2017’s final surge, when XRP jumped 2,440% to hit $3.30. Based on that relationship, his model suggests a potential range between $5.50 and $6.00 this time around. EGRAG also rejected the popular “diminishing returns” argument that claims each cycle produces smaller percentage gains. He highlighted XRP’s 1,700% rise during the 2021 cycle, which occurred despite regulatory pressure from the SEC lawsuit and an overall bearish market mood. He contends that advancements in technology and growing global adoption make larger gains feasible once again. According to his calculations, repeating the 2021 rally could push XRP above $5 in the coming months. Diminishing Bear Market Losses EGRAG further pointed to a pattern of shrinking losses in XRP’s historical downtrends, describing it as evidence of long-term market maturity. The first major downturn saw a 96% fall from the top, while the next dropped by 86%, showing a gradual 10% improvement. If the pattern holds, the next decline could limit losses to around 76%. This pattern also allows EGRAG to estimate potential bottoms for future cycles. If XRP reaches $5–$6 at the top of the current run, he predicts the next market low could form between $1.20 and $1.40.

Investors who accumulated below $0.50, he noted, remain well-positioned regardless of near-term fluctuations. Other analysts share EGRAG’s optimism about XRP’s long-term outlook but anticipate short-term weakness. DustyBC, for example, believes the asset may first complete a corrective phase before beginning a major third wave upward. His chart analysis places XRP between $2.00 and $2.40 to finalize the second wave before resuming its broader uptrend. Similarly, Casi Trades has identified nearby support and resistance zones that could guide XRP’s next move. After rejecting resistance around $2.68, XRP turned slightly bearish, with Casi noting support levels at $2.42, $2.03, and $1.65. A close below $2.42, she warned, could extend the decline toward $1.65, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. However, she believes this pullback would likely mark the end of the correction and prepare the asset for a sustained breakout to new highs. While the short-term picture for XRP remains mixed, EGRAG’s Gaussian Channel analysis presents a strong case for further gains, potentially lifting the asset above $5 if historical patterns persist. Though other analysts expect a temporary dip before the next upward move, the consensus remains that XRP’s broader structure continues to strengthen, signaling room for a significant rally before this cycle concludes.

His commentary shifts the focus from short-term trading and speculative exits to planning, tax efficiency, and wealth preservation strategies that allow holders to retain exposure while generating cash flow. Claver begins by stressing the importance of having a concrete plan before prices surge. He observes that many retail investors keep tokens on exchanges and liquidate positions as soon as targets are hit, often incurring large tax bills and spending windfalls without a long-term strategy. By contrast, disciplined planning can preserve capital and enable ongoing income generation while allowing the underlying asset to appreciate further. Do you have a plan for your crypto profits? Most people reading this won't do any of it. They'll keep their XRP on an exchange, sell when it hits their number, pay a bunch in taxes, buy liabilities, and wonder where it went. That's fine. More assets for the people who see it… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) October 30, 2025 Leveraging Institutional Lending A central element of Claver’s approach is borrowing against appreciated crypto rather than converting it to fiat. Institutional-grade crypto lending markets now permit qualified borrowers to use digital assets as collateral and obtain cash without triggering taxable events from sales. Claver suggests that investors who expect a substantial valuation increase can borrow a conservative percentage; he cites an example of borrowing roughly 30% against a position to access funds for living expenses, investment, or business needs. Properly structured, this method preserves the growth potential of the collateral while providing liquidity. Tax and Legal Structures Claver warns that holding sizable crypto balances in an individual’s personal name exposes assets to tax events, litigation risk, and estate complications. He recommends establishing appropriate legal entities, such as properly administered limited liability companies or trusts, and, when applicable, using institutional custody solutions. These measures can provide creditor protection, clearer succession planning, and easier onboarding with banks and service providers that service high-net-worth digital portfolios. He cautions that improperly maintained entities (for example, co-mingling personal and entity funds) can void protections and create additional legal exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For individuals or families with material crypto exposure, Claver recommends operational controls typically used by institutional investors. These include multi-signature custody, independent audit trails, segregation of duties, and working with custodians that provide insurance and compliance reporting. He also advises building relationships with financial institutions that understand digital assets so that lending and banking needs can be met without friction. Accessing Liquidity Without Selling To illustrate, Claver uses a hypothetical; an investor holding 10,000 XRP at a future $100 price would nominally hold $1,000,000 in value. Rather than liquidating, the investor could protocol a loan for a portion of that value, say $300,000, using the XRP as collateral. The loan proceeds could be allocated to living costs, investments that produce income, or business opportunities, while the XRP position remains intact and continues to participate in any further upside. Interest payments and loan structure determine the net cash flow. The key advantage is avoiding a taxable sale that permanently reduces exposure. Claver also outlines the risks. Borrowing against volatile collateral requires margin management and contingency plans for price declines. Lenders may demand additional collateral or liquidate positions if values fall below maintenance thresholds. Legal structures and custody arrangements have costs and administrative requirements. He stresses that such strategies are not suitable for all holders, particularly small retail positions, and recommends seeking competent legal, tax, and financial advice before implementation. Claver argues that the difference between a one-time windfall and enduring family wealth is strategy and execution. Investors who prepare legal structures, adopt institutional-grade custody, and use lending facilities responsibly can potentially access ongoing liquidity without selling their core holdings. For those seeking to convert crypto gains into sustained financial security, the emphasis should be on preservation, tax efficiency, and controlled leverage rather than immediate monetization.

Although altcoins have recently lagged behind Bitcoin, bullish factors from data and macroeconomic parallels are building optimism that a change in liquidity conditions might trigger a strong market-wide rally for altcoins. Altcoin Dominance Hits Record Oversold Levels According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, altcoin dominance has entered oversold conditions for the first time in history. Marks highlighted in his post that the indicator, which measures the market share of all altcoins, is now the most oversold it’s ever been. The OTHERS.D chart shows the market dominance percentage of all cryptocurrencies except the top 10 by market capitalization. It is a measure of the combined market share of smaller altcoins and can be used to identify broader altcoin rallies. His long-term chart of the OTEHRS.D movement spans over a decade, with each major low followed by an extended period of recovery and massive market gains. The chart reveals that dominance has declined sharply since its 2021 peak of around 20%. At the time of writing, the OTHERS.D dominance is around 7%. A wave trend indicator at the bottom of the chart is in deep negative territory around negative 50%, which is its lowest in history. Marks noted that such oversold conditions often precede strong reversals. It means that selling pressure has been exhausted and that a major rebound could soon begin. If this pattern repeats, altcoins may be entering one of their most attractive accumulation phases in years. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding Top 10 Dominance. Source: Javon Marks on X Fed’s Monetary Shifts And Their Impact On Crypto Liquidity Another technical perspective came from analyst Ted Pillows, who compared current market conditions to the 2019-2020 cycle when the Federal Reserve ended quantitative tightening (QT) and later resumed quantitative easing (QE). His chart of the crypto total market cap excluding Bitcoin shows a 42% decline following the end of QT in late 2019, followed by an explosive recovery after the Fed initiated QE in March 2020. Pillows explained that while ending QT may ease financial pressure, it does not directly inject liquidity into the economy, something altcoins need to rally. In contrast, QE or Treasury General Account (TGA) releases flood the market with liquidity and allow inflows into cryptocurrencies. He noted that ending QT isn’t enough for alts to rally. It is either the Fed starts another QE or the Treasury releases TGA liquidity into the economy. The most feasible option right now is the second one. Crypto Total Market Cap Excluding BTC. Source: Ted Pillows On X With the US government currently in a shutdown, he suggested that a TGA-driven liquidity release may occur once the fiscal impasse is resolved, and this will serve as the next major driving force for the altcoin market.

He explains that the value of XRP stems from its foundational role in the XRP Ledger. He believes many people misunderstand XRP by comparing it to stablecoins or other tokens, but that view misses the main point. Mickle Says XRP’s Value Is ‘Foundational,’ Not Just A Pitch In a recent X post, Mickle said that most people in crypto still do not understand what makes XRP special . He explained that when people ask, “What’s the current pitch for XRP?” they are asking the wrong question. To him, XRP does not need a sales pitch because its value is foundational. The cryptocurrency doesn’t depend on price movements, short-term excitement, or temporary stories. Instead, it is part of the very system that powers the XRP Ledger. Mickle compared XRP to well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, noting that they share common traits. They are native, non-issued assets that exist without a counterparty, meaning they are not created or backed by any one company or government. Like these leading cryptocurrencies, XRP provides the liquidity that allows value to move and settle across its decentralized network. According to Mickle, this is what gives XRP a lasting importance. It is not a token that depends on external promises or a central authority, but the heart of a decentralized system that operates independently. XRP Ledger Depends On XRP’s Native Role In Decentralized Settlement Mickle also suggests that the XRP Ledger cannot exist or operate without XRP. He said this is what many people miss when they compare XRP to other digital assets. The XRP ledger was built in a way that makes XRP an important part of how value moves and settles across the network. He noted that XRP’s speed, ability to handle many transactions, and connection with other systems make it stand out from most blockchains in the crypto space. Using Ripple’s payment tools as examples, Mickle showed how XRP plays a key role in helping different kinds of assets, like stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cryptocurrencies, move smoothly across decentralized systems. These tools make it possible to send money anywhere in the world quickly and cheaply, without going through banks or middlemen. Mickle added that XRP is a native digital asset, while stablecoins are tied to fiat money and rely on traditional financial systems to keep their value. He said this is what makes XRP unique and gives it real independence in the digital economy. This distinction, he said, is the very essence of crypto and the reason XRP continues to matter as a foundational digital asset . According to Mickle, understanding this difference is what separates those who genuinely understand crypto from those who do not.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 00:00:25

Billions of people across the world are going to be left out due to various reasons like language barriers and electricity availability, and fuel inequalities, as outlined in the tech firm’s “AI Diffusion Report,” which outlines how AI use, infrastructure, and innovation are spreading globally. Language barriers worsen the global inequality in AI While Microsoft acknowledges that AI tech is fast growing and spreading like no other tech before, there are fears this AI wave will not be experienced by everyone in the world therefore “deepen global inequality.” According to the Microsoft report , most AI models are trained in English, which means billions across the world cannot access the technology in their native languages. According to Microsoft, AI speaks English. The report indicates that while English and other high-resource languages are used to train AI, the majority of the world’s 7,000 languages are effectively excluded from AI systems, therefore limiting access for billions of people. According to Microsoft, low-resource languages like Hausa, Bengali, and Chichewa are under-represented in major AI developments, therefore limiting access to users in those regions who cannot interact with tools that cannot understand them. The tech giant opines that unless digital infrastructure and education catch up, “this gap will define who benefits from AI for decades to come” and could cement a new technological divide. Microsoft cites the stark infrastructure gap as problematic In this report, Microsoft indicated that over 1.2 billion people now use AI tools, which the tech giant admitted the adoption rate far outpaced electricity, computers and the internet. However, despite this rapid adoption and spread of the technology, Microsoft maintains that the diffusion is not even. In the report, Microsoft highlights the widening gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots” citing countries with power, data, and skills to use AI, and those that still lack the basics. Countries like UAE, with 59.4% adoption, Singapore at 58.6%, and Norway with 51.9% are leading the world in AI use. According to Microsoft, these countries have vast electricity, near-universal internet access, and while their populations are digitally fluent. Yet in some parts of Sub-Sahara Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, fewer than 10% of the populations use AI due to factors like low internet penetration, unreliable power, and limited access to the devices as well as the basic education to needed to use new technologies. In Africa, Microsoft recently highlighted the vast opportunities for AI developments. It however demands coordinated, inclusive effort involving governments, education systems, industry and civil society, according to Microsoft. “The challenge is not only scale, but also coordination. Fragmented efforts and a lack of unified strategy continue to slow momentum and dilute impact,” said Microsoft. “To fully realize AI’s potential for job creation, Africa must build a coordinated, inclusive skilling ecosystem, where government, education, industry, and civil society work together to shape the AI economy,” added Microsoft . The report also highlights the infrastructure gap that exists between countries, which has an impact on AI adoption. In terms of energy, the US leads with 53.7 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity followed by China with 31.9GW, then Germany with 8.5GW, and the United Kingdom with 7.4GW. According to the report the AI diffusion is dependent on electricity and computing capacity as much as on algorithms or data, and that over 700 million people still lack reliable power.

Nasdaq-listed Bitmain, a company increasingly focused on digital asset investments, has just made another substantial Bitmain ETH investment . This latest acquisition signals a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future, capturing the attention of investors and market watchers alike. What Does Bitmain’s Latest ETH Investment Entail? According to a report by Onchainlens, Bitmain recently acquired an additional 7,660 Ethereum (ETH) tokens. This impressive purchase is valued at approximately $29.54 million, executed through the well-known digital asset financial services firm, Galaxy Digital. This transaction underscores Bitmain’s continued strategy to bolster its holdings in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This substantial Bitmain ETH investment is not an isolated event. It reflects a growing trend among institutional entities to diversify their portfolios with leading digital assets. For Bitmain, which has historically been a dominant force in Bitcoin mining hardware, this consistent accumulation of Ethereum represents a strategic pivot and a clear belief in the platform’s long-term potential. Why is Bitmain Deepening Its Ethereum Commitment? Bitmain’s decision to continuously invest in Ethereum stems from several compelling factors. Ethereum is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is a robust blockchain platform that powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its utility and innovation continue to attract significant developer activity and user adoption. Moreover, Ethereum’s successful transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with ‘The Merge’ has enhanced its scalability and energy efficiency. This upgrade makes Ethereum an even more attractive asset for long-term holders like Bitmain. The company likely views its Bitmain ETH investment as a way to capitalize on Ethereum’s ongoing evolution and its pivotal role in the future of Web3. Impact of Bitmain’s ETH Investment on the Broader Market When a prominent, Nasdaq-listed firm like Bitmain makes such a significant investment, it sends a powerful signal to the entire crypto market. This move can boost investor confidence, particularly among institutional players who often look for cues from their peers. Such large-scale acquisitions can also contribute to positive price momentum for Ethereum, as demand increases.

The latest update on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows that fear continues to grip the cryptocurrency market. This crucial indicator, which provides a snapshot of investor sentiment, recently rose four points to 33. While a slight increase, it still firmly places the market in a state of ‘fear,’ according to data from Alternative.me. Understanding this index is vital for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful tool designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the crypto market. It operates on a simple principle: extreme fear can signal a buying opportunity, while excessive greed often indicates a market correction is imminent. This index helps investors gauge whether the market is overly emotional, which can lead to irrational decisions. How exactly does this index arrive at its score? It’s a sophisticated calculation, pulling data from various corners of the crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of its key components: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. Higher volatility often suggests a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): Analyzing current trading volumes and momentum helps determine if there’s strong buying or selling pressure. Social Media Mentions (15%): Tracking keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter can reveal widespread emotional responses. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls directly ask investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin market cap dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived ‘safer’ asset. Google Search Volume (10%): Analyzing search trends for crypto-related terms helps identify public interest and potential panic or excitement. Navigating the ‘Fear’ Zone: What Does a Score of 33 Imply? A score of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market is experiencing significant fear. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing; in fact, many seasoned investors view periods of high fear as potential opportunities. When fear is high, prices often drop, creating a chance to acquire assets at lower valuations. However, it also presents challenges: Potential for Panic Selling: New or inexperienced investors might sell their holdings at a loss due to widespread fear. Increased Volatility: Fearful markets can be unpredictable, with sharp price swings. Uncertainty: The future direction of the market becomes less clear, demanding careful research. Conversely, a score closer to 100, indicating ‘extreme greed,’ often signals that the market might be overheated and due for a correction. Historically, buying during extreme fear and selling during extreme greed has proven to be a successful strategy for some. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Respond to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index points to fear, it’s a signal to act thoughtfully, not impulsively. Here are some actionable insights: Research Diligently: Use this time to delve into projects you believe have strong fundamentals. Lower prices can make strong assets more attractive. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consistently invest a fixed amount over time. This strategy helps mitigate risk in volatile markets. Manage Emotions: The index itself is a reminder that emotions drive markets. Avoid making decisions based purely on fear or excitement. Stick to your investment plan. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help weather market downturns. Remember, the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. It provides valuable context, but individual investment decisions should always align with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. The Enduring Value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in a Dynamic Market In conclusion, the current reading of 33 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index underscores a market still wrestling with apprehension. While this state of fear can be daunting, it also presents a unique opportunity for those who approach it with a well-informed and disciplined strategy. By understanding the components of this index and its historical implications, investors can make more rational decisions, potentially turning market anxiety into long-term gains. It’s a powerful reminder that in the world of crypto, emotional intelligence can be as valuable as market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a low score on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicate? A low score, particularly below 25, indicates ‘extreme fear.’ This suggests that investors are highly anxious, often leading to panic selling and lower asset prices. Historically, these periods have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term investors. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh perspective on market sentiment based on the latest data points from volatility, trading volume, social media, and other factors. Q3: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index solely based on Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s market cap dominance is one factor, the index considers broader market sentiment indicators, including social media mentions and Google search trends that often reflect overall cryptocurrency interest, not just Bitcoin specifically. Q4: Can I rely solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for investment decisions? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should be used as one of many tools in your investment analysis. It provides valuable insight into market psychology but should be combined with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your personal financial strategy.

Tokens sit at $0.035 in Phase 6, 80% filled after a 250% climb from $0.01, setting up 400% gains to the $0.06 launch. This setup echoes Solana’s early surge, where utility met timing for massive returns. As the best crypto to buy now, MUTM offers DeFi entry at a fraction of future value, urging quick action before Phase 7’s 20% jump to $0.04. What crypto to buy now? One that mirrors proven winners like SOL, blending accessibility with growth potential that savvy holders have already spotted. Solana’s 2020-2021 Run: A Blueprint for Explosive Gains Solana has had an astonishing growth rate since its inception in 2020. The coin hit a nadir of $0.51 in May but soon rocketed to $260 in November 2021. The growth took a whopping 18 months to achieve a staggering 51,000% return on investment. The lucky few that invested in SOL when it hit rock bottom cashed in on its scalability and made life-changing gains. As the best crypto to buy now fades into yesterday’s news, echoes of SOL’s rise prompt a hunt for the next altcoin ready to replicate such multiples. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has stepped into that spotlight, offering DeFi crypto seekers a comparable launchpad at today’s $0.035. MUTM’s Presale Phases Lock in Early Advantages Mutuum Finance has structured its presale in 11 distinct phases to cap sales at a predefined price as a token of appreciation for contributors. However, Phase 6 is racing past incredibly as 80% has sold out for delivering tokens to buyers worth $0.035. There has been a phenomenal 250% increase in token value from Phase 1’s price of $0.01. The number of holders is 17,600 and has pumped in a total of $18,250,000 to this structure that has proved its allure as the top crypto to invest in to ensure a gradual growth. The DeFi crypto community has joined hand in hand since Phase 6 is close to completion. Community Giveaways Add to Holder Enthusiasm MUTM Finance has really kick-started its presale with a giveaway event where a total of $100,000 reward is given out in a way that $10,000 is won by 10 lucky winners out of its 17,600 holders. The event has really helped to attract more funds to MUTM. As a powerhouse in the world of altcoins, MUTM has made passive investment an active pursuit, where a single entry can yield a windfall over and above your foundation. Quickly realized gains in this area have led investors to understand that better gains come with a deeper level of loyalty. Thus emerges MUTM as the top crypto to buy and hold. Buy-and-Distribute Fuels Token Demand Mutuum Finance has a buy-and-distribute system in place where it directs all fees from its protocol to buy back MUTM tokens on open markets and subsequently distribute to stakers. As a result, this has created a value loop that enhances MUTM tokens. Currently, with a total of $18,250,000 raised for this project, MUTM has emerged as a DeFi crypto specially designed to increase in value. Stakers have watched distributions pad their yields, turning protocol success into personal wins that keep capital locked in. As altcoin cycles heat up, this loop has promised compounding edges, where fees from expanding use recycle into holder benefits. Early movers at $0.035 have positioned for 400% to launch, but this feature elevates long-term holds, making MUTM the best crypto to buy now for effortless upside. Security Audits Forge Unshakable Trust Mutuum Finance has emphasized safety as a well-audited project with a CertiK audit with a safety level of 90/100 for its tokens and a total bug bounty reward of $50,000 that urges security specialists to investigate for vulnerabilities even prior to its launch. The bounty reward amounts are tiered: $200 to $2,000 for critical vulnerabilities has reassured some 17,600 investors of its mutual fund safety. Thus, MUTM is solidified as a worthy choice for risk-averse DeFi cryptocurrency traders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured Solana’s essence at $0.035, where presale smarts and trust mechanisms promise 51,000%-style leaps for the best crypto to buy now. This DeFi crypto has primed portfolios for altcoin dominance, recapping SOL’s blueprint with modern edges.

The sharp sell-off on October 10 not only flushed leveraged positions across the market but also disrupted the uptrend ETH had been building throughout the summer. Since then, price action has weakened, and momentum has shifted toward the downside, raising concerns among analysts that a deeper correction could unfold if buyers fail to defend key demand levels in the days ahead. Related Reading: $780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks Despite these technical challenges, on-chain and institutional flow data tell a different story beneath the surface. Large-scale investors — including funds, corporate entities, and crypto-native institutions — continue to accumulate ETH during the pullback. The divergence between price weakness and institutional accumulation creates a pivotal setup for Ethereum. If ETH can stabilize and reclaim the $4,000 threshold, it may re-ignite bullish momentum. But failure to hold support could open the door to further downside before a sustainable recovery emerges. Bitmine Adds ETH as Institutional Accumulation Climbs According to data tracked by Lookonchain, institutional player Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation strategy. Purchasing 44,036 ETH — worth approximately $166 million — during the recent market pullback. This purchase lifts Bitmine’s total holdings to roughly 3.16 million ETH, valued at around $12.15 billion, reinforcing the company’s position as one of the largest Ethereum holders globally. Such sizeable buying activity during periods of price weakness highlights a notable divergence between institutional behavior and short-term market sentiment. While retail traders and leveraged participants may be shaken by Ethereum’s inability to reclaim the $4,000 level, long-horizon buyers appear unfazed. For them, price dips represent accumulating opportunities rather than reasons for concern. This duality is becoming increasingly evident across the market: spot inflows, exchange outflows, and whale accumulation metrics all point to growing long-term conviction, even as the chart reflects hesitation and downward pressure. This divergence underscores a familiar pattern in crypto market structure. Price action often lags underlying fundamentals, particularly during transitional phases where macro catalysts and liquidity shifts are still being digested. Ethereum remains structurally supported by rising institutional participation, increasing staking demand, and expanding Layer-2 ecosystems — all of which strengthen its long-term investment thesis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Records Over $300B Spot Volume In October – Investors Shift Away From Leverage Ethereum Tests Key Support Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $3,847, testing a critical support zone after failing to hold above $4,000 and rejecting from the $4,200 resistance area earlier this week. The daily chart shows ETH breaking below both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, signaling weakening momentum and a shift toward a more defensive market posture. This breakdown places increased pressure on bulls to defend the $3,800 region — a level that has repeatedly acted as a pivot point over the past two months. If ETH loses this support, the next meaningful demand zone lies near $3,500, followed by the 200-day moving average around $3,200, which would serve as a deeper structural retest within the longer-term uptrend. For now, however, ETH remains above its long-term trend line, meaning the broader bullish structure is intact despite short-term weakness. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens After 8 Years – 1,500 ETH Sent to Kraken After 8 Years On the upside, bulls need to reclaim $4,000 and then $4,150–$4,200 to revive bullish momentum and break the series of lower highs forming since September. Until that happens, price action favors consolidation and caution. With macro shifts underway and institutional accumulation rising, Ethereum’s chart suggests a wait-and-see phase, where holding support becomes crucial before any renewed upside attempt.

His recent statements have drawn sharp attention across the broader crypto community, particularly for their bold claims about XRP’s role in a truly decentralized financial ecosystem. Ripple CTO Highlights XRP Ledger’s Unique Autonomy An X social media account named ‘Stellar Ripple’ has spotlighted a statement from Schwartz, underscoring what he sees as a defining difference between the XRP Ledger and other blockchain networks. Stellar Ripple stated in its post on Thursday that the Ripple CTO dropped a “truth bomb,” cutting deep into the philosophy of decentralization within blockchains. In his post, Schwartz questioned whether users want to be their own bank or empower another intermediary in disguise. According to him, despite the decentralized branding of blockchain networks , they are ultimately designed for control, allowing certain participants to set the rules, impose transaction fees, and maintain leverage over users’ financial autonomy. In contrast, he described the XRP Ledger as a space free from such mediators, government influence , and protocols that could freeze or reverse transactions. This suggests that XRPL represents a purer or more superior interpretation of the decentralization narrative, where every transaction remains unalterable, resistant to censorship, and uncontrolled . Schwartz went on to explain that, unlike most digital assets, XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, exists as the only counterparty-free currency that anyone in the world can access without risk of default or confiscation. He noted that this unique feature helps XRP gain value from the activity generated on the blockchain network . Essentially, this implies that XRP’s price is intertwined with the growth of the ledger itself, providing a foundational layer that ensures liquidity and stability across every transaction. XRPL Expands Into Genomic Data Anchoring As the XRPL ecosystem continues to grow , real-world adoption is gaining momentum. Crypto commentator John Squire recently pointed out an exciting new development from DNA Protocol, a system that anchors DNA to the XRP Ledger. According to the report, DNAOnChain has officially launched operations in Tunisia, extending its reach to broader markets. Notably, this project marks a significant expansion of XRPL’s use cases by anchoring genomic identity data directly on the blockchain. Through DNAOnChain, Squire states that certified laboratories can now securely record and verify genomic data on XRPL, effectively bridging biotechnology with blockchain innovation. The integration is expected to enhance transparency and immutability in medical and genetic research , ensuring that sensitive information is permanently verifiable without compromising privacy. More importantly, this new development signals XRPL’s versatility beyond cross-border payments , highlighting its potential as a data integrity layer for real-world applications. It also demonstrates XRP’s growing adoption in new industries beyond digital assets and finance.","Ripple|David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz|DNA Protocol|DNAOnChain|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 01:00:19

A significant sum of 250 million USDC minted has been reported at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a signal indicating shifts in market demand and liquidity within the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the implications of such a large issuance is crucial for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Understanding Why USDC Gets Minted When we hear about new USDC minted , it means new stablecoins have been created. But why does this happen? USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It maintains a stable value, making it a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. The minting process is typically demand-driven. Increased Demand: Investors want to convert fiat currency into USDC to participate in DeFi, trade on exchanges, or hold a stable asset. Market Liquidity: More USDC means more liquidity for trading pairs, lending, and borrowing protocols. On-ramping: It serves as a gateway for new capital entering crypto, moving large sums efficiently. Circle, the issuer of USDC, mints new tokens only when there is a corresponding deposit of US dollars into their reserve accounts. This ensures each USDC is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. What Does This USDC Minted Event Signify? The minting of 250 million USDC minted is a substantial event, often pointing to several potential market scenarios. Such a large influx of stablecoins can have various ripple effects.

A significant event recently caught the attention of the crypto community: a massive 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This report, flagged by Whale Alert, signals substantial activity within the stablecoin ecosystem. When such a large amount of a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency like USDC is created, it often sparks questions about market demand, liquidity, and the broader implications for digital finance. Let’s explore what this significant minting event truly means for investors and the wider crypto landscape. What Does This Massive USDC Minting Event Signify? The creation of 250 million USDC minted at the Treasury is more than just a number; it reflects dynamic forces at play in the cryptocurrency market. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. It is backed by fully reserved assets, primarily cash and short-duration U.S. government bonds. When new USDC is minted, it typically indicates a rising demand for dollar-denominated digital assets. This demand can stem from various sources: Increased Investor Inflow: New capital entering the crypto market, often converted into stablecoins before being deployed into other cryptocurrencies. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: More users participating in DeFi protocols, requiring stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Institutional Adoption: Large financial institutions or corporations using stablecoins for settlement, remittances, or as a treasury asset. Essentially, this minting suggests that more people or entities want to hold or use digital dollars within the blockchain ecosystem. It’s a clear indicator of growing confidence and utility for stablecoins. The Mechanics Behind a USDC Mint How exactly does USDC minted come into existence? The process is straightforward and regulated. Circle, the issuer of USDC, works with regulated financial institutions. When an authorized participant wants to acquire USDC, they deposit an equivalent amount of US dollars into a Circle-managed bank account. Once the funds are verified, Circle instructs the smart contract to mint the corresponding amount of new USDC. These newly created tokens are then delivered to the participant’s crypto wallet. This mechanism ensures that every USDC token in circulation is backed by an actual dollar or dollar-equivalent asset held in reserve, providing its stability. This transparent, auditable process is crucial for maintaining trust in USDC as a reliable stablecoin. Regular attestations by independent accounting firms further verify these reserves. Implications for the Crypto Market and Beyond A significant amount of USDC minted can have several ripple effects across the crypto market: Enhanced Liquidity: More USDC in circulation means greater liquidity, making it easier and more efficient to trade between different cryptocurrencies. This can reduce slippage and improve overall market efficiency. Fueling DeFi Growth: Stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi. Additional USDC can be deployed into various DeFi protocols, increasing total value locked (TVL) and potentially boosting yields for participants. Gateway for Traditional Finance: For institutions looking to enter the crypto space, stablecoins like USDC offer a less volatile entry point compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Large mints can signal increasing institutional interest and readiness to engage with digital assets. Global Remittances and Payments: USDC facilitates faster and cheaper international transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Increased supply can support greater adoption in these use cases. While the immediate impact might be a boost in market liquidity, the long-term implications point towards a maturing and expanding digital economy where stablecoins play a central role. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: What Users Should Know Understanding the dynamics of USDC minted and its role is important for any crypto participant. Here are some key takeaways: Stability: USDC offers a haven from crypto market volatility, making it suitable for storing value or executing trades without exposure to price swings. Utility: It’s widely accepted across exchanges and DeFi platforms, making it a versatile asset for various financial activities. Transparency: Circle’s commitment to regular audits and public attestations provides a level of transparency regarding its reserves, which is vital for trust. However, it is also important to consider the centralized nature of USDC. While this offers stability and regulatory compliance, it also means reliance on a central issuer. Users should always be aware of the underlying mechanisms and potential regulatory shifts that could impact stablecoins. The recent minting of 250 million USDC underscores the growing demand for stable, reliable digital assets in the evolving financial landscape. This event highlights increased market activity, whether from individual investors or institutional players, seeking the benefits of blockchain technology without the inherent volatility of other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to expand, stablecoins like USDC will undoubtedly remain a crucial component, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of decentralized applications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC, or USD Coin, is a type of cryptocurrency known as a stablecoin. It is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability makes it a popular choice for traders and investors looking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why is USDC minted? A2: USDC is minted in response to demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire USDC, they deposit US dollars with Circle, the issuer. For every dollar deposited and verified, a new USDC is created, or “minted,” ensuring that each USDC in circulation is fully backed by an equivalent amount of fiat currency or highly liquid assets. Q3: Who issues USDC? A3: USDC is issued by Circle, a regulated financial technology company. Circle collaborates with various financial institutions to manage the reserves that back USDC and ensure its operational integrity and compliance. Q4: How does a large USDC mint affect the crypto market? A4: A large amount of USDC minted often indicates increased demand for stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. This can lead to enhanced market liquidity, making it easier for traders to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies. It can also signal new capital entering the market or increased activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Q5: Is USDC safe to use? A5: USDC is generally considered one of the safer stablecoins due to its regulatory compliance, transparent reserve attestations, and backing by high-quality assets. However, like all financial instruments, it carries some risks, including potential regulatory changes or reliance on the central issuer, Circle. Users should always conduct their own research.

Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss Hit Just 1.3% Recently In a new post on X, senior researcher at on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, CryptoVizArt, has talked about how Bitcoin currently compares to past bearish periods in terms of Relative Unrealized Loss . The Unrealized Loss is an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total amount of loss (in USD) that BTC investors as a whole are carrying in their wallets. This metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the blockchain to find what price it was last moved at. If this previous transaction price was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token could be assumed to be sitting on some net unrealized loss right now. The exact amount of loss that the coin carries is naturally equal to the difference between the two prices. The Unrealized Loss sums up this value for all loss tokens on the blockchain. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the indicator is of interest, called the Relative Unrealized Loss. This metric calculates the holder loss as a percentage of BTC’s market cap . The advantage of the Relative Unrealized Loss over the usual metric is that it makes a comparison across two different BTC cycles more reliable. Bitcoin has seen significant growth in stored capital with each cycle, so the absolute amount of loss held by investors in bear markets also rises with each cycle. By accounting for the market cap, the indicator normalizes the Unrealized Loss across cycles. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoVizArt that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Relative Unrealized Loss has remained at low levels during the past few months, indicating that loss among holders has stayed low in comparison to the market cap. Even during the cryptocurrency’s latest drop, the indicator only reached a value of 1.3%, corresponding to investor loss being just 1.3% of the market cap. “In mild bear markets, this typically exceeds 5%, and in severe ones, it exceeds 50%,” explained the Glassnode researcher. “The market pain is still far from what defines a true bear phase.” It now remains to be seen how Bitcoin will develop in the coming days, and whether the Relative Unrealized Loss will cross one of the bear market thresholds. BTC Price Bitcoin fell below $107,000 during its recent decline, but the coin has since seen a small rebound back to $109,500.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bear Market|Bitcoin Pain|Bitcoin unrealized loss|btc|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-01 02:00:58

Dogecoin Whales Shed 440 Million Tokens Over Last 72 Hours As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, whales have reduced their Dogecoin supply over the past few days. The indicator cited by the analyst is the “Supply Distribution” from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of DOGE that investors belonging to a given coin range are holding as a whole. In the context of the current topic, “whales” are the traders of interest. Their wallet range is typically defined as 10 million to 100 million tokens. At the current DOGE exchange rate, the lower end converts to $1.8 million and the upper end to $18 million. Given the scale, only big-money holders would be able to qualify for the group. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles To Hold Key Support: Could $88,000 Be Next? Such investors can carry some degree of influence in the market, so movements related to them can be worth watching. Their behavior doesn’t always impact the memecoin’s price, but it can still be revealing about the sentiment among this key cohort. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution of the whales over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales have seen a sharp decline in their supply recently, indicating that these humongous holders have been distributing. In total, the group has shed 440 million DOGE (worth $81.4 million) from its collective holdings during the last 72 hours. Alongside this trend, the DOGE price has slid down, implying that the whale selloff may have had a role to play. The Supply Distribution of this cohort could now be monitored, as where it goes next could potentially contain hints about what’s coming for the cryptocurrency’s price. Earlier in the week, Martinez shared another chart related to Dogecoin, this one showing a technical analysis (TA) pattern that DOGE has been trading inside on the 12-hour timeframe. From the graph, it’s visible that the pattern in question is an Ascending Channel, a type of consolidation channel that appears whenever an asset trades between two parallel trendlines sloped upward. The support line of the channel is located at $0.18. In the post, the analyst noted that holding this level could be key for DOGE. Following the whale selling, the coin is now retesting the level, with a brief fall below it even happening on Thursday, before the memecoin recovered back above it on Friday.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published Friday, Scott said both governments had reached a kind of balance before China decided to “fire shots” by threatening to cut off exports of critical minerals. That, he warned, crossed a line. He said China will not be able to keep using rare earths as a tool of pressure, especially now that it showed its hand. Scott pointed out that the United States sees the move as a major miscalculation.By showing its willingness to use rare earths to hit back, China exposed itself. Washington is already pushing for alternatives, and this new escalation has only sped things up. Scott said the U.S. and its partners no longer have the luxury of assuming those minerals will be freely available. Scott, the soybean farmer, says he’s felt the pain too Scott also took a moment to talk about the other front in this trade fight: soybeans. During an interview with Martha Raddatz on ABC News, Scott said, “I’m actually a soybean farmer… I have felt this pain, too.” China’s been effectively blocking U.S. soybeans for months, and Scott happens to be one of the people impacted. Sort of. He owns farmland in North Dakota where soybeans and corn are grown. His holdings are worth somewhere between $5 million and $25 million, and they generate between $100,000 and $1 million a year, based on his financial disclosure. But let’s not pretend Scott’s depending on those crops. Forbes says his net worth is about $600 million. So when China, once America’s biggest buyer, slapped heavy tariffs on soybeans in May, after President Donald Trump imposed duties on Chinese imports, the pain wasn’t evenly spread. Since the tariffs, China hasn’t bought any American soybeans at all. Regular farmers, the ones who depend on crop sales, are the ones really feeling it. Scott said the embargo is hurting, but the truth is, he can take the hit better than most. Still, the fact that the Treasury Secretary is directly affected by a trade standoff with China adds a strange twist. TikTok deal moves forward after Trump order On top of the rare earths and soybeans, Scott said the TikTok deal is finally getting off the ground. During an interview with Fox Business, he confirmed that in Kuala Lumpur, both sides finalized the agreement and are waiting for it to move ahead. “I would expect that would go forward in the coming weeks and months, and we’ll finally see a resolution to that,” he said. The fight over TikTok has dragged on for more than a year and a half. In 2024, Congress passed a law ordering TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell off the app’s U.S. assets by January 2025. Trump followed that up with an executive order on September 25, saying the sale plan meets the law’s national security conditions. The clock’s ticking. Buyers have 120 days to seal the deal, and Trump pushed the final deadline to January 20, 2026. Under the new plan, ByteDance will only hold less than 20% of TikTok U.S. and get just one seat out of seven on the new board. The other six will be Americans. The app’s algorithm, used by 170 million Americans, will be retrained and monitored by U.S. cybersecurity partners, with full control shifting to the new joint venture. Even so, John Moolenaar, the Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on China, is still not sold. He said the licensing agreement for the algorithm, which is part of the deal, “would raise serious concerns.” China’s Commerce Ministry, on its end, said it plans to “properly handle” the matter and will work with the U.S. to sort out remaining issues. But Washington seems to have made up its mind.

The discussions are still under due diligence though, so nothing is finalized. The deal may close later this year or early next year, but terms could still change and the entire plan could fall apart. This has not been announced publicly, and those speaking on the matter apparently requested anonymity. Coinbase Ventures, the venture capital arm of Coinbase, is already an existing investor in BVNK. Representatives for BVNK did not respond to inquiries. The largest US crypto exchange said: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation. Driven by our mission to expand economic freedom globally, we actively explore various opportunities — whether through building, acquiring, partnering, or investing — to advance our mission.” The tone is neutral, but the move fits with Coinbase’s push to expand outside pure trading revenue. Coinbase pushes deeper into stablecoins and payments Reports earlier this week said Coinbase has exclusivity in the takeover talks.That means no other bidders are actively in the running now.The talks followed a full bidding process. The timing lines up with increased activity in the stablecoin market after the first U.S. regulation for stablecoins passed in July. Since then, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, along with major banks, have been testing blockchain‑based tools for faster and cheaper payments. Almost 20% of Coinbase’s Q3 revenue came from stablecoins, according to the company’s shareholder letter released Thursday. The exchange has been pushing to drive more usage of USDC, the stablecoin it earns revenue from in partnership with Circle. One example: a payments integration with Shopify. On a call after earnings, Coinbase executives said they are actively searching for acquisitions in the payments sector, confirming that this direction is a core expansion plan. BVNK runs a platform that lets merchants accept payments, including in stablecoins. This is where the deal matters. Earlier this year, Coinbase launched Coinbase Business, a service for payments, invoicing, and financial operations. BVNK’s system could be plugged into that to create a stablecoin‑based banking and payments experience for companies that do not want to depend on traditional banking rails. BVNK was founded in 2021 and has raised $90 million in funding. Its investors include Citi Ventures, Haun Ventures, and Visa. If the deal closes, Coinbase would take another step away from depending on trading volumes. If it fails, nothing changes except that we all now know exactly what direction Coinbase is steering toward; payments built on stablecoins.

Bitcoin dropped below $109,000, highlighting the fragility of investor confidence. High leverage positions fueled the cascade, erasing gains made over the past week. While traders panic and market sentiment swings between extreme fear and false optimism, one project seems untouched: Noomez ($NNZ) . Its off-exchange presale structure protects investors from price swings, proving that not every market dip means danger. Why Did Crypto Crash? A mix of overleveraged longs and uncertainty around macroeconomic indicators triggered this correction. When Bitcoin’s chart broke below key support levels, automated liquidations accelerated across the market. The entire ecosystem followed as altcoins tumbled, and liquidity evaporated. Noomez , however, operates on its own timeline. It isn’t tied to centralized exchange volatility or speculative whale movements. Each presale stage runs independently, giving early backers clear visibility on price, supply, and distribution. Why Did Crypto Crash Today? Short-term data shows that the recent drop came after another spike in Bitcoin open interest, followed by a sudden flush-out. On platforms like CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s 24-hour volume jumped, reflecting panic selling more than organic trading. Meanwhile, Noomez continues its presale momentum. The live tracker shows over $4,500 raised and 39 holders in its first stage, a sign of steady early participation even as the broader market contracts. Such a quiet confidence underscores how structured presales, like Noomez, are designed to withstand volatility. Will Crypto Crash Again? What Comes Next Market corrections are a natural part of every bull cycle. The key isn’t predicting the next fall but positioning before the recovery. Historically, markets that shed excess leverage early tend to rebound stronger once liquidity returns. That’s why seasoned investors are allocating small, calculated portions of their portfolios into early-stage tokens like Noomez ($NNZ) . It’s a strategy based on timing and entering while others hesitate, before prices begin their inevitable climb. The Noomez Presale: Structure Amid Chaos Unlike hype-driven tokens, Noomez built a system that rewards patience and transparency. The Noomez presale accepts multiple blockchains: ETH, BTC, BSC, SOL, and BASE, making it accessible to a wider audience. Every transaction updates in real-time, with total raised and holder counts publicly displayed. At its current token price of $0.00001 , early participants are securing positions before the next price bump. Each phase has a fixed supply, and unsold tokens are burned at end‑of‑stage, adding a deflationary element. With 28 stages in total, each structured phase ensures sustainable growth instead of artificial spikes. A Safer Haven for Uncertain Times While centralized exchanges flash red and sentiment collapses after the Crypto Crash , Noomez keeps building. Its deflationary tokenomics, locked liquidity, and real-time data feed create a transparent foundation that traditional projects lack. Investors are committing to a long-term system built for steady growth rather than short-term speculation. Countless projects rise and fall through cycles, but few manage to stay grounded when volatility peaks. Noomez ($NNZ) feels like one of those rare cases where preparation meets opportunity. Pro Tip: Watch how fast the early presale stages fill. In volatile markets, consistent progress is often the clearest signal of investor trust.

53887192,618046,1761966014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53887192.jpeg,Bitcoin Flatlines As LTH Distribution Hits 810K Coins: Demand Still Absorbing Supply,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-flatlines-lth-distribution-hits-810k-demand/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim the $110,000 level after a sharp downside move pressured markets and triggered renewed volatility across the crypto landscape. While this pullback has been uncomfortable for short-term traders, it remains modest compared to the October 10 liquidation crash, which forced out excessive leverage and marked one of the most aggressive sell-offs of the year. Despite the short-term turbulence, Bitcoin remains within its broader consolidation range — but the market now enters a critical phase where direction must soon resolve. Over the coming weeks, macro developments, liquidity flows, and investor positioning will likely determine whether the next impulse is upward or downward. Fresh CryptoQuant data shows that since July 1, long-term holders (LTHs) have been steadily distributing coins, selling into strength as BTC approached and later tested all-time highs. This supply overhang has contributed to muted upside momentum, even as demand has proven strong enough to absorb much of the selling. Bitcoin Market Still Absorbs Supply According to analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin continues to navigate a complex supply-demand environment defined by steady profit-taking from long-term holders (LTHs). Since July 1, LTHs have distributed roughly 810,000 BTC, reducing their total holdings from 15.5 million to 14.6 million BTC. This represents one of the most significant distribution phases in the current cycle — a clear indication that seasoned holders have been locking in profits after years of accumulation and strategic positioning. What makes this dynamic particularly striking is that Bitcoin has printed new all-time highs twice during this distribution phase, demonstrating that market demand has remained robust enough to absorb the substantial supply being offloaded. Historically, similar phases of distribution from long-term holders often accompany major cycle inflection points, as capital shifts from early investors to new participants entering the market. Adler emphasizes that while this absorption reflects market strength, it also sets a ceiling on aggressive upside momentum. As long as long-term holders continue to realize profits, the path higher is likely to remain gradual and choppy rather than explosively parabolic. Strong demand is supporting prices and preventing deeper corrections — but supply pressure is simultaneously preventing sustained breakout acceleration. The takeaway is clear: Bitcoin is not lacking demand; it is working through supply once long-term distribution slows — whether due to exhaustion or macro reinforcement — upside potential could expand meaningfully. Until then, price action may continue to grind sideways with upside attempts meeting resistance as supply transitions to new owners. Bitcoin Holds Above Key MA Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $109,900, attempting to stabilize after a recent downside move pushed price back toward the 200-day moving average (red line) — a key long-term support level that currently sits near $108,000. This region has become an important defense line for bulls, structuring the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s consolidation range. Each time BTC has approached this zone over the past month, buyers have stepped in, signaling continued demand despite short-term weakness. However, reclaiming momentum remains a challenge. BTC continues to struggle below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, which have converged overhead and now act as layered resistance between $112,000 and $114,000. A sustained break above this cluster is required to re-establish bullish momentum and set up another attempt toward the $117,500 resistance — the cycle’s key Point of Control and the level that has repeatedly capped upside moves since summer. If Bitcoin loses the $108,000 support, a deeper correction toward $105,000–$103,000 becomes likely, where liquidity and previous reaction levels sit. For now, the technical picture remains neutral-to-cautious: bulls are holding essential support, but the burden remains on buyers to reclaim lost moving averages and flip market structure back in their favor.
