The update follows a pause in open applications and sets a clearer path for funding across the ecosystem. The post positions the change within the ongoing growth of tools, protocols, and public goods. The team writes that the previous intake stretched its limited capacity, so the new approach concentrates efforts on areas identified alongside other Foundation groups. 1/ ESP’s grant applications are now OPEN! Our new grants program is structured through two pathways: Wishlist Requests for Proposals (RFPs) Explore the new opportunities and apply below! https://t.co/qg4gBL62ED — EF Ecosystem Support Program (@EF_ESP) November 3, 2025 ESP Grants: Wishlist and RFP Tracks “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the post reads. “However, with a lean team and broad scope, the growing volume of applications stretched our resources, limiting our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” “Our new model addresses this by shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach, working closely with other EF teams to ensure that funding aligns with the ecosystem’s priorities and drives meaningful impact,” said the Ethereum Foundation. ESP remains open to applicants while channeling submissions through two paths that frame needs and outcomes. The Wishlist sets high-level goals and leaves room for varied approaches, inviting builders to propose initiatives that meet those goals without prescribing a single design. Ethereum Community and Builder Impact Requests for Proposals describe a defined problem and the expected deliverables, including scope, requirements, application windows, and estimated duration. This creates a schedule and a measurement plan that applicants can review before submitting. Office Hours continue for guidance on whether a concept aligns with a Wishlist area or with an active RFP, so teams can target the right track from the start. ESP says the first set of Wishlist items and RFPs is live across cryptography, privacy, the application layer, security, and community growth . The team notes that “Wishlist items and RFPs will be added and updated based on the evolving needs of the ecosystem,” making an ongoing pipeline rather than a single round. The announcement also outlines coordination and support beyond funding. ESP plans to align grantmaking with other Foundation groups, provide guidance to grantees, connect projects to peers, and draw insights from outcomes to guide future calls.

53998284,https://cryptonews.com/?p=447012,1762209000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53998284.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, Aster by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-cardano-aster-by-the-end-of-2025w/,"Google’s advanced Large Language Model, Gemini AI, suggests that investors holding XRP, Cardano, and Aster will see returns many times their initial investment between now and the holiday season. Despite a prolonged downturn through most of October, optimism is still high thanks to the U.S. debut of Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs, alongside the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut. US regulators are still very much on the crypto ball, while macroeconomic concerns around inflation are cooling, creating an appetite for risk. These developments point toward strong altcoin performance driving the next bull cycle, which may even begin this year, with Gemini forecasting XRP, Cardano, and Aster as the leaders. XRP ($XRP): Gemini Predicts 400% Gains by Christmas Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) appears as one of the top breakout contenders in Gemini’s models, with projections showing a potential rally to between $5.85 and $13 by year-end, an increase of roughly 439% from its current price of $2.41. Source: Gemini AI Following a decisive legal victory over the SEC earlier this year, market confidence in Ripple surged, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past 12 months, XRP has jumped 378%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum by a wide margin. Ripple’s rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin, combined with CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s engagement with President Trump, has positioned the company as a regulatory frontrunner, strengthening its appeal to both retail and institutional investors. XRP’s technical chart continues to display several bullish flag formations into 2025, suggesting a potential year-end breakout. If catalysts such as ETF approvals, Ripple inking more strategic partnerships, or clear U.S. crypto regulations emerge, Gemini’s upper projections of $13 are feasible before the year closes. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini Forecasts 700% Surge in Q4 Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the strongest DeFi networks in development, building a reputation as Ethereum’s top challenger thanks to its thriving developer ecosystem and growing suite of decentralized applications. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically peer-reviewed framework emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and formal verification. With a market capitalization of about $21 billion, Cardano holds a prominent position among leading DeFi projects, though it still trails Solana and Ethereum in overall adoption. Gemini’s analysis suggests ADA could climb as high as $7 by the New Year, a remarkable 1,100% gain from its current price of approximately $0.58. If investor sentiment strengthens through the end of the year, Gemini’s models indicate ADA could trade around $3 by late 2025 and potentially surpass its 2021 all-time high of $3.09 should a full-scale bull run take shape. Aster ($ASTER): Project with Ties to CZ Touted for 4x to 5x Gains Aster ($ASTER) is a newly launched decentralized exchange token that’s making waves in the DeFi space. Born from the merger of Astherus and APX Finance in late 2024, the project officially debuted in September 2025 and was listed on Binance the next month. Built on BNB Chain and backed by the venture arm once associated with Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Aster is a next-gen perpetuals DEX, supporting spot and futures trading with up to 1001× leverage. Its standout feature is the “Trade & Earn” model: users can leverage yield-bearing assets as margin, thereby trading and earning simultaneously. In the last 24 hours, Aster’s price shot up 9% despite a general dip that has shaved 3% from crypto’s market cap. While still too new to identify definite trends, Aster briefly broke out of a post-launch downward channel thanks to a whale interest over the weekend. It soon dipped again as traders took profits, but its neutral RSI and relative newness set it up to meet Gemini’s targets over the next two months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin With 100x Potential One emerging project not yet featured in Gemini’s dataset has been generating significant buzz in presale markets. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most discussed meme coin launches of the season, attracting around $3.9 million from investors eager for the next Dogecoin. Marketed as Dogecoin’s louder and more rebellious successor, Maxi Doge captures the degen spirit of crypto through meme contests, community events, and a highly active social media presence. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI enjoys faster and cheaper transaction speeds compared to Dogecoin’s legacy network. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which fuels marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 80% APY in rewards, though returns will decrease as participation rises. The current presale price is $0.000266, with incremental price increases scheduled for each subsequent phase. Investors can purchase MAXI through MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although the slump has rattled many investors, long-term participants view it as a healthy reset, a purge of excess leverage and speculation before the next leg up. History has shown this pattern repeatedly in crypto: sharp corrections before massive bull runs. And this time round, Bitcoin is likely to lose dominance to top-tier altcoins like XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. In fact, the charts suggest these players may explode in price in the coming months. Ripple (XRP): Pioneering the Future of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a lightning-fast, low-cost payment network designed to replace lengthy legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple is also on the radars of the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Adoption is continuing apace thanks to strategic partnerships with multiple banks. All this helped XRP to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, now exceeding $144.5 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin demonstrates the company’s commitment to capturing what will probably be the most widely adopted part of crypto: the stablecoin sector. However, XRP remains a central part of the ledger’s operation as a small amount of it is burned in every transaction. Over the last year, XRP has skyrocketed 378%, hitting $3.65 in mid-July, its highest point since 2018, easily surpassing Bitcoin’s 58% rise during the same timeframe. At present, XRP’s RSI sits close to 41, with prices re-converging with the 30-day moving average, signaling stabilization despite the prolonged downturn. Technical readings still show two bullish flag formations from the summer, which have yet to break out. With U.S. regulators due to greenlight spot ETFs and deliver news about comprehensive crypto legislation before the year is out, a possible run to $5–$10 by the New Year is highly likely. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Rival Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its reputation as one of the fastest, most scalable blockchain ecosystems. With a market cap of around $97 billion and $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), the network’s growth trajectory remains robust. The recent launch of Grayscale’s and Bitwise’s spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to attract significant institutional capital, echoing inflows following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Following a spring low near $100, SOL has since recovered to about $176, while its low RSI of 37 and divergence beneath the 30-day moving average hint that SOL is undervalued right now. Key support holds near $150, with firm resistance around $250. Should ETF-driven demand take off heading into the festive season, SOL could revisit its all-time high of $293.31, and in a prolonged bull phase, even $500 or $1,000 isn’t out of the question. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Doge Army Still Chases the $1 Dream Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the trailblazer that gave us the meme coin concept, debuted in 2013 and remains the dominant token in its category, boasting a market capitalization of around $26.4 billion and an enthusiastic global “Doge Army” following. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Prices briefly broke above $0.30 in mid-September before easing back to about $0.17. Doge’s multi-billion market cap has made it one of the more resilient assets in the space, often tracking price trends of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Dogecoin’s practical use continues to expand as well. Tesla now accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while both PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin payments into their platforms. In a bull-case scenario, DOGE could challenge its 2021 peak of $0.7316 later this year, even potentially breaking past it, before the year is out. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Upgrade for 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Ostensibly a meme coin, $HYPER actually aspires to be an integral upgrade to the Bitcoin network. It’s a Layer 2 that will expand Bitcoin’s throughput while making transacting cheaper. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER introduces DAO-based governance, smart contract functionality, and a meme-bridge enabling frictionless Bitcoin transfers. The presale has already exceeded $25.6 million raised, with analysts like Borch Crypto predicting 100x potential. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, bolstering investor trust. HYPER tokens power every aspect of the network, from governance and staking to transaction fees, and early participants can earn up to 46% APY in staking rewards. Bitcoin is going HYPER. This could be the next major breakout project. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the altcoin’s strong debut, noting that the BSOL led inflows for the week across ETPs, outperforming even Bitcoin and Ethereum-based spot ETFs. What a week for $BSOL , besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m ($IBIT had a rare off week, it'll be back). It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut. pic.twitter.com/HpKUTdq1J5 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 1, 2025 BSOL offers a new touch point for U.S. investors to gain regulated access to SOL staking yields, a feature previously reserved for on-chain participants. This has effectively opened the floodgates for millions in fresh institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem. With SOL still awaiting its own spot ETF approval, BSOL’s success could signal the scale of pent-up demand ready to enter. Grayscale Investments estimates that Solana ETPs could capture 5% of all SOL tokens within two years, representing over $5 billion in value at current prices. Real institutional momentum is now flowing into Solana, and it’s starting on Wall Street . Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Could Spark the Next Major Rally With the consensus among analysts expecting spot Solana ETF approvals this month, sidelined institutional demand could fuel an escape from a 7-month ascending channel. SOL / USD 1-day chart, descending triangle fuels ascending channel. Source. TradingView. The altcoin now tests a strong confluence of support and a potential launchpad setup, with the channel’s lower boundary meeting a historic demand zone at $175. This zone also forms a descending triangle, now nearing its apex, creating a decisive moment for November’s price action. Momentum indicators remain mixed. The MACD histogram has crossed below the signal line, a typical early downtrend signal, while the RSI sits near a historical bottom around 33, suggesting limited downside room. Losing $175 could open the door for a 30% drop to $120, but holding it may prepare SOL for another breakout attempt. The $300 level remains the key breakout threshold. A successful flip of that resistance into support could mark the start of a new uptrend, targeting $500 for a potential 185% gain. Still, with Solana entering corporate balance sheets and institutional exposure deepening through spot ETFs, the rally could extend another 470%, pushing the Solana price toward $1,000 . PepeNode: The Smarter Way to Earn in Any Market With passive income strategies like staking ETFs gaining traction, investors are seeking ways to earn even when markets stand still. With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is accelerating fast. The presale has already surpassed $2 million, with early stakers still earning up to 633% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. As U.S. interest rate easing fuels capital rotation into high-risk assets, PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture meme coin upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

53999074,619467,1762210800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53999074.jpeg,Hong Kong Opens Doors to Global Crypto Markets in Bold Bid to Revive Financial Hub Status,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-opens-doors-to-global-crypto-markets/,"In a progressive decision announced during Fintech Week 2025 , Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has unveiled a sweeping regulatory reform allowing licensed crypto exchanges to connect directly with global order books. The move dismantles the city’s “ringfenced” model that previously restricted trading within its borders, enabling access to international capital and liquidity. SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung emphasized that the shift follows extensive work to ensure investor protection. “Once we are sure that we can protect investors, we do relax, as we did with global liquidity,” Leung stated. The reform aligns Hong Kong’s digital asset framework with international financial standards, signaling the city’s ambition to reclaim its reputation as a leading fintech hub in Asia. What it Means for Hong Kong’s Digital Asset Ecosystem The SFC’s policy shift is part of a broader effort to modernize the region’s digital finance landscape. Over recent years, Hong Kong has launched a licensing regime for crypto exchanges, approved Bitcoin and Ether-linked exchange-traded products, and expanded oversight for digital asset funds. In partnership, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing to issue the first stablecoin licenses by next year, while regulators are crafting new frameworks for crypto dealers and custodians. Additionally, the SFC has removed the 12-month trading history requirement for HKMA-approved tokens and stablecoins, a change expected to accelerate listings of new digital assets. Industry observers view these developments as pivotal for attracting institutional players. Global firms like Binance and Coinbase could soon gain entry via brokerage licenses, faster and less restrictive than full exchange approvals. Currently, 11 exchanges and 49 brokers operate under SFC oversight, a number expected to rise sharply under the new system. Hong Kong’s Bid to Reclaim Market Relevance This policy overhaul highlights Hong Kong’s determination to position itself as a global crypto hub amid fierce competition from jurisdictions like Singapore and the United States. While mainland China continues to ban crypto trading , Hong Kong has opted for a regulated innovation model balancing market access with strict compliance. Leung acknowledged the delicate balance regulators must strike: “Overly strict requirements risk driving liquidity and talent elsewhere, but too little oversight could undermine trust.” Hong Kong’s new policies on global liquidity and tokenization mark a shift toward deeper integration with international crypto markets.

Announced in a blog post Monday, the new structure will channel funding through two avenues: a “wishlist” of focus areas identified by EF teams, and formal requests for proposals (RFPs) addressing specific ecosystem needs. A Shift Toward Strategic Coordination The previous open grants process, paused earlier this year, had stretched the Foundation’s administrative capacity due to high demand. According to EF, the revamped program will better align funding decisions with Ethereum’s long-term priorities by coordinating directly with internal technical and research teams. “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the Foundation said. “But the growing volume of applications limited our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” The first batch of wishlist items and RFPs is now available, covering areas such as cryptography, privacy, scalability, and community growth. In 2024, the Foundation awarded around $3 million to 105 projects and initiatives, continuing its mission to foster open-source innovation since the program’s 2018 launch. Ethereum’s Technical Upgrades Continue The update comes just after Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade went live on its final testnet, Hoodi, ahead of a mainnet launch expected December 3. Fusaka introduces EIP-7594 (PeerDAS), allowing validators to access smaller data chunks from layer-2 networks, improving efficiency and scalability. Additional proposals, EIPs 7825 and 7935, aim to increase gas limits and boost performance in preparation for Ethereum’s shift to parallel execution — a critical milestone that will allow multiple transactions to process simultaneously.

Related Reading: Forget Billions—XRP Could Hit Trillions, Leading Expert Says According to reports, Zhao said he personally owns just over 2 million ASTER tokens — a holding that has been valued at about $2.5 million in coverage of the event. That admission prompted a rapid buying wave and heavy media noise, with traders and observers trying to sort what the move means for the project and the broader4 market. Aster Trading Activity On Fire As Price Rises Based on reports, ASTER climbed from roughly $0.91 to a peak near $1.26 on the day the disclosure hit newsfeeds. Volume also surged: one snapshot put 24-hour turnover at around $224 million before the announcement and at more than $2 billion afterward. Platform metrics moved too; total value locked on the Aster system reached about $1 billion dollars in recent updates. Market watchers pointed out that those jumps happened within hours of Zhao’s statement, pushing the token into headlines and onto many traders’ watchlists. Full disclosure.

I buy and hold. pic.twitter.com/wvmBwaXbKD — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 2, 2025 Supply Concerns And Background Ties Reports have disclosed that Aster’s circulating supply stands at about 2 billion tokens while total supply is 8 billion. That gap has raised alarms among analysts who say future token unlocks could add selling pressure. At the same time, discussion has grown about whether Zhao’s stake represents a purely personal bet or something tied to past venture ties, like connections to YZi Labs (previously Binance Labs). Some community voices welcomed the vote of confidence, while others urged caution and more disclosure about timing and intent. Whales, Shorts And The Need For Transparency Traders already placed big bets in both directions after the pop. Some large holders were reported to be taking profits, while short sellers were opening positions on the belief that the rally could be fleeting. Based on reports, competition with other derivatives and exchange projects — names like Hyperliquid were mentioned in analyst commentary — will test whether Aster can keep user interest beyond the headlines. Observers also flagged that massive daily volume spikes are often followed by quick retracement if underlying usage does not grow.

These three tokens have suffered significant drops in the past 24 hours, yet these falls send them more firmly into oversold territory, meaning that a big rebound should be coming soon . We examine their technicals and provide price predictions in this article, while we also take a look at an up-and-coming token that could rally when it lists in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Imminent ETF Launches Will Send Alt to New ATHs XRP has declined by 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.40 also representing an 8% fall in a week and a 20% drop in a month. The altcoin does remain up by 375% in the past year, however, underlining its strong medium- and long-term momentum, which it should regain soon enough. The market is waiting patiently for the launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which some commentators suggest will launch in the next couple of weeks . These will result in a substantial increase in demand for XRP, which could surge as a result. Its chart today shows the coin in an oversold position, meaning that ETF launches could be the catalyst that causes a strong positive correction. Source: TradingView XRP’s two main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – has been in negative positions since August, indicating that the coin is well overdue a growth spurt. The bullish pennant in which XRP has been trading also suggests this, with the coin poised to reach $3 by the end of this month. And with Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company, it could top $4 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Altcoin Recovering After Release of Migration Figures At $0.2397, PI is down by 3% in a day and by 11% in a week, although it does hold on to an impressive 15% increase in the past fortnight. It has posted this fortnightly increase on the back of encouraging updates regarding mainnet migration, with the Pi Network team revealing towards the end of last month that 2.69 million ‘Pioneers’ have completed this migration, while 3.36 million have completed the KYC checks necessary for migration. Given that PI has had a bad time since reaching an ATH of $2.99 at the end of February, this update on migrations is reassuring, going some way to counteract earlier concerns that the mainnet migration had been handled poorly. And if we look at PI’s chart today, we see that it’s showing some bullish signs of recovery, with its relative strength index having risen above 50 in the past week. Source: TradingView Whether it can maintain this momentum is an open question, however, although the launch of altcoin ETFs could produce a market-wide optimism that will benefit its price. Longer term, Pi Network still faces skepticism from the wider cryptocurrency community, with the coin yet to list on major tokens such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Without such listings, PI may continue to struggle, whereas new listings could send it back up to whole figures quickly. It could potentially reach $1 by December, while good news could send it closer to $2. Crypto Price Prediction: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Meme Coin Close to Bottom, Could Double by 2026 SHIB is another coin that has been struggling in 2025, with its current price of $0.000009564 making for a 5% loss in 24 hours, an 8.5% loss in a week and a 23% decline in a month. Worse still, SHIB is actually down by 44% in the past year, whereas most top-50 coins have posted annual gains. This indicates the funk Shiba Inu is in right now, with whales and other traders neglecting the alt in favor of newer meme tokens (e.g. Fartcoin). And unlike Dogecoin, there aren’t any SHIB ETFs waiting to launch, something which could deprive the coin of a much-needed source of demand and momentum. Its chart today is reflective of its situation, given that its two main indicators are in very low positions. Source: TradingView Of course, the positive implication of oversold indicators is that the corresponding asset should bounce back strongly, but it’s hard to say whether SHIB has the fundamentals to mount a full and sustainable comeback. There have been efforts to boosts its utility, such as the launch of its layer-two network Shibarium a couple of years ago, but so far this has done little to impress the wider market. For instance, its 24-hour trading volume today is $145 million, whereas the figure for Dogecoin is $1.8 billion. This is a big difference, and without some positive news or update, SHIB may witness only modest growth. It could reach $0.000020 by December, and potentially see in the New Year at around $0.000040. PEPENODE Raises $2 Million in Presale: Is Mine-to-Earn Token the Next Big Thing? In addition to major tokens, some traders may also want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential gains. Newer coins can often show more volatility than more established alternatives, something which is often the case with presale coins. Such coins have the benefit of generating momentum during their sales, helping them to enjoy rallies once they list for the first time. The last thing you'd want to lose Luckily with PEPENODE the mining is 100% virtual… No hardware needed https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/n0Sre6uGgV — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 3, 2025 One presale coin looking to do this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token which has raised just over $2 million in its sale. This is a very promising figure, and highlights the excitement PEPENODE has been generating since it launched its presale. What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s crypto’s first mine-to-earn token, giving users the opportunity to earn rewards from their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, they can earn greater rewards, which the platform will pay out in third-party coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. Because users will need more PEPENODE to buy more nodes, the token could experience considerable demand. And by extension, it could see substantial price increases, especially when holders can also stake it. Investors can join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website. The coin currently sells for $0.0011317, although this will rise again in two days.

The token dropped 4% in the past 24 hours, but trading volumes have nearly doubled – a sign that whales are preparing for the next move. Data from on-chain supply clusters shows heavy accumulation between $2.52 and $2.54 , confirming this as a critical demand zone. If XRP bounces back above these levels, it would suggest strong underlying buyer confidence, potentially kickstarting the next leg up. Today’s dip likely stems from growing uncertainty around the Fed’s rate decision in December, which has triggered broader market jitters. Still, with fresh ETFs on the horizon and Ripple’s growing institutional partnerships, XRP may be positioning for a long-awaited breakout. XRP Price Prediction: $2.35 Level May Act as Launchpad for Higher Prices In the past 12 hours, XRP has dropped sharply after rejecting a move above $2.50 – a former support zone now acting as resistance, at least for the moment. However, if the downtrend finds a floor at the $2.30 to $2.35 support range, history suggests XRP could bounce strongly – and this time, the rebound may launch it toward new all-time highs. This key area has served as a reliable launchpad before, and a strong reaction from buyers could quickly flip the short-term narrative. On the 4-hour chart, XRP’s RSI has dipped below the 14-day EMA, signaling growing selling pressure. Yet, oversold signals could also mark the early stages of a reversal. As the broader crypto market struggles to stabilize, investors are increasingly turning to early-stage tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a presale project that could offer outsized returns once sentiment shifts back to risk-on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Nearly $4M to Bring Together Like-Minded Traders This bull market is not over yet as Bitcoin and altcoins are still sitting near all-time highs. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme that plans to take full advantage of the hype that comes along with positive cycles by launching a token that fully embraces retail traders’ ‘up only’ energy. Inspired by the popular Doge meme, this token plans to build a vibrant community of like-minded degens who can share ideas , strategies , and brag about their Ws to earn rewards and have fun. Meanwhile, through the Maxi Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds into the most promising tokens. The earnings will be reinvested on marketing efforts to make Maxi Doge known. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, you can simply visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect your favorite Ethereum wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to complete your transaction. Buy $MAXI Here.

In a post shared on X, Harris stated that his “money is on XRP all the way” when asked how he would allocate a hypothetical $1,000 investment between Bitcoin and XRP. He explained that, based on current prices, Bitcoin is trading around $107,000, and XRP at approximately $2.40 , the same investment would yield vastly different holdings, only 0.009 BTC or about 416 XRP. Harris used this comparison to illustrate why smaller-cap assets often appeal more to retail investors. In his view, XRP’s lower price and smaller market capitalization give it more room for rapid expansion during bullish phases. He argued that the chances of XRP doubling or even increasing tenfold in the short term are higher than Bitcoin achieving the same growth, given the disparity in market size. If you have $1000 to invest do you want: $1000 / $120,000 = 0.0083 BTC or $1000 / $2.40 = 416.67 XRP Then fast forward 90 days from today: Which is more likely to 2X, 4X or even 10X during the upcoming altseason? Now fast forward to 3 years from now and what will your return… — Daniel Harris (@DanielLHarrisUS) October 20, 2025 At present, XRP’s market capitalization sits near $145 billion, whereas Bitcoin’s exceeds $2.1 trillion. Harris suggested that it is far more feasible for XRP to reach $300 billion than for Bitcoin to double to $4.4 trillion, particularly within a 90-day timeframe. His analysis aligns with a growing sentiment among altcoin advocates who believe that smaller, utility-driven assets can outperform dominant cryptocurrencies during specific market cycles. Altcoins’ Accessibility and Appeal Harris’ remarks were made in response to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, who recently discussed the psychological barriers new investors face when entering the market. According to Kwok , the high unit price of Bitcoin discourages first-time buyers, even though fractional ownership is possible. He explained that many prefer purchasing entire coins of lower-priced tokens, which feels more tangible and rewarding than holding small fractions of Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Kwok emphasized that the issue is not financial capability but perception. New investors tend to associate owning a whole coin with greater value or progress, a mindset that continues to drive enthusiasm toward affordable altcoins such as XRP, ADA, and SOL. The Counterpoint: Bitcoin’s Fractional Advantage The conversation originated from comments made by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, who countered the claim that crypto is too expensive. Armstrong reiterated that investors can buy any portion of Bitcoin or Ethereum, removing barriers to entry for those with limited capital. Nonetheless, both Kwok and Harris argued that investor psychology remains a decisive factor. Even with fractional purchasing available, many people still gravitate toward coins with lower nominal prices, particularly in the early stages of an altseason, when such assets have historically delivered higher percentage gains. For example, over the past year, Bitcoin’s value has increased by about 60%, while XRP has recorded gains exceeding 380%. This performance gap supports Harris’ view that smaller-cap cryptocurrencies can generate stronger returns during speculative rallies. However, analysts also caution that this potential comes with greater risk. Unlike Bitcoin, which tends to experience moderate corrections, altcoins often face much steeper declines during market downturns. A 5% Bitcoin pullback can translate to losses of 30–50% in some lower-cap tokens, making timing and risk management crucial for investors drawn to XRP’s growth prospects.

Recently, whispers circulated about a potential legal battle brewing between prominent crypto market maker Wintermute and the global exchange giant Binance. But now, we have crucial clarity directly from the source regarding a possible Wintermute Binance lawsuit , putting an end to much speculation. Dispelling Rumors: No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit on the Horizon Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of Wintermute, has decisively put an end to speculation surrounding his firm’s intentions. He confirmed that Wintermute has absolutely no plans to sue Binance over the significant liquidation event that occurred in October. This statement directly addresses persistent rumors that Wintermute was preparing legal action against the exchange. Gaevoy took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation, emphasizing that these rumors are simply untrue. He sees no valid reason for such an action, providing a clear stance from the market maker. This clarification follows a significant event in October, which saw one of the largest forced crypto liquidations ever recorded. During this period, Binance’s auto-deleveraging (ADL) system reportedly experienced malfunctions. This system is designed to manage risks during volatile market conditions. However, its alleged malfunction led to unexpected losses for several trading firms involved in the market, sparking widespread concern across the crypto community. Understanding the October Liquidation and Initial Concerns Initially, after the October liquidation event, Gaevoy himself acknowledged the issues publicly. He had previously stated that he understood certain firms were preparing legal action against Binance. This earlier comment, reported by The Block, likely fueled the recent rumors of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit . It’s important to distinguish between Gaevoy’s understanding of other firms’ intentions and Wintermute’s own plans. His latest statement makes it unequivocally clear that Wintermute is not among those considering legal recourse. The incident highlighted the inherent risks and complexities within high-volume crypto trading. When such large-scale liquidations occur, the ripple effects can be substantial, impacting: Market stability: Sudden price movements and forced sales can increase volatility. Trader confidence: Firms experiencing losses may re-evaluate their strategies or trust in platforms. Operational integrity: Exchange systems are rigorously tested, but malfunctions can still occur under extreme stress. Despite these challenges, Wintermute’s decision is a significant development. Why No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit? A Strategic Choice Market makers like Wintermute play a vital role in the crypto ecosystem, providing liquidity and ensuring smooth trading across various assets. When an event like a large-scale liquidation occurs, it can significantly impact their operations and profitability. Despite the potential challenges posed by the ADL malfunction, Wintermute’s CEO has chosen a path of non-confrontation. This decision suggests that perhaps internal resolutions, direct communication, or different strategic considerations are at play. It avoids a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, which can be a drain on resources and reputation for both parties involved. The absence of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit helps to stabilize market sentiment and allows firms to focus on core business. This strategic choice by Wintermute could be driven by several factors: Maintaining business relationships: Legal disputes can strain crucial partnerships in a closely-knit industry. Cost-benefit analysis: The potential costs of litigation might outweigh the expected recovery. Focus on core operations: Avoiding lawsuits allows the firm to dedicate resources to market making and expansion. Alternative resolutions: It’s possible that other forms of redress or understanding have been reached between the parties. Implications for Market Trust and Future Relations Gaevoy’s direct and transparent communication helps to build trust within the often-opaque crypto industry. When leaders address rumors head-on, it provides much-needed clarity for investors and market participants.

The update was shared by the project’s marketing lead, Lucie, who revealed that Shiba Inu has been added to the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework, a joint initiative between Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell. According to Lucie’s post on X, the new classification places Shiba Inu under the “Consumer & Culture” category. This designation recognizes SHIB as part of the growing segment of cryptocurrencies that intersect with entertainment, culture, and online communities, an area where Shiba Inu has built one of the strongest global followings. Expanding Institutional Recognition The FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework was introduced in 2023 to categorize digital assets beyond the scope of traditional large-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The framework divides assets into five distinct segments: Financials, Smart Contract Platforms, Currencies, Utilities & Services, and Consumer & Culture. Good news for SHIB holders Grayscale’s Market Byte Here Come the Altcoins from October 2025 officially lists Shiba Inu SHIB under the Consumer & Culture crypto sector in the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors framework. SHIB is recognized by Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell as… pic.twitter.com/8jBpKkP9PL — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 2, 2025 When the index was first launched, tokens like ImmutableX (IMX), Decentraland (MANA), and ApeCoin (APE) were included under the Consumer & Culture classification. Shiba Inu was notably absent at the time. However, in the latest update, Grayscale has officially included SHIB in that category, a move Lucie says reaffirms the token’s staying power and the strength of its community-driven ecosystem. She added that this acknowledgment reflects the project’s long-term potential and confirms that its foundation remains strong and its vision is alive. SHIB Among Assets Eligible for Spot ETFs Beyond classification, Shiba Inu’s inclusion in the framework carries further significance. According to Grayscale’s latest report, SHIB is among the cryptocurrencies that satisfy the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Generic Listing Standards (GLS), a regulatory guideline that allows certain crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to be listed without individual SEC approval. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Under the GLS framework, exchanges can list spot ETFs for assets that meet defined eligibility criteria and have an effective registration statement. Grayscale’s analysis identified 11 cryptocurrencies across four sectors that qualify under these standards. In the Consumer & Culture category, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are the only two assets recognized. Other qualifying assets include XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash from the Currencies sector; Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche from Smart Contract Platforms; and Chainlink from Utilities & Services. Currently, Solana and Litecoin already have spot ETFs trading in the United States, while applications for Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash remain under review. SHIB Yet to Receive a Standalone ETF Filing Despite meeting the SEC’s Generic Listing Standards, there is still no individual application for a Shiba Inu spot ETF in the U.S. market. However, industry observers note growing institutional interest in SHIB, particularly following T. Rowe Price’s mention of the token as a possible component in its Active Crypto ETF product lineup. Outside the United States, the project has already seen success in traditional finance integration. Valour Inc., a European investment firm, previously launched a Swedish krona (SEK)-denominated ETP tracking Shiba Inu’s performance. While Grayscale’s latest framework update identifies Shiba Inu as eligible for a future ETF under current regulatory standards, it remains uncertain whether the firm intends to proceed with an official filing. Still, the token’s inclusion signals growing acknowledgment of SHIB’s influence and longevity within the broader crypto market.

Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-case-vs-bear-case/,"On November 2, 2025, crypto analyst Ignas | DeFi distilled crypto’s current standoff into a clean ledger of pros and cons. The Bearish Case For Crypto The first bear pillar is the “AI bubble” overhang. Late-October headlines crystallized the debate as Nvidia briefly breached a $5 trillion market value, a milestone that sharpened concern that equity valuations tied to AI infrastructure spending may be running ahead of realized returns. Point two—“bullish news fail to pump”—was on display as “Uptober” ended with a whimper for the crypto market. Despite intermittent policy tailwinds and strong ETF inflows mid-month, both Bitcoin and Ethereum faded into month-end, and US spot ETF flows turned sharply negative over the final three trading days of October, a pattern consistent with risk aversion after the Oct. 10–11 shock. Related Reading: Is Crypto ‘Boring’ Now? Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing That shock, the “10/10 crash,” is the third bear lever. The two-day downdraft followed a sudden tariff escalation threat from the White House and produced one of the largest one-day liquidations in crypto history, spurring a rush for downside hedges and leaving the market probing for “dead entities” and hidden impairments. Cycle timing is Ignas’ fourth bear note. The fourth Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024 (block 840,000). Prior cycles do not map one-for-one, but the post-halving window is a pattern which gets a lot of attention at the moment. If the “cycle is not dead,” a Bitcoin top may already be in or is looming by the end of the year. “Old OG wallets selling” is the fifth bear claimant—and, for once, the chain tells a clear story. Since mid-October, long-term holders have materially increased net distribution, with Glassnode and other trackers flagging outflows on the order of tens of thousands of BTC, alongside headline-grabbing awakenings of Satoshi-era wallets. This does not prove panic, but it does inject supply at a delicate moment. Negative ETF flows round out the bear list. Farside’s fund-by-fund ledger shows pronounced outflows on October 29–31 across several US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with total daily net redemptions exceeding $470 million on October 29 and $488 million on October 30, before another hit on October 31 (191 million). While October closed with a inflow total of 3.424 billion, the message: the “fast money” cohort that chased the summer breakout was, at least temporarily, in retreat. Buffett’s caution is the macro bear exclamation point. Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter print revealed a record $381.7 billion cash pile and a twelfth straight quarter as a net seller of equities—a posture that telegraphs wariness about broad risk assets and liquidity conditions even as operating earnings rise. For crypto, this is not a direct flow, but it is a bellwether for global risk appetite. The Bull Case For Crypto The bull case, however, is not hand-waving. Start with “liquidity easing & interest cuts.” The ECB has already delivered substantial easing this year and paused; the Bank of England has begun cutting; and in the US, the Federal Reserve is also expected to close out the year with two more cuts while ending quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Powell, The FOMC, And Crypto: The Message Everyone Missed Ignas also says “no clear euphoria,” and—empirically—he’s right. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index spent the past week toggling between “Fear” and low “Neutral,” printing in the mid-30s to low-40s as of November 3. That’s a long way from the 80s–90s “extreme greed” that often sets up blow-off tops, and it supports the idea that positioning is not yet dangerously crowded. Institutional adoption remains the quiet compounding force in the bull ledger. With $30.2 billion year-to-date inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs are fueling most of the market strength. On policy, the US did more than chatter in 2025: the Senate passed, and President Trump signed, a bipartisan stablecoin law in July. A broader market-structure bill remains in play, but even the stablecoin win is non-trivial for on-chain liquidity and payments rails. Seasonality also favors patience. Since 2013, Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter on average, with multiple cycles posting outsized November–December runs. Then there’s the stablecoin plumbing. Despite October’s chaos, aggregate stablecoin float sits around $307–308 billion and notched fresh all-time highs in mid-October—a sign that dry powder inside crypto’s own rails remains abundant and ready to mobilize if confidence stabilizes. As of today, DefiLlama pegs the total at roughly $307.6 billion. Finally, the US–China trade war has seen extremely positive progress. “This is the BIGGEST de-escalation yet. Under the new US-China trade deal, President Trump made a HUGE agreement with China: China will suspend ALL retaliatory tariffs announced since March 4th. And, China will suspend or remove ALL retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken since March 4th. This is not getting nearly enough attention,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X on Sunday. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.56 trillion.

54002411,619348,1762214449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54002411.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Retail Retreat: Shrimp Deposits Drop 5x Since Early 2023,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-retail-retreat-shrimp-deposits-drop-5x/,"Bitcoin is showing renewed fragility as price struggles to reclaim the $110,000 level, putting bulls on the defensive and exposing the market to further downside risk. Selling pressure has been building across the market, and BTC now finds itself probing lower demand zones as traders reassess positioning after recent volatility. While the macro backdrop remains broadly supportive, near-term sentiment has shifted toward caution as liquidity thins and speculative flows recede. A key dynamic shaping this cycle is the absence of retail participation. According to top analyst Darkfost, retail investor activity — measured through small holder inflows to Binance — has fallen sharply. Since early 2023, just after the bear market ended, the 90-day moving average of shrimp inflows has dropped from roughly 552 BTC per day to just 92 BTC today. This more than five-fold decline marks one of the steepest drops in retail engagement ever seen in a Bitcoin recovery phase. This structural shift underscores how different this cycle is from previous ones. With retail sitting on the sidelines, Bitcoin is being driven primarily by institutional flows, large holders , and long-term accumulation behavior. For bulls, the path forward likely hinges on whether new liquidity arrives — or whether current selling pressure pushes BTC into deeper support before the next leg higher can begin. Spot ETFs Reshape Market Participation as Retail Fades The decline in retail participation accelerated sharply with the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Before ETFs went live, small holders were sending roughly 450 BTC per day to Binance. Since the ETF debut, that figure has collapsed to just 92 BTC per day, and the downtrend has continued. This shift marks a structural change in how retail interacts with Bitcoin and where liquidity enters the market. Darkfost outlines three primary drivers behind this dramatic decline. First, a portion of the retail crowd migrated to ETFs, opting for the convenience and perceived security of regulated financial products over self-custody and traditional exchange activity. This naturally reduced on-chain inflows to Binance and similar platforms. Second, remaining retail investors have shifted behavior, choosing to hold long-term rather than trade, indicating stronger hands and a more disciplined class of small holders. Third, many early retail accumulators have simply graduated out of the shrimp cohort, now holding more than 0.1 BTC and no longer being counted in that data segment. These dynamics reveal a profound evolution in Bitcoin’s market structure. The current cycle is being driven not by speculative retail surges but by institutional flows, emerging whales, corporate treasury strategies, and long-term accumulation addresses that rarely sell. As a result, Bitcoin’s supply is tightening at the margins even as price consolidates — creating a slow-burning but powerful supply-demand setup unlike previous cycles. The forces supporting Bitcoin today are more structurally resilient, but they also produce a market rhythm that is quieter, more methodical, and less euphoric than traditional retail-led bull runs. Bitcoin Remains Trapped Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $107,250, holding above a key support zone after another rejection from resistance. The daily chart shows BTC struggling to regain momentum, with multiple attempts to reclaim the $110K–$112K band failing as sellers consistently step in around short-term resistance and moving average clusters. This area, highlighted on the chart, represents a critical liquidity and acceptance zone — until price breaks above it decisively, upside momentum will remain capped. BTC is currently trading below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a bearish short-term structure that points to continued market hesitation. The 200-day moving average sits slightly below current price and is acting as an important dynamic support. Losing that zone would open the door to a potential retest of the $104K–$105K region, where strong demand previously emerged during October’s flush. On the upside, a clean break above $112K, followed by a reclaim of the $117,500 Point of Control, is required to reset bullish momentum and put the next leg higher back in play. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound and cautious, with sellers defending overhead levels and buyers stepping in only at key supports. Volatility remains suppressed as the market waits for fresh catalysts and liquidity inflows.

The three months, which ended on Wednesday, saw $21 billion in short-term borrowing, down from the $590 billion forecast issued in July, indicating a decrease in short-term borrowing. Officials attribute most of the changes to more cash than expected at the beginning of the quarter. The data available suggests that in early October, the Treasury had approximately $891 in cash, which was above the $850 in summer gross cash. Using a substantial portion of the trove allowed the department to slow its rate of wealth increase for spending and debt repayment while still meeting all obligations. Treasury leverages a strong cash buffer The Treasury’s cut results from careful cash management, given there were months of heavy issuance to rebuild reserves following the suspension of the debt ceiling at the start of the calendar year. In previous quarters, the Treasury had increased sales of short-term bills to replenish its coffers. But strong tax inflows and cautious outlays have left it with a much larger cushion than expected. According to analysts, this could ease some of the tension in the bond markets, which have been pressured by the rapid pace of supply and an increase in longer-term interest rates. A borrowing reduction was a strong move to get the Treasury stabilizer working again, according to analysts quoted by the Financial Times. In addition, reductions in the borrowing requirement may help steady Treasury yields, making it easier for investors to anticipate interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, economists claim that the reduction is not an indication of general fiscal moderation. Spending at the federal level remains unchanged, and borrowing is still significantly higher than it was before the pandemic. Other obstacles remain for the Treasury. Treasury maintains high borrowing plans for early 2026 In summary, the Treasury plans to borrow approximately $578 billion between January and March 2026, contingent upon a year-end cash balance of $850 billion. This estimate aligns with its previous projections, underscoring that federal borrowing is expected to be extensive over the next few quarters. That is because the government continues to spend a significant amount on entitlement programs, its infrastructure plan, and other initiatives. However, market observers expect a balance between bill, note, and bond issues in the indicated bill cut. Therefore, the primary aim is to create an issuance plan that will provide the appropriate levels of liquidity across the maturity spectrum without destabilizing the Treasury market. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether the U.S. economy slows down and fiscal policymakers fail to pass a longer-term budget solution, this cut will be trivial compared to a historically large Q4 borrowing estimate. The final point is that persistent fiscal deficits will remain, and excellent debt management will be even more indispensable now than previously. This means that the oversupply issue will offer investors short-term relief from being bothersome. Still, their focus will instantly be on how the Treasury expects to transform its strategy for Q1 or 2026, given existing economic conditions and prevailing political states.

In the speech, Cook demonstrated her support for the recent interest rate cut and asserted that she is willing to consider further reductions. Notably, the Federal Governor has largely kept a low profile since Trump attempted to remove her in August due to allegations of mortgage fraud. To avoid trouble, Cook shifted her focus to the legal battles that have enabled her to remain at the central bank. Cook agrees on further rate cuts while facing legal battles Addressing the audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. On Monday, November 3, Cook highlighted her outlook regarding the country’s economic status and her opinion on monetary policy . She said the economy was strong; however, the Federal Governor pointed out risks to steady inflation and low unemployment. Cook agreed with the Federal Open Market Committee’s earlier decision to lower the central bank’s crucial interest rate by a quarter percentage point, which passed with a 10-2 vote. This decision marks the second consecutive meeting to result in a rate cut . In a statement, the Federal Governor expressed that she believes the decision was right because she felt that the threats surrounding job loss are more substantial than those related to surging inflation. Therefore, based on her argument, this latest reduction in the fed funds rate is another significant step towards normalizing their policy. Meanwhile, courts have stopped Trump from dismissing Cook. Sources close to the matter expressed that several individuals viewed the president’s move as a key problem for the central bank’s independence. On the other hand, White House officials accused Cook of issuing false details on her application for federally backed home loans. However, after several considerations, the Federal Governor was neither found guilty of any crime nor were any charges filed against her. Responding to these claims, Cook mentioned “clerical errors” in the loan applications. When reports requested her to provide information on the situation, she declined to respond. Still, Cook continues to undertake her responsibility at the Federal Reserve, which reduced its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December. Jerome Powell’s remarks on rate cuts raise concerns among individuals Looking ahead, Cook pointed out that she would continue to depend on the data released to make her decision. This was after FOMC officials hinted that there is a likelihood of another rate cut before the end of the year. “As always, I assess my monetary policy position at each meeting based on new data from various sources, my changing outlook, and the balance of risks,” she explained. According to Cook, every Federal meeting, including December’s, is crucial. When asked to comment on the impacts of Trump’s tariffs, the Federal Governor expressed their desire to determine if the impact of tariffs persists over time. She explained that this applies to whether companies are delaying price increases and what they have done with their stock, adding that there is much to expect and examine with the December meeting approaching. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised concerns in the market during his news conference after he stated that a cut in December is not guaranteed. Powell argued that there are many different opinions within the committee, which usually tend to agree on policy decisions Following his remarks, individuals are awaiting the December meeting to find out the Fed’s final decision.

This New Crypto Coin Could Lead Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-25x-this-new-crypto-coin-could-lead-q1-2026-2/,"A significant change is observable as the crypto world is preparing to take 2026. Investors are drifting out of the household-brand coins and seeking new crypto tokens which do something, ventures that have real application and which can grow in the first place. The name that has continued to emerge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi initiative that aims to make lending decentralised and more transparent. It has an organized presale, a strong audit in the books and actual momentum in the community, many people believe MUTM is one of the best crypto coins to hold before Q1 2026. Presale Heat and The Numbers That Matter Currently, Mutuum Finance is in the presale Phase 6. Tokens are sold at $0.035 price, which will rise to $0.04 in the next round and the actual price of launch is $0.06. To provide some background, the presale began at a very low price, of only $0.01, meaning that MUTM has already increased 250% and that is a strong indicator of demand. Up to this point, the project has raised over 18.3 million dollars, attracted in excess of 17,600 holders, and sold over 785 million tokens. That’s about 85% of Phase 6 done. Of the 4 billion, 45.5% will be reserved as presale or that is 1.82 billion. Every round is selling out quicker than the previous one which is only indicative of the fact that the interest is building up as Mutuum Finance nears launch. The presale also has a daily leaderboard where the best contributor in the day will win $500 in MUTM. It is an ingenious method of retaining people. What Mutuum Finance Is building In its simplest form, Mutuum Finance is assembling a non-custodial lending and borrowing platform that is decentralized. Smart contracts are the order of the day. Borrow and lend your crypto, generate passive income and offer collateral with no intermediaries in between. By depositing assets, you receive mtTokens as a receipt and yield generating instrument. Put in 1 ETH, you get 1 mtETH. The kicker? That the growth of the value of that mtETH is provided with the loan being paid in the form of interest. There is also a buy and distribute system. A portion of the platform charges is used to purchase MUTM tokens at the open market and sent to holders of the mtTokens. This makes demand constant and provides incentive to be patient in the long-term. Security’s a big deal here. Mutuum Finance already successfully had a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating and started a $50,000 bug bounty to identify any code problems prior to the launch of mainnet. Stablecoin and Oracle Plans Mutuum Finance has its own USD-pegged stablecoin plans, which are overcollateralized by the loans in the platform. That maintains things stable and liquid and the mint-and-burn system of operation means it can change supply when necessary. The stablecoin will further remit additional yield to the treasury of the project. In the case of price data, Mutuum Finance will be relying on trusted oracles such as Chainlink. In that manner, collateral values remain true despite the market becoming wild. Analysts believe that such features would make it highly adopted upon its launch. There are even those expecting that MUTM should be valued between $0.30 and $0.40 in the first year of operation – 9x to 12x higher than its present presale price. V1 Launch and the Big Players The initial edition of the protocol developed by Mutuum Finance is slated to go live in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. That launch will involve the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot, which will intervene automatically in the event of undercollateralized positions. It is a breakthrough, as Mutuum Finance is not a mere thought anymore, but a product. It is then that both regular punters and larger entities tend to take notice. Actually evidence of big half a dozen figure presale purchases have already appeared, so you see some whales are already getting on to the boat before prices get inflated. Phase 6 is nearly complete, and a price increase is imminent, leaving a little less than one month to purchase below $0.04. Of course, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to take charge, but there are new DeFi projects with tangible fundamentals that typically promise a larger payoff. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an interesting case due to a number of factors: they are focused on transparent lending, they have developed smart tokenomics, and the community is actually active. Having already raised over $18 million dollars and with a clean audit and V1 on the horizon, Mutuum is fast becoming one of the best projects to follow over the next five years (2026).

This decline has sparked a renewed sense of bearish sentiment among investors, and experts caution that conditions could worsen in the coming days. November Deadline Approaches Market expert CryptoBirb recently expressed concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), noting that the market is already ten days into a bearish cycle. According to CryptoBirb, diving into on-chain data, the more alarming the picture appears. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? CryptoBirb’s analysis begins with cycle peak data: it has been 1,078 days since the low in November 2022, which is 101.2% of the crypto cycle complete. Additionally, it has been 563 days since the last Halving, with 45 days remaining within the typical 518 to 580-day peak range. Alarmingly, the anticipated rally leading to this peak has not materialized, and there are only 17 days left before the window for a peak closes on November 20. Missed breakouts during this time frame have signaled the end of previous bullish cycles. When comparing the current situation to the 2017 cycle, it is noted that Bitcoin reached its peak on December 17, 2017, 1,068 days after its low. With BTC now 1,078 days into the current cycle, the chances of a late top are diminishing with each passing day that the cryptocurrency remains below $113,000. From a performance standpoint, Bitcoin is down 16% from its all-time high of $126,200 and has only gained 8.2% year-to-date. The market’s leading crypto has faced repeated rejections near the $113,000 to $114,000 range and is currently trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $109,882. Historically, November typically sees an average gain of 17.5%, with positive performance in 10 out of the last 15 years. However, the expert points that when November begins in the red, it often indicates that the cycle is already shifting. Potential Bullish Factors Amid Ongoing Crypto Concerns Adding to this bearish sentiment, DeFi researcher DeFiIgnas has outlined several factors complicating the crypto market’s trajectory. These include what he calls “the speculative nature of the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble,” the failure of bullish news to invigorate crypto prices, uncertainty surrounding entities that collapsed after the October 10 crash, and the cyclical nature of the market. Additionally, the selling activity from long-term holders and negative crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) flows contribute to the prevailing concerns. Related Reading: XRP Bear Signal Triggered: Will The Top Altcoin Drop 70-80% From Here? Despite these challenges, DeFiIgnas also identified some potential bullish factors that could foster recovery instead of further declines. These include easing liquidity and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), a lack of euphoria in the crypto space, slow but steady institutional adoption, and the potential passage of a US crypto market structure bill. Historically strong performance in the fourth quarter, stablecoin supply at all-time highs, and a recent US trade deal with China could also provide a counterbalance to the prevailing bearish sentiment.

On the anniversary of its whitepaper publication, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent used the occasion to highlight Bitcoin’s consistency and prosperity, suggesting that Senate Democrats could learn something from its reliability and history. His remarks linked BTC’s nearly uninterrupted record of network activity to the challenges seemingly faced by the Democrats. What Senate Democrats Could Learn From Bitcoin In an X social media post on October 31, Bessent criticized Senate Democrats, suggesting that Bitcoin’s ability to remain functional through global crises and economic changes over the past 16 years shows a level of resilience that they could learn from. As a US republican, his comments came as the two major political parties continue to clash over federal budget issues, which have resulted in the ongoing government shutdown . Notably, October 31 also marks the anniversary of the publication of Bitcoin’s whitepaper . The whitepaper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, described a fully digital monetary system designed to run without central authorities or intermediaries. When the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009, it officially launched the network, introducing a framework that has now become globally recognized, extending its reach across multiple sectors and countries. Bitcoin’s adoption since its launch has been nothing short of remarkable, with prominent industry leaders calling it a “ store of value ” and “ digital gold .” Even Bessent has been a vocal advocate of the rapid advancement of the digital asset sector and the growth of BTC. In July, after US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , Bessent stated that stablecoins could be the key to propping up the US dollar. A month later, he said on X that Bitcoin forfeited to the Federal Government would be the foundation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve established by the President’s March Executive Order. He also stated that the US Treasury has since committed to identifying budget-neutral ways to acquire additional Bitcoin to expand the reserve and strengthen the country’s position in the digital asset economy. BTC Records 99.9% Uptime Since Launch Recent data have underscored Bitcoin’s network performance over the past 16 years. Crypto Developer Abhinav reported that the blockchain has achieved a 99.9% uptime since its launch in 2009, with only two brief outages recorded over the past 16 years. Related Reading: Here’s What Happened The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Closed October In The Red Supporters have also highlighted this remarkable technical performance as evidence of BTC’s reliability and its role as the cornerstone of decentralized technology. Additionally, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s network hash rate, a measure of computational power, recently reached an all-time high of around 1.204 ZH/s. Its current level of 1.202 ZH/s marks a 12.3% increase from the previous day and a 79% rise compared with one year ago. Over its 16-year history, BTC has also undergone four halving events, achieving a market value exceeding $2.1 trillion. On its anniversary, it traded above $110,000, after previously reaching an ATH of over $126,000 in October .",Bitcoin News|Abhinav|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network Hash Rate|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|digital gold|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Scott Bessent|Stablecoins|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 01:00:17

With this deal, Ripple’s total investments in the crypto ecosystem now hit $4 billion through strategic acquisitions and platform development. Ripple has been actively making acquisitions over the past year. In April 2025, the company acquired Hidden Road , a prime brokerage, for $1.25 billion, thereby enhancing Ripple’s liquidity capacity and gaining access to institutional trading infrastructure. Later, Ripple purchased Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, for $200 million, enhancing its real-time settlement and cross-border capability. Only a month ago, the company acquired GTreasury, a corporate treasury administration facility, for $1 billion to enter the trillion-dollar corporate treasury market and expand its reach to Fortune 500 companies managing various cash and liquidity systems. Now, with Palisade, Ripple is taking this ambition a step further by integrating custody and wallet technology that allows firms to control their assets in a tightly controlled crypto environment. Ripple acquires Palisade to deepen custody and wallet push The purchase will grant Ripple access to Palisade’s sophisticated multi-chain wallet t echnology and top-quality custody facility. Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service scheme enables fintechs and businesses of all sizes to store and manage digital assets securely on a platform. Ripple stated in a press release on Monday that the acquisition would enhance its ability to hold and secure digital assets for fintech companies, crypto-focused businesses, and large enterprises across multiple blockchains. The company’s president, Monica Long, stated that corporations are expected to drive the next major phase of cryptocurrency adoption. She explained that by combining Ripple’s highly secure vault system with Palisade’s fast and lightweight wallet technology, the company can now offer institutions a complete solution — covering long-term storage, global payments, and treasury management. The purchase also provides Palisade wallets with an easy-to-integrate API that enables the quick addition of multi-party computation wallet technology, according to Ripple. Palisade Custody, on the other hand, offers governed storage of digital properties. As corporate involvement in the cryptocurrency market expands, experts anticipate that more corporations will make major acquisitions, such as Ripple’s. According to the firm, the move aligns with its broader goal of making crypto infrastructure accessible to major corporations. It positions them as corporate partners. Corporate clients drive Ripple’s strategy According to Ripple, the next significant wave of adoption will be driven not by cryptocurrency enthusiasts but by corporations. The firm currently holds more than 75 regulatory licenses worldwide, enabling it to offer the most comprehensive, regulatory-compliant custody and payment solutions across multiple jurisdictions among digital asset firms. This compliance advantage will be further enhanced by Palisade’s integration, particularly in the digital asset custody sector, which is experiencing rapid growth due to stricter regulations and an increase in hacking cases. Finally, this move further demonstrates Ripple’s fundamental goal of backing additional digital ecosystems, not just XRP. Palisade technology supports tokens on Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains, enabling Ripple to venture beyond its traditional comfort zone. According to experts, this development is part of a larger trend in which the world’s top blockchain companies are merging their technologies as they prepare for a significant influx of institutions into the digital asset sector. A surge in demand for regulatory-compliant, secure custody has recently emerged among hedge funds, fintechs, and major corporations. With Palisade, Ripple intends to integrate the firm’s technology into its existing platforms, including Ripple Payments and Ripple Custody. Ultimately, Palisade aims to create a connected, end-to-end system that enables firms to store, transfer, and spend digital assets globally. It intends to do so inside Ripple’s platforms. Multi-chain support is also being expanded to allow for greater collaborative efforts among blockchain networks. It may lay the groundwork for more outstanding cross-border settlements and the integration of decentralized finance for firms. Due to this, experts predict that Ripple’s recent acquisitions will transform it into a major contender with crypto custodians such as Coinbase Institutional, Fireblocks, and Anchorage Digital.

The company holds 192 bitcoins, while its cash holdings stand at $389 million. The moonshots portfolio includes a stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS) worth $62 million. BitMine is close to its Alchemy of 5% goal BitMine, as previously mentioned, now controls 2.8% of the total circulating Ethereum supply. The company is at the halfway point toward its goal, known as the “Alchemy of 5%.” BitMine announced its “Alchemy of 5%” plan in March and has been accumulating Ethereum aggressively since then. Based on a Cryptopolitan report , the firm acquired 27,316 ETH worth $113 million from BitGo exchange. Last month, the crypto treasury company purchased a total of 662,169 ETH. The firm now leads other crypto treasury companies in terms of crypto NAV per share. It also maintains a high trading volume for its stock, BMNR.

He said, “Ethereum fundamentals continue to strengthen at an accelerating pace, with stablecoin supply on ETH rising >15% in the past 8 weeks and application revs reaching an all-time high.” Lee explained that in crypto, price leads fundamentals, and sometimes fundamentals take over, “but price converges higher.” He said that the recent market crash, which wiped out over $19 billion from crypto markets, is a health reset. Lee added, “[the liquidation event] sets the stage for price and fundamentals to eventually converge. BMNR shares are down by 8.12% Despite the positive news, BMNR shares dropped more than 8.12% on Monday due to a wider market sell-off. The stock closed trading at $42.86, based on Yahoo Finance data.

Explore Moonbull, Toncoin, And Sui to Find the Next Big Opportunity",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-crypto-to-join-now-explore-moonbull/,"What if the next big crypto moonshot is already in liftoff mode, and you’re still waiting at the gate? The chase for the best crypto to join now has investors scanning charts, watching presales, and hunting for early entries that can turn a few hundred dollars into serious profits. With meme coins making headlines and top layer 1s attracting significant capital, timing has become everything in the crypto game. Finding the best crypto to join now feels like trying to grab concert tickets before the crowd knows the show’s happening. One day it’s quiet; the next, prices explode. Toncoin and SUI continue to make headlines with real utility and growth, but MoonBull ($MOBU) is stealing attention with one of the most talked-about presales in 2025. MoonBull ($MOBU): Why It Could Be The Best Crypto To Join Now? MoonBull ($MOBU) is a community-first best crypto to join now built on Ethereum that’s mixing humor with real token mechanics. It’s designed to reward everyday traders through auto liquidity, holder reflections, and ongoing burns that shrink supply and support long-term growth. Every transaction boosts liquidity, rewards holders, and adds scarcity, giving the project both staying power and meme appeal. Unlike typical meme coins, MoonBull focuses on fairness. The team passed an external audit and locked liquidity early, showing real transparency. Community voting begins mid-presale, allowing holders to decide on burns, campaigns, and major initiatives. With a 23-stage presale structure, MoonBull ensures early participants get the best entry price while building steady demand. The presale is now in Stage 5 at $0.00006584, with over $550K raised and 1,700 holders. Returns from Stage 1 already sit at 163%, and the projected ROI to listing price ($0.00616) exceeds 9,000 percent. A $20,000 purchase today could turn into roughly $1.87 million post-listing. It’s like finding Bitcoin back when it still had training wheels. If the goal is joining early and holding strong, MoonBull might just be the best crypto to join now. Toncoin (TON) Pumps After Chainlink Deal And Telegram Payments Toncoin has been making serious moves lately. Its integration with Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Data Streams connected TON to over 60 blockchains, unlocking faster liquidity and real-time data flow for developers. This step expanded Toncoin’s role in DeFi and multi-chain payments, pushing both adoption and credibility among large networks. Meanwhile, Telegram introduced QR-based Toncoin payments in Argentina, boosting on-chain activity and wallet growth by more than 6 percent. The latest upgrade, version 2025.10, also improved efficiency and reduced network costs. Analysts expect the TON price could range from $4.21 to $6.95 in 2025, with the potential to reach $10 if momentum continues. Toncoin is proving it’s not just hype, it’s infrastructure in motion. SUI (SUI) Jumps On Stablecoin Launch And ETF Hype SUI has grabbed attention with its launch of native stablecoins USDi and suiUSDe, lifting prices by about 5 percent in early October 2025. The move fueled DeFi activity and helped total value locked cross $2.63 billion, cementing SUI’s position as a top layer 1 blockchain. However, upcoming token unlocks worth $653 million could add short-term volatility, drawing mixed reactions from traders. On the institutional side, reports hint at a potential SUI-linked ETF that could open the door to broader exposure. With strong developer activity and growing stablecoin adoption, SUI continues to build relevance in DeFi. Despite the supply pressure, its roadmap signals long-term growth and increasing real-world traction. Final Thoughts MoonBull ($MOBU) offers the excitement of a community-powered presale and the fundamentals of a well-built crypto ecosystem. With staking rewards, locked liquidity, and top referrer bonuses paid in USDC, it’s a project built for long-term believers. Toncoin and SUI bring proven track records and network expansion, but MoonBull captures that rare early-stage energy investors chase. Based on research and market trends, this could be the best crypto to join now for anyone who wants to get in before the mainstream rush. MoonBull’s presale is live, holders are multiplying daily, and the next price jump is around the corner. Blink, and the rocket might already be gone.

Speaking on X, Gaevoy wrote : “literally nothing changed since this tweet and we never had plans to sue Binance, nor see any reason to do it in the future.” His post directly addressed social media speculation that Wintermute had suffered heavy losses and was preparing legal action against Binance. The rumors began circulating shortly after the October 10th market crash, which wiped out more than $20 billion in leveraged positions across crypto exchanges. The sudden sell-off led to widespread liquidations, sparking fears that some major market makers or trading firms were at risk of collapse. In a follow-up thread, Gaevoy wrote that Wintermute had no issue with Binance, noting that the firms had worked together for years and saw no reason to escalate anything legally. Wintermute clears the air after October crash Many crypto-watchers have described the October 10th crash as one of the largest liquidation events recorded in recent cryptocurrency history. According to analysts, more than $20 billion in open interest was wiped out in a matter of a few hours as a result of a liquidation spiral following the forced closure of countless leveraged positions on every major exchange. Experts claimed that the crash was the result of high levels of leverage combined with a sudden drop in liquidity, which created perfect storm conditions for even minor price canes to turn disastrous for traders. Individual traders, professional market makers, and centralized exchanges all suffered from ramped-up losses. A few days after the incident, Binance revealed that it had already paid $283 million in compensation to some affected traders after synthetic assets USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH went off-peg. In addition, the exchange also launched a $400 million rescue fund, including $100 million allocated as low-interest capital to aid institutional clients re-enter trading. Although Binance confirmed compensation for its market players, it is uncertain if Wintermute was among the reimbursed. In a Big Brain episode of The Block’s podcast, shared late October, Gaevoy admitted that some of Wintermute’s liquidation strikes were “very weird” and occurred at “completely ridiculous prices.” Nonetheless, he objected to stakeholders’ concerns that the firm’s overall financial security was undermined. He clarified that Wintermute had been fine, adding that the firm’s systems had worked precisely and managed risk effectively despite the intense volatility. According to other sources, Wintermute, one of Binance’s largest liquidity providers, sent more than $700 million worth of cryptos to the exchange a few hours before the crash. Gaevoy confirmed on “ Big Brain ” that the company withdrew “roughly the same amount.” Wintermute’s response calms market nerves Moreover, the obvious unwillingness of Wintermute to wage a legal battle regarding the spread of rumors about the lawsuit has a calming effect on the public. In the aftermath of October’s high volatility, when switching from Binance or one of its subsidiaries would have raised too many questions, a legal struggle between one of the market’s leading market makers and the world’s largest exchange could have exacerbated market anxiety, provoking possible liquidity crises in all exchanges. In contrast, Gaevoy’s assertion suggests that during those difficult times, Wintermute was able to maintain stability without attacking other projects behind the scenes. Market observers claim this is also a form of publicity worth considering. For Binance itself, the absence of threats of legal action means an alleviation of its position, as the exchange also continues to face pressure in various jurisdictions. Binance has been subject to a series of enforcement actions over the past several months, but it remains the leader in terms of market share.

This continues the scrutiny on the safety of the automaker’s products following several fatal crashes and incidents of passengers being trapped in their cars following crashes. Tesla Inc. is facing another major lawsuit after a Wisconsin family accused the automaker of negligence in a crash that killed five people. The case claims that Tesla’s Model S’s electronic doors failed to open after the vehicle caught fire, trapping the occupants inside. A Wisconsin family is suing Tesla over a fatal crash The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Wisconsin state court, is based on a crash that happened last November that killed Jeffrey Bauer, 54, and Michelle Bauer, 55, along with three others. According to the complaint filed by the couple’s children, the Bauers initially survived the impact when their Tesla sedan hit a tree, but were unable to escape the vehicle before it was engulfed in flames. A nearby homeowner who called 911 reported hearing screams from inside the burning car. A sheriff’s report described a cluster of bodies in the front seat, suggesting the victims tried to escape but couldn’t open the doors. “Tesla’s design choices created a highly foreseeable risk — that occupants who survived a crash would remain trapped inside a burning vehicle,” the family’s lawyers said. The suit accuses Tesla of negligence and argues that the company was aware of risks tied to its electronic door handles and the potential for battery fires, but did not act to fix them. The case has sparked a debate over the safety of Tesla’s handle design. The automaker makes use of retractable electronic handles that rely on power from the vehicle’s low-voltage battery. If that system fails during a crash, doors must be opened manually from inside, but many owners are unfamiliar with this method. The Dane County Sheriff’s Office found that speed, road conditions, and possible impairment contributed to the crash. Despite that, the plaintiffs argue that vehicle manufacturers must ensure the protection of passengers during and after a collision, including allowing escape in a fire. “Regardless of the cause of a crash, the manufacturer’s obligation includes designing vehicles that permit timely escape and rescue in the event of fire.” Tesla is also facing a suit in California filed by the families of three college students who allege that a similar design flaw led to their deaths in a fiery crash last year. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, and China address the dangers After several similar incidents of passengers getting trapped in their cars due to Tesla’s door design, regulators across multiple regions are taking action. Cryptopolitan reported earlier in October that the Dutch Vehicle Authority (RDW) revised its approval rules for all Tesla models sold in the European Union after reports of people getting trapped inside their cars after crashes, particularly when power systems fail. In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into Tesla’s Model Y to determine whether the design fails in emergencies and violates federal safety standards. At that time, Tesla’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, told Bloomberg that the company was working on a redesign of the handle to make it more “intuitive for occupants in a panic situation.” So far, there has been no update on a release date for the redesign. Chinese regulators are considering a national mandate that requires every passenger car to have mechanical door releases that work both inside and outside, even if the vehicle loses power.

This situation has supported the argument for the central bank to maintain its interest rate steady while it attempts to slow the rapidly emerging housing market. The announcement followed reports from the Ministry of Data and Statistics, which highlighted that consumer prices had soared by 2.4% compared to the same period last year. This percentage is up from a 2.1% increase in September. Additionally, this rate surpassed the average forecast of 2.2% from economists surveyed by a reliable source, marking the highest record since July 2024, when prices surged by 2.6%. Economist Bumki Son believes the BOK will focus on long-term inflation predictions Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose to 2.2%, up from 2% in September of this year. Following this progress, sources reported that overall and core inflation are currently above the Bank of Korea’s 2% target. This newly released inflation data comes at a pivotal moment when the Bank of Korea (BOK) has decided to maintain its crucial interest rate unchanged for the last three meetings. Despite the economy encountering challenges from Trump’s tariffs, concerns regarding asset bubbles and risks associated with household debt have prompted officials to make this rate decision. In his case, the relevant officials affirm that they will not start lowering rates again after they began last October. Meanwhile, reports from sources have acknowledged that whether policymakers view this recent report as another reason to maintain their pause likely depends on how they interpret the cause of the recent price increase. “Inflation surprised many by rising due to stronger price pressures from goods and services related to Chuseok, along with adjustments in imported car prices,” stated Bumki Son, an economist at Barclays Bank PLC. Son added that since part of this rise is related to seasonal spending, they believe that the BOK will focus on long-term inflation predictions and not worry too much about temporary changes. The economist also outlined Barclays’ intention to maintain its forecast for the central bank to reduce rates this month, due to concerns regarding Korea’s weak growth prediction. “Our main expectation still assumes that worries about financial stability will lessen as we approach the November Monetary Policy Committee meeting,” he added. The central bank expresses limitations in decision-making due to the latest pricing trends Currently, the latest pricing trends are limiting the central bank’s decisions as it considers the impact of 15% US tariffs on South Korean goods on the country’s economic status. According to the BOK’s expectation, these tariffs will weaken growth by 0.45 percentage points this year and by 0.6 points in 2026. In the meantime, after thorough research, the surge in inflation during October was primarily caused by a decline of almost 1.9% in the won against the dollar last month, according to sources. This scenario increased import charges for energy and food. Consequently, the currency hit its lowest point since March and has been ranked as one of the weakest Asian currencies compared to the dollar since October 1st. On the other hand, fuel prices escalated after the government lowered fuel tax subsidies in October, exerting more pressure on gasoline prices. At the same time, reports from the Korea Real Estate Board highlighted that apartment costs in Seoul continued to skyrocket for the 39th consecutive week as of October 27. In the same month, food and non-alcoholic beverage prices soared by 5% compared to last year, while costs for housing and utilities increased by 1.2%. Moreover, food and lodging prices escalated by 3.2%, and transportation expenses increased by 3.4%. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Brace For EU Power Shift Toward Central Regulation The asset has struggled to maintain its uptrend, slipping below the $3,800 level and testing the critical $3,715 support zone. Analysts note that this level has been retested multiple times since October, serving as a key battleground between bullish and bearish sentiment. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD show weakening momentum, suggesting that sellers remain in control. A decisive close below $3,680 could expose ETH to deeper losses toward $3,550 or even $3,500. However, a rebound from this level could allow buyers to target resistance zones near $3,920 and $4,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term bearish tone, Ethereum’s broader chart structure forms a falling wedge pattern, a setup often preceding a bullish reversal. Ethereum (ETH) On-Chain Data Signals Accumulation Despite Downtrend While technicals paint a cautious picture, on-chain activity reveals signs of underlying strength. According to Glassnode and Sentora data, over $600 million worth of ETH has been withdrawn from exchanges in just one week. This mass exodus often signals accumulation, as investors move holdings to cold wallets for long-term storage. Supporting this view, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio, a key valuation metric comparing market value to realized value, currently stands at 1.50, a level historically associated with market equilibrium before major uptrends. Notably, staked Ethereum maintains an even higher MVRV of 1.7, suggesting that long-term holders are confident in ETH’s recovery. With 36.1 million ETH staked, representing nearly a third of total supply, the data highlights reduced selling pressure and growing network resilience. Stablecoin Surge and Institutional Confidence Prepare for Rebound Beyond price action, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand. October saw a record $2.82 trillion in stablecoin transaction volume on the network, a 45% increase month-over-month, driven by yield farming and institutional liquidity management. Analysts interpret this as a sign of capital rotation rather than market exit, with traders parking funds in stablecoins while awaiting favorable conditions to re-enter ETH positions. Institutional inflows into Ethereum-based products have also topped $15 billion in 2025, reflecting steady confidence in Ethereum’s long-term role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and payments.

Parallel Channel Could Chart Out What’s Next For Ethereum In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a dream trajectory that Ethereum could follow with respect to a Parallel Channel. The “Parallel Channel” here refers to a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Key Retest: Bounce Or $98,000 Next? The upper line of the pattern is assumed to be a source of resistance, so tops can be likely to occur during retests of it. Similarly, the bottom level can provide support to the price, helping it to rebound. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel earlier in the year, but found rejection at it. The asset has since slipped down and arrived near the line, sitting a distance equal to three-fourths the height of the channel from the lower line. The analyst has noted that a dream scenario could be for ETH to find a rebound around here and smash past the $4,900 level, corresponding to the upper boundary of the Parallel Channel. Generally, Parallel Channel breakouts signal a continuation of the trend in that direction. This means that a surge above a Parallel Channel’s resistance can be considered a bullish sign, while a fall under the support level may lead to bearish action. Parallel Channel breakouts can be of the same length as the height of the channel. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, if ETH can break past the $4,900 mark, it may go all the way up to $8,000, corresponding to this length. For now, Ethereum is heading down, so it only remains to be seen whether its price will be able to find a rebound in the near future and retest the upper boundary of the Parallel Channel.

54005869,619994,1762222187,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54005869.jpeg,Warum Strategy jetzt weniger BTC kauft und wie Bitcoin Hyper trotzdem profitiert,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-saylor-kurs-btc-kauf/,"Strategy hat seine Bitcoin Käufe stark reduziert und liegt auf dem niedrigsten Niveau seit Jahren. Der Grund dafür sind schwierige Marktbedingungen und weniger Geld, das über Aktien aufgenommen werden kann. Trotzdem deutet Michael Saylor immer wieder an, bald erneut groß einzukaufen. Strategy gilt seit Jahren als das Unternehmen, das BTC am stärksten unterstützt und immer wieder große Mengen gekauft hat. Doch plötzlich stoppt der Konzern seinen rasanten Einkaufstakt und wirkt deutlich vorsichtiger. Viele Anleger fragen sich nun: Hat Strategy seine Meinung geändert – oder plant das Unternehmen im Hintergrund bereits den nächsten großen Schritt? Strategy stoppt seine schnellen Bitcoin-Käufe Strategy hat seine BTC-Käufe stark verlangsamt. Früher kaufte das Unternehmen manchmal zehntausende BTC in wenigen Tagen. Jetzt sind es nur noch etwa 200 BTC pro Woche. Das ist der niedrigste Wert seit 2020, also seit der Zeit, als Strategy überhaupt erst begann, Bitcoin regelmäßig zu kaufen. Die Veränderung ist deutlich und fällt Experten in der Branche sofort auf. Viele fragen sich, warum die aggressive Strategie plötzlich pausiert. Trotzdem betont das Unternehmen weiterhin: BTC bleibt der wichtigste Teil der Finanzstrategie. Es handelt sich also nicht um einen Ausstieg oder einen Kurswechsel. Vielmehr geht es darum, die aktuelle Marktsituation genau zu beobachten. Das Ziel bleibt langfristig, Bitcoin als digitalen Wertspeicher zu halten — ähnlich wie andere Firmen früher Gold gehalten haben. Warum Strategy aktuell vorsichtiger handelt Der Grund für die Pause liegt nicht daran, dass Strategy nicht mehr an Bitcoin glaubt. Stattdessen sind die Finanzbedingungen schwieriger geworden. Normalerweise hat Strategy neue Aktien ausgegeben, um mit diesem Geld BTC zu kaufen. Doch der Preis der Strategy-Aktie ist deutlich gefallen — etwa 50 % unter dem Höchststand. Auch Bitcoin selbst liegt rund 16 % unter seinem Rekordpreis . Dadurch lohnt es sich aktuell weniger, neue Aktien zu verkaufen. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Zusätzlich ist der Preisaufschlag auf die Strategy-Aktien fast verschwunden. Früher lag er bei über 200 %, jetzt sind es nur noch rund 4 %. Das bedeutet: Strategy kann aktuell viel schlechter Geld über den Aktienmarkt bekommen. Die Folge: Das Unternehmen muss vorsichtiger sein und kann nicht mehr so schnell einkaufen wie zuvor. Es geht also nicht darum, BTC aufzugeben — sondern darum, die richtige Zeit abzuwarten. Rückblick: Von Rekordkäufen zu einer Pause In den vergangenen Jahren war Strategy berühmt für seine massiven Bitcoin-Investitionen. Das Unternehmen kaufte einmal 55.500 BTC in einer einzigen Woche — ein Rekord, der weltweit Schlagzeilen machte. Insgesamt besitzt Strategy heute mehr als 640.000 BTC. Das entspricht rund 3,2 % aller verfügbaren Bitcoin. Kein anderes Unternehmen hält so viele. MICHAEL SAYLOR: ""If you want to be successful, adopt a Bitcoin Standard."" ""Buy Bitcoin, hold Bitcoin, support the Bitcoin protocol, do not sell your Bitcoin."" pic.twitter.com/FoBXS3oFkP — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) November 3, 2025 Dass Strategy nun fast zum alten, langsamen Kaufverhalten zurückkehrt, erinnert an die Anfangszeit der Strategie im Jahr 2020. Für viele Experten zeigt das eine Art „Ruhephase“ nach einer extrem schnellen Aufbaustrategie. Es ist typisch für Strategy, in Wellen zu kaufen — schnelle Phasen, gefolgt von Pausen. Diese Pause bedeutet also nicht automatisch, dass die Strategie vorbei ist. Saylor deutet trotz Pause neue Käufe an Michael Saylor, der Gründer und Vorsitzende von Strategy, bleibt weiterhin einer der größten BTC Fans weltweit. Er nutzt regelmäßig soziale Medien, um Nachrichten und Hinweise zu teilen. Kürzlich schrieb er erneut „Orange Dot Day“ — eine Botschaft, die er oft kurz vor neuen Käufen nutzt. Für viele Investoren ist das ein Alarmzeichen: Es könnte bald wieder losgehen. Saylor wiederholt ständig: Bitcoin ist das beste langfristige Vermögensgut. Er betrachtet BTC als die Zukunft des Geldsystems. Auch wenn gerade nicht gekauft wird, klingt sein Ton unverändert optimistisch. Wer Saylor kennt, weiß: Er handelt häufig dann, wenn andere zögern. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Wie geht es jetzt weiter? Es sieht so aus, als würde Strategy einfach auf den richtigen Moment warten. Sobald sich die Finanzmärkte wieder beruhigen und der Aktienpreis steigt, könnte das Unternehmen wieder aktiv BTC kaufen. Viele Beobachter rechnen damit, dass Strategy sogar noch größere Käufe vorbereiten könnte — gerade weil die Pause jetzt so auffällig ist. Für Einsteiger bedeutet das: Strategy bleibt ein wichtiger Spieler im Markt. Das Unternehmen handelt nicht aus Panik, sondern nutzt Finanzzyklen. Der nächste große Schritt könnte Überraschungen bringen — und die Märkte erneut bewegen. Bitcoin Hyper: Mehr Nutzen auf dem Fundament, das MicroStrategy stärkt MicroStrategy ist heute der größte börsennotierte BTC-Holder der Welt und spielt eine wichtige Rolle dabei, BTC im globalen Finanzsystem zu verankern. Je mehr große Investoren BTC halten, desto deutlicher zeigt sich: BTC wird immer mehr zum digitalen Wertspeicher der Zukunft. Genau hier setzt Hyper an. Während MicroStrategy BTC als strategisches Asset etabliert, erweitert Bitcoin Hyper dessen Möglichkeiten. Das Projekt nutzt die Sicherheit und Stabilität des Bitcoin-Netzwerks – kombiniert sie aber mit der hohen Geschwindigkeit, Skalierbarkeit und Programmierbarkeit von Solana. So entsteht ein System, in dem BTC nicht nur gehalten werden kann, sondern auch aktiv nutzbar wird – etwa für schnelle Transaktionen, Yield-Modelle, dApps und moderne Finanzanwendungen. Bitcoin bleibt das sichere Fundament, BTC Hyper baut darauf eine leistungsfähige Nutzungsschicht. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Mit BTC wachsen – und darüber hinaus Der $HYPER-Token ist das Herzstück dieser Erweiterung. Wenn institutionelles Interesse an Bitcoin weiter steigt – angefeuert durch Unternehmen wie MicroStrategy – wächst auch der Bedarf, Bitcoin effizient einsetzen zu können. Genau dann zeigt Hyper seine Stärke: Die Robustheit von Bitcoin, kombiniert mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana um BTC-Power in die Welt der modernen Blockchain-Anwendungen zu bringen Kurz gesagt: BTC legt den Wert. Hyper entfaltet ihn. Wer an den langfristigen Erfolg von Bitcoin glaubt, findet in $HYPER eine sinnvolle Ergänzung, um nicht nur am Wertwachstum, sondern auch an der aktiven Nutzung des Bitcoin-Ökosystems teilzuhaben.

Over the past six months, a remarkable 209,000 BTC has moved off centralized exchanges, according to data from Santiment, as reported by CryptoBriefing. This isn’t just a number; it signals a profound shift in investor behavior, driven by a desire for enhanced security and control in an increasingly volatile market. What’s Behind the Shrinking Bitcoin Exchange Balances? This dramatic decrease in Bitcoin exchange balances suggests a clear trend: investors are re-evaluating where they store their valuable digital assets. The primary catalyst appears to be the persistent market volatility that has characterized the cryptocurrency landscape. When prices fluctuate wildly, the perceived risk of keeping funds on exchanges, which can be vulnerable to hacks or regulatory actions, increases. Fear of Centralized Risks: Past incidents involving exchange failures or or security breaches have made investors wary. Desire for Sovereignty: Many Bitcoin proponents value the asset’s decentralized nature and prefer to hold their keys directly. The Rise of Self-Custody: Taking Control of Your BTC The reported drop in Bitcoin exchange balances directly correlates with a growing movement towards self-custody. Instead of leaving their Bitcoin on platforms managed by third parties, more investors are opting for “safer storage methods.” These methods typically involve moving Bitcoin to personal wallets, such as hardware wallets (often called cold storage) or secure software wallets. Hardware Wallets: Devices like Ledger or Trezor keep private keys offline, offering robust protection against online threats. Enhanced Security: Self-custody eliminates counterparty risk, meaning you don’t rely on an exchange’s security measures. Full Ownership: Holding your own keys grants you absolute control over your funds, aligning with Bitcoin’s core philosophy. Market Implications of Lower Bitcoin Exchange Balances This significant withdrawal of Bitcoin from exchanges has several crucial market implications. Firstly, a reduced supply of BTC available for immediate trading on exchanges can potentially lead to lower liquidity. This might make larger buy or sell orders more impactful on price. Secondly, historically, a decline in Bitcoin exchange balances is often seen as a bullish signal. Reduced Selling Pressure: When Bitcoin is moved off exchanges, it often indicates a long-term holding strategy (HODLing), reducing immediate selling pressure. Potential for Price Appreciation: A constrained supply on exchanges, coupled with consistent demand, could theoretically contribute to price increases. Decentralization Trend: It reinforces the core tenet of decentralization, as fewer Bitcoins are concentrated in centralized entities. Practical Steps to Secure Your Bitcoin Holdings If the trend of declining Bitcoin exchange balances inspires you to enhance your own crypto security, there are actionable steps you can take. Protecting your digital assets is paramount in the volatile crypto space. Invest in a Hardware Wallet: This is widely considered the gold standard for secure Bitcoin storage. Research reputable brands and ensure you buy directly from the manufacturer. Learn About Seed Phrases: Understand the importance of your 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. Store it securely offline, away from your device, and never share it. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For any remaining exchange accounts, always use strong 2FA (preferably an authenticator app, not SMS). Practice Good OpSec: Be wary of phishing attempts, use unique passwords, and keep your software updated. The substantial drop in Bitcoin exchange balances over the past six months is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of evolving investor sentiment. It highlights a collective move towards greater security and self-sovereignty in the face of market uncertainty. As the crypto landscape matures, the emphasis on robust personal security and independent asset control will likely only grow stronger, shaping the future of how we interact with digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Bitcoin exchange balances? Bitcoin exchange balances refer to the total amount of Bitcoin (BTC) held by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges on behalf of their users. These holdings represent the BTC available for trading and withdrawal on these platforms. 2. Why are investors moving Bitcoin off exchanges? Investors are increasingly moving Bitcoin off exchanges primarily due to concerns about market volatility and a desire for enhanced security. This shift allows them to mitigate risks associated with exchange hacks, regulatory actions, or platform insolvency, opting for safer, self-custody methods. 3. What is self-custody in the context of Bitcoin? Self-custody means holding your own Bitcoin private keys, rather than entrusting them to a third-party service like a cryptocurrency exchange. This typically involves using hardware wallets (cold storage) or secure software wallets, giving you complete control and responsibility over your digital assets. 4. Is it safer to keep Bitcoin off exchanges? Generally, keeping Bitcoin in a self-custodied wallet (especially a hardware wallet) is considered safer than leaving it on an exchange. While exchanges offer convenience, they are centralized targets for hackers and subject to operational risks. Self-custody eliminates these counterparty risks, though it places the full responsibility of security on the individual. 5. How does lower Bitcoin on exchanges affect the market? A decrease in Bitcoin on exchanges can have several market effects. It often signals a long-term holding sentiment (HODLing), potentially reducing immediate selling pressure. Lower supply on exchanges can also lead to decreased liquidity, meaning larger trades might have a more significant impact on price, and it can be interpreted as a bullish indicator.

Blue chip chains roar. Transactions fly. Traders slam keyboards. And somewhere in the corner, a tiny mosquito circles the arena with big dreams and even bigger bite energy. With markets heating up again and early-cycle excitement building, the hunt for the best crypto to buy has never felt more dramatic or fun. This round is not just about giants like Ethereum and Solana. It is also about one buzzing newcomer, La Culex , trying to sting its way past giants and sneak into the same conversation. A bold move, but in crypto tiny wings often beat loud footsteps. History has seen stranger breakouts. As always, crypto carries market risks. This report is for research and entertainment. DYOR and always stay safe in markets, even when the memes start flying harder than charts. Now the match begins. Eight contenders. One throne. Who claims the title of best crypto to buy going into 2025? 1. La Culex: The Flying Bug With a Bite and a Shot at Best Crypto to Buy Glory Imagine a mosquito with a finance degree, an attitude, and a dream to turn tiny buzz into big gains. That is La Culex. This project arrives as a swarm-powered meme-alt hybrid aiming to run faster than typical early-phase coins. The La Culex presale currently sits in Stage 4 with a Hive Signal price of $0.00002458. Every market cycle hides a wildcard. Some break through with tech. Some ride memes. Sometimes a frog goes viral. And now a mosquito buzzes in with attitude. La Culex enters the jungle with tiny wings and big plans, calling itself the top crypto presale right now. Stage 4, titled Hive Signal, runs for $0.00002458. More than 500 million tokens are already gone, over $10,000 in funds swarm inside, and roughly 80 holders sit early waiting for the hive to fill. Stages shift every 5 days or when milestones snap. So timing matters. The target listing price sits at $0.007, and early hive members already saw roughly 26.2% gains from the earliest stage movement. Now here is the math exercise. A $5,000 entry at the current price equals around 203,417,413 tokens. If price goals land, that bag could sit near $1,423,921.89 at listing before fees. Pure speculation, sure. But crypto icons have grown from memes, animals, and pixels before. The top crypto presale chase always loves a surprise guest. 2. Solana: Fast, Loud, and Still Throwing Punches in Q4 2025 Solana has energy and traders love it. With fast transactions and low fees, it stays one of the most active blockchains worldwide. In October 2025, Bloomberg reported that Solana ETFs passed major inflow milestones and institutional attention jumped again. That is strength nobody ignores. For many analysts, Solana sits right behind Ethereum in long-term upside strength. High-speed DeFi, gaming projects, and payments build momentum. Anyone hunting the best crypto to buy with proven market strength keeps Solana on the short list. 3. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract King Still Swinging Hard Ethereum enters 2025 as the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, tokenization, and enterprise blockchain. Upgrades on scalability keep rolling and Layer 2 networks keep stacking transactions. According to Glassnode, Ethereum staking participation crossed 32 million ETH locked in October 2025, showing growing confidence among long-term holders. Ethereum might not feel like the dramatic pick for the best crypto to buy title, but stability plus constant network usage can be just as powerful as early growth stories. Developers pick Ethereum first. Institutions recognize it. Smart contract traffic stays massive. A classic heavyweight that never sits out a cycle. 4. Ripple: The Utility-Driven Fighter With Global Influence Ripple, powered by XRP, remains laser-focused on real-world finance. Cross-border settlement keeps scaling and its institutional network touches banks worldwide. Ripple Labs reported new corridors expansion in Asia and the Middle East during late 2025, keeping demand lively. This coin does not try to be loud. It tries to be useful. In a world where real utility keeps winning, XRP still fights for the best crypto to buy label among serious investors and finance watchers. 5. Binance Coin: The Exchange Giant’s Fuel Token BNB stands strong because Binance stands strong. With millions using the exchange, BNB stays relevant for fees, launchpads, and chain participation. Even during market dips, activity around Binance keeps token demand alive. With Binance expanding products and compliance globally, BNB remains a top call in many best crypto to buy lists for traders who love big-brand endurance. 6. Cardano: Research-Built and Consistent Cardano maintains a slow but steady building style. Some call it too slow, others call it academic discipline. In 2025, multiple smart contract optimizations rolled out and DeFi liquidity climbed again. Messari data shows Cardano’s stable community and continued network health. Not the loud joker coin, but a solid chess-player coin. Sometimes the best crypto to buy is the one playing long games instead of short memes. 7. Chainlink: The Oracle Powerhouse Feeding Every Chain Data Chainlink powers price feeds, real-world data, and smart contract automation across ecosystems. It keeps proving that without data, blockchains cannot function. In Q3 2025, Chainlink crossed billions in value secured and expanded enterprise integrations. Whenever analysts debate critical infrastructure plays, LINK enters the chat. It may not meme, but real builders and institutions still call it the best crypto to buy for core utility. 8. Polkadot: The Multi-Chain Vision Still Charging Forward Polkadot continues building toward cross-chain futures. Parachains keep improving and governance upgrades rolled out across 2025. Fortune covered rising enterprise experimentation with cross-chain tech in September 2025, aligning with DOT’s vision. If markets reward interoperability next cycle, DOT has a clear runway to fight for best crypto to buy status again. Final Bite: Big Chains vs One Bold Bug Huge chains have stamina. They survived crashes, trends, and trade wars. But every bull cycle brings a surprise winner from nowhere. One project sneaks into charts like a mosquito buzzing into a board meeting. That is why La Culex stays on radar next to giants. Ethereum brings legacy. Solana brings speed. Ripple brings banking. BNB brings exchange power. Cardano brings research. Chainlink brings data. Polkadot brings cross-chain logic. La Culex brings a sting and a crowd whispering it could be the best crypto to buy before price wings flap too far. Crypto always rewards the bold and early. The next cycle might crown a heavyweight or shock everyone with a tiny flyer.

The title of best crypto to buy depends on momentum, adoption, and cycle strength. Big chains like Ethereum and Solana hold network power and real use. A buzzing newcomer like La Culex brings early-stage upside energy that traders watch closely for fast gains. Is La Culex a serious contender or just a meme-vibe project? a Culex mixes humor with real token utility, including staking structure and burn mechanics. It runs a structured presale phase that early buyers track closely. Like all early-stage assets, it carries risk, so research is key before entering the La Culex presale. Can large-cap altcoins still give strong returns in 2025? Yes, but returns may differ from early-phase coins. Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink already hold scale and steady network strength. They tend to move slower than micro-caps but provide stability and proven fundamentals across market cycles. Glossary Altcoin Any crypto asset that is not Bitcoin, often offering unique network features or utility. Presale Early token offering stage before public trading, typically at lower prices for first adopters. Listing Price The price at which a token launches on major exchanges for open-market trading. Tokenomics The structure of supply, rewards, vesting, and economic design behind a cryptocurrency. Staking Locking tokens to support network validation or earn network rewards. Burn Mechanism The process of permanently removing tokens from supply to increase scarcity and value potential. Liquidity The availability of tokens for trading on exchanges without heavy price impact. Summary The hunt for the best crypto to buy in Q4 2025 brings a lineup of heavyweight altcoins and one ambitious newcomer buzzing louder every week. Ethereum maintains smart contract dominance while Solana pushes ultra-fast transactions. Ripple builds banking corridors, Binance Coin fuels global exchange use, and Cardano leans on methodical research. Chainlink powers essential data layers and Polkadot backs cross-chain scaling. Then enters La Culex, a tiny-but-bold contender with a growing investor swarm and strategic token design. Its presale structure, utility concept, and viral messaging position it as a wildcard project many traders watch early in the cycle. Markets reward conviction and timing. Giants bring stability while small buzzing players can surprise with upside when momentum hits. As 2025 unfolds, the crown for best crypto to buy remains open, and tiny wings sometimes create the loudest results. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Nevertheless, analysts are identifying a collection of indicators suggesting that a bullish resurgence for the cryptocurrency could be on the horizon. What’s Fueling BTC’s Potential Surge This November? According to experts at The Bull Theory, November is poised to be the most bullish month of the year for Bitcoin, and the supporting numbers are quite compelling. Historically, November has been one of the strongest months not only for US equities but also for the Bitcoin price. For stocks, it consistently ranks as a top-performing month, while Bitcoin has historically recorded some of its most significant rallies during this time, averaging gains between 40% and 42%. What sets this November apart, however, are the underlying factors at play. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? One of the primary catalysts identified by the analysts is the anticipated end of the US government shutdown, which is expected to conclude this month. While this may seem like a political issue, its financial implications are substantial. They assert that the resumption of government spending means “billions of dollars” will start flowing back into contractors, projects, and public sectors. This return to fiscal spending acts as a mini liquidity injection into the economy. Historically, such movements of money have had a positive effect on risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies, as capital begins to rotate from the real economy into the financial system. Another significant factor is the planned ramp-up of corporate buybacks. Within the next few weeks, many major companies are expected to restart their buyback programs. This creates new demand in equities at a time when liquidity is improving, which historically has pushed stock indices higher. Given that cryptocurrencies often track global liquidity cycles, this corporate-driven demand could similarly benefit the crypto market. Bitcoin Price To Reach $160,000? Additionally, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has quietly re-entered the scene, as evidenced by a spike in daily overnight repo loans, which reached $29.4 billion—the highest level in nearly five years. This significant borrowing indicates that banks are short on dollars and are relying heavily on the Fed. Such activity typically signals stress in the short-term funding market. Related Reading: Pundit Elaborates On Ripple/SWIFT Theory That Will Send The XRP Price To $1,000 Historically, when repo activity surges, the Fed tends to inject liquidity to stabilize the situation. This influx of capital does not remain isolated within the banking system; it tends to flow through markets, lifting equities and eventually benefiting cryptocurrencies once confidence is restored. Moreover, the US Treasury’s General Account (TGA) balance has surged close to $1 trillion, sitting approximately $150 to $200 billion above normal levels. This capital is currently idle, but once government spending resumes following the shutdown, it is likely to begin circulating again. If the Bitcoin price performance this November mirrors its historical averages, the analysts anticipate a potential rally of around 40%. Such an increase could see the Bitcoin price reaching the $150,000 to $160,000 range.

The Noomez ($NNZ) ‘Stage X Million’ Airdrop is the Biggest Airdrop Crypto Event of the Year,https://timestabloid.com/looking-for-free-crypto-the-noomez-nnz-stage-x-million/,"Interest in free crypto is reaching new highs as traders search for projects offering real rewards instead of empty promises. That’s why attention is turning toward Noomez ($NNZ) and its massive “Stage X Million” Airdrop, now being called one of the biggest giveaway events of the year. The program rewards holders with millions of $NNZ tokens at the end of every presale stage, creating ongoing excitement without complicated requirements. With its transparent system and public results, Noomez is proving that free crypto can come from structure, not luck, and is reshaping how airdrops are viewed in 2025. How to Get Free Crypto Through the Noomez Airdrop Each stage of the 28-phase presale ends with a random draw that rewards one verified wallet with a token amount equal to the stage number in millions. For example, Stage 10 delivers 10 million $NNZ , while Stage 28 offers 28 million. The process is automatic and fully transparent, with results published publicly after every round. Unlike typical giveaways that rely on social tasks or referrals, this setup connects rewards directly to real meme coin presale participation. Noomez also gives a 10% bonus to both the buyer and the referrer during the presale. Projects that show verifiable proof of winners, like Noomez, offer a safer way to get free crypto instantly without hidden conditions. Pro Tip: Before joining any airdrop, always confirm that selection results and wallet addresses are viewable on-chain. How Participants Earn Free Crypto With Each Stage Noomez’s airdrop model stands out because it rewards ongoing participation rather than one-time sign-ups. Every presale stage functions as its own event, giving new and existing buyers a chance to win fresh allocations. The only requirement is a verified purchase of at least $20 during that stage , making it accessible to small investors as well as large ones. Once the timer expires or tokens sell out, the system automatically selects a wallet and sends the reward instantly, with all data visible on-chain. This system turns the presale into a live, recurring giveaway that sustains interest across all 28 stages. For those looking to earn free crypto , Noomez offers one of the most consistent and transparent models, proving that well-designed presales can balance community rewards with measurable fairness. Inside the Noomez “Stage X Million” Airdrop System Noomez ($NNZ) has built one of the most structured airdrop systems seen in recent presales. Each stage runs independently, closing with a random draw that sends tokens straight to the selected wallet – no waiting, no claiming forms, and no extra steps. The model ensures that every buyer who joins a stage has an equal chance of winning, whether they hold a small or large allocation. How it works: Each presale stage ends with an automated random selection. Rewards are sent instantly through smart-contract execution. Results and wallet IDs are published publicly for verification. This fair distribution has become a strong example of how to get free crypto without hidden rules or delays. The Airdrop Setting a New Standard for Presales The Noomez ($NNZ) “Stage X Million” event is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most buzzed-about crypto giveaways. Its blend of transparency, automation, and instant rewards has raised the bar for how presales operate. Each completed stage adds more visibility, while token burns and clear tracking keep the project grounded in measurable progress. Now, Stage 2 is live , priced at $0.0000123 per token, continuing this momentum. For traders exploring free crypto mining alternatives that don’t rely on heavy setups or hidden costs, Noomez offers a cleaner path, a presale where participation alone can lead to meaningful rewards, and a stronger connection to the project’s growth.

54006070,619474,1762225256,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54006070.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Shrinks on Binance While $7B In Stablecoins Arrive – Bullish Fuel Loading,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shrinks-binance-while-7b-stablecoins/,"Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as the market faces renewed selling pressure and short-term sentiment turns cautious. After weeks of volatility and failed attempts to hold above key resistance zones, investors are now watching closely to see whether BTC can stabilize and defend support as macro and liquidity factors continue to shift. Yet beneath the surface, new on-chain data points to a strong foundation forming — one that may be quietly setting the stage for the next major leg higher. According to fresh insights, Binance’s netflow data for October 2025 delivered one of the strongest bullish signals of this cycle. The exchange saw a record-breaking $7 billion net inflow, signaling a significant wave of capital preparing to enter the market. Even more importantly, the composition of this flow suggests a structurally bullish setup: the majority of incoming liquidity came from stablecoins, representing billions in sidelined buying power. At the same time, both Bitcoin and Ethereum registered net outflows from Binance — a sign that long-term holders are withdrawing funds to self-custody rather than preparing to sell. This divergence between incoming liquidity and decreased sell-side supply is historically associated with early accumulation phases and heightened bullish potential. In other words, while price action appears uncertain, the underlying capital rotation suggests Bitcoin may be gearing up for a decisive move. Stablecoin Surge + Bitcoin Outflows Create a Powder-Keg Setup for Next Move According to new data shared by CryptoQuant, one of the most compelling trends in recent months has been the scale and composition of capital flows into Binance. Over the past 30 days, the exchange recorded a net inflow of more than $5 billion in Tether (USDT) and an additional $2 billion in USD Coin (USDC). This is not ordinary liquidity — it is pure “dry powder”, capital deliberately positioned on the sidelines and waiting for favorable entry points. Such aggressive stablecoin inflows historically precede major market expansions, signaling that deep liquidity is preparing to re-enter risk assets. What makes this dynamic even more significant is that it is occurring alongside persistent outflows of crypto assets. Binance saw approximately $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and $500 million in Ethereum move off the platform in the same period — a classic hallmark of long-term accumulation. Investors withdrawing BTC and ETH to self-custody drastically reduces available sell-side supply, tightening the float and amplifying future price impact when demand accelerates. The combination is powerful: surging dollar liquidity + shrinking exchange balances = bullish supply-demand imbalance building beneath the surface. Additionally, flows into the “Other Altcoins” category have picked up noticeably, hinting that capital is beginning to position beyond majors — often an early signal of increasing risk appetite and the initial stages of an altcoin rotation. While price action remains choppy and sentiment cautious, this liquidity posture is historically aligned with pre-breakout market structure, not late-cycle exhaustion. Traders should watch closely for signs of stablecoin rotation into BTC and ETH; once that ignition point arrives, the resulting flow could mark the beginning of the market’s next major rally phase. BTC Retests Key Support as Market Awaits Direction Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, currently hovering near the $107,000–$108,000 support zone after failing to reclaim the $110,000 level. The chart shows price struggling below the short- and medium-term moving averages, signaling weakening momentum in the near term. The repeated rejections near $117,500, a major resistance and former range high, reinforce this level as a critical battleground for bulls. Until BTC reclaims and holds above this threshold, upside conviction remains limited. Price is also interacting with the 200-day moving average, which has acted as a dynamic support during this cycle. A confirmed breakdown below this moving average could open the door toward deeper liquidity pockets around $103,000–$105,000, where prior demand emerged during the post-October crash recovery. Still, the structure has not decisively shifted bearish. Bitcoin remains within a broad consolidation range that began in late summer, and despite volatility, sellers have yet to break the market’s higher-timeframe structure. As long as BTC holds above the $100K–$105K region, bulls maintain a defensive position. With macro catalysts in play and large capital inflows sitting on the sidelines, the coming sessions may determine whether this drawdown becomes a launchpad — or the market heads for another liquidity sweep before trending higher.

Firmen wie IREN, früher Iris Energy, stürzten zunächst ab und erlebten dann eine dramatische Wende. Seit der strategischen Neuausrichtung und dem Rebranding im November 2024 legte die Aktie über 580 % zu. Konkurrenten wie Riot Platforms, TeraWulf und Cipher Mining verzeichneten ebenfalls enorme Kursgewinne zwischen 100 % und 360 %, was zeigt, wie stark der Markt auf die neue Ausrichtung reagiert. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Die Basis dieses Erfolgs liegt in einer überraschenden Stärke der Miner: riesige Energie- und Kühlkapazitäten, die bereits bestehen. Diese Infrastruktur ist über Jahre aufgebaut worden und erlaubt einen schnellen Übergang von Blockchain-Verarbeitung zu High-Performance-Computing. Während klassische Rechenzentren Zeit benötigen, um auszubauen, stellen Miner sofort nutzbare Fähigkeiten bereit. Analysten sehen darin ein außergewöhnliches Beispiel für unternehmerische Anpassungsfähigkeit, denn die Branche wechselt von digitalem Goldschürfen zur Bereitstellung kritischer KI-Ressourcen. Milliardenverträge bestätigen strategischen Wert Ein entscheidender Moment für den Sektor war der Milliarden-Deal zwischen IREN und Microsoft. Das Technologieunternehmen sicherte sich ein 9,7-Milliarden-Dollar-Abkommen für Rechenzentrumskapazitäten in Texas. Zudem verfügt IREN über ein weiteres Vertragsvolumen von 5,8 Milliarden Dollar für GPU-Lieferungen von Dell. Diese Partnerschaften katapultieren den Miner in die erste Reihe globaler KI-Dienstleister. Branchenbeobachter sehen darin eine klare Botschaft: Die Energie- und Infrastrukturkompetenz der Miner ist ein strategischer Vorteil im Zeitalter der KI. HIVE has surged 283% this year to reach 23 EH/s of global Bitcoin mining capacity. Now expanding 32.5 acres in New Brunswick to build a Tier III+ HPC campus capable of scaling to over 25K next-gen GPUs powered by renewables. This is the next chapter of digital infrastructure pic.twitter.com/rbgZqIVFO3 — HIVE Digital Technologies (@HIVEDigitalTech) November 3, 2025 Auch andere Tech-Giganten beobachten und handeln. Amazon prüft laut Branchenkreisen vergleichbare Vereinbarungen mit weiteren Mining-Anbietern. Hintergrund ist der immense Bedarf an grafischen Prozessoren und Rechenleistung für KI-Modelle. Traditionelle Data-Center-Projekte können nicht mithalten, denn sie benötigen Jahre bis zur Fertigstellung. Miner verfügen dagegen schon über Kühlung, Netzanschlüsse und Erfahrung im Betrieb von Hochleistungssystemen. Investoren bewerten daher heute Faktoren wie Megawatt-Kapazitäten und GPU-Zuteilungen statt Bitcoin Hashrate. KI-Nachfrage sprengt klassische Kapazitäten Die globale KI-Welle schafft einen nie dagewesenen Hunger nach Rechenleistung. Modelle werden größer, Märkte schneller und Innovationszyklen kürzer. Unternehmen, die rechtzeitig Kapazitäten sichern, erhalten Wettbewerbsvorteile. In dieser Umgebung bieten Miner etwas Seltenes: sofort verfügbare Infrastruktur in industrieller Größe. Die Fähigkeit, schnell zu skalieren und GPUs effizient zu betreiben, macht sie zu bevorzugten Partnern für Hyperscaler und KI-Startups. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei Bitcoin noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Marktstrategen betonen, dass diese Wende erst der Anfang ist. Viele Miner entwickeln neue Standorte oder erweitern bestehende Anlagen, um den steigenden Bedarf zu decken. Netzbetreiber beobachten wachsende Stromanfragen aus Regionen wie Texas und North Dakota. Damit entsteht ein neues Machtzentrum für digitale Infrastruktur in den USA, das nicht mehr von Kryptowährungen allein abhängig ist. Für Anleger gilt: Das Mining-Geschäft hat sich dauerhaft verändert und ein neues, robusteres Geschäftsmodell hervorgebracht. US-Politik schafft Wettbewerbsvorteile Neben wirtschaftlichen Kräften beeinflusst auch die Geopolitik den Markt. Die US-Regierung blockierte zuletzt den Export leistungsstarker Nvidia-Blackwell-Chips nach China. Offiziell aus Sicherheitsgründen, praktisch aber zur Sicherung technologischer Führung. Das Timing kurz vor dem Treffen zwischen Donald Trump und Xi Jinping unterstreicht die Bedeutung des Themas Bitcoin und Kypto. China verliert Zugang zu modernsten KI-Prozessoren, während US-Firmen bevorzugt beliefert werden und sofort profitieren. BREAKING- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slammed U.S. export bans on AI chips to China, saying they wiped out Nvidia’s market share — “from 95% to 0%.” China will not loose but develop alternatives. Trump is now destroying US companies & rebellion has started pic.twitter.com/vr96uf0GUb — Megh Updates (@MeghUpdates) October 20, 2025 Für US Bitcoin Miner bedeutet dies ein stabiles politisches Umfeld und exklusiven Zugang zu Spitzentechnologie. In China hingegen kämpfen Miner mit Krypto-Regulierungen und GPU-Knappheit. Diese strukturellen Unterschiede schaffen einen klaren Vorsprung für amerikanische Anbieter. So entwickeln sich Miner zu unverzichtbaren Stützen der nationalen Technologie-Strategie. Unternehmen, die früher nur Token generierten, liefern heute kritische KI-Infrastruktur für internationale Tech-Konzerne. Neue digitale Energie-Ökonomie entsteht Die Branche steht an einem historischen Wendepunkt. Energienetzwerke, Chips und Datenzentren werden zu den wertvollsten Ressourcen der digitalen Welt. Bitcoin Miner galten lange als Nischenplayer, doch jetzt zeigen sie, wie flexibel digitale Energieproduktion eingesetzt werden kann. Ihr Übergang von Proof-of-Work zu KI-Rechenleistung markiert eine neue Phase, in der Strom und Hardware mehr wert sind als Coins. In Zukunft dürften hybride Modelle entstehen: Mining bei günstiger Energielage, KI-Betrieb bei hoher Nachfrage. Analysten erwarten weitere Übernahmen, Fusionen und Investitionen in Netz- und Kühltechnologien. Für den Markt bedeutet das Stabilität und Diversifizierung, während Technologieunternehmen dringend benötigte Kapazitäten erhalten. Der Wandel der Miner zeigt: Wer Infrastruktur kontrolliert, kontrolliert die Zukunft der künstlichen Intelligenz. PepeNode: Mining neu gedacht im Zeitalter von KI und Krypto Während klassische Bitcoin Miningzentren zunehmend für die KI-Revolution umgebaut werden, geht PepeNode einen anderen Weg und führt Mining zurück zu den Nutzern – jedoch virtuell und spielerisch. Statt Hardware und Stromkosten gibt es digitale Serverräume, Mining-Nodes und Upgrades, mit denen man $PEPENODE erzeugt. So entsteht eine moderne Weiterentwicklung des Mining-Prinzips: zugänglich, strategisch und ohne technische Hürden. Hier kommst du zu einer langfristigen Prognose zu PepeNode! Ein Memecoin mit echter Idee – Chancen, aber auch Risiko PepeNode zeigt, dass Memecoins mehr können als nur Trend sein. Durch Gamification entsteht ein funktionierendes Mini-Mining-Ökosystem, das Aktivität belohnt und Utility bietet. Trotzdem bleibt es ein spekulativer Coin: hohe Chancen, hohe Schwankungen. Wer versteht, dass hier Humor, Innovation und Risiko Hand in Hand gehen, könnte früh bei einem spannenden neuen Mining-Ansatz dabei sein.

Amazon stated in a press release that OpenAI will utilize hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) in the United States to run workloads on AWS infrastructure, planning to increase capacity in the coming years. Amazon stated that the rapid advancement of AI technology has created an unprecedented demand for computing power. According to Amazon, the deal’s initial phase will utilize existing AWS data centers, and Amazon will subsequently expand its OpenAI infrastructure. In an interview, AWS Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services Dave Brown stated that “It’s entirely separate capacity that we’re putting down.” He added that OpenAI is utilizing some of that capacity that is already available.

The deal gives OpenAI massive access to Amazon Web Services — its first-ever collaboration with the cloud giant — signaling that the $500 billion #AI leader is expanding beyond its dependence on… pic.twitter.com/EARpnyiRsK — Defcon7 (@Defcon7_) November 3, 2025 Amazon and OpenAI’s partnership comes less than a week after the ChatGPT developer altered its relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft, which first invested $13 billion in OpenAI in 2019, has an exclusive cloud relationship with the artificial intelligence (AI) startup. Microsoft announced in January that it would no longer be the exclusive OpenAI cloud provider and was switching to a system that would give it the first say in any new requests. Microsoft’s special standing under its recently agreed commercial terms with OpenAI ended last week, allowing the developer of ChatGPT to expand its partnerships with the other hyperscalers. The AI startup had already signed cloud agreements with Google and Oracle, but AWS leads the market by a wide margin. Amazon stated in a press release that AWS’s infrastructure deployment for OpenAI features an advanced architecture design optimized for optimal AI processing performance and efficiency. Clustering NVIDIA GPUs, including both GB200s and GB300s, on the same network using Amazon EC2 UltraServers enables low-latency performance across linked systems. The clusters also enable the ChatGPT developer to run workloads effectively and at peak performance. The press release explained that the clusters are designed to handle a range of workloads, from training next-generation models to providing inference for ChatGPT with the ability to adapt to OpenAI’s evolving requirements. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute. Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” – Sam Altman , OpenAI CEO Altman claimed that as OpenAI continues to expand the realm of what is feasible, its AI goals will be supported by AWS’s top-notch infrastructure. He added that the scope and instant accessibility of optimized compute illustrate why AWS is uniquely positioned to handle the extensive AI workloads of OpenAI. Amazon exceeded analyst forecasts in its earnings release last week, announcing a more than 20% year-over-year increase in AWS sales. However, Microsoft and Google had quicker growth, reporting 40% and 34%, respectively, in cloud expansion. OpenAI expands global AI infrastructure projects Recently, OpenAI has been making numerous deals. The ChatGPT developer announced buildout agreements worth approximately $1.4 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle, and Google. OpenAI plans to construct 30 gigawatts of computer power, equivalent to the electricity used in nearly 22.5 million homes in the U.S. The ChatGPT developer will also be completing a corporate reorganization that will value the company at $500 billion and position it for what could be Silicon Valley’s most significant IPO. In January, President Trump, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, and SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son announced OpenAI’s $500 billion data center plan, Stargate. Since then, the project for the AI data center has undergone significant growth. In September, OpenAI announced five additional data center locations in the United States, bringing the total capacity to approximately 7 gigawatts. Over the next three years, the company plans to invest over $400 billion in U.S.-based data center and AI infrastructure projects. Oracle delivered the first Nvidia GB200 racks in June, and OpenAI is already executing early training workloads on next-generation research at the flagship location in Abilene, Texas. In addition to the announcement of Stargate Argentina in October, OpenAI is developing additional AI computer infrastructure locations in Shackelford County, Texas.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ethereum-eth-indeed-surge-to-8k-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $3,700 at press time, down over 4% in 24 hours and nearly 11% on the week. While near-term momentum has turned bearish, several analysts are looking at this zone as a possible springboard for a broader move. Analysts Watch $3,800 as Key Level Ali Martinez outlined what he called the “ dream scenario ” for Ethereum. In this view, ETH would hold above $3,800, break through resistance near $4,900, and continue toward $8,000. His chart shows a step-by-step path higher, with pauses near $5,600, $6,400, and $7,200. He stated , “Ethereum bounces off $3,800, smashes through $4,900, and rockets to $8,000.” This move would require a clear break above the $4,900 area, which previously acted as a cap. That level remains a focus for market participants watching for signs of trend reversal. Source: Ali Martinez/X Short-Term Signals Show Weakness While longer-term setups remain in play, shorter timeframes show pressure building. The daily RSI is at 39, pointing to a lack of buying strength. The MACD also shows the trend leaning bearish, with the signal and MACD lines both in negative territory. Source: TradingView Ted noted that Ethereum is at a make-or-break zone. “If this level holds, Ethereum could rally towards $4,000 this week. If ETH fails to hold this, expect a dump below the $3,500 zone,” he said. On the ETH/BTC chart, market watchers continue to monitor key support zones that have historically acted as strong foundations during previous cycles. In earlier commentary, Michaël van de Poppe referred to this broader area as an “ ideal zone for buys. ” Broader Market Setup Remains Intact Chart watchers are also pointing to larger structures still in place. Trader Tardigrade described a falling wedge pattern on the weekly ETH chart, saying it remains valid and could lead to a move. Merlijn The Trader compared ETH’s setup to a previous Bitcoin cycle. “If the echo continues, ETH is about to rip,” he said. Crypto Patel noted that ETH remains in a wide trading range between $2,560 and $5,760. He highlighted that the MVRV ratio is currently at 1.5, which reflects a neutral zone historically seen before major price moves. He described this period as “ the calm before every big move in past cycles. ” On-chain activity supports this, with Crypto Rand reporting that ETH stablecoin transfer volume hit $2.82 trillion in October, a new record and a 45% rise from September.

Despite a weak Wave (5) formation, the broader uptrend remains intact, and momentum is quietly building. If the push continues, the next major test lies near the $1,300 zone — a level that could define BNB’s bullish chapter. Wave (5) Weakness Signals Possible Completion Of The Bounce Providing an update to a previous post on BNB, More Crypto Online highlighted that the recent bounce visible on the chart may now be nearing its completion phase. While price action initially appeared promising, momentum has started to weaken, raising questions about the sustainability of the upward move. Related Reading: BNB Reclaims $1,100 As Binance Founder Receives Presidential Pardon – New Rally Coming? According to the analyst, Wave (5) in the current structure looks relatively weak, which could indicate that buying pressure is fading. This development may point to the market preparing for a potential retracement or sideways movement before establishing a clearer direction. More Crypto Online emphasized the importance of staying flexible at this point, as market structure remains uncertain. Despite the recent bounce, there’s still no clear indication that the broader Wave 4 pullback has concluded. Until confirmation appears, the possibility of another downward move within the corrective phase cannot be ruled out. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the analyst maintained a positive long-term outlook, stating that the overall uptrend remains intact on the higher timeframe, as long as key structural supports hold firm. Breakout Builds Strength — Bulls Target The $1,230–$1,300 Zone According to a recent update by crypto analyst BitGuru, BNB’s price action is showing early signs of renewed strength, with buyers gradually stepping back into the market. The recent upward movement suggests growing confidence among traders after a period of consolidation. Related Reading: BNB Price Retreats After Rally — More Downside Risks On The Horizon In his post, BitGuru outlined that if this breakout gains traction, BNB could climb toward the $1,230–$1,300 range in the next bullish leg. Such a move would signal a continuation of the broader uptrend and potentially attract more momentum-driven participants. He further emphasized the importance of monitoring the current price action closely, noting that momentum is steadily building. As of the time of writing, BNB has recorded a 6% decline in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $1,027. This drop reflects a cooling phase after recent bullish attempts, as traders assess short-term market conditions. The token’s market capitalization now stands at approximately $141.34 billion, positioning it among the top-performing assets despite the temporary pullback. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume of $2.85 billion indicates active participation across exchanges.

54008328,619485,1762228854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54008328.jpeg,"Cardano Founder Fires Back At Critics, Outlines 2026 Revival Plan",https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-2026-revival-plan/,"Charles Hoskinson used his latest live AMA on November 1 to issue a point-by-point rebuttal to claims that Cardano is suffering from low adoption, thin liquidity, poor interoperability and marketing inertia—while laying out a 2026 growth blueprint anchored in the Midnight partner-chain, cross-ecosystem bridges, an events-driven marketing push, and clearer accountability for KPIs. Hoskinson framed the broadcast as a response to an “adversarial” community post listing seven alleged flaws “holding back Cardano adoption,” including the lack of USDC/USDT, “critically low” liquidity/TVL, “severe network congestion,” “minimal on-chain adoption,” limited marketing reach, poor interoperability/bridges, and thin tier-one exchange support for Cardano native tokens. He rejected the framing as “not fair,” arguing that it ignores both network realities and pipeline developments, and that it collapses the distinction between Cardano’s base-layer participation and DeFi usage. “It comes up quite a bit,” he said on the stablecoin debate. “There is this belief that if somehow, someway Tether or Circle came to Cardano, then magically all of our DeFi problems would be solved […] I do agree that there’s not enough stablecoins issued, but remember we have USDM, we have USDA. They don’t dip. They’re asset-backed […] and we can mint them all the time. I’ve personally minted them myself.” On TVL and adoption metrics, he contrasted DeFi snapshots with broader on-chain engagement: “It is absolutely valid that there’s about $680 million in TVL on Cardano. But […] we have 1.3 million people participating in either governance or staking […] more than 15 billion ADA […] We don’t get to count that in our TVL. Ethereum does […] but we don’t.” The core challenge, he argued, is not user scarcity but conversion: “Cardano users aren’t using Cardano DeFi […] If our own people consumed, our TVL would be $5 to $10 billion minimum instead of $680 million.” Midnight As Key Adoption Driver For Cardano A large portion of the AMA elevated Midnight—the privacy-preserving partner chain—as the mechanism to unlock the “interoperability and bridges” critique and to catalyze exchange coverage for Cardano native tokens. “I’ve spent the last six years building Midnight. We’re getting ready to launch […] [It] resolves pretty much all those concerns,” he said, adding that the token would be a Cardano-native asset with “tier one exchange listings,” “over a 100 partnerships,” and connectivity to “eight ecosystems, seven blockchains—Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, XRP, Avalanche, and obviously Cardano.” He positioned Midnight as a practical bridge layer for cross-chain capital and as a driver of DeFi participation on Cardano: “People are going to want to create yield with their [Midnight tokens], and so they’re going to utilize Cardano DeFi.” He also previewed distribution mechanics and scale claims around the Midnight drop: “Midnight is shaping up to be the largest drop in the history of the industry […] There are already millions of addresses […] about 200,000 participating in the glacier drops […] I believe Kraken and […] Gate [are participating] […] when you sum up all those people, it’s going to be probably over a million, which makes it larger than Arbitrum.” On stablecoins specifically, he forecast resolution via Midnight’s negotiation leverage and a trust-minimized “recursive snark bridge” between Midnight and Cardano: “As for the stablecoin side of things, that’s going to get totally resolved in 2026 […] If it’s on Midnight, we’ll have a trustless recursive bridge […] Native issuance on Midnight into Cardano.” Cardano Scaling Hoskinson dismissed the “severe network congestion” critique as inconsistent with current utilization. “Our blocks are about a third to half full most of the time or less […] do we really have a throughput problem?” He pushed back on suggestions that Cardano’s scaling stack was unreleased: “Hydra is working on mainnet right now […] If you participated in the Glacier drop, you were using Hydra […] Hydra has reached version 1.0 . There are numerous people on Cardano mainnet using Hydra right now on a per-application basis.” As evidence of efficiency, he cited loading “33.6 million eligible addresses” into a Hydra head for the drop “at a total operation cost” of less than five figures. On the data availability/throughput track he calls Leios , Hoskinson said “the SIP is done” and that “linear Leios is being planned for released next year,” with a public monthly R&D cadence and an upcoming progress website. He linked those efforts to partner-chain finality work and recursive SNARKs, arguing Cardano is scaling “with values”—maintaining decentralization and resilience while adding throughput. Marketing And Governance While rejecting claims of “negligible marketing reach,” Hoskinson conceded underperformance and said he would personally drive an event-centric push in 2026: “Even though it’s not my job, I’m going to make some of it my job […] we’re going to have four major events per year […] bring the top 25 to top 50 dApp/DeFi projects on Cardano to those events to augment the Cardano booth, the IO booth.” He pointed to Token2049 as a model—“we took over that entire event […] even the Wi-Fi codes”—and called for a sustained campaign around Cardano’s “USPs.” He repeatedly stressed the absence of a single entity accountable for growth. “There is nobody currently accountable […] for the growth of Cardano. If it’s no one’s problem, everyone’s problem is no one’s problem.” The remedy, in his view, is a 2026 framework of delegated authority with explicit KPIs across MAUs, transaction volume, TVL, active dApps, developer counts, integrations and blockchain-to-blockchain partnerships. In this context he contrasted the Midnight Foundation’s “hungry” execution—“they announce deals every week”—with frustration at the Cardano Foundation’s silence on Midnight partnerships and listings: “Zero tweets saying Midnight is a big thing […] It’s frustrating to me because how do we win if we destroy ourselves?” Pipeline: Africa, Bitcoin DeFi, Partnerships Hoskinson said IO is preparing Cardano-native DeFi applications for 2026 and emphasized that the “real” Africa microfinance product never stopped. “We never gave it up. We never stopped. Go to Twitter. People just lie until it becomes reality in their minds. They say we abandon Africa. John O’Conor is still here. It’s a huge team. We’ve been lending money like crazy, my money, and we’re opening it up for micro finance, banking the unbanked, the economic identity side of it. And that is coming in 2026. I think that’s going to be the largest contributor to Cardano’s TVL when that service turns on,” Hoskinson said. He also tied it to the Bitcoin defi initiative. “Bitcoin and ADA can be lent, converted into a stablecoin, and then lent out […] Our belief is that’ll create billions of dollars of TVL for the network and bring a lot of Bitcoin into the network.” He also referenced conversations and integrations with Near—“you guys saw the Near intents coming through”—and floated blockchain-to-blockchain outreach to Tezos and Algorand including an indirect route to Chainlink via Near given “a direct conversation has been less than fruitful due to the price […] mid eight figures.” On developer experience, he argued the narrative is outdated: “They say it’s Haskell only […] They don’t even talk about Aiken […] Every programming language designer […] says it takes about three to seven years […] we’re right there.” He flagged Plutus v4 “next year,” StarStream “adding contract composition,” and a lane for rollups supported by recursive SNARK primitives, alongside L2 efforts “like Midgard and Gummy.” The strategic thread, he said, is continuity: “We bet big on decentralization […] resilience […] interoperability with Bitcoin […] partner chains. Now it’s about adoption.” Hoskinson closed by pledging continuing delivery on partner chains—“I want to launch one every year”—core research translated into production, and relentless advocacy, while asking the community to match that with usage and unified messaging. “We can complain about it or we can solve the problem. Together we will succeed.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.577.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano 2026|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 04:00:54

The price is now showing bearish signs and is at risk of more losses below $2.30 in the near term. XRP price gained bearish momentum and traded below $2.350. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it stays above $2.30. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price remained in a bearish zone below $2.550 and extended losses, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $2.50 and $2.420 levels. The decline gained pace after there was a close below $2.40. The price even tested $2.250. A low was formed at $2.260, and the price is now correcting some losses. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.552 swing high to the $2.260 low. The price is now trading below $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.40 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.552 swing high to the $2.260 low. The first major resistance is near the $2.480 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.320 level. The next major support is near the $2.30 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.30 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.250. The next major support sits near the $2.220 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.20. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin fell 2% in early Asia, slipping below $107,000 as whale profit booking and continued ETF outflows weighed on sentiment. The pullback extends pressure from Red October, when a $19b washout on Oct. 19 set a weaker tone that bled into November. Traders say the move looks like consolidation after a volatile month, with some positioning for a base before the next leg higher. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $106,961, down 0.7% Ether : $3,636, down 2.7% XRP : $2.35, down 3.4% Total crypto market cap: $3.64 trillion, down 1.6% Institutional Demand Slows as New Bitcoin Supply Outpaces Accumulation On-chain flows support the cautious mood. For the first time in seven months, institutional demand has dipped below the pace of new coin issuance, according to Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments. Won't lie, this was the main metric keeping me bullish the last months while every other asset outperformed Bitcoin. The trend could flip tomorrow, next week, or in 2 years. But right now we have 188 treasury companies carrying heavy bags with no business model and a lot less… https://t.co/ECTv3Klbmf — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) November 3, 2025 It is a sign that large buyers are stepping back. That shift aligns with a broader risk-off stance across crypto. Equities painted a different picture. Most major stock indexes climbed on Monday after news that Amazon will supply cloud services to OpenAI, while the dollar firmed to a three-month high against the euro as expectations for hefty US rate cuts faded. Wall Street finished the previous session stronger, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq buoyed by tech gains, though futures later pointed lower, indicating a softer US open. In Asia, a rise in tech shares lifted Japan’s Nikkei and Taiwan’s TAIEX to record highs, while several regional markets slipped after recent rallies. Fed Signals Measured Path Ahead as Traders Scale Back Rate-Cut Bets Policy remains the main macro thread. The Federal Reserve eased last week as expected, but Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate cut at the next meeting in December was “not a foregone conclusion.” That line kept traders from leaning too hard into dovish bets. Meanwhile, Fed officials on Monday offered mixed views on growth and inflation, and the ongoing US government shutdown has delayed key data, complicating the read-through for December. Markets now price a roughly 70% chance of a 25-basis-point cut next month, down from about 94% a week ago. After October’s Shakeout, Crypto Markets Seek Stability as Leverage Resets Back in crypto, October’s liquidation wave drained leverage and risk capital. Rebuilding that base takes time, which is why spot dips are attracting only selective bids and rallies fade quickly when supply hits exchanges. “In many ways, October’s correction has done what it needed to: it has flushed out leverage and re-set sentiment,” said Rachel Lin, chief executive of SynFutures. “On-chain data shows that long-term holders are not capitulating, they’re actively accumulating. Exchange outflows remain steady, and that’s historically a constructive sign>’ She added that November could start sideways as markets absorb Fed commentary. A softer inflation print or a clearer easing message could spark a recovery, while Ethereum may track the same path, with added support from network upgrades and growing institutional use of DeFi. For now, the path of least resistance hinges on flows. If ETF redemptions slow and exchange inflows abate, spot could stabilize above recent lows. Until then, the market will trade headline to headline, with macro and positioning calling the shots.

At the same time, Ripple’s new US prime brokerage will enable institutional clients to execute over-the-counter spot transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies after the company’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road. With over $4 billion spent on acquisitions this year already, Ripple is turning itself into a leading provider of comprehensive crypto solutions for enterprises worldwide. Ripple Snaps Up Palisade Ripple made another major move to strengthen its institutional crypto services by acquiring Palisade , a crypto custody and wallet company. This latest acquisition is part of its ongoing expansion into the enterprise and fintech sectors. The acquisition will see Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service offering integrated into Ripple Custody, the company’s crypto custody arm that is designed for banks and financial institutions. Ripple said the goal of the acquisition is to better serve a growing client base that includes fintechs, corporates, and crypto-native firms seeking reliable and compliant digital asset infrastructure. In a statement announcing the deal, Ripple President Monica Long pointed out the growing importance of corporate adoption in the next phase of crypto expansion. “Corporates are poised to drive the next massive wave of crypto adoption,” she said. “Just as we’ve seen major banks go from observing to actively building in crypto, corporates are now entering the market, and they need trusted, licensed partners with out-of-the-box capabilities.” The integration of Palisade’s wallet technology will extend beyond Ripple Custody. Ripple said the offering will also enhance Ripple Payments, its cross-border payments service, by adding infrastructure for subscription payments, collections, and crypto-to-fiat on and off-ramps across multiple blockchains. The company explained that the acquisition will enable it to support high-speed use cases and deeper interoperability with decentralized finance protocols — areas that are critical for institutional crypto adoption. According to Ripple, it has spent around $4 billion on acquisitions to date, with much of that total coming from large deals made in 2025. Earlier this year, Ripple completed a $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road to expand its over-the-counter crypto trading capabilities for US institutional clients. In October, it acquired GTreasury for $1 billion to boost its presence in the growing crypto treasury management sector. The company also purchased the stablecoin payments platform Rail in a $200 million deal expected to close by year-end. With the Palisade acquisition, Ripple is getting ready to build one of the most comprehensive institutional crypto infrastructures in the industry. Ripple Launches Crypto Prime Brokerage in the US Meanwhile, Ripple also expanded its presence in the United States by launching a digital asset spot prime brokerage service for institutional clients, which is yet another step in the company’s evolution from a payments provider to a full-service crypto financial platform. The announcement was made roughly seven months after Ripple revealed plans to acquire Hidden Road. According to Ripple, the new offering will allow US-based institutional clients to execute over-the-counter (OTC) spot transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies, complementing the company’s existing OTC and cleared derivatives services. Announcement from Ripple Michael Higgins, the international CEO of Ripple Prime and former Hidden Road executive, said that the new capabilities position Ripple to offer “a comprehensive suite of services” tailored to institutional trading strategies. With the integration of Hidden Road’s infrastructure, Ripple is now perfectly positioned to operate as a multi-asset prime broker for digital asset traders, providing cross-margin OTC spot trading, holdings, swaps, and access to CME-listed futures and options. The expansion was announced ahead of Ripple’s annual Swell conference in New York City, which is usually a key event where the company unveils new partnerships and technological milestones. The move also proves Ripple’s commitment when it comes to capturing more institutional market share as traditional financial firms and crypto-native companies converge on regulated trading solutions. Meanwhile, Ripple’s native token XRP has faced some short-term price pressure by falling about 3.9% in the last 24 hours from $2.50 to $2.35, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Despite the market volatility, Ripple certainly still wields a lot of influence in US political and regulatory circles. XRP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The firm maintained a presence in Washington, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other executives building ties with key policymakers. In October, a Ripple representative attended a White House fundraising event connected to President Donald Trump’s planned $350 million ballroom expansion project.

54009313,619704,1762232409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54009313.jpeg,Bitcoin Mining Frenzy Turns Iran Into A ‘Paradise For Illegal Miners’ – CEO,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-frenzy-turns-iran-into-a-paradise-for-illegal-miners-ceo/,"Iran’s power grid is under fresh strain as a large-scale boom in Bitcoin mining pushes regulators to hunt down illegal operations , according to statements from local energy officials and recent reports. Cheap, subsidized electricity and covert hookups have turned parts of the country into a “paradise for illegal miners,” Akbar Hasan Beklou, CEO of the Tehran Province Electricity Distribution Company, said. Illegal Bitcoin Mines Multiply According to Beklou, about 427,000 active mining devices are running across Iran, and more than 95% of them operate without proper licenses . That scale of activity is estimated to draw roughly 1,400 megawatts of power round the clock. These numbers, the officials said, have forced energy firms to step up enforcement and carry out raids in several provinces. In Tehran Province alone, law enforcement shut down 104 illegal Bitcoin farms in a recent operation and seized between 1,400 and 1,465 machines. Other statements from utility executives suggest that when cumulative seizures over multiple years are counted, the total may reach into the hundreds of thousands of machines. Reports have also said that some operations are well hidden, tucked inside factories or connected through forged industrial meters. Why It’s Happening Cheap electricity is the main draw. Prices set well below market levels make mining more profitable, even when devices run non-stop. Sanctions and trade limits have also pushed some operators to treat crypto as a way to move value beyond standard banking channels. Based on reports , both small groups and larger networks have set up rigs to tap into subsidized power supplies, and some farms use industrial connections that are meant for heavy industry. Officials have described a mixed picture when it comes to enforcement: many illegal farms are being tracked down and dismantled, while other operations may enjoy protection or special access. Analysts and local sources point to a few entities with ties to state-linked groups that appear to operate at a different scale, complicating uniform enforcement. Illegal Bitcoin Mining: Crackdown Efforts And Public Pressure The energy ministry and local utilities have promised more raids and new measures to trace illicit consumption . Rewards for tip-offs and a push to check industrial meters have been reported. Still, the problem is large, and action has often followed spikes in blackouts or pressure on the grid rather than a steady, pre-planned effort. Some experts warn that unless pricing and enforcement are adjusted, miners will keep trying to find workarounds. Devices can be moved quickly. They can be hidden in warehouses or hooked to meters that are not regularly checked. That mobility makes the job of regulators much harder.

Some analysts have suggested that the altcoin is in a healthy retest of a key area, but others warned that the cryptocurrency risks another major correction if the current levels are also lost. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run: Over Or Just Paused? CryptoQuant CEO Presents The Data Solana Risks 30% Correction On Monday, Solana recorded an 8.3% drop after losing the lower boundary of its three-month range. The cryptocurrency has been trading within the $175-$250 levels after the August breakout, hitting a multi-month high of $253 during the September rally. Since then, the altcoin has retraced nearly 35% to the current levels and failed to successfully reclaim the $200 psychological barrier despite multiple attempts. Following the early October correction, when SOL dropped to $168, the price has repeatedly retested the $170-$180 mark as support, bouncing from this area each time. Nonetheless, the recent market volatility, which sent Bitcoin (BTC) back to the $107,000 mark, has dragged Solana below its crucial support zone to a new local low of $165. Amid this performance, some analysts have suggested that SOL’s pullback may not be over, as the price risks another major correction. Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the cryptocurrency’s macro range between $100-$260, emphasizing that Solana must reclaim $200 to show strength and potentially target the range highs. He previously affirmed that a confirmed breakdown from the $180 level would set the stage for further losses. Per the chart, the next support level sits around the $158 area, which marks the mid-zone of the macro range and a key support and resistance level throughout the early Q3 run and Last November’s breakout. However, the analyst considers that the next crucial support actually “sits much lower.” As he explained, if Solana fails to bounce from the current levels and reclaim $180, it could face a 30% pullback to $115. Meanwhile, analyst DonAlt affirmed that “It’s probably wise to have a bearish bias between here and $210 and then aggressively flip if SOL manages to flip the $210 resistance.” Investor Bet On SOL’s Long-Term Performance Despite the bearish outlooks, some have suggested that SOL is “showing a clean retest setup” within its long-term support. Trader Elite Crypto considers that SOL’s recent pullback “looks like a healthy correction after months of upward movement.” He noted that the cryptocurrency is still holding a major ascending support zone that has served as a crucial bounce point since 2023. Based on this, the market watcher expects Solana’s price to retest the $158 area before the next leg up. “Overall, I am still bullish on SOL,” he affirmed. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggested a bullish long-term performance for the leading altcoin. In an X post, he highlighted that the asset management firm “opened a bridge to Solana for many investors” with its recently launched SOL Staked Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing Notably, the second wave of crypto-based ETFs started trading last week, with the SOL-based investment product recording $400 million of inflows on its first four days. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, it led “all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows.” Horsley highlighted that “ETF investors tend to be long term oriented,” signaling that the cryptocurrency is expected to have an overall bullish performance in the future despite the current price action. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $167, a 17% decline in the weekly timeframe.

The filing, submitted on November 3, 2025, lists Edward McGee as Chief Financial Officer and identifies Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP as legal counsel, reaffirming Grayscale’s procedural diligence in navigating the SEC’s review process. The amendment does not yet indicate final approval or listing, but its submission demonstrates continued effort to structure an XRP-based investment vehicle compliant with U.S. securities regulations. Such progress, if recognized by regulators, would make XRP more accessible to institutional investors seeking digital asset exposure through conventional financial products. Crypto commentator Jack The Rippler drew attention to the filing, describing it as a new amendment for an XRP ETF. His post drew reactions across the community, highlighting both optimism and skepticism over what the development might mean for the broader digital asset market. BREAKING: Grayscale has just filed a new amendment for their #XRP ETF! pic.twitter.com/6B8r0xbzpf — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) November 4, 2025 Reactions from the Community One X user, XR TRADER, viewed the filing as a step forward in mainstream integration. He noted that an XRP ETF would represent more than price speculation, signaling a deeper willingness from institutions to formalize and standardize their digital exposure. He also pointed out that eventual approval would depend heavily on how regulators assess clarity and custody structures—two areas that remain central to digital asset oversight in the United States. In contrast, another user, XdRewP, voiced frustration with XRP’s price performance despite ongoing news and developments. He expressed doubt that any announcement or institutional progress could alter what he described as XRP’s dependence on Bitcoin’s overall market direction. His sentiment echoed concerns among some retail investors that even with growing institutional interest , broader market patterns continue to dictate XRP’s valuation in the short term.

As regulatory authorities evaluate these filings, their decisions will shape the structure of institutional access to digital assets moving forward. Approval of such a product would not only expand investment pathways but also reinforce market recognition of XRP as a regulated component of the financial ecosystem. While the outcome remains uncertain, Grayscale’s action highlights a maturing phase in digital asset adoption—where compliance, clarity, and institutional engagement increasingly define the next stage of growth for blockchain-based investment products.

In response, Stream is in the process of engaging Keith Miller and Joseph Cutler of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP, to lead a comprehensive… — Stream Finance (@StreamDefi) November 4, 2025 Stablecoin XUSD Plunges as Traders Rush to Exit After Loss Disclosure The announcement hit sentiment across the protocol’s ecosystem. Earlier, its staked stablecoin XUSD broke from its $1 peg, dropping as much as 58% in 24 hours. Traders pointed to heavy selling on Arbitrum-based venues as confidence slipped. The disclosure went live around 12.45 pm UTC, in a window that also saw reports of a large multichain exploit on Balancer . While the events appear unrelated, the overlap in timing amplified anxiety across pockets of DeFi and accelerated defensive positioning. Within hours, aggressive XUSD-to-USDC swaps on Camelot and Uniswap drove XUSD from $1 to $0.92. As Stream confirmed the freeze on deposits and withdrawals pending the investigation, bids thinned and the price slid further. Between 6.00 pm UTC on Nov. 3 and 2.00 am UTC on Nov. 4, liquidations and arbitrage pressure pushed XUSD to about $0.43. #PeckShieldAlert Staked Stream USD $XUSD has depegged, down ~58%. @StreamDefi https://t.co/otLGs1Ti9t pic.twitter.com/lziLZj2QSO — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) November 4, 2025 No Evidence of Direct Exploit, But Leverage Concerns Deepen On-chain watchers framed the slide as a trust shock rather than a confirmed smart contract failure. They noted that trading activity on Arbitrum dominated the move, with no direct evidence of a protocol exploit at the time of writing. Concerns over backing intensified on social media. One X user claimed that on-chain data showed roughly $170m in supporting assets against about $530m in outstanding loans, implying leverage above four times. Those figures could not be independently verified in real time. Stream launched in early 2024 with a pitch of capital-efficient strategies that blend DeFi and traditional market techniques. Users deposit USDC into a vault and receive XUSD, which targets yield through activities such as lending arbitrage, incentive farming and hedged market making. The protocol has also worked with external managers when internal capacity is exceeded. The model helped Stream grow quickly through 2025, but reliance on external counterparties now sits at the center of the investigation.

Ripple Prime users will now be able to conduct over-the-counter (OTC) spot trading on dozens of digital assets, including XRP and RLUSD, the company announced. The company acquired multi-asset brokerage firm Hidden Road in October 2025. Following this merger, Ripple integrated its licenses with Hidden Road's solutions, creating a new structure under the Ripple Prime umbrella. This provides institutions with seamless access to foreign exchange (FX), digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed-income securities.

Besides, Saylor sparked Bitcoin frenzy with his bold, cryptic November hint. “Orange is the color of November,” he wrote to his 4.6 million followers on X.

Further, dividends will be paid in cash quarterly, beginning on December 31, 2025, if declared by its board of directors.

The anticipated cost is over 4% less than WeRide’s Monday close of $10.90 on the Nasdaq. The Guangzhou-based mobility company is scheduled to go public in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on November 6, the same day as rival Pony AI Inc. Pony AI Inc. is listed on the mainland, having raised HK$6.7 billion in New York. In the US, where delisting fears have been simmering, both businesses went public last year, increasing Hong Kong’s allure as a potential destination. WeRide secures funding to expand global operations The autonomous-driving startup offering has Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp as joint sponsors. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is also facilitating the transaction. As reported by the Chinadaily news outlet, the money raised from the offering will be used by WeRide to advance its autonomous driving technology, increase the commercialization of its robotaxis and ride-hailing services, and expand internationally. The outlet reported that investors in the share sale have included Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte, automotive supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, Uber Technologies Inc., and Grab Holdings Ltd. The autonomous-driving startup explained that the involvement of Bosch, Uber, and Grab not only offers substantial financial support but also signifies close cooperation across markets, technologies, ecosystems, and international operations. According to the Guangzhou-based mobility company, the close collaboration across markets and financial support promotes the widespread commercialization of WeRide’s autonomous cars. Additionally, the Guangzhou-based mobility company has previously benefited from strategic investments from top-tier international industry partners like Uber, NVIDIA , Bosch, and Renault-Nissan. In a press release released on October 28, WeRide claimed to be the only tech company with cars that have autonomous driving licenses in seven different countries. WeRide emphasized that more than 30 cities in 11 countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, France, Singapore, and Japan, have seen the deployment of its cars. The Guangzhou-based mobility company presently operates more than 700 robotaxis and more than 1,500 AVs worldwide. WeRide reported solid financial results for the second quarter of 2025, demonstrating the company’s rapid expansion and growing market traction. Total revenue increased 60.8% year over year (YoY) to RMB 127.2 million (US$17.8 million), indicating undeniable and accelerating commercial momentum. 2Q2025 Robotaxi revenue increased 836.7% year-over-year to RMB 45.9 million (US$6.4 million), marking the highest quarterly revenue since the company’s founding. The Robotaxi business accounted for 36.1% of total revenue in 2Q, the greatest quarterly revenue concentration since 2021. Also in 2Q2025, gross profit increased 40.6% year-over-year to RMB35.7 million (US$5.0 million), with an industry-leading margin of 28.1%. WeRide launches Robotaxi, Robobus pilot in the UAE On October 2, in collaboration with the Ras Al Khaimah Transport Authority (RAKTA), WeRide announced the start of Robotaxi GXR and Robobus pilot operations in the UAE. The launch marked WeRide’s first deployment in Ras Al Khaimah and expansion into a third emirate in the UAE. By incorporating WeRide’s autonomous vehicles (AVs) into Ras Al Khaimah’s public transportation network, the trial sets the stage for further national commercialization of these vehicles. WeRide claimed to be the only AV company operating in Ras Al Khaimah and the only partner chosen for the emirate’s smart mobility policy. The Guangzhou-based mobility company announced that starting October 2, WeRide’s Robobus will operate between nine stations on Al Marjan Island. The routes will link hotels, resorts, and monuments such as the Pullman Hotel, Hampton by Hilton, and Mövenpick Resort, with plans to expand into Mina Island. WeRide emphasized that the Robotaxi GXR will provide autonomous mobility beyond tourist destinations into the everyday lives of locals in Ras Al Khaimah’s city core. According to WeRide, commercial operations are expected to start in early 2026 as part of RAKTA’s public transportation network. Customers will be able to use RAKTA’s digital mobility app to schedule Robotaxi rides and monitor the whereabouts of Robobuses. A safety officer will be present when services begin, and after regulatory permission, totally autonomous operations are anticipated in a later stage. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Reports have disclosed that crypto outlets and market watchers quickly read the line as a hint at another corporate Bitcoin buy. Related Reading: Forget Billions—XRP Could Hit Trillions, Leading Expert Says Bitcoin Buy: Orange Dot Signals According To screenshots and media coverage, the post echoed past Saylor posts that used orange imagery to flag Bitcoin moves. Some outlets called it a tease for a 13th straight purchase by Strategy. That description comes from reporters tracking the firm’s buying pattern, not from an official Strategy statement. The tweet did not lay out timing or dollar amounts. Strategy Holdings And Recent Buys Based on reports and filings summarized in market coverage, Strategy currently holds roughly 640,808 BTC, with an average cost basis near $74,302 per coin. The company’s last disclosed acquisition was about 390 BTC, which market trackers put at roughly $43 million. Those figures come from public disclosures and tracking services that follow corporate treasury buys. Orange is the color of November. pic.twitter.com/M3JoIuDpRk — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 2, 2025 Market Reactions And Risks Traders reacted fast. Some buyers pushed prices higher on the idea that another corporate buyer was about to enter the market. Others sold into the noise, treating the tweet as a signal that might not immediately lead to a trade. Headlines linking the post to other big political or economic events—such as reporting on US President Donald Trump—appeared in a few outlets, but analysts say such connections are speculative unless tied to filings or on-chain moves. Why Watch For Filings Based on past practice, Strategy tends to file disclosures after completing purchases. That pattern makes regulatory filings and on-chain addresses worth watching for anyone tracking actual flows. If a fresh 8-K appears or a wallet tied to the company posts movement, that will turn rumor into confirmed action. Until then, the market runs on interpretation and expectation. What This Means For Investors For holders, corporate accumulation often serves as a sentiment boost. For short-term traders, it raises volatility. Institutional watchers will be looking not only for more purchases but also for any change in scale. The company’s large stake—hundreds of thousands of BTC at a multi-thousand dollar average—means that public buys or sales have the power to move sentiment. Related Reading: XRP’s Next Earthquake: Billions Set To Flow In, ‘Supply Shock’ Coming—Analyst What To Watch Next Based on reports, the clearest signs to watch are regulatory filings, updates from Strategy itself, and on-chain transfers tied to known company addresses. Market data providers who tracked the last 390 BTC purchase will likely flag any new movement quickly. Until those items appear, the tweet remains a strong hint but not proof of an imminent large purchase.

Standard Chartered CEO Believes Blockchain Will Host All Money Eventually As reported by CNBC, Bill Winters talked about the future of finance and Hong Kong’s role in the global digital assets space at a Hong Kong FinTech Week panel on Monday. “Our belief, which I think is shared by the leadership of Hong Kong, is that pretty much all transactions will settle on blockchains eventually, and that all money will be digital,” said the Standard Chartered CEO. The comment comes as there has been a push toward digital ledger tokenization around the world. Payments giant SWIFT, for example, is developing a blockchain-based ledger, as announced in September. Tokenization of an asset creates a digital copy of it that can be traded on the blockchain. Last year, Hong Kong launched a project to test the application of tokenization in real-life business scenarios, with Standard Chartered as a participant . Standard Chartered is a British bank that operates around the world, including Hong Kong. The institution, designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), has been growing its presence in the digital assets space recently. Earlier this year, the bank became the first of its stature to launch a spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading desk for institutional clients. It has also formed a joint venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) to obtain a stablecoin license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Stablecoins represent a prominent example of tokenization, acting as blockchain counterparts to fiat currencies. Standard Chartered is planning to launch an asset of this kind based on the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD). The current tokenized assets may only be the beginning if the prediction from the bank’s CEO about all money eventually becoming digital is to go by. “Think about what that means: a complete rewiring of the financial system,” noted Winters. Bitcoin Has Taken A 3% Hit During The Past Day Bitcoin has kicked off the new week with another retrace as its price is back down to the $107,500 mark. The chart below shows how the cryptocurrency’s trend has looked recently. Despite the recent bearish wave, however, Bitcoin is still outperforming in 2024 in terms of the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. As CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post , 2025 is ahead of 2024 in year-to-date inflows. At this point last year, US Bitcoin spot ETFs registered around $22.5 billion in cumulative inflows. The same metric for 2025 is now sitting at $25.18 billion.",Blockchain|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|BTCUSDT|Digital Money|Standard Chartered|Standard Chartered CEO,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 06:00:47

Instead of following speculative narratives or reacting to unverified claims about acquisitions and partnerships, the commentator emphasized that XRP ‘s foundation lies not in hype but in its intended role as a real-world financial solution. The post comes at a time when predictions and expectations have dominated discussions surrounding the future of XRP. Despite these circulating claims, All Things XRP stressed that the digital asset’s true strength is rooted in its technological capability to address large-scale inefficiencies in the global economic system. The commentator described XRP as a utility-driven innovation designed to solve problems that traditional infrastructures have failed to address for decades. Dear XRP Community, I’ve been quietly watching the storm — posts flying around about ETF dates, Ripple acquisitions, rumors, and endless bullsh*t speculation. But here’s the truth… It’s not that complicated. JUST HOLD. Because XRP isn’t built for hype — it’s built for… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) November 1, 2025 Utility Over Speculation The message from All Things XRP reflects a growing sentiment within parts of the digital asset community — one that prioritizes practical adoption and sustained utility over temporary market excitement. The commentator encouraged holders to remain patient and maintain confidence in the long-term vision rather than seeking short-term price movements. This perspective aligns with a broader shift among seasoned market participants who view real-world application as the foundation for future valuation. According to All Things XRP, projects that focus on genuine problem-solving ultimately gain recognition as their utility becomes evident in global financial ecosystems. The post reinforced the belief that when a digital asset demonstrates measurable value in facilitating cross-border settlements and institutional-grade liquidity solutions, market rewards will naturally follow. The focus, therefore, should remain on the progression of use cases and partnerships that reflect tangible impact rather than speculation-driven price dynamics. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions and Enduring Commitment Several community members expressed strong agreement with the sentiment shared by All Things XRP. X user Adrian Godoy commented that the age of speculation is drawing to a close, and that the market’s next major phase will be defined by utility and functionality. He added that holding XRP remains the most sensible strategy in an evolving financial landscape increasingly shaped by technological integration. Another user, Saedhu, shared a personal reflection on his long-term commitment to XRP. He noted that despite the asset’s slower price growth compared to Bitcoin, his belief in XRP’s future remains unchanged, emphasizing that his decision to hold is based on confidence in its eventual recognition as a critical financial tool. Through this message, All Things XRP has reignited discussion around patience, conviction, and the fundamental value of real-world utility — underscoring that, in the long run, sustainable innovation will define XRP’s place in the global financial system.

This new offering allows US-based institutional clients to execute over-the-counter (OTC) spot transactions across a wide range of digital assets—including XRP and the firm’s dollar-pegged cryptocurrency RLUSD. New Ripple Brokerage Services For US Institutions According to Ripple’s announcement , the launch follows the acquisition of Hidden Road. By merging its regulatory licenses with Hidden Road’s capabilities, Ripple has created Ripple Prime, which provides institutions with seamless access to foreign exchange (FX), digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income products. This acquisition is seen as a strategic move to facilitate the institutional adoption of digital assets, particularly in light of a more favorable regulatory environment under the recent Trump administration. Moreover, RLUSD has gained regulatory compliance under the newly enacted stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act, which has been signed into law by President Trump earlier this year. This compliance is expected to enhance institutional trust and further integrate RLUSD into traditional financial operations . Michael Higgins, the International CEO of Ripple Prime, commented on the launch, stating: The introduction of OTC spot execution capabilities complements our existing suite of OTC and cleared derivatives services in digital assets and positions us to provide US institutions with a comprehensive offering to suit their trading strategies and needs. With this new feature, Ripple Prime’s US clients can now cross-margin their OTC spot transactions and holdings alongside their broader digital asset portfolios, including OTC swaps and Chicago-Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures and options. In addition to these developments, Ripple is actively pursuing approval for its national bank charter license in the United States. This initiative places Ripple alongside other firms, such as Circle (CRCL), Coinbase (COIN), Sony Bank, Paxos, and Crypto.com (CRO). Spot XRP ETFs Expected Soon On the exchange-traded fund (ETF) front, market expert Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, has forecasted on social media site X (previously Twitter) the launch of the first spot XRP ETFs within the next two weeks. This comes on the heels of a five-year litigation period between the SEC and Ripple, which concluded just three months ago. Geraci believes that the introduction of spot XRP ETFs could signify a major turning point, potentially marking the end of previous anti-crypto regulatory attitudes. Notably, eight XRP ETFs have now been registered with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), indicating that these funds have entered DTCC’s operational pipeline and are actively being processed for potential trading. When writing, XRP trades at $2.41, representing a drop of 4.5% in the past 24 hours and over 8% in the weekly time frame.

This has led to predictions that the Bitcoin price is headed for another crash amid the weakness. One analysis that stands out comes from crypto analyst Toby Dawson, who pointed out the formation of a bearish Heads and Shoulders pattern that could trigger a cascade below $100,000. Head And Shoulders Pattern Points Downward In the analysis shared on the TradingView website, Dawson outlines the formation of the head and shoulders pattern. The first shoulder here, the left shoulder, was created at around $117,000, when the price was struggling back in the month of September. The subsequent recovery would then give rise to the formation of the head. Related Reading: Dogecoin RSI Returns To Pre-Launch Levels, Analyst Says Next Major Surge Is Close Next was the rapid Bitcoin price rise to a new all-time high above $126,000 before hitting resistance. This resistance at this level led to the formation of the head of the pattern, and, as expected, the price continued its downtrend following this. The most recent of these is the formation of the right shoulder, which was created in the rally toward $117,000 at the end of October. Once again, the Bitcoin price hit another major resistance, marking the completion of the head and shoulders pattern. With this formation, the crypto analyst points out the possibility that the Bitcoin price will see a major bounce. However, in the case of a breakdown, the expectation would be for the price to crash below the $100,000 and move toward $90,000. Bitcoin Price Crash Expectations Spread Another crypto analyst has also called out the possibility of the Bitcoin price crashing. This comes after the cryptocurrency made a new all-time high above $126,000, and the analyst points out that the digital asset has always seen a major price crash after reaching new peaks. Related Reading: Billions In Bitcoin And Ethereum Leave Exchanges: Is Selling Pressure Easing? From here, the focus is now on the 1-week 50 EMA and the support at $100,000. These two are serving as the last line of defense, and if they fail, then the analyst expects the Bitcoin price to go into free fall. As a result, the analyst warns that investors should get ready to exist as “Bitcoin is heading straight to hell!” Just like Dawson, the crypto analyst expects that Bitcoin will break below $100,000, but puts it even further. This time, it isn’t expected to actually stop above $90,000, but to reach deeper into the $80,000 territory before finding support.

The filing provides a detailed view of why XRP’s trading structure naturally mitigates volatility and manipulation risks. Rather than attributing its potential stability to a lack of movement, the filing focuses on the architecture of XRP’s global and continuous market activity. Why XRP will Not be Volatile Based on Cboe BZX Exchange filing to list the Canary XRP ETF Trust (SR-CboeBZX-2025-022, p. 34) Market design, not price stillness: XRP’s stability arises from its structural integrity rather than the absence of price movement. Global… pic.twitter.com/R79LPtyZdC — ProfessoRipplEffect (@ProfRipplEffect) November 1, 2025 Global Liquidity and Continuous Trading Activity According to the filing, XRP’s liquidity extends across numerous exchanges worldwide , sustaining active trading around the clock. This continuous activity reduces the chances of artificial price gaps forming during off-hours, which commonly affect traditional markets that operate within limited time windows. By functioning 24/7, XRP markets remain fluid, allowing for price corrections and the absorption of trading shocks in real time. The exchange filing further emphasizes that this constant market presence diminishes the influence of isolated events or short-term market disruptions. Arbitrage opportunities arising due to temporary dislocations are swiftly corrected by market participants operating across borders and platforms. This dynamic helps sustain equilibrium and ensures that XRP’s price reflects broad global market conditions rather than isolated regional behavior. Geographic Diversity and Market Fragmentation The Cboe BZX Exchange explicitly noted that the “geographically diverse and continuous nature of XRP trading renders it difficult and prohibitively costly to manipulate the price of XRP.” This statement highlights a key point of differentiation from assets that are heavily concentrated on specific exchanges or within particular regions. XRP’s trading occurs across multiple jurisdictions and time zones. This requires any attempt at price manipulation to coordinate across numerous platforms — an effort that would be both logistically complex and financially burdensome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The dispersion of trading activity also means that no single entity can dominate market influence. As trading volume is distributed across regions, the impact of wash trading or localized manipulation is diluted by the broader, global market response. Institutional Arbitrage and Market Balance In response to the analysis, an X user named Monica added that once regulatory frameworks become more harmonized, XRP’s price equilibrium will increasingly be sustained through institutional arbitrage, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) pools, and market makers who balance supply and demand for real-time settlement. This interplay of institutional mechanisms with XRP’s inherent market structure enhances its resilience against volatility. Taken together, the Cboe BZX Exchange’s observations underscore that XRP’s stability is not accidental but is built into the design of its markets — a structure defined by global reach, constant liquidity, and a high barrier to manipulation.

Despite headlines of “full repayment,” the actual recovery for creditors, in real crypto terms, may be far from whole. According to Sunil, a well-known FTX creditor representative and crypto commentator, the real recovery rate sits between 9% and 46%. And that figure could be even lower when adjusted for today’s higher crypto prices. “FTX creditors are not whole,” Sunil wrote on X, warning that the supposed 143% recovery doesn’t tell the full story. FTX Bankruptcy recovery rates in real crypto terms FTX creditors are not whole 9% to 46%: Real crypto terms recovery but probably in reality lower as crypto prices higher when 143% paid Also seen on CT some: 1) Protect known scammers/liars/fraudsters 2) Attack those helping… pic.twitter.com/pUcjIPFsnv — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) November 2, 2025 The Misleading “143% Recovery” Headline FTX’s restructuring team made headlines earlier this year by announcing plans to repay creditors “up to 143%” of their claims. But the math behind that number is based on fiat values from November 2022, the time of FTX’s collapse. Crypto prices were far lower then. Bitcoin traded near $16,500. Ethereum hovered around $1,200. Solana was barely above $13. Today, all three have more than tripled in value. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC sits around $110,000, ETH near $3,800, and SOL over $183. That means a creditor owed one Bitcoin in 2022 might only receive the equivalent of 0.3 BTC today, even if paid “in full” by dollar value. The crypto may be gone, but the fiat number looks good on paper. So while 143% sounds like a victory, in crypto terms, it’s a heavy haircut. What “Real Crypto Recovery” Looks Like Sunil’s breakdown offers a more accurate picture. After accounting for current market conditions, the real crypto recovery rate falls between 9% and 46%. That range depends on the type of asset lost, when it was held, and the final valuation method used by the bankruptcy court. For example, a creditor with assets in SOL or ETH is seeing far worse recovery than someone holding stablecoins like USDC. Because while crypto values exploded in 2023 and 2024, FTX’s repayment plan remains anchored to 2022 fiat prices. In other words, creditors are being repaid as if the market never recovered. Creditor Frustration Rising This reality has fueled anger within the FTX creditor community. Some feel misled by headlines portraying the bankruptcy resolution as a full recovery. Sunil has been vocal about this issue, noting that online narratives often twist facts or attack those advocating for fairer outcomes. He highlighted a worrying trend across Crypto Twitter (CT): Protection of known scammers, liars, and fraudsters, individuals connected to the old FTX structure who now attempt to rebrand. Attacks on those helping creditors, including independent researchers, recovery advocates, and watchdog projects. The tension has created a divide between those celebrating FTX’s supposed “comeback” and those still counting real losses. FTX Bankruptcy recovery rates in real crypto terms FTX creditors are not whole 9% to 46%: Real crypto terms recovery but probably in reality lower as crypto prices higher when 143% paid Also seen on CT some: 1) Protect known scammers/liars/fraudsters 2) Attack those helping… pic.twitter.com/pUcjIPFsnv — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) November 2, 2025 The Forgotten Victims of Crypto Winter The FTX bankruptcy affected over 9 million users worldwide. Many were retail traders, builders, and DeFi enthusiasts who left their crypto on the exchange. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, it wiped out billions in user funds and shattered trust in centralized platforms. Even two years later, most creditors remain in limbo, waiting for payouts that feel like partial refunds at best. And while repayment in fiat might look fair legally, emotionally and economically, it doesn’t feel like justice. The Case for “Extra Recovery” There may still be a silver lining. Sunil believes extra recovery could come from outside the bankruptcy proceedings, through airdrops, tokens, and incentives from new projects. “FTX creditors are the most valuable asset and attractive for projects,” he wrote. Their verified on-chain data, community presence, and massive exposure make them prime candidates for targeted recovery campaigns. Some protocols are already taking notice. Paradex Leads the Way Paradex, a decentralized trading platform built on Starknet, recently announced an airdrop for verified FTX creditors. The initiative is designed to reward affected users while giving them an opportunity to rejoin the DeFi ecosystem. It’s the first notable example of an “outside bankruptcy” recovery path, where new Web3 projects see FTX creditors not as victims, but as a potential user base ready to rebuild. Others are expected to follow. Especially as airdrop culture grows and protocols look for meaningful communities to onboard. If Paradex’s move gains traction, it could spark a trend of restitution-driven airdrops, creating a parallel recovery market for those left behind by traditional processes. Creditor Data as a New Asset Class In an unexpected twist, FTX creditors themselves are becoming a new kind of asset. Verified creditor lists are seen as high-value datasets, a ready-made audience of millions who understand risk, regulation, and crypto trading. Projects seeking instant credibility and user engagement view them as a strategic demographic to target. This shift hints at a deeper theme in crypto’s evolution: value isn’t just coins, it’s community. And the FTX creditor base, once shattered by loss, might now hold collective power as an influence group across DeFi, airdrops, and governance. A Painful but Defining Chapter FTX’s story has always been one of extremes, explosive growth, catastrophic collapse, and a painfully slow recovery. For many, this bankruptcy has redefined what “full recovery” means in crypto. It’s not about percentages on paper, but purchasing power, opportunity cost, and the time lost waiting for restitution. As Sunil and others keep emphasizing, the conversation must move from “how much in fiat” to “how much in real crypto terms.” Only then can the true cost of FTX’s collapse be understood. As the bankruptcy process nears its end, most FTX creditors will finally see funds returning, but in a market that has already moved on. The best hope for full recovery may come not from the court, but from the community. Airdrops like Paradex’s are just the beginning. Others, perhaps DeFi protocols, L2 projects, or even centralized exchanges, could step up next. Each new recovery attempt offers a small dose of restitution and recognition for those who lost the most. The FTX chapter may be closing legally, but emotionally and financially, it’s far from over.

The 0 Fee Carnival, originally set to end this month, has now been extended until November 30, 2025, allowing users to transfer $USDC and $USD₁ across the BNB ecosystem completely free of charge. That means no gas fees when sending stablecoins between wallets, bridges, or centralized exchanges. Since launch, BNB Chain has already covered more than $4 million in fees, making cross-chain transfers faster, simpler, and entirely frictionless for millions of users. Send more, spend nothing on fees… Learn how you can save on fees when transacting with USD1 & USDC below https://t.co/PkBMkH0b5T pic.twitter.com/nJ0P26kPFB — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) November 2, 2025 Zero-Fee Transfers, Unlimited Movement BNB Chain launched the 0 Fee Carnival earlier this year as a way to improve user experience across DeFi and Web3 payments. The program covers transaction costs for $USDC and $USD₁, two of the most widely used stablecoins on the network, encouraging greater adoption across wallets, dApps, and exchanges. Users can now bridge, swap, or send stablecoins across the BNB ecosystem, without paying a single cent in gas fees. Whether moving funds between chains or transferring to a CEX, the zero-fee feature removes one of crypto’s biggest pain points: high network costs during congestion. According to BNB Chain, the initiative is already one of the most successful fee subsidy programs in crypto history. Millions Served, Millions Saved In less than a few months, the impact has been massive. BNB Chain has already covered over $4 million in user gas fees, boosting on-chain activity and making Web3 transactions more inclusive for new users. By absorbing these costs, the network allows users to experience DeFi, payments, and trading with none of the friction typically associated with blockchain transactions. It’s part of BNB Chain’s broader push to expand crypto accessibility and create a user-first experience in what it calls the Internet of Value, a future where value moves as easily as information. BNB Chain’s Weekly Numbers The network’s ecosystem remains one of the strongest in crypto, supported by impressive weekly performance metrics: 4.6 million+ average daily active users (DAU) 172.5 million+ transactions processed $14.2 billion+ in total value locked (TVL) $106 billion+ in trading volume These numbers highlight the scale of the BNB ecosystem, and why it continues to dominate among Layer-1 networks for both user activity and developer engagement. Data from CoinMarketCap ranks BNB (BNB) as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at around $147 billion . A week in numbers for BNB Chain: 4.6M+ average DAU 172.5M+ transactions $14.2B+ in TVL $106B+ in trading volume BNB Burn, Buenos Aires BNB Hack, 100+ tokenized equities via @OndoFinance and more. Catch the full update https://t.co/bpJEBGGE3I pic.twitter.com/Hr1kkb5acV — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) November 1, 2025 Why It Matters Stablecoins like $USDC and $USD₁ are the backbone of on-chain activity. They power DeFi protocols, payment systems, and exchanges across every major blockchain. By eliminating gas fees, BNB Chain lowers the barrier to entry for users in emerging markets, many of whom rely on stablecoins for remittances, savings, and trading. The 0 Fee Carnival also strengthens liquidity within the BNB ecosystem, as users are more likely to move capital freely when there’s no cost friction. In short, this initiative transforms BNB Chain into one of the most cost-efficient and accessible networks in the world. BNB Chain’s Broader Momentum The zero-fee initiative comes at a time when BNB Chain is experiencing strong ecosystem growth. The network recently completed its 33rd quarterly BNB token burn, removing 1.44 million BNB from circulation. This deflationary mechanism continues to reinforce BNB’s long-term tokenomics, gradually reducing supply while increasing scarcity. The consistent burns have also helped stabilize the BNB economy amid rising on-chain activity and network expansion. A Bigger Vision for Web3 BNB Chain’s zero-fee campaign isn’t just about lower costs, it’s about changing how people use crypto. The initiative plays into the chain’s larger goal of driving mass adoption by reducing complexity and removing hidden costs that often discourage everyday users. BNB Chain is positioning itself as a universal settlement layer for both crypto-native and real-world assets, integrating DeFi, GameFi, and AI-powered Web3 applications. The 0 Fee Carnival acts as a bridge to this future, where anyone can transact, swap, or bridge assets instantly without worrying about gas or slippage. Community and Developer Response Developers across the ecosystem have praised the move, calling it a “user-first innovation” that helps smaller projects onboard users faster. By eliminating gas fees for stablecoins, dApps can integrate BNB Chain payments seamlessly, improving UX while maintaining full decentralization. The community’s response has been equally positive. On X, users celebrated the extension of the campaign as a win for accessibility and inclusivity. “This is how mass adoption starts,” one user commented. “Zero-fee stablecoin transfers mean anyone can use DeFi without worrying about gas.” Looking Ahead: Zero Fees, Infinite Growth With the 0 Fee Carnival extended through November 2025, BNB Chain is making a strong statement, that it wants to lead the next phase of crypto usability. The campaign removes the final barrier between users and fast, borderless transactions. As the network continues to expand its partnerships and integrations, the combination of scalability, liquidity, and zero fees could position BNB Chain as a top destination for global stablecoin settlement. In many ways, this is the logical evolution of Web3, where users don’t think about fees, wallets, or bridges, but simply move value freely. And for BNB Chain, that vision is already in motion. BNB Chain’s 0 Fee Carnival is more than a promotion, it’s a glimpse into the future of how blockchain should work. Simple. Fast. Free. With millions of users already benefiting, and over $4 million in fees absorbed, the initiative has turned BNB Chain into the most accessible stablecoin network in the world. If the current momentum holds, BNB Chain’s push toward frictionless value transfer might become the new standard for the industry, one transaction at a time.

Here’s What a Chinese Analysis Company Thinks",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/why-did-bitcoins-price-fall-and-what-will-happen-next-heres-what-a-chinese-analysis-company-thinks/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital evaluated the recent movements in the Bitcoin market and reported that October was recorded as the “first red October since 2018.” The company stated that Bitcoin fell from $110,000 to $106,000 as early investors took profits, but the price still managed to hold above $100,000. Despite selling pressure of approximately 405,000 BTC in October, Bitcoin hasn't broken below $100,000, according to QCP Capital data. This resilience could signal either the quiet start of a new rally or early signs of an impending “crypto winter,” according to the firm's assessment. Bitcoin, which had a weak start to November, continued its recent downtrend, falling from $110,000 to $106,000. On-chain data reveals that long-held Bitcoin has been moving to the Kraken exchange, a continuation of the sell-off that continued throughout October. QCP Capital noted that these movements are generally driven by profit-taking by early investors. Related News: Will Bitcoin Fall Below $100,000 This Year After the Latest Decline? Here Are the Odds According to QCP's analysis, there is no clear macroeconomic catalyst behind the recent sell-off. On the contrary, while traditional markets and risk assets continue to rise thanks to accommodative monetary policies, the consolidation in the crypto market is notable. Volatility has risen slightly in the past week, while the options market remains biased towards puts. However, futures open interest is low and funding rates are stable, suggesting there's no major market panic. Despite the slowdown in buying by institutional investors, Bitcoin's spot price remains at strong support levels. QCP Capital noted that even last week's ETF outflows failed to break the current price band. The company included the following assessment at the end of its report: Bitcoin has been consolidating within a range similar to the pre-2024 period in recent months. Whether we are nearing the end of this cycle or the quiet beginning of a new bull run remains unclear. Currently, long-term investors are realizing their profits, while institutional inflows and adoption rates continue to strengthen the market's fundamentals. *This is not investment advice.

54013612,https://invezz.com/?p=2952478,1762240217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Top reasons the crypto crash is happening as liquidations jump,https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/04/top-reasons-the-crypto-crash-is-happening-as-liquidations-jump/,"A crypto crash happened today, with Bitcoin and most altcoins continuing their recent downtrend. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $104,130, down by 17% from its highest level this year. Other top altcoins like Aster, Aptos, World Liberty Financial, Cosmos, Toncoin, Sei, and Flare plunged by over 10% in the last 24 hours. All these tokens have moved to the bear market after falling by over 40% from their highest level this year. Crypto crash is happening as Bitcoin forms risky patterns The first main reason why the crypto market crash is happening is that Bitcoin price has formed highly bearish chart patterns on the daily and weekly charts. For example, the daily chart shows that the coin has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart, which often leads to more downside over time. The coin has also formed a death cross pattern, which is characterized by the crossover of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Bitcoin has also formed some major bearish chart patterns. For example, it has moved below the lower side of the ascending channel, a sign that bears have prevailed. Additionally, the coin remains below the Ichimoku cloud and the Supertrend indicators. Therefore, the most likely Bitcoin price forecast is bearish, with the next key support level to watch being the psychological level at $100,000. A move below that support level will point to more downside as it will send a signal that bears have prevailed. Such a move will, on the other hand, lead to more downside among other altcoins. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto market crashing as the US dollar index jumps The crypto market crash is also happening as the US dollar index gains steam. Data shows that the index jumped to a high of $99.80, its highest level since August 1 this year. The dollar index has jumped after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 0.25% last week. It also announced that it would start ending its quantitative tightening policies in December this year. In theory, these are all bullish news for the crypto industry because these tokens thrive in a period of easy money policies. However, the bank warned that it may not cut interest rates in the coming meeting in December as inflation remains high. In a statement on Monday, Fed’s Austan Goolsbee said : “I am nervous about the inflation side of the ledger, where you’ve seen inflation above the target for four and a half years and it’s trending the wrong way.” Liquidations and fear are contributing to the crypto market crash Most importantly, the crypto market is crashing because of the ongoing panic among investors. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has slumped in the past few days and is now in the fear zone of 30. The fear is mostly driven by the recent surge in liquidations. Data shows that the daily liquidations jumped by 160% in the last 24 hours to over $1.3 billion. Over 327,790 traders were liquidated. This growing liquidation is bringing memories of the one that happened on October 11, when over 1.6 million traders were wiped out. Therefore, it will take time for crypto investors to move on from that event. This explains why any rebound in the crypto market is finding substantial resistance.

The leading cryptocurrency slipped 3.69% during the month, marking its worst October since 2018, a rare departure from its historically bullish Q4 trend. Back in 2018, Bitcoin’s red October was followed by a brutal November crash that saw prices plunge 36%. By year’s end, BTC had fallen nearly 85% from its all-time high. But this time, the backdrop looks different. JUST IN: #Bitcoin officially closed October in the red for the first time in seven years. The last time October ended in the red, during the 2018 bear market, $BTC plunged -36% in November and was down -85% by year’s end. pic.twitter.com/halLkxjtFp — SwanDesk (@SwanDesk) November 1, 2025 October Ends Weak, But November Hope Builds Bitcoin’s mild October decline came amid mixed macro conditions, rising Treasury yields, U.S. rate cut uncertainty, and lower on-chain activity. Yet even as prices softened, long-term holders were quietly accumulating. Now, with November here, sentiment may be ready to flip. Historically, November has been Bitcoin’s strongest month, with an average gain of 42.5% over the past decade. If that pattern holds, a 42% move from current levels would push BTC near $160,000, a staggering recovery and new record high. It’s no wonder that, despite the short-term red candle, optimism is building again among traders and analysts. Whales Bought $5.7 Billion in October Behind the scenes, whales, large holders controlling between 10 and 10,000 BTC, have been buying aggressively. According to Santiment, these wallets added roughly $5.7 billion worth of Bitcoin in October alone. They now hold 13.68 million BTC, representing about 68.6% of total supply. This wave of accumulation signals that deep-pocketed investors are positioning ahead of what many expect to be Bitcoin’s next major uptrend. October ended in the red with Bitcoin down 3.69% – its worst October since 2018. But November is finally here. Historically, November's been Bitcoin's strongest month, averaging a 42.5% gain. For context, a 42% move from here would put BTC around $160,000. With sentiment so… pic.twitter.com/rBQydunRbS — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) November 1, 2025 “Smart money isn’t waiting for confirmation,” one analyst noted. “They’re front-running the next leg up.” Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Conviction Despite the recent red candle, market structure remains largely bullish. Bitcoin has consolidated around the $95,000 range after hitting record highs earlier in the year. Retail sentiment, however, has cooled. Social data shows engagement and mentions for BTC trending lower, a setup that often precedes major rebounds. The whale data supports that view. These entities were net accumulators before Bitcoin’s last breakout, stacking over 110,000 BTC between August 22 and October 12, before trimming around 23,200 BTC recently. Even with that minor sell-off, their overall holdings remain near record highs, a sign of conviction. Why This October Was Different In past years, October earned the nickname “Uptober” for its tendency to deliver strong returns. 2020 and 2021 saw Bitcoin climb double digits each time, driven by liquidity inflows and ETF speculation. This year, however, global uncertainty weighed on risk assets. The U.S. dollar strengthened, and spot ETF flows slowed as institutional investors paused new allocations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s volatility fell to multi-month lows, a sign of compression that often precedes explosive moves. The combination of reduced retail euphoria and quiet whale accumulation has set the stage for a potential rebound as liquidity rotates back into crypto. November’s Bullish History If there’s one month Bitcoin bulls love, it’s November. Over the past 11 years, BTC has finished November in the green eight times, averaging 42.5% gains. That performance includes legendary rallies, like November 2020, when Bitcoin surged 43% to break past $19,000, and November 2013, when it soared 450% in a single month. Even in bearish years, November tends to bring relief. In 2022, BTC still managed a modest rebound after the FTX collapse. Given this track record, traders see the latest dip less as a breakdown and more as a setup for what could be another historic month. Market Sentiment: Fear or Opportunity? According to Santiment’s social sentiment data, discussions around Bitcoin have cooled, while altcoin chatter has increased. Historically, this rotation occurs when retail traders lose focus, often right before BTC reclaims dominance. The Fear & Greed Index has also drifted toward “neutral” after months in “greed” territory, suggesting a potential bottoming of short-term sentiment. What to Watch in November The next few weeks could prove pivotal. Traders are watching three main catalysts: 1. ETF flows – Any uptick in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows could spark renewed institutional demand. 2. U.S. macro data – Inflation and rate expectations continue to influence Bitcoin’s correlation with equities. 3. On-chain accumulation – Sustained whale and long-term holder buying could confirm a market floor. Key stakeholders with 10-10K $BTC hold 13.68M $BTC , totaling 68.62% of all Bitcoin. Going into the last all-time high, they accumulated ~110,010 coins between Aug. 22 and Oct. 12. However, they have dumped ~23,200 coins since. Track them here: https://t.co/XfBCHZ1z30 pic.twitter.com/iLXuMu1nYg — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 31, 2025 Zooming out, this October red candle may be more psychological than structural. Bitcoin remains one of the best-performing assets of 2025, up over 90% year-to-date, despite short-term pullbacks. The long-term fundamentals haven’t changed: limited supply, increasing institutional participation, and a growing on-chain base. So while 2025’s “Uptober” didn’t go according to script, “Movember” might just live up to the hype. Bitcoin’s first red October since 2018 is a reminder that bull markets don’t move in straight lines. But history, and on-chain data, suggest the pause may be temporary. With whales adding billions, volatility at record lows, and November’s historical tailwinds, the setup for the next leg higher looks strong. As the saying goes: “Weak hands panic in red months. Strong hands buy them.” And right now, the strong hands seem very busy. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The future of festivals is being rewritten this November as The Best Event (TBE) — the flagship series by TBV — partners with UNTOLD Dubai , one of the world’s largest music festivals, to launch a groundbreaking tech-culture stage at Dubai Parks & Resorts, running November 6–10, 2025. This first-of-its-kind collaboration fuses Web3, AI, gaming, and creator tech with the electrifying atmosphere of a world-class music festival. With over 240,000 attendees expected, the event aims to bridge innovation and entertainment like never before — transforming technology into a shared cultural experience. “This has never been done before — not in Web2, not in Web3, not anywhere,” said Tobias Bauer, Co-Founder of The Best Event. “We’re taking the world’s most exciting technologies and bringing them to where people are already celebrating creativity and connection.” The Convergence of Innovation and Culture UNTOLD Dubai made history in 2024 by drawing more than 185,000 fans — nearly four times the size of SXSW — positioning it as the ideal stage for TBE’s vision of uniting the next generation of innovators and creators. “UNTOLD has always been about pushing boundaries — not just in music, but in how people experience culture,” said Bogdan Radulescu, Co-Founder and CBO of UNTOLD Universe. “Partnering with The Best Event adds a new dimension to that vision. It’s where the creative pulse of a global festival meets the innovation driving Web3, AI, and gaming.” A Festival Inside a Festival The Best Event x UNTOLD Dubai will unfold across two immersive formats: Day — Raj Mahal Theatre High-signal interviews, fireside conversations, film screenings, and brand activations designed for audiences eager to understand and participate in the next wave of innovation. Night — The Best Event Stage As the lights come up, the city’s most vibrant stage takes over — with global DJs, live creator performances, and exclusive tech brand unveilings that blur the lines between conference and concert. Across the festival grounds, visitors will experience interactive activations, lounges, and next-gen F&B concepts, turning Dubai Parks & Resorts into a living, breathing intersection of creativity, community, and innovation. More Than a Festival — A Signal Shift The UAE continues to cement its leadership across Web3, AI, gaming, and the creative economy, with long-term programs such as the UAE National AI Strategy 2031, the Dubai Program for Gaming 2033, and the Dubai Creative Economy Strategy. By embedding The Best Event stage within a mainstream festival, Dubai becomes the global epicenter of how technology integrates into daily life and culture — not as a niche interest, but as a movement.

Here's All the Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/privacy-focused-coins-show-positive-divergence-as-cryptocurrency-market-declines-continue-heres-all-the-data/,"Privacy-focused coins are experiencing a notable surge in the cryptocurrency market. Many privacy coins have gained double-digit value in the last 24 hours. Privacy-Focused Cryptocurrencies on the Rise: ZEC Reaches All-Time High Leading the way, Zcash (ZEC) surged 31 percent to $469, reaching a new all-time high. Dash (DASH), another prominent name on the list, gained 66 percent in value in the last 24 hours, reaching $138.32. Horizen (ZEN) rose 49 percent to $23.77, PIVX rose 38 percent to $0.3369, and Secret Network (SCRT) rose 32 percent to $0.2144. Analysts point to several possible reasons for this strong rise, including increased demand for privacy-focused financial solutions, regulatory concerns, and data security concerns within traditional financial systems. Some market observers also point to renewed institutional interest in established privacy projects like ZEC and DASH as a contributing factor to this rally. According to experts, whether privacy-themed assets can maintain this momentum will depend on both the course of regulatory policies and users' sensitivity to digital privacy. *This is not investment advice.

Is It the Crypto to Buy Now?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-0-035-token-mirrors-dogecoins-doge-viral-spark-from-years-past-is-it-the-crypto-to-buy-now/,"One may recall the tremendous growth of Dogecoin in the years 2020 and 2021, where the meme coin started from nowhere to somewhere after appreciating from a price level of $0.0023 in the early days of 2020 to a staggering level of $0.7376 in May 2021, providing an enormous return on investment for investors who invested at the right time. However, after the passage of time, the meme spark went off on the once top crypto. A new player at the price level of $0.035 offers the same appeal through measured growth and utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , this new cryptocurrency, has lured 17,660 investors for the DeFi lending capability, gathering a whopping $18,400,000 from the presale phase for this new entrant into the blockchain arena. Traders today are talking about MUTM as the cryptocurrency to buy now, just like DOGE at the start of its journey to the moon. Mutuum Finance Presale Stirs the Interest The Presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has echoed the early virality of Dogecoin in the sense that it has encouraged a gradual, community-driven growth process, raising $18,400,000 and attracting 17,660 members as the current phase, Phase 6, stands at 85% sold for $0.035, which represents a 250% jump from the $0.01 starting point seen in Phase 1. In contrast to DOGE’s random price spikes, the MUTM’s approach to the situation offers a long-term commitment to growth, funnelling funds into a lending platform expected to launch in Q4 of 2025. Current investors are looking at an opportunity for growth from the launch price of $0.06 to 420%. Phase 6 drops quickly, providing the last opportunity at $0.035 while Phase 7 will burst close to a 20% jump to $0.04 and lock forever the entry-level prices for these lucrative offers. Watching others profit as prices rocket out of control makes for a bitter experience for those left on the bench, necessitating the need for prompt action to stake one’s claim on this increasing altcoin token. Peer-to-peer Markets Enable Direct Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rolled out Peer-to-Peer markets where lending of such tokens that lack liquidity in the pool is possible through direct lending, where lenders create their own deals based on the risk level for increased profits, which the hype level in DOGE’s price never provided. Because of the flexibility in the platform, shrewd traders who wish to control the market convert every contract into a profit-making opportunity, thus taking the crypto to buy today to greater heights than the meme token, which only focuses on price manipulation based on certain moods of the market. Buy-and-Distribute Fuels Token Demand The developers at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) have integrated the buy and distribute mechanism, which uses the fees from the protocol to buy back the tokens on the open market and then reward stakers in the process. Such a development directly connects the activity levels on the platform and the reward for the token holders. Stakers compound these rewards passively, layering additional profits on top of lending rewards to keep pace with DOGE’s sentiment-driven price Appreciations. Essentially, MUTM has designed a machine for sustained price growth. It’s the cryptocurrency to buy now if you’re seeking DOGE’s performance benefits alongside inherent durability. Leaderboard Spikes Daily Interest The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) group has rolled out a leaderboard showcasing the top 50 token-holders over a period of 24 hours, sparking the lure of competitiveness through the reward scheme, reminiscent of DOGE’s virality; the first-ranked participant gets rewarded $500 in MUTM after every transaction. Its quality, however, has elevated the presale fervor, where transactions are fueled for the development of network liquidity and not only reward participants who supercharge the presale process for free token-distributions. Dogecoin’s legendary jump has sparked numerous quests for the next hot opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at the price point of $0.035, encompasses the spirit of the meme token craze combined with the complexity of DeFi as the cryptocurrency to buy today. Lock in your stake for Phase 6 today.

The event shook the DeFi circles, causing XUSD to plummet to a new all-time low of $0.30, according to data from CoinGecko. Stream Finance Freezes Withdrawals In an X post, the Stream Finance team confirmed the loss and temporary suspension of all deposits and withdrawals while investigations continue. “Yesterday, an external fund manager overseeing Stream funds disclosed the loss of approximately $93 million in Stream fund assets,” wrote the company. It also said it has hired attorneys Keith Miller and Joseph Cutler of Perkins Coie LLP to lead a full probe into the loss and has begun withdrawing all remaining liquid assets as a precautionary step. “Until we are able to fully assess the scope and causes of the loss, all withdrawals and deposits will be temporarily suspended,” the project stated, adding that its decision to retain Perkins Coie reflected a “commitment to transparency and corporate governance.” Blockchain security firm PeckShield first flagged the issue earlier in the day, noting that XUSD had fallen by 23%, before the decline deepened to 58% within an hour. At the time of writing, the asset was trading around $0.48, a 62% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market cap sits at roughly $95.6 million, with a one-day trading volume of $1.59 million. The stablecoin’s 7-day and 30-day performances both mirror the sharp decline, showing a consistent 62% downturn, making it one of the steepest stablecoin depegs of 2025 so far. Ongoing DeFi Fragility The Stream Finance incident comes hot on the heels of an exploit on Balancer V2, one of the sector’s longest-running protocols, which led to $128 million in losses. The attack also impacted several Balancer forks, with StakeWise DAO confirming earlier today that, together with security experts from Balancer and Gnosis Chain, it had managed to recover 73.5% of its affected funds, returning more than $20 million worth of stolen assets to users. These events highlight a recurring problem in the industry. According to a recent Peckshield report, in September alone, there were more than 20 major exploits on DeFi platforms, in which over $127 million was collectively lost. Although the figure represented a 22% drop from August’s loss of $163 million, it still brought 2025’s total above $3 billion, with casualties including the Bunni decentralized exchange. The platform shut down completely after an $8.4 million hack, which left the team unable to cover the cost of new security audits. However, they announced that users would still be able to withdraw assets and that the remaining treasury funds would be distributed to token holders.

The action has garnered significant publicity within the SHIB community. Kusama's bio now has bold writing: ”Founder. Innovator. Visionary. Here to prove the liars wrong. Tune in.” His location field shifted from ”on the cutting edge” to ”Watching the Blue Kachina.” The updates are his first published actions on the platform in several weeks. The reference to the Blue Kachina holds significant meaning based on the Hopi prophecy. It is, according to tradition, the onset of a new world. The prophecy speaks of a blue star that will lift its veil and usher in a time of cleansing. This would manifest itself as the ninth and last sign before a new transformative era starts. The exact meaning behind Kusama's reference remains unclear. Nevertheless, the symbolism of the Blue Kachina implies the motifs of change and renewal. All these ideas align with the current development of Shiba Inu as a cryptocurrency project. The cryptic nature of the update has prompted widespread speculation about potential announcements or developments. Shibarium Upgrade Adds Context to Timing The shifts in Kusama's profile are correlated with the key technical advancements of Shibarium. The Layer 2 blockchain solution has undergone a major upgrade recently . Network administrators have announced that the old RPC endpoint will be closed in the next 2 weeks. The upgrade will focus on enhancing the network decentralization. It is also designed to enhance the uptime and reliability for users. Shibarium is a crucial component of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The platform enables faster transactions and lower fees compared to operations on the Ethereum mainnet. Institutional Interest Grows as ETF Filing Emerges Shiba Inu has recently gained popularity among individuals in traditional finance fields. T. Rowe Price, a legacy asset manager with $1.77 trillion in assets under management, included SHIB in a multi-crypto ETF filing . The inclusion is an indicator of the increasing institutional acceptance of the token. This development occurs as cryptocurrency markets experience renewed interest from conventional investors. The ETF filing process continues through regulatory channels. Approval would provide traditional investors with regulated access to Shiba Inu exposure .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-04 07:43:00

Key Takeaways: FTX withdrew its plan to restrict repayments in 49 jurisdictions after backlash from creditors, especially those in China. The proposal sought to exclude around $800 million in claims if local compliance was deemed impossible. The reversal marks a major win for affected creditors as founder Sam Bankman-Fried continues to contest claims that FTX was insolvent. The motion, filed as part of FTX’s ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, sought to create a “Restricted Jurisdiction Procedure” that would have allowed the estate to withhold or even forfeit creditor claims in 49 jurisdictions deemed too complex for repayment due to local laws. FTX Faces Backlash Over Plan to Exclude $800M in Claims, Majority from China Those jurisdictions included China, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, covering roughly $800 million in claims, about 5% of FTX’s projected $16 billion in distributions. China alone represented 82% of that figure. Under the plan, FTX would have retained local legal counsel to assess whether compliant payments could be made in each region. If local compliance was deemed impossible, claims from those jurisdictions could have been forfeited and redistributed among other creditors after a 45-day objection window. The proposal drew immediate backlash from creditor groups . Over 300 Chinese claimants, represented by Singapore-based tax resident Weiwei Ji, filed a formal objection in Delaware bankruptcy court. Ji argued that the exchange failed to provide a valid legal or factual rationale for classifying China as a restricted jurisdiction, calling the plan discriminatory and contrary to bankruptcy fairness principles. Facing mounting pressure, FTX withdrew the motion on Monday “without prejudice,” leaving open the possibility of refiling the request later. For now, however, the reversal is seen as a symbolic win for affected creditors, many of whom had feared being excluded from repayment altogether. Update: The #FTX Recovery Trust filed a Notice of Withdrawal of the “Restricted Jurisdiction Procedures” motion on Nov 3. This is a victory for all potentially affected creditors. But until you receive the compensation you’re owed, stay vigilant and keep acting together. pic.twitter.com/Z1oBhHZOXk — Will的折腾纪 (@zhetengji) November 3, 2025 The development comes as Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the convicted FTX founder, prepares to appear before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York on Tuesday for his appeal hearing. Bankman-Fried, who is serving a 25-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy, has recently resurfaced in headlines after publishing a document claiming that FTX and Alameda Research were “never insolvent.” He accused the bankruptcy team of misrepresenting the exchange’s financial health and “liquidating valuable assets unnecessarily.” His family has since called for clemency from President Donald Trump, who has previously pardoned Ross Ulbricht and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after revelations of secret fund transfers between the exchange and Alameda triggered a liquidity crisis and one of the largest collapses in crypto history. Sam Bankman-Fried Claims FTX Was Never Insolvent As reported, Bankman-Fried has reignited debate over the FTX collapse, claiming the exchange always had enough assets to fully repay customers. In a September 30 document, the former CEO argued that the $8 billion shortfall cited during bankruptcy “never left,” and that customer recoveries of up to 143% prove FTX suffered a liquidity crunch—not insolvency. “There have always been enough assets to repay all customers—in full, in kind—both in November 2022, and today,” he wrote. Bankman-Fried framed the collapse as a “classic bank run,” triggered by panic withdrawals that drained liquidity within days. He maintained that FTX and Alameda’s assets exceeded liabilities up to mid-2022, and claimed that financing deals were underway before the bankruptcy filing. His document disputes the bankruptcy team’s early reports of insolvency and blames their management for eroding value and prolonging creditor repayments.

US President Addresses Binance’s Founder Pardon In a recent CBS News 60 Minutes interview , President Trump defended his decision to pardon Binance’s co-founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, which faced major backlash from multiple members of the US Congress. On October 23, the White House revealed Trump had pardoned Zhao, two years after pleading guilty, affirming that the US President “exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” CBS News correspondent Norah O’Donnell asked the US President about the reasons behind his decision to pardon the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations in 2023 while leading the crypto exchange. Trump explained that he doesn’t know who Zhao personally or who he is, but heard that his case was part of the Biden administration’s “witch hunt” against the crypto industry and was “set up” and a “victim of weaponization” by the previous government, like him and many others. This man was, in my opinion, from what I was told, this is, you know, a four-month sentence. But this man was treated really badly by the Biden administration. And he was given a jail term. He’s highly respected. He’s a very successful guy. They sent him to jail and they really set him up. That’s my opinion. I was told about it. Trump ‘Not Concerned’ About Corruption Claims Further detailing his reasoning, the US President affirmed that he knew “it may look bad,” but he had to “do the right thing” by pardoning Binance’s co-founder, later adding that he was “not concerned” about the appearance of corruption and play-for-play. Notably, Democratic lawmakers have pressed multiple government officials, including the US Special Envoy for peace missions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s former acting chairman, and the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), about Trump’s crypto ventures and potential conflicts of interest. Among the concerns, lawmakers have questioned a $2 billion deal between Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and the Emirati firm MGX, facilitated by Binance, alleging that the President has advertised a “staggering model for corruption” by using USD1 to finance business between “a foreign government-backed entity (MGX) and a foreign corporation that pleaded guilty to criminal violations of U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws (Binance).” When asked about the appearance of a potential play-for-play, Trump affirmed that he knew nothing about the deal because he is “too busy” and his sons oversee the family’s crypto ventures. I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I’m glad they are, because it’s probably a great industry, crypto. I think it’s good. You know, they’re running a business, they’re not in government. (…) My sons are involved in crypto much more than I– me. I– I know very little about it, other than one thing. It’s a huge industry. And if we’re not gonna be the head of it, China, Japan, or someplace else is. So I am behind it 100%. The US President stated that he wants to “make crypto great for America” and doesn’t want another country to be the global leader of the industry, as “it’s a kind of an industry where basically you’re going to have number one and you’re not gonna have a number two.” “Right now we’re number one by a long shot (…). The same way we’re number one with AI, we’re number one with crypto. And I wanna keep it that way,” he concluded.",Crypto News|binance|Binance.US|Changpeng Zhao|CZ|CZ pardon|Trump|US President Donald Trump|US Senators|USD1|WLFI|WLFIUSDT|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 08:00:09

Today, Solana slumped nearly 20%, marking an unexpected divergence from the debut’s record inflows. For instance, the BSOL fund recorded the most inflows in its first week, attracting roughly $417 to $421 million in net inflows, placing it among the top 20 ETFs by assets. Bitwise ETF, which launched with $223 million in seed capital, surpassed most notable asset managers such as Grayscale, which launched with only $2.2 million. BSOL fund leads in inflows with over $65 million this week Based on on-chain data, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to lead in inflows despite an unexpected outflow of more than $25o million last week. SoSoValue data shows that Bitcoin ETFs, including the IBIT ETF, experienced roughly $798 million in outflows over the past week, while Ethereum ETFs demonstrated sustained inflows of $15 million. Bitcoin’s decline below $110,000 was the primary driver of the trend. Source: SoSoValue ; Solana spot ETF flows. Solana’s high-speed transaction, DeFi activity, and the future of tokenized assets and stablecoin settlement infrastructure have placed the token ahead last week. Solana ETFs attracted roughly $44.4 million on Friday alone last week, driving cumulative inflows to around $199.2 million, while total assets under management surpassed $502 million. So far, Solana ETFs have attracted $513 million in assets under management, with most of the inflow occurring last week. This week, the funds have seen a 20% drop to around $420 million, marking a significant decline within the weekly timeframe. Based on in-chain data, Solana’s daily inflows stand at $70.5 million, with BSOL drawing in $65.16 million and GSOL attracting $ 5.34 million. Source: SoSoValue ; U.S. spot Ethereum ETF flows. Vincent Liu of Kronos Research revealed that Solana ETFs are surging on fresh catalysts and capital rotation. He added that staking-driven yields and new narratives are pulling in capital from BTC and ETH. According to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, the launch of U.S. Solana spot ETFs has been a notable success, drawing in substantial demand from investors despite a significant trend of outflows across other cryptocurrency blockchain networks. Solana drops 8% today and more than 30% over the past month Bitcoin ETFs lost $186.51 million today alone, and a similar trend was observed last week, with a cumulative outflow of $798 million. Ethereum ETFs recorded relatively the same, with a total of $135.6 million in outflows, reducing their cumulative total net inflow to $14.3 billion. Bitwise offers a roughly 7% stacking yield, making it the most preferred fund alongside the HSBC-backed Litecoin. The other fund is the HBAR ETF, Grayscale’s Solana Trust conversion, which reflects the broadening landscape of altcoin-based, regulated investment vehicles. Liu warned that the ongoing macro volatility may persist into the next few days, but any shift in market sentiment may trigger reversals. Solana has slumped by 8% today and more than 30% over the past month, trading at $162.2, which represents a 9.12% decline on the daily chart at the time of publication. BTC and ETH have also recorded drops, with a 1.5% decline on Bitcoin and a 6.1% drop on the Ethereum blockchain’s native token. On the monthly chart, BTC and ETH recorded 15% and 22% drop, respectively. Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise, maintained his bullish sentiment regarding Solana’s long-term prospects, despite the recent price activity. He argued that investing in Solana is a bet on the network’s role in enabling stablecoin transfers and tokenized assets. He added that if he’s right, then the combination of a growing market and a growing share of that market will boost Solana’s growth.

CryptoQuant noted that this failure could expose the market to further downside momentum. Bitcoin’s Line of Defense Breached According to the analysis, the established range between approximately $107,000 and $123,000 has served as the battlefield for buyers and sellers since mid-June, and price action reflected high vulnerability at the range floor. However, while the price continued to show weakness and remains under pressure near the bottom of this multi-month structure, on-chain data from Binance reveals a contrasting pattern that signals a rise in underlying demand. CryptoQuant stated that the 7-day moving average of Exchange Withdrawing Addresses on Binance has increased sharply, rising from roughly 340 on October 30 to close to 418 on Monday, which indicates a growing cohort of market participants is moving Bitcoin off the exchange and into self-custody. This trend is historically associated with accumulation behavior rather than preparation for selling, and suggests that some holders may now view the current price zone as attractive for long-term positioning. The earlier opposing trend of falling price versus rising withdrawals suggested that demand was forming around the $107,000 zone, potentially offering short-term protection. Those withdrawal patterns signaled that certain buyers were attempting to build a base by shifting coins into self-custody and away from exchange sell-side pressure. But CryptoQuant noted that this signal alone was not a guarantee that support would hold. The outcome, according to the analysis, was always based on whether the accumulation magnitude was strong enough to counter ongoing selling. With Bitcoin now trading around $104,000 and below that previously observed support area, the focus shifts toward whether this withdrawal trend continues to rise or begins to cool. The sustainability of this metric in the coming days will determine if buyers still step in at lower prices or if the breakdown below the range continues. Rising Activity From STH Signals Early Accumulation Bitcoin’s short-term holder cohorts are beginning to accumulate again, but this does not necessarily mean the market has found a local bottom. CryptoQuant’s analysis tracking Bitcoin’s Realized Price by UTXO Age Bands focuses on two short-term groups. First, those holding BTC between one and three months, and second, those holding between three and six months. These two cohorts are typically the most reactive during market corrections and tend to drive volatility. In previous uptrends, especially from early 2024 to mid-2025, the realized price of the one-to-three-month band often acted as a first support line, as newer buyers defended their cost basis during pullbacks. Meanwhile, the three-to-six-month cohort has historically behaved in a contrarian way. It was found that their accumulation tends to rise when prices are falling, and fade when prices are rising. The analytics firm observed that this three-to-six-month group has now started accumulating again, but the trend is not fully developed. This could mean that while these holders are stepping in, they may not yet view current prices as attractive enough for aggressive entry, or are waiting for more fear, capitulation, or deeper discount conditions to unfold before increasing their positioning in size.

Understanding market sentiment is absolutely crucial, especially when it comes to volatile assets like Bitcoin. Today, we’re diving deep into the fascinating world of BTC perpetual futures , specifically looking at the long/short ratio on the top three crypto futures exchanges. This powerful metric offers a snapshot of trader sentiment, helping you gauge whether the crowd is leaning bullish or bearish. Unpacking BTC Perpetual Futures: What They Are and Why Ratios Matter Before we dissect the numbers, let’s quickly clarify what BTC perpetual futures are. Unlike traditional futures contracts with an expiry date, perpetual futures don’t expire. This makes them incredibly popular among traders who want to speculate on Bitcoin’s price movements without the hassle of rollovers. They essentially allow you to bet on whether Bitcoin’s price will go up (going “long”) or down (going “short”). The long/short ratio then becomes a vital indicator. It simply compares the number of long positions to short positions. A higher long ratio suggests bullish sentiment, with more traders expecting prices to rise. Conversely, a higher short ratio indicates a bearish outlook, with more traders anticipating a price drop. Monitoring these shifts can provide valuable clues about potential market direction. Decoding the Current BTC Perpetual Futures Landscape So, what’s the latest buzz in the market? Let’s look at the 24-hour long/short position ratios for BTC perpetual futures across the world’s top three crypto futures exchanges, ranked by open interest. This data gives us a real-time pulse of trader sentiment: Overall Market Sentiment: Across these leading platforms, the sentiment is fairly balanced but with a slight lean towards the bears. We’re seeing approximately 48.84% long positions versus 51.16% short positions. This suggests that slightly more traders are currently betting on a price decline for Bitcoin. Binance’s Perspective: On Binance, the largest exchange by open interest, the picture is similar. Traders here are holding 48.65% long and 51.35% short positions. This indicates a marginally bearish tilt among its vast user base, aligning with the overall trend. Bybit’s Outlook: Bybit shows an even stronger bearish sentiment compared to the overall average. Their traders are positioned with 47.35% long and a significant 52.65% short. This suggests a more pronounced expectation of downward price movement on this platform. Gate.io’s Divergence: Interestingly, Gate.io presents a different narrative. Here, we observe a slight bullish bias, with 50.92% long positions against 49.08% short. This divergence highlights that sentiment isn’t uniform across all exchanges and can sometimes offer contrarian signals. This snapshot of BTC perpetual futures data provides a fascinating look into the collective mindset of crypto traders right now. It’s a dynamic picture, constantly shifting with market news and price action. What Does This BTC Perpetual Futures Data Tell Us? The current data on BTC perpetual futures long/short ratios paints a picture of cautious, perhaps slightly bearish, sentiment across the major exchanges, with one notable exception. The overall lean towards short positions suggests that a significant portion of the market anticipates a potential downtrend or consolidation for Bitcoin in the immediate future. This doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, but rather that traders are positioning themselves to profit from potential declines or are hedging existing spot positions. The stronger bearish sentiment on Bybit, for instance, could indicate a more aggressive short-selling presence or a reaction to recent price movements. Conversely, Gate.io’s slight bullish lean might reflect a different trader demographic or a belief that Bitcoin is due for a bounce. Understanding these nuances across platforms is key to forming a comprehensive market view. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for BTC Perpetual Futures Traders For those trading BTC perpetual futures , these ratios are more than just numbers; they are actionable insights. When the long/short ratio heavily favors shorts, it could indicate an overcrowded trade, potentially setting the stage for a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly rise. Conversely, an overwhelmingly long ratio might precede a long squeeze. It’s crucial to remember that these ratios are just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine this sentiment data with other technical and fundamental analysis. Consider: Volume Trends: Is the sentiment backed by strong trading volume? Price Action: How is Bitcoin’s price reacting to this sentiment? Macro Factors: Are there broader economic or regulatory news items influencing the market? Risk Management: Never trade solely based on sentiment. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. By integrating these ratios into your trading strategy, you can gain a deeper understanding of market psychology and potentially identify better entry and exit points for your BTC perpetual futures trades. In conclusion, keeping a close eye on BTC perpetual futures long/short ratios provides an invaluable window into the collective sentiment of the crypto trading world. While the current data suggests a slightly bearish inclination on most top exchanges, it’s a dynamic metric that warrants continuous monitoring. Understanding these ratios, alongside robust technical and fundamental analysis, empowers traders to make more informed decisions and navigate the volatile Bitcoin market with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize sound risk management. Frequently Asked Questions About BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios What is a BTC perpetual future? A BTC perpetual future is a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiration date, unlike traditional futures. How is the long/short ratio calculated for BTC perpetual futures? The long/short ratio is typically calculated by dividing the total number of long positions by the total number of short positions (or sometimes expressed as a percentage of each). It reflects the proportion of traders betting on a price increase versus those betting on a decrease. What does a high short ratio in BTC perpetual futures indicate? A high short ratio indicates that a greater number of traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall, suggesting a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. Can I use the long/short ratio alone to make trading decisions? While the long/short ratio is a powerful sentiment indicator, it should not be used in isolation. It’s best combined with other forms of analysis, such as technical indicators, price action, and fundamental news, for a more comprehensive trading strategy. Why do different exchanges show different BTC perpetual futures long/short ratios? Differences can arise due to varying user bases, regional preferences, trading strategies prevalent on each platform, and even slight delays in data aggregation. Each exchange represents its own microcosm of market sentiment. Found this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long/short ratios insightful? Don’t keep these crucial market insights to yourself!

RLUSD’s $1B Surge Puts Pressure on the Charts,https://coinpaper.com/12084/can-xrp-defend-2-25-rlusd-s-1-b-surge-puts-pressure-on-the-charts,"XRP Showing Signs of Weakness as Momentum Fades — Can Bulls Defend the $2.25 Support? According to renowned market analyst Ali Martinez, XRP is beginning to show signs of weakness after its recent rally, with momentum indicators pointing toward a potential pullback. Following a strong surge that pushed the token to multi-month highs, buyers appear to be losing steam, raising concerns about whether the $2.25 support zone will hold or if a deeper correction is imminent. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is cooling from overbought levels, signaling fading buying momentum, while a bearish Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) crossover suggests profit-taking among short-term traders. Together, these indicators point to weakening bullish strength and a potential retest of lower support zones. Historically, the $2.25 zone has been a pivotal level for XRP, flipping between resistance in past rallies and support during pullbacks. Holding above it could reinforce the bullish structure and spark a rebound toward the $2.45–$2.55 range. Conversely, a clean break below $2.25 may open the door for deeper losses, with the next key support around $2.05. In the days ahead, XRP’s reaction around the $2.25 level will be pivotal. A strong rebound could reignite bullish momentum, confirming a healthy correction within the broader uptrend as the altcoin traverses oversold territory. However, a breakdown below this support may trigger a deeper retracement, flushing out leveraged positions before the next major move. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Crosses $1 Billion Valuation, Signaling Growing Institutional Adoption According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, Ripple’s recently launched stablecoin, RLUSD, has officially surpassed a $1 billion market valuation, marking a major milestone for the blockchain company and signaling accelerating institutional interest in Ripple’s ecosystem. RLUSD’s explosive growth positions it among the fastest-rising stablecoins in the market. Built on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, it’s engineered to bridge traditional finance with decentralized systems through a compliant, transparent, and enterprise-grade framework. This rapid adoption underscores Ripple’s broader strategy to move beyond cross-border payments and cement its presence in the expanding world of tokenized finance. Analysts attribute RLUSD’s rapid rise to Ripple’s global partnerships and clear regulatory positioning. Unlike many rivals, RLUSD is backed by full reserves, institutional-grade security, and audited transparency, a formula that’s winning over banks, fintechs, and liquidity providers seeking a trusted stablecoin for settlement and on-chain payments. “Crossing the $1 billion threshold highlights the market’s confidence in Ripple’s ability to deliver stability and trust in digital assets,” said a CryptoQuant market analyst. “Institutional players are clearly viewing RLUSD as a credible bridge between crypto liquidity and traditional finance.” The timing of this milestone is also significant. As global demand for tokenized assets and real-world asset (RWA) solutions accelerates, RLUSD provides Ripple with the foundation to integrate stable settlement rails across diverse financial applications, from DeFi liquidity pools to enterprise remittance platforms. Conclusion XRP sits at a critical juncture, with the $2.25 support zone poised to decide its next major move. A decisive defense could reignite bullish momentum, transforming the recent pullback into a springboard for higher targets. While technicals point to short-term exhaustion, underlying market optimism and rising institutional interest suggest any dip may be short-lived. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.25 could trigger deeper losses, making the coming days pivotal for XRP’s trend direction. On the other hand, RLUSD’s rapid climb to a $1 billion valuation cements Ripple as a major force in the stablecoin and digital finance landscape. The milestone validates Ripple’s vision of uniting regulatory compliance with blockchain innovation while underscoring rising institutional trust in its infrastructure. As adoption expands across payment rails, DeFi ecosystems, and tokenized asset markets, RLUSD is emerging as a cornerstone of liquidity and confidence, positioning Ripple at the forefront of the next financial revolution.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-04 08:10:39

In the volatile world of finance, where every central bank decision sends ripples across markets, understanding the nuanced movements of foreign exchange is paramount, especially for those tracking the broader economic landscape that influences even digital assets. Recent developments in Asia FX offer a compelling case study of how global monetary policy and regional economic dynamics intertwine, creating a complex environment for investors and traders alike. As the Federal Reserve’s next move remains shrouded in speculation, Asian currencies find themselves at a critical juncture, balancing domestic stability with external pressures. Navigating the Labyrinth of Fed Rate Uncertainty The specter of Fed rate uncertainty continues to loom large over global financial markets, dictating the ebb and flow of capital and the relative strength of currencies worldwide. The Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates are not just domestic matters for the United States; they are global events that trigger a cascade of effects, particularly in emerging markets and highly dollar-sensitive economies. When the Fed signals a potential rate hike, it typically strengthens the US Dollar (USD), making dollar-denominated assets more attractive and potentially drawing capital away from other regions, including Asia. Conversely, a dovish stance or a pause in rate hikes can weaken the USD, providing a breathing room for other currencies. This constant anticipation creates a challenging environment for policymakers in Asia, who must calibrate their own monetary policies to prevent excessive currency volatility, capital flight, or inflationary pressures. The market is currently dissecting every piece of economic data – from inflation figures to employment reports – to glean clues about the Fed’s next move. This uncertainty often leads to: Increased Volatility: Currencies can experience sharp swings as market participants react to new information or revised expectations. Capital Flow Reversals: Funds can quickly move in and out of Asian markets, impacting bond yields and equity prices. Policy Dilemmas: Asian central banks face the tough choice of whether to mirror the Fed’s actions to maintain currency stability or prioritize domestic economic growth. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in international trade, investment, or even just observing the broader macroeconomic trends that ultimately influence the performance of various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The Australian Dollar ‘s Steadfast Stance: A Closer Look at the RBA Amidst this global uncertainty, the Australian Dollar (AUD), often referred to as the ‘Aussie,’ has shown a remarkable degree of resilience, particularly following the recent RBA decision . The Reserve Bank of Australia opted to hold its cash rate steady, a move that was largely anticipated by the market. This decision reflects the RBA’s cautious approach, balancing persistent inflation with signs of a slowing economy and the impact of previous rate hikes. Key factors influencing the RBA’s hold included: Factor RBA’s Consideration Inflation Inflation remains elevated but shows signs of moderating, with the RBA monitoring its path back to target. Economic Growth Domestic demand is slowing, and household consumption is softening due to higher interest rates. Labor Market While still tight, there are indications of some easing, reducing immediate wage pressure concerns. Global Economy External uncertainties, including China’s economic performance and global commodity prices, weigh on the outlook. The RBA’s steady hand has provided a degree of stability for the Australian Dollar, preventing significant depreciation despite the broader global headwinds. This stability is particularly important for Australia, a major commodity exporter, as it helps to manage import costs and maintain purchasing power. The Aussie’s performance is often seen as a bellwether for global growth and commodity demand, making its current steadiness a point of interest for market watchers. What Does the RBA Decision Mean for Regional Currencies? The RBA decision to hold rates, while specific to Australia, sends ripples across the broader Asian currency landscape. Australia’s strong trade ties with many Asian economies mean that the Aussie’s stability or volatility can have contagion effects. For instance, a stable Australian Dollar can contribute to a general sense of calm in the region, especially for economies heavily reliant on trade with Australia or those whose currencies often move in tandem with commodity prices. However, the impact is not uniform. For some Asian currencies, the RBA’s stance might indirectly influence capital flows. If the RBA is perceived as being more dovish than the Fed, it could encourage capital to flow towards economies with higher interest rates or stronger growth prospects. Conversely, if the RBA is seen as more hawkish than other regional central banks, it might attract capital. The carry trade, where investors borrow in low-interest-rate currencies and invest in high-interest-rate ones, can also be affected, leading to shifts in demand for various Asian currencies like the Japanese Yen (JPY), South Korean Won (KRW), or Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). The RBA’s approach, alongside other central banks in the region, contributes to the complex mosaic of monetary policy responses to a global environment dominated by Fed actions and the ongoing recovery from various economic shocks. Each central bank is essentially playing a chess game, trying to optimize domestic conditions while responding to external forces. Understanding the Broader Global Economic Outlook and Its FX Impact Beyond individual central bank decisions, the overarching global economic outlook is a crucial determinant of currency movements. The interconnectedness of today’s economies means that developments in one major region can quickly reverberate across the globe. Currently, several key themes dominate the global economic narrative: Persistent Inflation: While showing signs of cooling in some regions, inflation remains a concern, pushing central banks to maintain restrictive monetary policies. Slowing Growth: Major economies like the US, Eurozone, and China are experiencing decelerating growth, raising fears of a potential recession. Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing conflicts and trade disputes continue to add layers of uncertainty, impacting commodity prices, supply chains, and investor confidence. China’s Economic Performance: As the world’s second-largest economy and a major trading partner for many Asian nations, China’s recovery (or lack thereof) significantly influences regional currencies and commodity demand. These factors collectively shape the risk appetite of investors. During periods of heightened risk aversion, safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar and Japanese Yen tend to strengthen. Conversely, during periods of optimism, riskier assets and currencies linked to global growth (like the Australian Dollar or emerging market currencies) might perform better. For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro trends is vital, as they often dictate the broader liquidity environment and investor sentiment that indirectly impact digital asset valuations. Opportunities and Challenges in Asia FX Markets The current environment, characterized by Fed rate uncertainty and varying regional responses, presents both significant opportunities and formidable challenges for participants in Asia FX markets. The heightened volatility, while posing risks, also creates potential for strategic trading for those who can accurately predict central bank moves or identify undervalued currencies. Challenges: Unpredictable Policy Shifts: Sudden changes in central bank rhetoric or economic data can lead to rapid and significant currency movements, making risk management complex. Divergent Growth Paths: The varied economic health across Asian nations means that a ‘one size fits all’ approach to investment is risky. USD Dominance: The enduring strength and safe-haven status of the US Dollar can exert downward pressure on many Asian currencies, especially during global downturns. Opportunities: Carry Trade Potential: If interest rate differentials widen favorably, certain Asian currencies might offer attractive carry trade opportunities. Hedging Strategies: Businesses and investors can utilize FX derivatives to hedge against currency risks, protecting their international revenues or investments. Selective Value Plays: Identifying economies with strong fundamentals, improving current accounts, or undervalued currencies can present long-term investment opportunities. Actionable insights for investors include maintaining a diversified portfolio, staying abreast of central bank communications, and utilizing technical analysis to identify entry and exit points. For those with exposure to crypto, understanding these traditional market dynamics can provide a clearer picture of overall market liquidity and investor sentiment, which often spill over into digital asset performance. FAQs on Asia FX and Global Monetary Policy Q1: What is the primary driver of current Asia FX movements? The primary driver is often the perceived future path of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, which influences the strength of the US Dollar and global capital flows. Regional economic data and central bank actions also play a significant role. Q2: How does the RBA decision impact the Australian Dollar ? When the RBA holds rates steady, it generally provides stability to the Australian Dollar, especially if the decision aligns with market expectations. It signals a balanced approach to inflation and growth, which can attract or retain investment. Q3: Why is Fed rate uncertainty so impactful globally? The Federal Reserve sets the benchmark for global interest rates. Its decisions affect the cost of borrowing for governments and corporations worldwide, influence capital allocation, and determine the relative attractiveness of the US Dollar, impacting global trade and investment. Q4: What role does the International Monetary Fund (IMF) play in these discussions? The IMF monitors the global economy and provides policy advice to member countries, including on monetary and fiscal policies.

According to real-time monitoring, BTC has notably fallen below the $106,000 mark, currently trading around $105,965.44 on the Binance USDT market. This significant movement has naturally sparked discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. What does this immediate shift mean for the broader crypto landscape, and how should participants react to this sudden change? What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind any significant market movement is crucial. The recent Bitcoin price drop can be attributed to a combination of factors, often intertwined and complex. While no single event is usually solely responsible, several elements typically contribute to such shifts: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as inflation concerns or interest rate hikes, often push investors towards safer assets, leading to outflows from riskier ones like cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles, even if unrelated to Bitcoin directly, can dampen overall investor confidence. This creates a ripple effect across the market. Technical Resistance Levels: Bitcoin often encounters resistance at certain price points. Failing to break above these levels can trigger sell-offs as traders take profits or anticipate a reversal. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often called “whales,” can significantly influence prices with their substantial buy or sell orders. A series of large sell orders can quickly drive the price down. Regulatory Speculation: Ongoing discussions or rumors about new cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to reduce their exposure. These elements, working in concert, can create downward pressure, leading to a noticeable Bitcoin price drop in a short period. Navigating the Bitcoin Price Drop: What Investors Should Know When the market experiences volatility, especially a sudden Bitcoin price drop , it is natural for investors to feel concerned. However, panicking often leads to impulsive decisions. Here are some key considerations and actionable insights for navigating such times: Stay Informed, Not Emotional: Rely on reputable sources for information. Avoid making decisions based on fear or hype. Understanding the underlying reasons for the price movement is more productive than reacting emotionally. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current holdings. Is your portfolio diversified? Do your investments align with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, a Bitcoin price drop can be an opportunity. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps mitigate risk over time. Understand Support and Resistance: Learn about key technical levels. Support levels are price points where buying interest is strong enough to prevent further drops, while resistance levels are where selling interest is strong enough to prevent further gains. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss orders if you are actively trading to limit potential losses. Remember, market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle. Bitcoin has a history of significant volatility, followed by periods of recovery and growth. Looking Ahead: The Future After a Bitcoin Price Drop While the immediate Bitcoin price drop below $106,000 might seem daunting, it is important to consider the broader perspective. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by remarkable resilience and adoption over the past decade. The cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, with ongoing innovations and increasing institutional interest. The future outlook for Bitcoin remains a topic of extensive debate, but several factors suggest continued long-term potential: Increasing Adoption: More businesses and institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their operations and investment strategies. Halving Events: Periodic halving events reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically leading to price appreciation over time. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments in scalability and security further strengthen Bitcoin’s underlying technology. Market movements like this serve as a reminder of the dynamic nature of cryptocurrencies. Investors are encouraged to conduct thorough research, consult with financial advisors, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations. The crypto market rewards patience and informed decision-making. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $106,000 is a significant event that warrants attention, but not necessarily alarm. It underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, driven by a confluence of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and technical indicators. By staying informed, practicing sound risk management, and maintaining a long-term outlook, investors can navigate these fluctuations more effectively. As the digital asset space matures, understanding these market dynamics becomes increasingly vital for success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when BTC falls below a certain price? A1: It indicates a shift in market sentiment, where selling pressure has overcome buying interest at that specific price point, potentially signaling a new support or resistance level. Q2: Is a Bitcoin price drop a bad sign for the crypto market? A2: Not necessarily. Price drops are a normal part of market cycles, often leading to corrections before further growth. They can also present buying opportunities for long-term investors. Q3: How should I react to a sudden Bitcoin price drop? A3: Avoid panic selling. Instead, stay informed, review your investment strategy, consider dollar-cost averaging, and assess your risk tolerance. Q4: What are the potential reasons for this specific Bitcoin price drop? A4: Reasons can include macroeconomic factors, changes in market sentiment, technical resistance levels, large whale movements, or regulatory news. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover after this drop? A5: Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and recovery after significant price drops. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, many analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential due to increasing adoption and technological advancements.

The Japanese company said it now plans to sell 19 million Switch 2 units before the end of March 2026. That’s up from an earlier estimate of 15 million units. The company reported its financial results for the three months ending September 30. Nintendo brought in 527.2 billion yen, or roughly $3.7 billion, in revenue. Wall Street analysts had predicted 461.76 billion yen. The company earned 102.9 billion yen in profit, well above the expected 63.6 billion yen. Sales jumped more than 90% compared to the same period last year. Profits climbed over 270%. The gaming company introduced the Switch 2 in June, and shares have climbed nearly 40% so far this year as per CNBC. September quarter shows solid performance Nintendo moved 4.54 million Switch 2 units during the quarter ending in September. The company noted this was fewer than the “high demand seen immediately following the launch of Nintendo Switch 2” in the previous three-month period, though it said sales “remained strong.” Since hitting stores, the Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units total. Two games have become big hits for the new system. “Mario Kart World” and “Donkey Kong Bonanza” helped Nintendo sell 11.95 million software titles for the Switch 2 during the quarter. The positive response to the Switch 2 led Nintendo to adjust other financial targets as well. The Kyoto-based company now expects total sales of 2.25 trillion yen for the fiscal year, up from its previous goal of 1.9 trillion yen. It also raised its profit forecast by almost 17% to 350 billion yen. Original Switch sets high bar for success The first Switch console came out in 2017 and became Nintendo’s second-highest-selling system ever, trailing only the Nintendo DS. People liked being able to play games both at home on their TV and while traveling. Some observers wondered if the Switch 2 would offer enough new features to convince people to buy it. Early sales numbers suggest customers are responding well. Analysts will watch the current quarter closely, especially with the busy holiday shopping period approaching. Nintendo kept the original Switch selling for years by releasing games featuring well-known characters like Super Mario and Pokemon. The company plans to use the same approach with the Switch 2. Last month, Nintendo put out “Pokémon Legends: Z-A” and offered a package deal that includes the game with the Switch 2 console. Two more titles, “Kirby Air Riders” and “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,” are set to come out later this year. “We will aim to keep the momentum of released titles and continuously introduce new titles to expand the platform’s user base,” the company said in its earnings statement.

In a recent dramatic turn of events, a staggering $250 million worth of crypto futures liquidation swept across major exchanges in just one hour. This rapid sell-off sent ripples through the digital asset landscape, highlighting the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in leveraged trading. Over the past 24 hours, the total figure climbed even higher, reaching an astonishing $776 million in liquidations. For many traders, this wasn’t just a market blip; it was a harsh reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the fast-paced world of crypto futures. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? If you’re new to the derivatives market, the term “liquidation” might sound a bit intimidating. Simply put, a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a specific future date. When you trade futures on an exchange, you often use leverage, meaning you only put up a fraction of the total trade value as collateral, known as margin. This allows you to control a larger position with less capital. However, leverage is a double-edged sword. If the market moves significantly against your leveraged position, your margin might no longer be enough to cover potential losses. When this happens, the exchange automatically closes your position to prevent further losses, and this forced closure is what we call crypto futures liquidation . It’s a protective mechanism for the exchange, but a painful experience for the trader who loses their collateral. The Staggering Numbers: $250 Million in an Hour – What Does It Mean? To witness $250 million in crypto futures liquidation within a mere 60 minutes is a stark indicator of extreme market pressure. This kind of rapid liquidation event suggests a significant price movement that caught a large number of leveraged positions off guard. Often, it’s a cascading effect: one liquidation triggers another as prices dip further, leading to a domino effect of forced closures. Consider the broader context: the $776 million liquidated over 24 hours underscores sustained market volatility. These figures are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital wiped out from traders’ accounts. Such events can amplify market downturns, as the forced selling adds more supply to the market, pushing prices even lower and trapping more leveraged positions. Why Does Crypto Futures Liquidation Happen So Suddenly? Several factors contribute to these sudden and massive crypto futures liquidation events: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their wild price swings. A small percentage change in Bitcoin or Ethereum can translate into a significant movement when leverage is applied. High Leverage Usage: Many traders in the crypto futures market use very high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x). While this can magnify gains, it drastically reduces the margin for error, making liquidation thresholds much tighter. Market Whales and Large Orders: Large sell orders from institutional players or “whales” can quickly drive down prices, initiating a cascade of liquidations. Unexpected News or Events: Geopolitical events, regulatory announcements, or even a prominent figure’s tweet can trigger rapid market reactions, leading to widespread liquidations. These elements often combine to create a perfect storm, where a minor price dip can snowball into a major liquidation event, affecting hundreds of thousands of traders globally. Navigating the Storm: Strategies to Avoid Crypto Futures Liquidation While the crypto market will always have its volatile moments, traders can adopt strategies to minimize their risk of crypto futures liquidation . It’s about smart risk management and understanding the tools at your disposal. Manage Your Leverage Wisely: Avoid using excessively high leverage. While tempting, it significantly increases your risk. A lower leverage ratio provides more buffer against price fluctuations. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders. These automatically close your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses before liquidation occurs. Maintain Sufficient Margin: Ensure your account has enough collateral to withstand market swings. Don’t overextend yourself; always have a buffer beyond the minimum margin requirement. Stay Informed and Practice Due Diligence: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. Understanding potential catalysts for price movements can help you anticipate and react. Diversify (Where Possible): While futures trading is specific, having a broader portfolio can cushion the blow of a single market downturn. Understanding these principles is crucial for anyone venturing into the high-stakes world of crypto futures. It’s not just about making profits, but also about protecting your capital. Conclusion: The Enduring Lesson of Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent $250 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rapid shifts within the cryptocurrency market. While futures trading offers immense opportunities for profit, it demands a disciplined approach to risk management. Understanding what triggers liquidations, and implementing strategies like judicious leverage and stop-loss orders, are not just good practices—they are essential for survival and success. Always remember, the market doesn’t forgive recklessness. Trade wisely, stay informed, and prioritize capital preservation above all else. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly is crypto futures liquidation? It’s the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin (collateral) falls below a required level due to adverse market movements, preventing further losses for the exchange. 2. Why did $250 million worth of futures get liquidated so quickly? Such rapid liquidations are typically triggered by extreme market volatility, often combined with widespread use of high leverage. A significant price swing can quickly push many leveraged positions past their liquidation threshold, creating a cascade effect. 3. How does leverage contribute to liquidations? Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. While it allows traders to control larger positions with less capital, it also drastically reduces the price movement required to wipe out their initial margin, making liquidation more likely. 4. What can traders do to avoid crypto futures liquidation? Key strategies include using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in your trading account, staying informed about market news, and practicing overall disciplined risk management. 5. Are liquidations always bad for the market? While painful for the liquidated traders, liquidations are a natural part of leveraged markets. They can sometimes clear out excessive speculation, potentially leading to healthier, more sustainable price action in the long run, though short-term they can intensify downturns.

According to an X post from the project during the early hours of November 4, one of the project’s third-party fund managers reported the loss over the weekend, which led to a sharp depeg of its stablecoin and a halt in user activity.

Stream Finance has pledged to publish a detailed post-mortem and continue updating the public as its investigation progresses. xUSD loses dollar peg Stream Finance is a recursive looping DeFi protocol that uses layered yield strategies and third-party fund managers to generate returns and collateralise its stablecoin, xUSD. However, as unease spread over the weekend after users noticed stalled withdrawals and xUSD slipping from its peg, the platform’s complex yield mechanisms and reliance on off-chain fund managers came under renewed scrutiny. Before the team issued its official statement, users had already begun sounding alarms about stalled transactions and a sudden drop in xUSD’s price across decentralized exchanges. The stablecoin, which was designed to maintain a $1 peg, fell to as low as $0.51 on Monday, as market confidence in the protocol’s underlying collateral and risk exposure faded. At press time, xUSD is down over 76% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.2973. xUSD price action in the past 24 hours. Source: Coingecko. Prominent DeFi voices, including Chaos Labs founder Omer Goldberg and trader CBB0FE, were among the first to highlight that xUSD had already “materially depegged” hours before Stream Finance acknowledged the situation. Goldberg also drew connections between the timing of the depeg and a separate exploit that hit the automated market maker Balancer just days earlier. The Balancer incident , which involved a vulnerability resulting in a $100 million loss, may have prompted investors to rapidly pull funds from protocols perceived to be exposed or poorly collateralized. At the same time, community members have also questioned the discrepancies between the platform’s self-reported total value locked (TVL) and data available on DeFiLlama, where Stream’s looping strategies were not recognized as valid TVL due to concerns about inflated figures. Stream itself acknowledged this difference in a Friday post , stating that user deposits totalled around $160 million while total deployed assets exceeded $500 million, raising questions about leverage and collateral adequacy. “We have signed letters of engagement with third-party attestation companies and have shared access to our books. These things take time to do right, but we are moving as fast as we can to give users guarantees,” it said at the time. In its Nov. 4 update, Stream Finance said it is actively working to recover all liquid assets and noted that no new deposits would be processed during the ongoing review.

The resistance levels have held up well at the 50-day-low Exponential Moving Average of $0.00001026, having faced three rejections, thus indicating waning momentum. Weak points at the level of the 0.382 Fibonacci level at the price of $0.00001022 are visible, likely to break and move towards the price levels of $0.000008. However, as the meme coin craze dies down—it’s seen in the market cap, although the volume indicates a 14% jump— buyers invest in utility-forward alts instead. With MUTM costing $0.035, it comes as the crypto to buy, fusing the benefits of DeFi and the stability found in neither SHIB’s tokenomics nor other meme assets for the past 17,660 investors who are seeking the promise of a 420% ROI. Shiba Inu Fights Against Strong Resistance Shiba Inu remains in the extended phase of an 11-month bear market as of November 2025, keeping the period of absorption without an accompanying breakout. Whale selling, burning rates at an unprecedented level, and an at-risk pattern demonstrate the cryptocurrency’s sensitivity to the consequences associated with the squeeze effects within the meme market group. The historical November pattern comes complete with losses such as the 29.6% close at the end of the last year, after which SHIB and other cryptocurrencies are left open to the effects since the rotation, as opposed to new money, causes the separation where the volumes are up, but the prices are stagnant below $0.0000113. With the pressure building up, the focus lies on projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which provide guaranteed profits, and not speculative flops. Mutuum Finance Presale A staggering $18,400,000 has been injected into the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, having reached the crucial point of 17,700 wallets for the current phase, phase 6, which stands at an impressive 85% sold at the price of $0.035, a staggering results-acquiring jump of an astonishing 250% from the price at the launch in phase 1, which stood at an incredibly-low price of only $0.01. The presale phase for the token is soon expected to be at the price point of $0.06 at launch, setting the stage for big gains. Demand gets accumulated as MUTM ties directly to the fee for borrowing, which aids in the repurchasing and recycling of the token, forming the value circles, which the meme token SHIB fails to offer. Furthermore, MUTM being the top cryptocurrency to buy at the moment, turns idle money into revenues, attracting traders from sinking stories. Phase 6 goes quickly at this entry point, slamming the door on $0.035 offers before a Phase 7 jump to $0.04. Token owners rejoice every day through the new leaderboard for the top 50 entries, and the leaderboard winner wins $500 MUTM after only one transaction. Peer-to-Contract Pools In the MUTM network, Mutuum Finance has designed Peer-to-Contract pool solutions where users are required to contribute ETH and USDT to a joint pool, triggering an instant interest rate as other users borrow money from the pool. Depositors regard mtTokens as interest-bearing slips, which are redeemable for the originals and profits—a hassle-free process to outperform the stagnant holds of SHIB. With an industry hungry for reliability, such an investment option is the best crypto to buy today, providing appreciable APYs of between 5% and 10% for stable assets while meme currencies are taking a toll on the portfolios of invested parties. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Increases the At Mutuum Finance, fee proceeds are used for the open market purchase of tokens, after which they are re-distributed to mtToken stakers, thus creating a self-sustaining demand mechanism. In MUTM, the activity on the platform directly correlates to the positive aspect for owners, thus increasing prices as a result of enhanced activity, and not based on public sentiment as seen in the case of Shiba Inu. Stakers are able to reap these rewards through the passive harvesting process, increasing the stake level in the long run during the DeFi boom period. MUTM enters the marketplace as an altcoin designed for the long run, the crypto to buy right now based on promises of an explosive launch growth of up to 420% and additional profits from accruals. Security Audit Anchors Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) got a score of 90/100 from the reputable security scan platform Certik for the security of the token, ensuring the smart contracts are immune to the sideline exploit attack used on other small projects. A $50,000 bug-bounty program encourages hackers to scan the pre-launch efforts, providing a reward of up to $2,000 for reporting bugs and utilizing layers of security that go beyond audits. Its owners believe in the good practice of the framework, trusting MUTM as the best crypto to buy now for risk-free involvement in yields, which cannot be offered by the SHIB token. The hype for Shiba Inu takes a backseat during bearish trends, while the showcase role for the top cryptocurrency to buy goes to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where the combination of security and rewards makes for an attractive storyline for an altcoin to buy. Participants for phase 6 are given the opportunity today; MUTM costs $0.035.

The world of cryptocurrencies and traditional banking is increasingly converging, and at the forefront of this evolution is the remarkable Chainlink DvP Settlement . This innovative development signals a significant step forward in how international transactions are conducted, bringing unprecedented efficiency and security to cross-border payments. What is the Chainlink DvP Settlement and Why Does it Matter? Recently, Chainlink announced its pivotal role in facilitating a Delivery versus Payment (DvP) settlement between the Central Bank of Brazil and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. This isn’t just a technical achievement; it’s a testament to the power of blockchain technology in bridging traditional financial systems with decentralized networks. A DvP settlement ensures that the transfer of securities (like bonds or stocks) and the corresponding payment occur simultaneously. This critical mechanism eliminates counterparty risk, meaning neither party has to worry about sending their asset or payment without receiving the other. Chainlink’s involvement brings the robust security and transparency of its decentralized oracle networks to this essential process. Key participants in this landmark Chainlink DvP Settlement included: Standard Chartered Banco Inter The Global Shipping Business Network 7COMm These entities represent a diverse group, from established banks to innovative tech firms, highlighting the collaborative nature of this initiative and its broad impact. How Does Chainlink Enhance Global Financial Efficiency? The successful execution of this cross-border DvP settlement, powered by Chainlink, holds immense implications for the future of international trade and finance. It demonstrably shows how real-world assets can be tokenized and exchanged securely and efficiently across different jurisdictions. Furthermore, it paves the way for a more integrated and reliable global financial infrastructure. The benefits of such a system are clear and compelling: Reduced Risk: Simultaneous exchange minimizes the chance of one party defaulting, offering greater security. Increased Efficiency: Automated processes significantly speed up settlement times, potentially transforming days into mere minutes. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of all transactions. Lower Costs: Streamlined operations and reduced intermediaries can lead to substantial cost savings for financial institutions and their clients. This initiative helps simplify the complexities of cross-border payments. The Chainlink DvP Settlement acts as a secure conduit, ensuring that value moves seamlessly and safely across international borders. What’s the Connection to Brazil’s Digital Currency Project? This isn’t Chainlink’s first collaboration with the Central Bank of Brazil. As Bitcoin World previously reported in November 2024, the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) had launched the second phase of its Drex digital currency (CBDC) project, with Chainlink participating in the pilot. This prior collaboration laid crucial groundwork for the recent DvP success, demonstrating Chainlink’s consistent involvement in Brazil’s digital finance evolution. The Drex project aims to create a digital version of the Brazilian Real, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced financial services. Chainlink’s role in both the Drex pilot and this DvP settlement underscores its importance in connecting CBDCs and other digital assets with external data and off-chain systems. This connectivity is absolutely vital for the widespread adoption and utility of digital currencies, providing the necessary infrastructure for their real-world application. What Does This Chainlink DvP Settlement Mean for the Future? The success of the Brazil-Hong Kong Chainlink DvP Settlement serves as a powerful proof of concept. It illustrates the immense potential for decentralized oracle networks to facilitate complex financial operations on a truly global scale. Consequently, we can anticipate more central banks and financial institutions exploring similar solutions to modernize their payment systems. This development is not just about payments; it’s about building a programmable financial system where smart contracts can execute agreements automatically and reliably. Chainlink’s secure data feeds and interoperability solutions are key enablers for this future, allowing various blockchain networks and traditional systems to communicate seamlessly and securely. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, the demand for robust, secure, and interoperable infrastructure will only grow. The Chainlink DvP Settlement exemplifies how innovation can drive real-world utility and reshape the very foundations of global commerce. A Glimpse into Tomorrow’s Global Finance In conclusion, the successful Chainlink DvP Settlement between Brazil and Hong Kong is a landmark achievement. It showcases the transformative power of decentralized oracle networks in creating a more efficient, secure, and transparent global financial system. By reducing risks and increasing speed, Chainlink is not just supporting transactions; it’s actively shaping the future of cross-border finance. This is a clear indicator of how blockchain technology, specifically Chainlink’s capabilities, is moving from theoretical potential to practical, impactful applications that benefit everyone involved.

Prices dipped to a 24-hour low of $103,938 after earlier trading above $109,000, and gauges of market mood turned sharply negative as investors reassessed risk. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Be This Week’s Big Story As Saylor Teases Fresh Buy Crypto Fear Hits Extreme Readings According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, the score fell to 21 out of 100 on Tuesday, a move that registers as “Extreme Fear.” That mark is the lowest in nearly seven months; the index previously hit 18 out of 100 on April 9, when markets reacted to US President Donald Trump’s global tariff measures. Reports have disclosed that the index has been swinging between calm and alarm since the large sell-off in early October, when readings tumbled after prices slid from a peak above $126,000 on Oct. 6. Market participants pointed to a mix of weak institutional flows and macro worries. Based on reports, Bitcoin-tied exchange-traded funds recorded net outflows of nearly $800 million last week. Analysts said institutional buying recently fell below the amount of newly mined Bitcoin for the first time in seven months. Those trends reduce the steady inflows that had helped support prices. Price Action & Short-Term Drivers Bitcoin recovered above $104,100 after the low, but the sharp intraday swing highlighted fragility. Some traders blamed cooling activity on exchanges and wallets, while others flagged concerns about the Federal Reserve’s stance. The Fed cut interest rates for the second time this year on Wednesday, yet signaled there may not be more cuts in 2025. That hint of a less-accommodating outlook appeared to catch investors off guard, prompting quick re-pricing in both stock and crypto markets. There are also technical points at play. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index last fell into the “Extreme Fear” zone on Oct. 21 when it hit 25 out of 100, after Bitcoin slid from over $110,000 to below $108,000. Earlier, the index had topped 70 — a “Greed” reading — showing how fast sentiment can flip when price moves accelerate.

Based on reports, lower blockchain activity and fewer large buys by institutions have been cited as immediate reasons for the decline. If inflows return, they could stabilize the market. If outflows continue, the pressure may deepen. Market bulls, however, still point to seasonal history. According to historical patterns cited by some analysts, November has often been a strong month for Bitcoin, with average gains above 40% in past years.

The clarification comes after days of social media speculation linking the market maker to potential litigation over auto-deleveraging executions during the October 10-11 flash crash that liquidated $19 billion in positions and briefly erased $600 billion from the crypto market cap. literally nothing changed since this tweet and we never had plans to sue binance, nor see any reason to do it in future I should probably ask to make a note of all the people spreading baseless rumors, but most of people believing these have goldfish memory capacity, so I wont https://t.co/0oHShby0Uk — wishful_cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) November 3, 2025 Gaevoy labeled the rumors as “ larp ” when directly asked whether he had signed a non-disclosure agreement with Binance or coordinated with other market makers to pursue joint legal action. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao amplified the denial by quote-tweeting Gaevoy’s post, writing, “ If someone made you believe otherwise, it’s time to click unfollow. “ October Crash Stir ADL Controversy The October 10 selloff was triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports , creating panic across global markets. Bitcoin plummeted to $104,782 during the 48-hour period, while Ethereum and major altcoins lost between 15% and 20% of their value. Binance’s trading infrastructure buckled under the strain, with API failures returning HTTP 503 errors and Reduce-Only orders being rejected during peak volatility. The exchange’s Auto-Deleveraging mechanism was activated, resulting in short liquidations at prices up to five times the prevailing market rates. Binance spent $188 million from its insurance fund and issued $283 million in refunds for oracle-related depegs , though ADL losses were excluded from compensation. Gaevoy had previously stated in a video that Wintermute was “ ADL’d at completely ridiculous prices ” and mentioned that the firm was evaluating legal options. These remarks fueled speculation about the lawsuit. Wintermute CEO @EvgenyGaevoy on how they got ADL’d on Binance and predicts lawsuits and challenges from trading firms. pic.twitter.com/d2hGXoOOHc — cryptotesters (@cryptotesters) October 20, 2025 On-chain analysis of Wintermute’s 10 tracked wallets across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Solana revealed a 12% decline in the portfolio, dropping from $637 million to $572 million. No large withdrawals exceeding $10 million or liquidation patterns involving Aave or Compound were detected; however, a single 1,000 BTC inflow worth approximately $61 million occurred on October 4, just days before the crash. Market Structure Under Scrutiny The October event exposed structural vulnerabilities in crypto derivatives markets, where notional liquidation figures vastly overstate actual capital losses. Speaking with Cryptonews, Sam Seo, chairman of the Kaia DLT Foundation, said the actual capital lost by traders is likely “ in the range of 5% to 15% of the headline number, ” translating to between $950 million and $2.85 billion in real losses. He warned that “ the remaining 85-95% was simply phantom leverage, synthetic exposure that was rapidly unwound. “ Most people on Crypto Twitter freaked out over the $19B in liquidations. But real trader losses are far smaller than that, may be only 15% of the total figure. #CryptoCrash #Liquidations #BTC https://t.co/d0IJDFeaNC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 17, 2025 Bitcoin futures open interest collapsed by more than 30% during the selloff, erasing over $10 billion in notional positions in one of the largest single-day declines on record, comparable to the May 2021 liquidation and the FTX unwind in 2022. Patrick Heusser, head of lending and TradFi at Sentora, also explained that “ liquidations [are] a speedometer for deleveraging intensity, not a profit and loss statement, ” noting that exchanges settle these events using margin and insurance funds. Despite the chaos, Bitcoin recovered to $114,000 by October 13, supported by $420 million in spot ETF inflows that helped stabilize prices. ‘Uptober’ Turns Red for First Time Since 2018 According to Reuters , October marked Bitcoin’s first monthly loss since 2018, snapping a seven-year winning streak and ending nearly 5% lower for the month despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 just days before the crash. The reversal came as broader risk appetite weakened, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pushing back against market expectations for continued rate cuts and a government shutdown blocking crucial economic data. Analyst Scott Melker has earlier called Bitcoin’s resilience “ a small miracle ” after the liquidation , stating “ I don’t think we’re entering a bear market ” and noting “ this isn’t 2017. Nor is it 2021. What happened last week was purely structural. “ Bitcoin opened November trading at $106,961 , down 0.7% as whale profit-taking and continued ETF outflows pressured prices below $107,000. For the first time in seven months, institutional demand has fallen below the pace of new coin issuance, indicating that large buyers are stepping back. Source: X/@caprioleio Markets now price a roughly 70% chance of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in December, down from 94% a week earlier, as policymakers deliver mixed signals on growth and inflation. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic that November could restore typical seasonal strength, as Bitcoin has historically averaged returns exceeding 40% during the month. Speaking with Cryptonews, MEXC Research Chief Analyst Shawn Young noted that “ accumulation of coins by major market participants, the trade agreement between Washington and Beijing, and moderately positive stock market performance are paving the way for a possible recovery in November. “ VALR CEO Farzam Ehsani also warned that the market structure remains fragile, stating, “ any change in the Fed’s tone or a new round of geopolitical tension could dramatically shift the balance of power, ” keeping Bitcoin likely range-bound between $107,000 and $113,000 as participants await clearer macro signals.

Speaking at an investment conference in Hong Kong, the chief executives of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said they expect markets to pull back at some point soon, though they emphasized such drops are a regular part of investing. Stock markets across the globe have been climbing higher throughout this year. Investors have been excited about artificial intelligence technology and hoped central banks would lower interest rates. In recent weeks, major American stock indexes have reached all-time highs. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and South Korea’s Kospi have also set new records. In China, the Shanghai Composite has climbed to its best level in ten years, helped by improving relations between Washington and Beijing and a weaker U.S. dollar. David Solomon, who leads Goldman Sachs, told attendees at the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit that markets will probably fall between 10 to 20% sometime in the next 12 to 24 months. “Things run, and then they pull back so people can reassess,” Solomon said as quoted by CNBC. Not a cause for alarm, executives say But Solomon made clear that such drops should not worry long-term investors. He said Goldman Sachs continues to tell its clients to keep their money in the market and review how their investments are spread out, rather than trying to guess when prices will rise or fall. “A 10 to 15% drawdown happens often, even through positive market cycles,” he explained . “It’s not something that changes your fundamental, your structural belief as to how you want to allocate capital.” Ted Pick, the head of Morgan Stanley, shared similar thoughts during the same discussion. He said investors should actually see temporary declines as a good thing, not a warning sign of trouble ahead. “We should also welcome the possibility that there would be drawdowns, 10 to 15% drawdowns that are not driven by some sort of macro cliff effect,” Pick said. The two executives are not alone in their concerns. The International Monetary Fund recently warned that markets could experience a sudden sharp drop . Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have also raised concerns about stock prices being too high. Asian markets show promise Despite these warnings about a possible pullback, both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley see good opportunities in Asian markets over the coming years. They pointed to recent positive changes, including the trade agreement between the United States and China. Solomon said Goldman Sachs believes investors worldwide will keep putting money into China, calling it one of the “largest and most important economies” globally. Pick said Morgan Stanley feels positive about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India because each has its own unique story of economic growth. He specifically mentioned Japan’s efforts to improve how companies are run and India’s major spending on infrastructure as investment opportunities that could play out over several years. “It’s hard not to be excited about Hong Kong, China, Japan and India — three vastly different narratives, but all part of a global Asia story,” Pick said. He particularly highlighted China’s artificial intelligence, electric vehicle and biotechnology industries as areas worth watching. As reported by Cryptopolitan Southeast Asian markets are also drawing increased attention from global investors looking for alternatives as trade dynamics shift worldwide.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-investors-choose-your-targets-wisely-heres-why/,"Crypto market analyst Egrag Crypto has released a detailed chart analysis emphasizing a pivotal moment for XRP’s price structure. His latest projection, based on long-term technical patterns, outlines potential price targets ranging from conservative to highly optimistic levels, while identifying $2.08 as a key threshold that could determine the next market direction. #XRP – Choose Your Targets Wisely : When it comes to #XRP , let’s keep it simple and real, As long as price doesn’t close below $2.08, every other indicator out there is lying or lagging. Price Action is the ultimate truth-teller: True technical analysts know one fact… pic.twitter.com/ST6dKfOzjt — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) November 2, 2025 Focus on Price Action and Market Structure Egrag’s analysis, presented through a “W-pattern” framework, underscores the idea that price movement itself is the most reliable signal in technical analysis. He argues that as long as XRP’s price does not close below $2.08, broader market indicators or oscillators should not dictate sentiment. According to the chart, this price acts as the compression point within the asset’s multi-year structure, suggesting it could serve as a technical foundation for the next potential rally. The visual shows a long-term formation resembling a double-bottom or “W10” pattern, with XRP consolidating around its neckline. From this base, Egrag outlines three potential scenarios: a conservative target near $13, an average projection around $22, and an optimistic scenario extending to approximately $35.21. These projections appear to derive from measured moves calculated from historical trend symmetry and structural breakout potential.

Bitcoin Slips Below $107K as ETF Outflows and Whale Selling Pressure Market Bitcoin dropped 2% in early Asian trading, sliding below $107,000 amid continued ETF outflows and profit-taking by large holders. The move extended the market’s cautious tone from late October’s $19 billion washout, with traders viewing the pullback as consolidation after a volatile stretch. On-chain data shows institutional accumulation has slowed, with inflows falling below new Bitcoin issuance for the first time in seven months, according to Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards. The shift reflects a broader risk-off tone as equities advanced, led by tech gains and Amazon’s OpenAI deal, while the dollar strengthened on reduced expectations for rapid US rate cuts. Won't lie, this was the main metric keeping me bullish the last months while every other asset outperformed Bitcoin. The trend could flip tomorrow, next week, or in 2 years. But right now we have 188 treasury companies carrying heavy bags with no business model and a lot less… https://t.co/ECTv3Klbmf — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) November 3, 2025 Analysts say October’s correction flushed out excessive leverage, leaving the market in a rebuilding phase. SynFutures CEO Rachel Lin noted that long-term holders remain steady and exchange outflows persist, which is typically a positive sign. For now, the market is expected to trade sideways as traders watch ETF flows and Fed signals, with a softer inflation print potentially reigniting buying momentum later this month. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,370, down 2.04% on the day.

BTC is currently fluctuating between $104,000 and $106,000, a range that suggests consolidation following recent sell pressure. A decisive move above $106,500 could pave the way for a rebound toward $109,000 and $112,000, where prior resistance has capped gains. On the downside, a break below $103,500 could expose the market to deeper losses, with the next notable support seen around $101,000–$100,000, a key psychological zone watched by traders. Meanwhile, Ethereum trades at $3,477, down 3.48% over the past 24 hours. The coin has weakened after repeatedly failing to hold above $3,700, suggesting sellers remain in control. If ETH reclaims $3,550, it may attempt a rebound toward $3,750–$3,900. However, a drop below $3,450 could open the door to a sharper correction toward $3,300–$3,250, where stronger buying support previously emerged. Meanwhile, market sentiment has turned sharply bearish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropping to 27 , signaling “Fear.” The index stood at 36 yesterday, 42 last week, and 59 a month ago, reflecting a consistent erosion in investor confidence as crypto prices continue to fall. The steep decline underscores the market’s growing caution, with traders reducing exposure amid volatile price action and fading risk appetite. The US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $186.5 million in outflows on November 3, signaling renewed selling pressure across institutional products, according to data from SoSoValue. The cumulative total net inflow now stands at $61.0 billion, with combined net assets valued at $143.5 billion, accounting for 6.75% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization.

Among individual issuers, BlackRock’s IBIT led the outflows with $186.5 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB posted no new inflows. Despite the pullback, BlackRock’s fund remains dominant with $85.3 billion in total assets, followed by Fidelity’s $21.8 billion and Grayscale’s $18.2 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $135.76 million in outflows on November 3. Among the nine listed ETFs, BlackRock’s ETHA recorded the largest outflow of $81.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $25.1 million, and Grayscale’s ETHE with $15 million. Other issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares, also reported smaller redemptions as institutional sentiment cooled alongside Ethereum’s market pullback. The total cumulative net inflow now stands at $14.23 billion, while total net assets dropped to $24.02 billion, representing 5.55% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Daily trading volume across all funds reached $2.51 billion, reflecting high turnover amid declining prices. In contrast, spot Solana ETFs saw $70.05 million in net inflows on November 3, marking their fourth consecutive day of positive flows, according to data from SoSoValue. The total cumulative net inflow now stands at $269.26 million, with total net assets reaching $513.35 million, representing 0.57% of Solana’s market capitalization. Total trading value for the day amounted to $67.59 million. Among the two listed ETFs, Bitwise’s BSOL dominated with $65.16 million in inflows, while Grayscale’s GSOL added $4.9 million.

This transformation is highlighted by a monumental $9.7 billion, five-year contract with Microsoft, a deal that not only underscores the tech giant’s aggressive pursuit of AI dominance but also showcases the lucrative pivot for companies like IREN. This article delves into the intricacies of this landmark agreement, its implications for the AI landscape, and what it means for the future of cloud computing. The Strategic Alliance: Microsoft’s Quest for Enhanced AI Compute Microsoft is leaving no stone unturned in its quest to secure more compute capacity for meeting its customers’ heavy demand for AI services. The Redmond-based tech giant recently signed a substantial $9.7 billion, five-year contract with Australia’s IREN, formally known as Iris Energy, to secure further AI cloud capacity . This strategic partnership is a clear indication of the escalating competition among tech behemoths to establish a dominant position in the artificial intelligence sector. The deal will give Microsoft access to compute infrastructure built with Nvidia’s cutting-edge GB300 GPUs, which will be deployed over phases through 2026 at IREN’s facility in Childress, Texas. This facility is planned to support an impressive 750 megawatts of capacity, signifying a massive undertaking to power the next generation of AI applications. This massive investment highlights several key aspects of Microsoft’s strategy: Meeting Surging Demand: The insatiable demand for generative AI, large language models, and complex AI workloads requires an unprecedented amount of computational power.

Leveraging Existing Assets: IREN already possessed the core assets – large-scale data centers and a significant fleet of GPUs – making the pivot more efficient than starting from scratch. Strategic Market Positioning: By aligning with the explosive growth of AI, IREN positioned itself in a market with immense demand and less direct competition than the saturated crypto mining space. IREN’s CEO, Daniel Roberts, expects the Microsoft deal to take up only 10% of the company’s total capacity and generate about $1.94 billion in annualized revenue, as reported by Bloomberg. This indicates the sheer scale of IREN’s operations and the immense potential for further growth in the AI infrastructure market. The Power of Nvidia GPUs: Fueling Microsoft AI Ambitions At the heart of this deal are the state-of-the-art Nvidia GPUs , specifically the GB300 series. IREN said it is separately buying GPUs and equipment from Dell for about $5.8 billion to fulfill the requirements of this contract. This investment underscores the critical role Nvidia’s hardware plays in powering advanced AI applications. The GB300 NVL72 systems are optimized for reasoning models, agentic AI systems, and multi-modal generative AI, making them ideal for Microsoft’s ambitious AI projects. Microsoft’s commitment to Nvidia’s latest technology is not new. Just last month, the company launched its first production cluster with Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 systems for Azure. This continuous integration of cutting-edge hardware is vital for Microsoft to maintain its competitive edge in the fast-paced AI market. The capabilities of these GPUs enable: Faster Training Times: Significantly reducing the time required to train complex AI models. Enhanced Inference Performance: Delivering quicker and more accurate responses from deployed AI systems. Scalability: Allowing Microsoft to scale its AI services to meet the growing demands of its global customer base. The collaboration between Microsoft, IREN, and Nvidia forms a powerful ecosystem designed to accelerate AI innovation and deployment on a grand scale. Microsoft AI: A Glimpse into the Broader Strategy and Competition This IREN deal is not an isolated event but rather a piece of a larger, aggressive strategy by Microsoft to dominate the Microsoft AI landscape. The company is actively forging partnerships and making substantial investments to secure the necessary compute resources. Last month, for instance, Microsoft signed a deal with Nscale for approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S. These deals collectively paint a picture of a company relentlessly building out its AI infrastructure to support its diverse range of AI products and services, from Azure AI to Copilot. The competitive landscape for AI compute capacity is intense, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Meta also investing heavily in their own AI infrastructure. Companies like CoreWeave, which also started as a bitcoin-mining operation before pivoting to AI, highlight a growing trend of specialized providers emerging to meet this demand. Microsoft’s strategy appears to be a multi-pronged approach: Internal Development: Continuing to innovate within Azure and its own data centers. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with firms like IREN and Nscale to rapidly expand capacity. Hardware Investments: Directly procuring the latest and most powerful GPUs from Nvidia and other vendors. This comprehensive approach ensures Microsoft remains a formidable player in the global AI race, providing its customers with the most advanced and scalable AI solutions.

The recent decline is tied to increased selling activity from whale wallets and shifts in broader market behavior. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.26. The 24-hour trading volume sits at $6.42 billion. The token has lost 13% over the last seven days and is down 6% in the past 24 hours. Whales Reduce Exposure as Price Falls Whale addresses holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP have been reducing their holdings recently, according to analyst Ali Martinez. 900,000 $XRP sold by whales in just 5 days! pic.twitter.com/28404KMy24 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 3, 2025 This activity took place during a period of sharp price decline for XRP. Charts show the asset falling from above $3.00 to the $2.40 range during this time. Similar behavior was observed in the weeks leading up to the drop, as noted by reports from CryptoPotato . Moreover, data from CryptoQuant shows that transfers of XRP from large wallets to exchanges have dropped off since the end of October. Notable spikes in activity were recorded on October 10, 16, and 25. After those dates, flows fell and stayed low. Source: CryptoQuant The 30-day average of these transfers has also trended downward, pointing to reduced sell-side pressure. While XRP’s price moved from over $2.90 to $2.30 during this period, the recent slowdown in exchange inflows may help ease further declines — if demand holds steady. Technical Setup Shows Volatility Crypto analyst CryptoWZRD reported that both XRP/USD and XRP/BTC closed bearish recently, following an increase in Bitcoin dominance. “ XRP and XRPBTC both retested their support territory ,” the analyst said, noting that the outlook depends on how Bitcoin dominance moves going forward. In addition, the intraday chart showed strong volatility, with the price bouncing in a narrow range. Another analyst, CW, noted that XRP is currently supported by a buying wall but warned: “Two selling walls exist until $2.57.” As previously reported , the current pattern may be part of a broader five-wave move, with the final leg possibly targeting the $2.00 zone. Away from price movement, Ripple has announced the launch of a digital asset spot prime brokerage service in the US. This platform allows institutional clients to execute over-the-counter spot transactions for a range of digital assets, including XRP and the RLUSD stablecoin. Furthermore, Ripple recently acquired Palisade, expanding its custody services beyond banks to include fintechs, corporates, and crypto-native firms.

What Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/has-btc-topped-for-this-cycle-what-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now/,"Bitcoin has slipped back under $110,000 just weeks after setting new all-time highs near $125,700, and that has shaken many late buyers. ETF flows have flipped from strong inflows to choppy weeks with patches of outflows, so the big question now is simple but brutal. Is the current Bitcoin price prediction still pointing to $135,000 to $150,000, or did the market already print the top for this cycle and quietly ring the bell without telling anyone? If upside from here is smaller and slower, then what is the best crypto to buy now? Many desks are quietly reviewing early payment-focused DeFi project names, and Remittix is already on that shortlist because it has a live wallet from Q3 and real cross-border payment rails in testing. Bitcoin price prediction: has the cycle already peaked? At the moment, BTC trades around $108,000 after a sharp move down from the record zone above $125,700. One group of analysts believes the market already topped near $126,000 and that a fresh bear phase has started as the halving effect fades and macro conditions tighten. In this view, any Bitcoin price prediction that still points far above the old high is seen as stale optimism rather than a realistic road map. The opposing camp leans on updated Bitcoin price prediction frameworks that combine Elliott wave structures with ETF flow and liquidity data. Their models still flag a possible final peak between $135,000 and $140,000 by late 2025 as long as BTC holds above the 50-week EMA that sits close to $100,000. For these analysts, a wide range between $100,000 and $120,000 is simply a cooling zone before one last attack on higher levels. In every version of that bullish script, ETF inflows and global liquidity remain the fuel for any aggressive Bitcoin price prediction from here. Remittix: the payment rail altcoin investors will hate to miss Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the one project many analysts do not want to ignore when they talk about the best crypto to buy now. While Bitcoin wrestles with the question of whether $126,000 was the top, RTX is building the rails that turn crypto into money in bank accounts across more than 30 countries. The PayFi model targets freelancers, remote workers, and families who want fast settlement, fair FX, and a simple wallet rather than another trading screen. The numbers already show how quickly this story is tightening. Investors can still access RTX at $0.1166, even though more than 683 million tokens are already allocated, and the raise has passed $27.9 million with over 40,000 buyers involved. The project secured a BitMart listing once it crossed the $20 million mark and confirmed LBANK after the $22 million milestone, with another major centralized exchange in the pipeline. Why Remittix is gaining traction RTX focuses on real crypto to bank payouts for workers and families instead of short term trading hype. The live wallet gives users a simple way to test low friction payments and FX conversion right now. The PayFi design aims to keep costs competitive with local remittance services and typical low gas fee crypto options. Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBANK position RTX in front of a global audience ahead of the next market wave. If this Bitcoin cycle delivers only a modest new high, many investors will look back and regret ignoring a payment-focused asset that was still available near $0.1166 while the foundations were already in place. Right now, the market still argues about every new Bitcoin price prediction, but for those searching for the best crypto to buy now with real-world demand behind it, Remittix looks like the rare opportunity that will not stay early for long.

We’re talking about a significant milestone: the Bitcoin hashrate reaching an astonishing all-time high. This isn’t just a technical detail; it speaks volumes about the network’s health and future. What is the Bitcoin Hashrate and Why Does it Matter? The Bitcoin hashrate is essentially a measure of the total computational power being used to mine and process transactions on the Bitcoin network. Think of it as the collective “muscle” of all the mining equipment working together. A higher hashrate means: Increased Security: More power makes the network harder to attack. Greater Decentralization: Often indicates more participants contributing. Stronger Network Health: A sign of robust and growing interest in Bitcoin mining. When the Bitcoin hashrate hits a new record, it’s a strong indicator of the network’s resilience and ongoing expansion. October’s Astounding Bitcoin Hashrate Surge According to a recent JPMorgan report, which was cited by CoinDesk, the average Bitcoin hashrate soared to an incredible 1,082 exahashes per second (EH/s) in October. This marked a substantial 5% increase compared to the previous month. Such a surge demonstrates the continued investment and commitment within the Bitcoin mining sector. This achievement is particularly noteworthy because it happened amidst fluctuating market conditions, underscoring the long-term confidence miners have in Bitcoin. The consistent growth in Bitcoin hashrate shows that despite various challenges, the network continues to attract significant computational power. How Did This Impact Miners and the AI Pivot? While the overall network health improved, the increased competition from a higher Bitcoin hashrate did have an effect on individual miners. The JPMorgan report indicated that daily block rewards for miners averaged $48,000 per EH/s, which was a 3% decrease from the prior month. This shows the dynamic interplay between network growth and individual profitability. Interestingly, publicly listed U.S. mining firms saw their combined market capitalization jump by an impressive 25% in just one month, reaching approximately $70 billion. JPMorgan linked this growth to market expectations surrounding these companies’ strategic pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI). This suggests a fascinating evolution within the mining industry: Diversification: Miners are exploring new revenue streams beyond just Bitcoin block rewards. Technological Adaptation: Leveraging powerful computing infrastructure for other high-demand applications like AI. Future-Proofing: A move to enhance long-term viability and investor appeal. This shift highlights a forward-thinking approach, where the infrastructure built for mining the Bitcoin hashrate can be repurposed or augmented for other computationally intensive tasks. What’s Next for Bitcoin Hashrate and Mining? The continuous rise of the Bitcoin hashrate suggests a robust and expanding network. This trend is likely to continue as more efficient mining hardware becomes available and global interest in Bitcoin grows. However, miners will need to remain agile, especially concerning energy costs and technological advancements. The pivot to AI by some mining firms also opens up new avenues for growth and investment. It could lead to more diversified business models, making these companies less solely dependent on Bitcoin price fluctuations. As the industry matures, we can expect further innovations and adaptations. In conclusion, October’s record-breaking Bitcoin hashrate is a powerful testament to the network’s strength and security. While it brings challenges for individual miner profitability, it also showcases the innovative spirit of the mining industry, particularly with the strategic move towards AI. This ongoing evolution ensures Bitcoin remains a secure and dynamic digital asset for the future. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin Hashrate Q: What does an “all-time high” Bitcoin hashrate signify? A: An all-time high Bitcoin hashrate indicates that the network is more secure and robust than ever before. It means more computational power is dedicated to processing transactions and securing the blockchain, making it significantly harder for malicious actors to attack. Q: How does the Bitcoin hashrate impact Bitcoin’s price? A: While not a direct cause-and-effect, a rising Bitcoin hashrate is generally seen as a positive indicator of network health and miner confidence, which can indirectly contribute to positive market sentiment and potentially influence price over the long term. Q: What is an EH/s? A: EH/s stands for Exahashes per second. It’s a unit of measurement for the computational power of the Bitcoin network. One exahash is equal to one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hashes per second, demonstrating the immense scale of Bitcoin mining operations. Q: Why are mining firms pivoting to AI? A: Mining firms possess vast amounts of high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. This infrastructure, initially used for calculating the Bitcoin hashrate , can be repurposed or augmented to perform other computationally intensive tasks, such as training artificial intelligence models. This pivot offers diversification and new revenue streams, especially as the demand for AI computing power grows. Q: Does a higher hashrate mean more Bitcoin is being mined? A: No, a higher Bitcoin hashrate does not mean more Bitcoin is being mined in total. Bitcoin’s supply schedule is fixed, with a block reward halving approximately every four years. A higher hashrate means more competition among miners to earn those fixed block rewards. Was this deep dive into the astonishing Bitcoin hashrate surge insightful?

The global exchange has confirmed the upcoming listing of KITE perpetual futures , an exciting development for traders worldwide. This new contract is scheduled to go live at 1:00 p.m. UTC on November 3rd, promising up to 25x leverage. This move opens up fresh avenues for market participants, allowing them to engage with the KITE asset in a dynamic and potentially highly profitable manner. However, it also introduces complexities that require careful consideration. Let’s delve into what this listing entails and how traders can best prepare. What Are KITE Perpetual Futures and Why Should Traders Care? Firstly, it’s crucial to understand what KITE perpetual futures are. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This means traders can hold their positions indefinitely, as long as they maintain sufficient margin. This flexibility is a major draw for many. Moreover, the offering of up to 25x leverage significantly amplifies potential gains. Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For instance, with 25x leverage, a trader can open a $2,500 position with just $100. This can be a game-changer for those looking to maximize their exposure to KITE’s price movements. Key benefits of this new listing include: Enhanced Market Access: Provides a new way to trade KITE without owning the underlying asset directly. Flexibility: No expiry date means more strategic holding options. Capital Efficiency: Leverage allows for significant positions with less capital outlay. Navigating the Dynamics of KITE Perpetual Futures Trading While the prospect of 25x leverage is appealing, it’s vital to approach KITE perpetual futures trading with a clear understanding of the associated risks. High leverage can amplify losses just as quickly as it can magnify gains, leading to potential liquidations if the market moves against your position. Binance’s robust trading platform provides the infrastructure, but traders must exercise discipline. Understanding margin requirements, funding rates, and liquidation prices is paramount. Funding rates, in particular, are unique to perpetual futures and ensure the contract price stays close to the spot price. These periodic payments can either be received or paid by traders, depending on the market’s sentiment. Consider these points when engaging with KITE perpetual futures : Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential downside. Position Sizing: Start with smaller positions, especially when new to leveraged trading. Market Volatility: Be prepared for rapid price swings in the crypto market. Strategies for Approaching KITE Perpetual Futures on Binance To successfully trade KITE perpetual futures , a well-defined strategy is essential. Firstly, conduct thorough research on the KITE project itself. Understanding its fundamentals, use cases, and market sentiment will provide valuable insights into its potential price action. Secondly, never trade without a plan. Define your entry and exit points, set realistic profit targets, and always account for potential losses. Utilizing technical analysis tools can help identify trends and crucial support/resistance levels. Moreover, consider starting with a lower leverage ratio, even if 25x is available, until you gain more experience. Ultimately, patience and continuous learning are your best allies in this fast-paced environment. The launch of KITE perpetual futures offers a significant opportunity, but it demands respect for the market’s inherent volatility. Conclusion: A New Chapter for KITE Traders The listing of KITE perpetual futures on Binance marks an exciting new chapter for traders interested in the KITE asset. With the potential for substantial gains through 25x leverage, it offers a compelling avenue for engaging with the crypto market. However, success in this arena hinges on a disciplined approach, robust risk management, and continuous education. As November 3rd approaches, prepare your strategies, understand the mechanics, and approach this new trading opportunity with both enthusiasm and caution. The world of crypto derivatives is dynamic, and being well-informed is your greatest asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are KITE perpetual futures? KITE perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of KITE without an expiry date, offering continuous trading opportunities. What does 25x leverage mean for KITE perpetual futures? 25x leverage means you can control a trading position 25 times larger than your initial capital. For example, with $100, you can open a $2,500 position, amplifying both potential profits and losses. When will KITE perpetual futures be available on Binance? Binance is scheduled to list KITE perpetual futures at 1:00 p.m. UTC on November 3rd. Is trading KITE perpetual futures risky? Yes, trading KITE perpetual futures, especially with high leverage, carries significant risk. While it can amplify gains, it can also lead to rapid losses and potential liquidation of your position if the market moves unfavorably. How can I prepare to trade KITE perpetual futures? Prepare by understanding perpetual futures mechanics, practicing risk management (e.g., stop-loss orders), researching the KITE project, and starting with smaller position sizes.

The surge places XRP ahead of SEI and Zama, which followed closely with 244.58K and 243.03K, respectively, signaling renewed investor confidence in Ripple’s native token amid increasing institutional interest and blockchain adoption. Notably, this bullish shift stems from clearer regulatory standing for Ripple, the strong performance of its RLUSD stablecoin, and surging activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Investor sentiment, gauged through social volume, engagement, and market positioning, offers a snapshot of collective confidence and price momentum. XRP’s lead on the sentiment charts signals not only strong retail enthusiasm but also rising institutional interest in digital assets with real-world utility. Therefore, XRP’s sentiment surge signals growing market recognition of its resilience and expanding ecosystem. Unlike hype-driven rallies, this rise reflects real adoption and utility. Meanwhile, SEI and Zama’s strong standings reflect the broader diversification of investor interest within the crypto market. SEI, known for its high-speed layer-1 architecture, continues to gain traction among DeFi developers. Zama, on the other hand, has seen a rise in attention due to its innovations in homomorphic encryption, signaling that blockchain investors are increasingly valuing technology-driven narratives. If the sentiment trend holds, XRP could be on the verge of a stronger market breakout, positioning it as one of the standout performers in the next phase of the crypto cycle. Japan Approves Eight Non-Financial Companies to Hold XRP According to Japanese market commentator Yuto, Japan has approved eight non-financial companies to include XRP among their cryptocurrency holdings, signaling another milestone in the nation’s progressive approach to digital assets. While the timing of when each company will begin holding XRP remains at their discretion, the approval itself underscores Japan’s growing confidence in Ripple’s technology and the broader digital asset economy. This move comes at a time when institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is accelerating globally. Japan has long stood out as one of the most crypto-friendly nations, with clear regulatory frameworks that encourage responsible innovation. The Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan’s primary financial regulator, has consistently taken a proactive stance in defining digital asset classifications and establishing guidelines for their use by corporations and investors alike. By approving non-financial companies in sectors like tech, retail, and manufacturing to hold XRP, Japan is accelerating mainstream crypto adoption beyond the financial sphere. This move expands XRP’s real-world utility across cross-border payments, treasury operations, and tokenized asset systems, while underscoring Ripple’s growing credibility and enterprise relevance in one of the world’s most tightly regulated markets. Analysts predict Japan’s move could spark a ripple effect across Asia’s corporate sector. As more businesses adopt digital assets, XRP’s deep integration within Japan’s financial ecosystem, strengthened by Ripple’s long-standing partnership with SBI Holdings, positions it for accelerated real-world adoption. With SBI already leveraging XRP for cross-border payments, its acceptance among non-financial firms could further cement the token’s role in mainstream finance. Although each of the eight firms will time their XRP entry based on internal strategies and market conditions, the collective approval underscores rising institutional confidence in XRP’s long-term value. The move boosts Ripple’s presence in Japan’s dynamic crypto market and reinforces XRP’s role as a trusted bridge between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. Conclusion XRP’s dominance in market sentiment highlights a strong revival of investor confidence and network relevance. Backed by a growing ecosystem, institutional adoption, and favorable regulatory progress, XRP is reclaiming its role as a leader in utility-driven blockchain innovation. While short-term volatility remains, the prevailing optimism reflects genuine faith in its long-term potential. As sentiment builds and adoption accelerates, XRP may be positioning itself for the next major breakout in the evolving crypto landscape. Meanwhile, Japan’s greenlight for eight non-financial firms to hold XRP marks a milestone in corporate crypto adoption. It underscores regulatory maturity and growing confidence in Ripple as a bridge between traditional finance and digital innovation, potentially sparking wider institutional adoption across Asia and beyond.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-04 09:45:23

The FTX Recovery Trust filed a formal notice of withdrawal with the Delaware bankruptcy court, reversing a proposal that had sparked strong opposition from creditor groups, particularly in China, which accounted for the majority of the affected claims. FTX changes its plan for bankruptcy after pressure from international creditors FTX initially requested a U.S. court to approve a “Restricted Jurisdiction Procedure” to determine the countries where local laws and government restrictions make it difficult to compensate users . The company aimed to simplify the repayment process, but instead, customers became angry when they discovered they would lose everything simply because of their location. The plan was to hire lawyers in each of the 49 countries to check if the repayment process was legal. Users in these regions would automatically lose their repayment right if the lawyer found out that the process broke local laws, and their money would be distributed among other creditors. International customers said the plan was unfair and discriminatory because users had already suffered big losses and should not be punished further just because of legal or political issues in their countries. Weiwei Ji, an investor based in Singapore, led 300 Chinese claimants and filed an official objection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. He said FTX had no solid reason to include China in the list of restricted countries and that if the court approved the plan, other big companies would start denying customers payments simply based on geography. FTX withdrew the motion after facing a lot of backlash, and many creditors are happy because customers will now get the money they deserve. Creditors welcome the reversal of bankruptcy as FTX focuses on repayment and appeal Many customers were pleased and said it felt like FTX was finally addressing their concerns. It also showed that the company wants to reduce new legal fights because if their plea was approved, customers would rise up again to fight it in court. Similarly, many creditors said they felt left out because most of the discussions and court actions took place in the United States, but after FTX reversed its plan, they now feel included. They also hope this step will speed up future decisions about how much money they can collect from the remaining assets. The founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, will attend his appeal hearing in New York to challenge his conviction for fraud. He continues to defend himself and says FTX and its trading firm, Alameda Research, were not insolvent when the company collapsed in 2022. The founder explains that his company had more than enough assets to survive the crisis, but bankruptcy lawyers exaggerated its financial problems and shut down the firm too quickly. The lawyers also sold valuable assets for far less than they were worth, and this made the situation that FTX was in look worse than it really was. Some of Bankman-Fried’s supporters say poor management was the reason the company collapsed in the first place, but legal experts and former employees disagree. They say billions of dollars in customer funds went missing, and records showed large amounts of money had been transferred to Alameda.

A recent headline has sent ripples through the market: TonStrategy (TONX) , a prominent strategic investor in The Open Network (TON), has received a serious TonStrategy Nasdaq warning . This isn’t just a minor procedural note; it highlights a critical violation of shareholder approval requirements, as reported by WalterBloomberg. What Triggered the Urgent TonStrategy Nasdaq Warning? This concerning development stems from a specific series of events that unfolded last August. TonStrategy engaged in a private placement and an asset purchase agreement. While such financial maneuvers are common in the corporate world, they must adhere strictly to the rules set by regulatory bodies like Nasdaq. The Core Issue: The private placement and asset purchase agreement failed to secure the necessary shareholder approval. Nasdaq’s Stance: Nasdaq listing rules are designed to protect investors by ensuring transparency and proper corporate governance. Shareholder approval for significant transactions is a cornerstone of these protections. The warning letter from Nasdaq is a formal notification that TonStrategy has fallen short of these vital listing requirements. This is a serious matter for any publicly traded company, especially one with significant ties to a growing blockchain ecosystem like TON. Why Does Nasdaq’s Rule Violation Matter for TONX? A TonStrategy Nasdaq warning carries considerable weight. Nasdaq is one of the world’s largest and most respected stock exchanges, known for its stringent listing standards. When a company violates these rules, it signals potential issues with corporate governance and investor protection. For TONX, this means several things: Reputational Damage: A public warning can erode investor confidence, potentially impacting the company’s stock performance. Compliance Scrutiny: Nasdaq will closely monitor TonStrategy’s actions moving forward, demanding rectifications. Market Perception: Investors, both current and prospective, will likely view TONX with increased caution until the matter is resolved. Moreover, as a strategic investor in The Open Network, TonStrategy’s challenges could indirectly influence sentiment around TON itself, although the direct impact on TON’s underlying technology and development remains separate. Understanding Nasdaq’s Shareholder Approval Requirements Nasdaq’s rules, specifically those related to shareholder approval, are not arbitrary. They exist to prevent corporate actions that might dilute existing shareholders’ interests or involve significant asset transfers without their consent. For instance, Nasdaq Rule 5635(d) often requires shareholder approval for certain equity issuances that exceed 20% of outstanding shares or voting power, especially in private placements. In this case, TonStrategy’s August transactions likely triggered such a requirement, which they evidently failed to meet. This oversight raises questions about internal compliance procedures and governance frameworks within the company. What Are TonStrategy’s Next Steps After the Warning? Receiving a TonStrategy Nasdaq warning is not an immediate delisting notice, but it is a precursor to potential enforcement actions if the issue is not addressed promptly. Typically, TonStrategy will be required to submit a plan to regain compliance within a specified timeframe, often 60 days. This plan would likely involve: Remedial Actions: Taking steps to rectify the specific violation, which could involve seeking retroactive shareholder approval or unwinding parts of the transaction if feasible. Improved Governance: Demonstrating to Nasdaq that internal controls have been strengthened to prevent future breaches. Communication: Transparently communicating with shareholders and the market about the steps being taken. Failure to adequately address the warning could lead to more severe consequences, including delisting proceedings, which would be a significant blow to TonStrategy and its investors. Implications for Investors in TONX and The Open Network For investors holding TONX shares, this TonStrategy Nasdaq warning necessitates careful consideration. It’s crucial to monitor the company’s official statements regarding its plan to resolve the compliance issue. The market’s reaction will also provide insights into how seriously this event is perceived. For those invested in The Open Network (TON), while TonStrategy is an important strategic partner, TON’s decentralized nature means it’s not directly reliant on any single entity. However, the reputational spillover from a key investor facing regulatory issues is always a possibility. Investors should focus on TON’s core development, ecosystem growth, and overall market sentiment rather than solely on investor-specific news. Conclusion: Navigating the TonStrategy Nasdaq Warning The TonStrategy Nasdaq warning is a stark reminder of the importance of corporate governance and regulatory compliance, even in the fast-paced world of crypto-related investments. While TonStrategy has a path to rectify this situation, the incident underscores the need for due diligence from companies and vigilance from investors. How TonStrategy responds will be critical in restoring confidence and ensuring its continued presence on a major exchange. This event serves as a valuable lesson: adherence to established rules is paramount for maintaining market integrity and investor trust. The coming weeks will reveal TonStrategy’s strategy to navigate this challenging period. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the TonStrategy Nasdaq warning about? A1: The warning is for violating Nasdaq’s shareholder approval requirements, specifically concerning a private placement and asset purchase agreement made in August. These transactions did not receive the necessary approval from shareholders as mandated by Nasdaq’s listing rules. Q2: Is TonStrategy (TONX) going to be delisted immediately? A2: No, a warning letter is not an immediate delisting. It typically initiates a process where TonStrategy must submit a plan to regain compliance within a set timeframe, usually 60 days. Delisting is a potential consequence if the company fails to address the violation adequately. Q3: How does this TonStrategy Nasdaq warning affect The Open Network (TON)? A3: TonStrategy is a strategic investor in TON, so while the warning doesn’t directly impact TON’s technology or operations, it could indirectly affect investor sentiment towards the TON ecosystem due to reputational spillover from a key partner. However, TON’s decentralized nature provides some insulation. Q4: What are the potential consequences for TonStrategy if they don’t resolve the issue? A4: Failure to address the violation and regain compliance could lead to more severe enforcement actions from Nasdaq, including the potential delisting of TONX shares from the exchange. This would significantly impact the company’s access to capital and its public profile. Q5: What should investors in TONX do now? A5: Investors should closely monitor TonStrategy’s official announcements regarding their plan to resolve the compliance issue. It’s advisable to assess the company’s response, the market’s reaction, and consider how this situation aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

While top tasks like Bitcoin and Ethereum retain their dominance in size and balance, the most explosive returns usually come from mid- and early-stage belongings. Analysts at the moment are zeroing in on 3 names that would deliver brilliant profits in 2025—Ozak AI, Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP. While DOGE and XRP are pro favorites with strong communities and verified staying power, Ozak AI —an artificial intelligence-powered blockchain task presently in its 6th presale stage—is being hailed as the following foremost breakout, doubtlessly capable of handing over 100x returns as AI keeps shaping the destiny of decentralized technology. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin That Refuses to Fade Dogecoin, trading around $0.1865, continues to be one of the most resilient meme coins in the market. Despite its playful origins, DOGE has evolved into a major asset with growing adoption, particularly for microtransactions, tipping systems, and even merchant payments. The community’s strength and the ongoing support from Elon Musk and X (formerly Twitter) have kept the token relevant through every market cycle. Technically, DOGE suggests resistance degrees close to $0.195, $0.210, and $0.235, with support around $0.174, $0.162, and $0.148. A confirmed breakout above $0.210 should cause a robust rally in the direction of the $0.30 quarter, in particular if social sentiment and market liquidity align. While DOGE’s path to a full 100x seems unlikely due to its massive circulating supply, its proven ability to deliver 15x–20x flips in bullish conditions keeps it a favorite for traders seeking liquidity and excitement. Still, the next true exponential play, analysts argue, lies in utility-driven projects like Ozak AI. XRP: The Institutional Powerhouse Preparing for a Global Push XRP, currently priced at $2.50, has re-emerged as a serious contender in the 2025 bull run following Ripple Labs’s legal victory against regulators. Now with regulatory clarity and deep partnerships across global banks, XRP is positioned to become the standard for cross-border payments—offering a fast, low-cost alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. From a technical perspective, XRP faces resistance at $2.70, $2.95, and $3.25, with support at $2.35, $2.10, and $1.88. If XRP can close above the $2.95 resistance, a surge toward the $5 mental barrier will become likely—especially as institutional adoption will increase. However, while XRP’s fundamentals are among the strongest in crypto, its upside potential is naturally capped by its scale and market cap. Analysts expect 3x–5x growth, which is significant but modest compared to smaller, innovative tokens. That’s why many seasoned investors are rotating part of their profits into Ozak AI, where the growth curve is just beginning. Ozak AI: The New Frontier of AI-Powered Crypto Growth Ozak AI is at the forefront of the AI-blockchain convergence, leveraging artificial intelligence to revolutionize predictive analytics, trading insights, and decentralized intelligence. Its ecosystem is powered by AI prediction marketers—machine learning systems able to analyze real-time blockchain facts, social sentiment, and trading patterns to forecast market traits. At $0.012, Ozak AI’s early entry point gives sizable upside. The project has already raised over $4.38 million and offered more than 990 million tokens, signaling robust investor confidence. Its partnerships with Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT ensure scalability, factual precision, and pass-chain capability—giving Ozak AI both real-world utility and long-term staying power. Additionally, audits from CertiK and Sherlock add credibility, confirming that Ozak AI is not just another hype-driven presale but a secure, professionally built platform ready for institutional-level adoption. At its current valuation, a $2,000 investment in Ozak AI would secure about 166,000 tokens. If Ozak AI reaches $1, that becomes $166,000—an 83x return. Even a conservative rise to $0.50 yields a 40x gain, making it one of the most asymmetric opportunities in crypto today. Balancing Stability and Explosive Growth Dogecoin and XRP are both essential plays for 2025—DOGE for its viral power and retail dominance, and XRP for its institutional adoption and global utility. But when it comes to exponential upside, Ozak AI stands in a league of its own. With its AI-driven ecosystem, audited infrastructure, and fast-growing presale, Ozak AI embodies the innovation and scalability that define crypto’s future. Analysts agree: while DOGE and XRP may multiply portfolios, Ozak AI could redefine them entirely, making it the most convincing 100x candidate heading into the next bull market.

Among these, Ozak AI, Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP have garnered particular attention from market analysts for their potential to deliver outsized gains. Ozak AI, currently in its sixth presale stage, merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming to disrupt the way decentralized technologies function. This makes Ozak AI a standout candidate for those looking to capitalize on the integration of AI with blockchain. Ozak AI: Pioneering AI in the Blockchain Space Ozak AI is not just a promising new token but a transformative project at the intersection of AI and blockchain. With a vision to enhance predictive analytics and trading insights within the crypto world, this platform is all about leveraging AI to provide a competitive edge to its users. With more than $4.38 million raised and over 990 million tokens already sold, Ozak AI has shown it has the investor confidence to back its ambitious goals. Furthermore, partnerships and audits from reputable entities like CertiK and Sherlock underscore its credibility and potential for durability in the market. Investors considering Ozak AI can currently buy tokens at $0.012, with projections suggesting substantial growth as the project evolves. This sets the stage for potentially lucrative returns, especially if the token's value escalates as predicted. The Enduring Appeal of Dogecoin (DOGE) Despite originating as a meme, Dogecoin has evolved into a robust cryptocurrency with practical uses in microtransactions and tipping systems. It continues to enjoy the support of a strong community and high-profile endorsements, which help maintain its relevance in the market. While a 100x return might be less likely due to its large circulating supply, DOGE still shows potential for substantial gains during market upswings, making it a viable option for traders looking for high liquidity and excitement. XRP: Set for Institutional Success XRP stands out with its solid fundamentals and is poised to benefit from Ripple Labs' recent legal victories and its established network of global banking partnerships. This coin is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to conventional financial networks like SWIFT for cross-border transactions. With the potential to streamline and reduce the costs of global payments, XRP could experience a significant boost in adoption and value, particularly as more institutions start to integrate it into their operations. Striking a Balance in Crypto Investments Choosing the right cryptocurrency to invest in involves a delicate balance between risk and potential reward. While Dogecoin and XRP offer their unique appeals, Ozak AI represents a novel opportunity particularly due to its AI-driven approach and early stage in the market.

Ripple said it will expand its enterprise custody and payments business with the acquisition of Palisade. Ripple Doesn't Stop! Continuing its corporate expansion, Ripple has acquired cryptocurrency wallet and custody company Palisade as part of its efforts to expand its corporate payments business. Ripple stated that the Palisade acquisition will allow it to expand its storage capacity to serve fintechs, cryptocurrency firms, and corporations. However, Ripple did not disclose the details of the Palisade acquisition. Ripple Labs President Monica Long stated that the acquisition is expected to increase the stability of Ripple Payments and improve payment speeds. “Institutions are poised to drive the next big wave of crypto adoption. The combination of Ripple's bank-grade vault and Palisade's fast and lightweight wallet makes Ripple Custody the end-to-end provider for every institutional need, from long-term storage to real-time global payments and treasury management.” Ripple also added that it has made numerous acquisitions this year, including Hidden Road for $1.25 billion and stablecoin platform Rail for $200 million.

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has a compelling prediction that could reshape your understanding of the financial landscape and potentially ignite a new crypto bull market . His latest insights suggest the U.S. is quietly preparing a financial maneuver with significant implications for cryptocurrencies. What’s Fueling Hayes’ Bold Crypto Bull Market Prediction? Arthur Hayes, known for his sharp macroeconomic analysis, recently shared his views on his blog. He believes the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve are setting the stage for what he terms “stealth quantitative easing” (QE). This isn’t your typical, publicly announced QE, but a more subtle approach designed to inject liquidity into the system. Hayes’ argument begins with the U.S. government’s preferred method of funding its substantial spending: issuing bonds. Rather than increasing taxes, the Treasury relies on selling debt. However, a critical problem is emerging: demand for this U.S. debt is softening. Weakening Foreign Demand: Foreign central banks are increasingly diversifying their reserves, often by accumulating gold. This shift signals a growing apprehension about the risks associated with dollar-denominated assets. Sluggish Private Sector Interest: Domestically, private sector demand for U.S. Treasurys also remains unenthusiastic. Hayes points out that even the four largest commercial banks have only absorbed a fraction of the recently issued debt. This weakening demand creates a significant challenge, especially when considering the sheer volume of new debt. The Treasury is projected to issue an astonishing $2 trillion in new bonds annually just to cover the existing fiscal deficit. How Could “Stealth QE” Spark a Robust Crypto Bull Market ? In this challenging environment of high debt issuance and dwindling demand, Hayes foresees a crucial intervention. If the market’s liquidity proves insufficient to absorb the massive influx of new bonds, the Federal Reserve will likely step in. How? Through its Standing Repo Facility (SRF). The SRF allows eligible financial institutions to temporarily exchange U.S. Treasury securities for cash from the Fed. While technically different from traditional QE, Hayes argues that the effect is remarkably similar. It effectively injects funds into the market, increasing the money supply and easing financial conditions. Think of it this way: When the Fed uses the SRF to provide liquidity, it’s essentially ensuring there’s enough cash flowing through the system to buy the government’s debt. This indirect method of monetary expansion, according to Hayes, acts like a hidden form of QE. Historically, periods of increased monetary supply and quantitative easing have often correlated with upward movements in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The expectation is that this new wave of liquidity will find its way into various markets, potentially reigniting a robust crypto bull market . What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors in a Potential Crypto Bull Market ? Hayes’ analysis isn’t just a prediction; it comes with a clear recommendation for investors. He advises accumulating cash in anticipation of this “stealth QE” scenario materializing. His rationale is straightforward: Strategic Positioning: Holding cash allows investors to be ready to deploy capital when the market signals a clear shift. Rapid Rebound: Once the Fed begins injecting funds, Hayes expects the market, especially the crypto sector, to rebound both quickly and strongly. This suggests a potential for significant gains for those positioned correctly. This strategy highlights the importance of understanding the broader macroeconomic forces at play. While the U.S. government faces a dilemma in funding its spending, the proposed solution could inadvertently create a powerful tailwind for digital assets. Investors who pay close attention to these underlying economic shifts may find themselves well-prepared for the next surge. Is a New Crypto Bull Market on the Horizon? Arthur Hayes’ perspective offers a fascinating look into the intricate dance between government spending, bond markets, and central bank policy. His prediction of “stealth QE” presents a compelling narrative for how a new crypto bull market could emerge from the current economic landscape. While the mechanisms are complex, the potential outcome for crypto investors is clear: a significant injection of liquidity could provide the necessary catalyst. Staying informed about these macroeconomic developments is crucial for navigating the volatile yet opportunity-rich world of cryptocurrencies. As Hayes suggests, the market might just be waiting for its hidden boost. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Bull Market and Stealth QE Q1: What is “stealth QE” according to Arthur Hayes? A1: “Stealth QE” refers to the U.S. Federal Reserve injecting liquidity into the financial system through its Standing Repo Facility (SRF). Hayes believes this action, while not traditional quantitative easing, will have a similar effect by increasing the money supply to help absorb government debt. Q2: Why does Arthur Hayes believe the U.S. will resort to stealth QE? A2: Hayes argues that the U.S. government needs to issue $2 trillion in new bonds annually to cover its deficit, but demand from both foreign central banks and the private sector for these bonds is weakening. If there isn’t enough liquidity to buy this debt, the Fed will step in via the SRF. Q3: How could stealth QE impact the crypto market? A3: Historically, periods of increased monetary supply and quantitative easing have led to capital flowing into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Hayes predicts that this new wave of liquidity will reignite a strong crypto bull market . Q4: What is Arthur Hayes’ advice for investors based on this prediction? A4: Hayes advises accumulating cash in anticipation of the stealth QE scenario. He believes that once the Fed begins injecting funds, the crypto market will rebound quickly and strongly, rewarding those who are strategically positioned. Q5: Is the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) the same as traditional Quantitative Easing (QE)? A5: While the SRF is a different tool used for short-term liquidity management, Hayes argues that its effect of injecting funds into the market to facilitate bond purchases is functionally similar to traditional QE in terms of increasing the money supply.

The coin expanded close to $480, as its climb is not affected by the overall market fear. ZCash (ZEC) once again moves against all market logic, returning to the $480 range. The coin rallied despite the dip of BTC to $105,000, moving on its own market logic. Bridged ZEC on Solana briefly broke above $500, boosted by general hype and a whale-sized order. | Source: CoinGecko . ZEC relies on active derivative trading, with open interest rising to over $582M. However, spot buying and accumulation is also happening, with a few hundred coins each day added to shielded pools. ZCash mining is also at an all-time high, with the hashrate reaching a record . At the current stage, the ZCash community is showing true belief, but there are still skeptics who see the ZEC rally as an attempt at finding exit liquidity. ZEC rises on Solana-based activity The two main sources of ZEC activity are derivative trades, and DEX trading on Solana . ZEC has become a DeFi token, though at much smaller volumes. However, this is also one of the main sources for making whale-sized orders and swaying the price. ZEC on Omni Bridge has a supply of 28,280 coins, with a total valuation above $13M. Recently, a whale made a $300K order , buying ZEC at $600, breaking above all other platforms. Previously, whale buyers have also boosted ZEC. Solana has now become the main decentralized venue for trading ZEC , with volumes recently posting a record. However, the DEX market remains much smaller compared to other listings for ZEC. On Solana, the ZEC narrative has replaced the meme token hype, after the trenches slowed down. Now, ZEC is seen as a potential source of liquidity and interest in DEX trading. The coin has returned to levels not seen since 2017, but has also received additional attention after years of inactivity. ZEC mindshare is up by another 574% since October 5, rising to 0.7%. The coin sees a mix of retail hype and whale activity. Recently, a whale opened a 5X long position on Solana, after depositing $7.9M USDC. ZEC still gets aggressively shorted The current rally comes with over 62% in short positions on most major exchanges. On Hyperliquid, more whales are going long, with just 43% in short positions, betting on continued ZEC expansion. Based on short liquidity positions, ZEC may try to liquidate traders up to $495. However, there is liquidity on the downside, and ZEC has also shown it can dip to a lower range. ZEC is now the top privacy coin by market capitalization, even after taking a step back to $462. The token flipped Litecoin (LTC), and moved faster compared to other legacy private coins. Monero (XMR) remains active, though its expansion stalled at $344. Decred (DCR) and DASH also achieved near-vertical rallies, but are still incapable of catching up with ZEC. The privacy narrative is also not the main driver of the ZEC rally, which is getting a boost from influencers and whale traders.

Strategy & BitMine Have Both Added To Their Treasury Reserves Strategy and BitMine , the largest Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury companies, respectively, have just revealed new purchases. The former’s announcement comes through a routine Monday X post from co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor. With this purchase, the company has added 397 BTC to its holdings. The buy, which occurred in the period between October 27th and November 2nd, cost Strategy about $114,771 per token, or a total of $45.6 million. This acquisition isn’t too big and continues the recent trend of small, but consistent purchases from the Bitcoin hoarder. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm’s acquisition has come alongside sales of its STRF, STRK, STRD, and MSTR at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. While Strategy’s purchase has been relatively modest, BitMine has made a more substantial acquisition. As announced in a press release, the Ethereum treasury company expanded its holdings by 82,353 ETH during the past week, worth about $302 million at the current exchange rate. BitMine now owns 3.4 million ETH, equivalent to 2.8% of the cryptocurrency’s entire circulating supply. “We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH,” noted Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat, Chairman of BitMine. BitMine is the largest ETH treasury in the world, but in terms of overall cryptocurrency corporate holders, the firm comes second behind Strategy. Saylor’s firm holds 641,205 BTC after the latest purchase, equivalent to over 3.2% of the Bitcoin supply. Strategy invested a total of $47.49 billion into these holdings, and today, the tokens value at $68.8 billion, giving the firm a healthy profit margin. While the Bitcoin treasury is in the green, BitMine’s ETH reserves are underwater. The company spent $13.25 billion to assemble its Ethereum stack, but at current prices, the reserve values at $12.43 billion. Both BTC and ETH have gone through bearish price action recently, but the reason Strategy’s holdings are still strong lies in the fact that the firm has been at its buying spree for years now, while BitMine is a new player in the space, so its cost basis is much closer to recent prices. While Strategy and BitMine have continued to accumulate recently, the wider trend in the sector is that institutional buying pressure has been slowing down. As Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has explained in an X post , net institutional accumulation has dropped below the daily miner issuance . This is the first time in seven months that this trend has developed, suggesting a shift in institutional interest in Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,300, down 7% over the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|BitMine|btc|BTCUSDT|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum treasury|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 10:00:12

What Does the Upbit MMT Listing Mean for You? Whenever a major exchange like Upbit adds a new asset, it typically generates buzz. MMT, while perhaps new to some, now gains substantial visibility and liquidity. This listing could provide a fresh trading opportunity for both seasoned and new crypto enthusiasts. Upbit is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, especially in Asia. Therefore, any coin listed on its platform often experiences increased trading volume and broader market exposure. This is a critical moment for the MMT project and its community. Navigating MMT Trading Pairs: BTC and USDT The decision to list MMT against both Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) trading pairs offers flexibility. Each pair caters to different trading preferences and strategies. BTC Pair: Trading MMT against BTC means you are essentially speculating on the value of MMT relative to Bitcoin. This can be more volatile, but it also allows for direct crypto-to-crypto exposure without needing to convert to stablecoins. USDT Pair: The USDT pair, on the other hand, offers a more stable reference point. USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, making it easier to track the dollar value of your MMT holdings. Many traders use USDT as a primary entry and exit point for their crypto investments. Traders can choose the pair that best aligns with their risk tolerance and market outlook. This dual listing enhances the accessibility of MMT on Upbit. Preparing for the Upbit MMT Listing: Trader Insights With the Upbit MMT listing happening soon, preparation is crucial. Informed decisions are always the best decisions in the fast-paced crypto market. Here are some actionable insights: Research MMT: Understand the project’s fundamentals, its use case, technology, and team. A solid understanding helps you assess its long-term potential. Risk Management: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage potential downside. Start Small: Especially in the initial hours or days following a listing, prices can fluctuate wildly. Consider starting with a smaller position to gauge market sentiment before committing more capital. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and announcements related to MMT and Upbit. Timely information can give you an edge. This approach helps mitigate risks while still allowing you to participate in the potential opportunities presented by the new Upbit MMT listing .

With hype around Ripple Swell fading and whales still waiting to strike, many investors are shifting focus toward higher-upside opportunities. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes in, a rapidly emerging DeFi crypto priced at just $0.035 and already 85% through its Stage 6 presale. Unlike older altcoins struggling for fresh catalysts, Mutuum Finance offers both utility and early-stage growth potential. Its decentralized lending protocol, yield incentives, and strong community traction have positioned it as the best crypto to buy now for investors chasing exponential gains in 2025. XRP Holds Ground as Traders Await the Next Big Move Ripple’s XRP is showing quiet resilience around the $2.50 mark, managing to stay stable despite mixed market sentiment. Technical indicators suggest the token might be coiling for a decisive move, Bollinger Bands are tightening, the RSI sits at a neutral 45, and a potential MACD crossover just above key support hints at early bullish momentum. Meanwhile, developments like Bitwise’s ETF progress and the increasing adoption of RLUSD are helping maintain positive sentiment even as volume cools off. Short-term traders are watching $2.68–$2.83 as the next potential resistance zone, a breakout above which could reawaken momentum in XRP. However, with price action still confined to a narrow range, some investors are scanning the market for more aggressive growth opportunities, and that search is starting to lead them towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the next crypto to explode that is capturing early attention as the best crypto to buy ahead of 2025’s major bull cycle. Mutuum Finance Shatters Records in Its Rapidly Selling Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to trend as the best crypto to buy, setting new records in both presale performance and investor participation. With more than 17,700 investors onboard and over $18.4 million raised, the project’s momentum has solidified its reputation as the next crypto to explode in the coming year. Now in Phase 6, MUTM tokens are available at $0.035, marking the final opportunity for investors to buy before the next 15% price jump to $0.04 in Phase 7. The growing enthusiasm highlights strong confidence in Mutuum Finance’s long-term potential, giving early backers a prime entry point ahead of the next market upswing. In a major step toward global accessibility, Mutuum Finance has also introduced Credit and Debit Card purchases, allowing investors to buy tokens directly through its official platform, no complex wallet setup required. This feature removes barriers to entry and opens the door for both new and experienced investors, making MUTM the best crypto to buy for accessibility, potential growth, and innovation. A Strategic Roadmap Powering Scalable DeFi Growth Mutuum Finance’s strong presale performance is backed by a clear, well-structured roadmap designed for transparency and long-term scalability. During Phase 1, the team achieved several critical milestones, including the successful presale rollout, strategic marketing initiatives, and completion of a third-party security audit. The introduction of an AI-powered helpdesk improved user support, while the establishment of a dedicated compliance department ensured alignment with evolving regulations. To strengthen user understanding, the team also launched educational resources detailing the platform’s lending mechanisms and token utility, further building investor trust and community engagement. As the project moves through Phase 2, the focus shifts to the development of the V1 DeFi protocol, featuring smart contracts for lending and borrowing, an intuitive decentralized application (DApp) interface, and a high-performance back end for seamless on-chain transactions. The upcoming Sepolia testnet launch will serve as a critical stage in testing scalability, performance, and security before the full mainnet rollout. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $18.4 million from over 17,700 investors, with Phase 6 of its presale 85% sold out at $0.035 per token. As Phase 7 approaches with a 15% price increase, this limited window offers investors a final chance to secure early entry into one of 2025’s most promising DeFi projects. Backed by a clear roadmap, strong community support, and upcoming testnet launch, MUTM is positioned as the next crypto to explode and unquestionably the best crypto to buy for long-term growth in the DeFi market.

November 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, has announced the company’s plans to expand to Europe Saytlo with a new capital-raising vehicle. The perpetual preferred stock – tickered $STRE (Stream) – will have no maturity date. It will pay a 10% dividend in Euros, incentivizing investors to commit long-term capital into Strategy. The funds will then be used to expand the company’s Bitcoin holdings. On Monday, Strategy announced yet another $BTC purchase, bringing its total holdings to a whopping 641,205 . Meanwhile, steady long-term conviction in Bitcoin has pushed the Bitcoin Hyper presale past $25.7M. The project is building a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing speed and smart contracts to the network. As a project that could transform Bitcoin into a Web3 hub and shape its future trajectory, Bitcoin Hyper’s growing presale FOMO seems well justified. It is one of the best meme coins to buy now. Read on to find out how to buy $HYPER tokens before it’s too late . BitMine Buys $300M-Worth of $ETH as Maxi Doge Becomes One of the Best Meme Coins November 4, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine just bought another $300M-worth of Ethereum , increasing its treasury to 2.8% of the total $ETH supply. The company’s combined value of crypto, cash, and equity totals $13.7B , which includes the 3,395,422 $ETH, 192 $BTC, $62M stake in Eightco Holdings and $389M in cash. The acquisition comes just as Ethereum is taking a plunge, after a 15.4% dip over the last week. This shows Lee’s increased confidence in Ethereum’s future and sets a strong example for investors. It’s also fitting that Lee predicted a $7K Ethereum and a $200K Bitcoin by the end of the year during a CNBC interview. If that happens, the market may explode in Q1 2026, with projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) becoming one of the best meme coins available. Learn more about Maxi Doge right here.

54017731,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88558,1762250547,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Documented for Major Asset Recommended for IMF By ECB President,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-documented-for-major-asset-recommended-for-imf-by-ecb-president/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has shared documents suggesting that private sectors could issue a new Special Drawing Rights (SDR)-based digital currency on a Layer 1 blockchain such as the XRP Ledger. The material outlines how a blockchain-based version of the SDR could combine the IMF’s backing and the existing fiat basket model with the transparency and efficiency of distributed ledger technology. The documents describe the proposal as a way to modernize the SDR framework, making it compatible with blockchain ecosystems while maintaining its reserve-backed stability. Unlike traditional IMF SDRs, which are allocated to member states, this proposed “crypto SDR” would be privately issued and freely circulated, creating a new bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. THE NEW SDR-BASED CRYPTO CAN BE ISSUED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON A LAYER 1 BLOCKCHAIN SUCH AS THE XRP LEDGER Documented. https://t.co/2h6COUUxMD pic.twitter.com/pCMgritUap — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 2, 2025 Design and technological framework The documents outline two models for possible implementation. The first involves developing a new blockchain to host the SDR token, defined as a Layer 1 approach. The second, described as more practical, involves issuing the asset on an existing blockchain such as the XRP Ledger , a Layer 1 network designed for efficient cross-border transactions. The material notes that both options require strong compliance mechanisms and stable collateralization to preserve the SDR’s intended function as a low-volatility reserve asset. The eSDR framework would use blockchain to streamline international settlements. By pegging its value to the SDR’s existing basket of major currencies, the digital asset would provide a stable valuation mechanism while removing reliance on intermediaries. The report suggests that the private sector’s adoption of a Layer 1 blockchain would allow faster deployment, real-time settlement, and enhanced data transparency across jurisdictions. Application in cross-border payments The documentation further explores how central banks or private issuers could use eSDRs to facilitate cross-border transactions. It outlines a model in which payments move directly from one currency into the eSDR and then into another, achieving near-instant settlement without traditional correspondent banking layers. The proposed framework would also reduce foreign exchange costs and improve liquidity for banks, financial institutions, and potentially fintech platforms integrated with the ledger. The attached material references the XRP Ledger’s design as a foundation for this kind of programmable payment solution. It highlights its high throughput, low transaction cost, and compliance adaptability as characteristics that could make it suitable for issuing an SDR-pegged instrument. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Impact If implemented, an SDR-linked crypto asset could serve as a hybrid model between central bank digital currencies and stablecoins, combining regulatory oversight with decentralized technology. However, the documentation acknowledges key challenges, including jurisdictional regulations, interoperability with existing systems, and the need for clear reserve management frameworks. According to the research shared by SMQKE, private-sector issuance of an SDR-pegged digital asset on a Layer 1 blockchain could represent a major step toward a unified, blockchain-based reserve instrument. The model positions the XRP Ledger as a potential foundation for such development, aligning with ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and efficiency in the global payments ecosystem.

BlockDAG has impressed investors with a staggering $434 million raise, cementing its place as a technical powerhouse. But complexity can be a double-edged sword. Meanwhile, Digitap is stealing the spotlight with something far simpler—real-world use. Its “omni-banking” card lets users spend crypto like cash anywhere. This is a utility investors can see and use today. For whales and retail buyers alike, Digitap is emerging as the best crypto to buy now and one of the most promising altcoins to buy in 2025. BlockDAG: A Technical Marvel, But Too Complex for Mass Adoption? BlockDAG has secured monumental funding thanks to its ambitious, highly technical vision. The project combines the speed and privacy of Bitcoin’s UTXO model with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. It then ties everything together through the parallel processing power of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger, powered by the GhostDAG protocol. It’s an impressive idea. However, it's also an intimidating one, especially for crypto beginners. BlockDAG’s main strength—its complexity—may also be its biggest weakness. The average investor needs to grasp difficult concepts like the UTXO-EVM bridge, “burning” and “minting” coins, and consensus models such as SPECTRE, PHANTOM, and PoW. That’s a lot to ask. Sure, the $434 million crypto presale shows strong institutional belief. Yet it doesn’t solve crypto’s biggest challenge: simplicity. For investors seeking altcoins to buy or the best crypto to buy now, a project that requires a computer science background might be a tough sell. The Digitap Difference: Utility and Anonymity Is the New Edge Digitap delivers a clear counter-narrative to BlockDAG’s complexity: real-world utility that works right now. Instead of focusing on how the blockchain operates, Digitap puts the spotlight on the user experience. It removes the barriers that stop crypto from being used like everyday money. This project is already live. Its omni-banking app unifies all assets, fiat and crypto, under one simple dashboard. The standout feature, however, is the Digitap Card—a globally accepted Visa-partnered card that lets users spend crypto like cash anywhere. Privacy and flexibility make Digitap truly unique. Users can sign up in minutes with No-KYC onboarding, maintaining full anonymity and complete control over their assets. Every transaction stays private and untracked. At the same time, the card automatically converts any supported crypto or fiat at payment, integrating with Apple Pay and Google Pay for tap-to-pay convenience. This seamless usability explains why analysts now consider Digitap one of the best crypto to buy now for 100X gains. The $TAP Presale: Rewarding Utility With Deflationary Scarcity Momentum around Digitap’s crypto presale continues to surge, powered by real-world adoption and strong deflationary tokenomics, a sharp contrast to projects still stuck in the whitepaper stage. Digitap has already raised over $1.3 million, with Stage 2 priced at $0.0268 and a listing target of $0.14. That gives early buyers a potential 425%+ return before exchange listings even begin. Digitap’s economic design is just as impressive. The token supply is capped at 2 billion, and the system is fully deflationary. Half of all platform profits are used to auto-buy $TAP on the open market—then 50% of those tokens are burned, while the rest go to stakers as rewards. This means every card swipe and every transaction directly adds value to the token. For investors searching for altcoins to buy or the crypto to buy now, Digitap’s blend of utility, scarcity, and passive rewards is a standout combination in 2025. Why $TAP Stands Out as the Best Crypto to Buy Now BlockDAG has set an impressive benchmark with its massive crypto presale success. Yet it still represents the old “tech-first” mindset; a complex maze of bridges, protocols, and ledgers that few investors truly understand. Digitap takes a different path. It’s leading the next wave by making crypto feel like cash; simple, instant, and usable anywhere. That’s a game-changer for adoption. For investors who missed previous bull runs, the choice in 2025 is clear. They can back a theoretical project that might deliver results someday, or they can support a live product that is already solving real financial challenges such as high fees, cross-border friction, and limited accessibility. With its Visa partnership, radical privacy model, and powerful deflationary tokenomics, Digitap ($TAP) is emerging as one of the few altcoins to buy built for mainstream use. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy now, shifting to Digitap’s proven utility could be the smartest move of the year. Digitap is Live NOW.

The exchange has confirmed the imminent delisting of the AI16Z perpetual futures contract, a development that demands immediate attention from anyone holding or considering positions. This crucial decision by OKX is set to take effect on November 6, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. UTC, and understanding its implications is essential for safeguarding your trading strategy and assets. What Does the Delisting of AI16Z Perpetual Futures Mean for Traders? OKX has officially scheduled the delisting of the AI16Z perpetual futures contract. This means that after the specified time on November 6, traders will no longer be able to open new positions or maintain existing ones on this particular contract. For many, this news prompts questions about the underlying reasons and the necessary steps to take. A perpetual futures contract, for those new to the concept, is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. The AI16Z perpetual futures contract enabled users to trade the AI16Z token against USDT, offering leverage and opportunities for both long and short positions. Exchanges typically delist contracts due to various factors. These can include low liquidity, insufficient trading volume, concerns about the underlying asset’s project viability, or even regulatory considerations. While OKX has not provided explicit detailed reasons for the AI16Z perpetual futures delisting in their initial announcement, traders should always be prepared for such possibilities in the dynamic crypto market. How Should Traders Prepare for the AI16Z Perpetual Futures Delisting? For traders currently holding positions in the AI16Z perpetual futures contract, immediate action is paramount. Procrastination can lead to unfavorable outcomes, including forced liquidation at potentially disadvantageous prices. It is vital to manage your positions proactively before the delisting deadline. Here are the essential steps you should consider taking: Close Open Positions: If you have any active long or short positions on the AI16Z perpetual futures , it is strongly advised to close them before the delisting time. This allows you to control your exit price and avoid automatic settlements by the exchange. Monitor Your Portfolio: Keep a close watch on your OKX account to ensure all positions related to AI16Z are managed appropriately. Withdraw or Convert Assets: After closing positions, consider withdrawing any remaining USDT or converting it to other assets if you do not plan to use it for other trades on OKX. Acting swiftly ensures you retain control over your funds and mitigate potential risks associated with the automatic settlement process. What Are the Broader Implications of Such Delistings? The delisting of an asset like the AI16Z perpetual futures contract serves as a critical reminder of the inherent volatility and evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. Such events highlight the importance of continuous vigilance and robust risk management strategies for all traders, regardless of their experience level. It underscores the need to: Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges where you trade. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid over-reliance on a single asset or contract. Understand Underlying Assets: Research the projects behind the tokens you trade to assess their long-term viability. While the delisting of AI16Z perpetual futures might seem like an isolated event, it is part of a broader trend where exchanges continually review and optimize their offerings based on market conditions and regulatory landscapes. Adapting to these changes is a key skill for success in crypto trading. In conclusion, the upcoming delisting of the AI16Z perpetual futures contract by OKX on November 6, 2023, is a significant event for affected traders. By understanding the announcement, taking prompt action to manage existing positions, and reflecting on broader market strategies, traders can navigate this change effectively.

It showed explosive growth over the years in the meme coin world. What started as a joke project turned into one of the most talked-about cryptos on social media. Eventually creating millionaires during its peak. But while Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a fan favorite, traders in 2025 are beginning to look beyond memes. They are looking for projects with real-world utility that could deliver similar returns . One name that keeps appearing in that conversation is Avalon X (AVLX coin)X — a real estate backed cryptocurrency that’s redefining what early-stage growth can look like in the RWA (Real World Asset) sector. With its Stage 2 presale now live, Avalon X is already gaining comparisons to SHIB’s early trajectory. Is Shiba Inu Price Ready for Another Rally? Shiba Inu price is showing slight improvement after months of consolidation. Different exchanges list SHIB trading around the $0.0000104 mark. At the same time, chain data shows modest whale accumulation and renewed retail interest. Eventually it suggests cautious optimism among investors. Social media posts highlight small inflows from long-term holders hoping for a repeat of its 2021 rally. But the meme coin world has evolved. Many traders who once chased pure speculation are now seeking tokens with real underlying assets and Avalon X has quickly positioned itself as that next evolution. Why Is Avalon X Stage 2 Attracting Serious Attention? The Avalon X presale has entered Stage 2. As the numbers speak for themselves. So far Avalon X has already sold more than 64 million AVLX tokens.

For those immersed in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these traditional market shifts is not just academic; it can directly influence digital asset valuations, investor sentiment, and capital flows. Recently, the US Dollar has showcased remarkable resilience, holding firm near its recent highs, while the British Sterling has faced considerable headwinds, primarily due to domestic political challenges. This divergence creates a fascinating landscape for analysis, revealing deeper insights into the forces shaping global finance. Why is the US Dollar Maintaining its Unwavering Strength? The US Dollar has long been considered the world’s primary reserve currency and a safe haven during times of uncertainty. Its current strength is not accidental but a culmination of several powerful factors. The Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance on interest rate hikes, aimed at curbing persistent inflation, has made dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. Higher yields draw capital, strengthening the currency. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s commitment to fighting inflation through rate increases has widened the gap between US interest rates and those in many other developed economies. This makes holding dollars more rewarding. Global Economic Uncertainty: In an era marked by geopolitical tensions, energy crises, and inflation fears, the dollar acts as a safe harbor. Investors flock to US assets, perceived as stable, when other markets become turbulent. Robust US Economic Data: Despite concerns, the US economy has shown relative resilience, particularly in its labor market. Strong employment figures and consumer spending can bolster confidence in the dollar’s underlying economic support. This sustained strength of the US Dollar has significant implications, not just for traditional markets but also for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, often impacting the price of Bitcoin and other digital assets, which are typically priced against the dollar. What Political Woes are Hitting the British Sterling So Hard? While the dollar enjoys its moment of strength, the British Sterling tells a different story. The UK economy has been grappling with a series of challenges, exacerbated by political instability. Frequent changes in leadership and policy direction have created an environment of uncertainty, which currency markets inherently dislike. Political Turmoil: The UK has seen significant political shifts, including leadership contests and policy reversals. Such instability erodes investor confidence, making the pound less appealing. High Inflation and Cost of Living Crisis: The UK is facing some of the highest inflation rates among G7 nations, severely impacting household incomes and consumer spending. This economic pressure puts the Bank of England in a difficult position, balancing inflation control with economic growth. Recession Risks: Many economists predict a recession for the UK economy. A shrinking economy typically weakens its currency as prospects for future growth diminish. Lingering Brexit Impact: While not a new issue, the long-term economic consequences of Brexit continue to weigh on trade relationships and labor availability, adding to the Sterling’s vulnerability. The combined effect of these factors has put immense pressure on the British Sterling , leading to its depreciation against major currencies, including the strong US Dollar. Understanding Forex Market Dynamics: What Drives Currency Volatility? The Forex market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest financial market globally, where currencies are traded. Its sheer scale and constant activity mean that understanding its dynamics is key to grasping broader economic trends. Currency values are not static; they are in constant flux, driven by a complex interplay of economic, political, and psychological factors. Here are some core drivers of Forex market movements: Interest Rates: As seen with the US Dollar, higher interest rates attract foreign capital seeking better returns, strengthening a currency. Economic Performance: A country with a strong, growing economy tends to have a stronger currency. Indicators like GDP growth, employment rates, and manufacturing data are closely watched. Political Stability: Stable political environments foster investor confidence, while instability, as experienced by the British Sterling , can lead to capital flight and currency depreciation. Trade Balances: A country that exports more than it imports (a trade surplus) will generally see its currency strengthen as foreigners buy more of its goods and thus its currency. Market Sentiment and Speculation: Trader expectations and large speculative positions can also significantly influence short-term currency movements. The contrasting performance of the US Dollar and British Sterling vividly illustrates these dynamics. One benefits from favorable interest rate differentials and safe-haven demand, while the other struggles with political uncertainty and economic headwinds. Factor US Dollar (USD) British Sterling (GBP) Interest Rates Higher Federal Reserve rates attracting capital, supporting value. Bank of England balancing inflation control with growth, creating uncertainty. Economic Growth Relatively robust, resilient labor market and consumer spending. Slowdown, high inflation, and significant recession risks. Political Stability Generally stable, predictable policy environment. Frequent leadership changes, policy uncertainty, impacting confidence. Safe-Haven Status Strong demand during global crises, seen as a reliable store of value. Limited safe-haven appeal, vulnerable to global risk-off sentiment. Inflation Outlook Fed actively tackling inflation, signs of potential moderation. Persistent high inflation, impacting real wages and consumer purchasing power. The Ripple Effect of Currency Volatility on Global Economics Currency volatility is more than just a concern for Forex traders; it has far-reaching implications for global economics. A strong US Dollar can make US exports more expensive, potentially dampening demand from other countries. Conversely, it makes imports cheaper for US consumers, which can help mitigate domestic inflation but also impact local industries. For countries with dollar-denominated debt, a strong dollar means a higher cost of repayment. For the UK, a weak British Sterling can make its exports cheaper and more competitive on the global market, potentially boosting trade. However, it also makes imports more expensive, contributing to inflationary pressures and increasing the cost of living for consumers and businesses reliant on imported goods, such as energy. This creates a difficult balancing act for policymakers and businesses alike. Impact on Trade: Currency fluctuations directly affect the cost of imports and exports, influencing trade balances and corporate profits. Inflationary Pressures: A depreciating currency makes imports more expensive, feeding into domestic inflation, while an appreciating currency can help curb it. Investment Flows: Currency stability and strength are key considerations for foreign direct investment. Volatility can deter investors. Central Bank Responses: Central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are constantly monitoring currency movements, often adjusting monetary policy in response to maintain economic stability. Understanding these ripple effects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the complex landscape of global economics . Actionable Insights for Traders: Adapting to Current Global Economics For those involved in the Forex market , the current environment presents both challenges and opportunities. Navigating a strong US Dollar and a weak British Sterling requires careful planning and a robust understanding of market drivers. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Their forward guidance on interest rates and economic outlooks are primary drivers of currency movements. Track Key Economic Data: GDP reports, inflation figures (CPI), employment data, and retail sales provide vital clues about economic health and potential currency direction. Diversify and Manage Risk: In times of currency volatility , diversification across different asset classes and careful risk management are paramount. Don’t over-leverage, and use stop-loss orders. Understand Geopolitical Risks: Global political events and conflicts can swiftly alter market sentiment and currency flows. Stay informed about major international developments. Consider Currency Pairs: Focus on pairs where the fundamental divergence is clear, such as USD/GBP, but also be aware of how other major currencies interact. These insights can help traders make informed decisions in a world shaped by evolving global economics and unpredictable political landscapes. FAQs: Your Questions on Dollar, Sterling, and Forex Answered What makes the US Dollar a safe haven? The US Dollar is considered a safe haven due to the size and liquidity of the US financial markets, the stability of the US government, and its role as the world’s primary reserve currency. During global crises, investors tend to move capital into US Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets, driving up its value. How do political events impact the British Sterling? Political events, such as leadership changes, policy uncertainty, and referendums, directly affect investor confidence in a country’s economic future. Negative political developments can lead to capital outflow and a decrease in demand for the currency, causing the British Sterling to weaken. Institutions like the Bank of England and the UK government’s HM Treasury closely monitor these impacts. What is the Forex market? The Forex market is a global decentralized or over-the-counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. This market determines foreign exchange rates for every currency. It includes all aspects of buying, selling, and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. Major players include central banks like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank , commercial banks, investment firms, and individual traders. How does a strong US Dollar affect other economies? A strong US Dollar can make goods and services from other countries cheaper for US consumers, but it also makes US exports more expensive. For countries that have dollar-denominated debt, a stronger dollar increases the cost of servicing and repaying that debt. This can lead to financial strain in emerging markets and influence global trade balances. Can the British Sterling recover its strength? The recovery of the British Sterling depends heavily on an improvement in the UK’s economic outlook and greater political stability. Addressing high inflation, fostering economic growth, and providing clear, consistent policy direction would be crucial. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often provides recommendations for such economic adjustments. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Currency Landscape The current divergence between the resilient US Dollar and the struggling British Sterling offers a compelling case study in the complex interplay of economic fundamentals, central bank policies, and political stability. The dollar’s strength reflects its safe-haven status and the Federal Reserve’s firm monetary policy, while the Sterling’s weakness highlights the profound impact of domestic political woes and economic challenges. Understanding these dynamics is not just for currency traders; it’s essential for anyone seeking to comprehend the broader shifts in global economics and their potential ripple effects on various financial markets, including the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. As these currencies continue their respective journeys, staying informed and adaptable remains the key to navigating an ever-evolving financial world.

As of press time, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies stood at $3.45 trillion, down from $3.72 trillion just a day prior, according to CoinMarketCap data. 30-day global crypto market capitalization. Source: CoinMarketCap Leading the charge in this crash were some of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and XRP all saw substantial drops. Bitcoin, for instance, is trading around $103,944. Ethereum’s price has also slumped, now hovering around $3,500, while XRP, despite the recent excitement surrounding Ripple’s Swell conference, fell by 5.46%, trading at $2.27. Top cryptocurrencies. Source: Finbold Why crypto market is crashing The catalyst for this sharp sell-off appears to be comments by United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. At last week’s meeting, Powell stated that a rate cut in December was not guaranteed, signaling a slower pace of interest-rate reductions and caution regarding inflation. These remarks immediately impacted global risk sentiment, leading to a sell-off in both equities and cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the rising strength of the US dollar, particularly against the Japanese yen, has further amplified the aversion to risk assets, pushing traders to shift toward safer investments. Additionally, volatility in the cryptocurrency market has been exacerbated by derivatives activity. With perpetual contract volumes soaring by 142% and open interest falling by 5.1%, there have been signs of a classic long squeeze. Pressure on leveraged positions This has placed pressure on leveraged positions, with major altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) and XRP experiencing 8% to 9% drops. In Solana’s case, the price fell below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), triggering liquidation events to the tune of $19 million. The market has also been plagued by what analysts are calling “narrative fatigue.” Despite ongoing institutional interest, particularly BlackRock’s push for tokenization, the technical damage to altcoins has been significant and difficult to overcome. As the sell-off continues, traders are keeping a close eye on upcoming macroeconomic data, including the U.S. jobs report on November 7, which could further impact market dynamics.

Many are optimistic that institutional money could finally flow should the launch come to pass. Meanwhile, in a separate but connected development, the payments-focused project Remittix (RTX) is experiencing unusual activity; its volume and wallet metrics suggest whales may already be moving in. The question on investors’ lips right now is “ What’s the realistic price path for XRP, and could the real opportunity lie in payments infrastructure?” XRP ETF Launch: Why It Matters and How It Could Move Price According to filings, multiple products are in the pipeline, and the removal of delay clauses in S-1s suggests approvals may be imminent. Historically, when a major ETF launches, it brings new entrants, fresh capital, and renewed market attention. For XRP, this means: A larger pool of institutional buyers is getting access via regulated vehicles Greater legitimacy for XRP’s settlement and payments narrative Potential for a price surge if it triggers inflows similar to those seen with spot BTC/ETH ETFs By the way, technical indicators are cautious but hopeful. As seen in the chart above, price consolidation around the $2.19 to $2.64 band points to a possible breakout if volume spikes. But, as always, ETFs are catalysts, not guarantees. Remittix: Volume Spike Suggests Strategic Positioning Away from Ripple and into Remittix: while XRP may be about to steal the headlines, RTX is quietly behaving like a project with real-world promise and positioning. On-chain and market-data aggregators point to rising wallet accumulation and jump-ups in trading metrics; subtle signals that often precede broader moves. Here’s how to frame the story: XRP’s narrative centres on institutional access and regulated exposure. Remittix’s narrative centres on payments infrastructure and fiat-crypto conversion. If XRP’s ETF launch succeeds, it may trigger a wave of institutional acceptance, and that could benefit infrastructure plays like Remittix. Investors looking deeper than token price alone may see RTX as an under-the-radar play while the bigger spotlight is on XRP. Final Thought: Two Layers, One Opportunity The next few weeks could be deciding for XRP. A successful ETF launch would unlock a new chapter in its story, and that matters. Yet, for investors who look beyond headlines, the remittances and payment-rails layer may be the more interesting long-term angle. In essence, if XRP is the door to institutional crypto-finance, Remittix might be the corridor through which value flows. Now, it doesn’t matter what your investing style is; you might want to pay attention to both, as the former looks suitable for short-term play, while the latter suits long-term players, thanks to its deep underlying infrastructure.

This digital asset, deeply intertwined with the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has captured significant attention from investors and enthusiasts alike. Everyone is asking: What does the future hold for BNB? Is a monumental leap to $1000 a realistic prospect, or is it merely an ambitious dream? This comprehensive guide delves into the factors shaping the Binance Coin price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030, offering insights into its potential trajectory and market standing. Understanding Binance Coin: The Heart of the Binance Ecosystem Before we dive into price forecasts, it is essential to understand what Binance Coin is and its integral role. BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance blockchain ecosystem. Initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network in 2017, it later migrated to its own blockchain, the Binance Chain, and subsequently became central to the BNB Chain (which includes Binance Smart Chain, now BNB Smart Chain). Its primary utility began with discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, but its functions have expanded dramatically. Today, BNB serves multiple purposes: Transaction Fees: Used to pay for transaction fees on the BNB Chain. Trading Fees: Offers discounts on trading fees on the Binance exchange. Staking: Enables participation in network security through staking on BNB Smart Chain. Launchpad Allocations: Grants access to token sales on Binance Launchpad. Decentralized Applications (DApps): Powers various DApps and DeFi protocols built on the BNB Chain. This extensive utility solidifies BNB’s position beyond a mere speculative asset, linking its value closely to the growth and adoption of the broader Binance ecosystem . Binance Coin Price Prediction: Analyzing Key Influencers Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently complex, influenced by a myriad of factors. For Binance Coin price prediction , several key elements come into play: Market Demand and Supply: Like any asset, scarcity and utility drive demand. BNB has a burn mechanism that periodically reduces its supply, aiming to increase its value. Binance Exchange Performance: As the native token of Binance, the exchange’s regulatory standing, user growth, and new product offerings directly impact BNB’s perceived value. BNB Chain Development: The continuous development, scalability, and adoption of the BNB Chain for DApps, DeFi, and NFTs are crucial for BNB’s utility and demand. Regulatory Environment: Global cryptocurrency regulations can significantly affect market sentiment and the operations of exchanges like Binance, thereby impacting BNB. Overall Cryptocurrency Market Trends: BNB often follows the broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin’s performance. A bull market typically lifts all major altcoins, including BNB. Technological Advancements: Innovations within the BNB Chain, such as opBNB for layer-2 scaling, enhance its competitiveness and potential. Will BNB Hit $1000? A Look at the BNB Price Forecast for 2025 The question of whether BNB will hit $1000 is a frequent one among investors. For the BNB price forecast in 2025, several indicators suggest a positive outlook, though volatility remains a constant companion in the crypto space. By 2025, we anticipate several catalysts: Continued Growth of the BNB Chain: The expansion of DApps, GameFi, and DeFi protocols on the BNB Chain could significantly increase demand for BNB as a utility token. Increased Institutional Adoption: As the crypto market matures, more institutional players might enter, bringing substantial capital that could drive up prices for established assets like BNB. Halving Cycle Impact: The post-Bitcoin halving rally typically extends to altcoins, potentially providing a strong tailwind for BNB. Based on current trends and historical data, a conservative estimate for 2025 could see BNB trading within a range of $500 to $750 . However, under extremely bullish conditions, fueled by a strong bull market and significant ecosystem expansion, breaching the $800 mark and even testing the $1000 psychological barrier could become a possibility towards the end of 2025 or early 2026. This would require sustained positive market sentiment and robust fundamental growth. BNB Future Price: Projections for 2026 – 2030 Looking further into the decade, the BNB future price predictions become more speculative but are grounded in long-term trends and potential developments. The period between 2026 and 2030 will be crucial for BNB’s sustained growth. 2026: Sustaining Momentum After a potential bull run, 2026 might see a period of consolidation or continued growth. The market will likely assess the sustainability of the previous year’s gains. If the BNB Chain continues to innovate and attract developers, BNB could stabilize at higher levels. We might see BNB trade between $700 and $950 , with potential spikes above $1000 if market conditions are exceptionally favorable. 2027: Navigating Market Cycles Cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. 2027 could potentially be a bear market year, similar to historical patterns. During such periods, even strong assets like BNB might experience corrections. A realistic range could be between $600 and $850 , though strong utility and adoption could provide a floor against severe drops. 2028: Recovery and Renewed Growth As the next Bitcoin halving approaches, typically around 2028, the market sentiment often shifts. This period could mark the beginning of a new uptrend. Increased utility of BNB in emerging Web3 applications, metaverse projects, and further DeFi integration could drive demand. BNB could potentially re-test and surpass previous highs, aiming for $900 to $1200 . 2029 – 2030: The Path to Greater Heights? By the end of the decade, the cryptocurrency landscape is expected to be far more integrated into mainstream finance and technology. For BNB future price to reach and sustain levels significantly above $1000, several conditions must be met: Dominant Ecosystem: The BNB Chain must maintain its position as a leading blockchain for DApps, potentially competing more fiercely with Ethereum, Solana, and other layer-1 solutions. Regulatory Clarity: A more defined and favorable global regulatory framework would reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Technological Innovation: Continuous innovation in scalability, security, and user experience on the BNB Chain will be paramount. If these factors align, BNB could realistically aim for price targets between $1200 and $1800 by 2030. Under an extremely bullish scenario, with Binance maintaining its market leadership and the BNB Chain becoming a cornerstone of the decentralized web, a price exceeding $2000 is not entirely out of the question, though it represents an optimistic upper bound. BNB Price Prediction Table (2025-2030) Here’s a summary of potential price ranges for BNB, based on various market conditions: Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2025 500 650 1000 2026 700 850 1150 2027 600 750 900 2028 900 1100 1400 2029 1100 1350 1700 2030 1200 1500 2000+ Disclaimer: These are speculative predictions and should not be taken as financial advice. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. The Role of Binance Ecosystem Growth in BNB’s Value The success of BNB is inextricably linked to the robust and expanding Binance ecosystem . This ecosystem is not just the exchange; it is a sprawling network of services and platforms that create demand and utility for BNB. Key components contributing to BNB’s value include: Binance Exchange: As the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, its continued dominance and expansion into new markets directly benefits BNB. BNB Chain (BNB Smart Chain, BNB Beacon Chain, opBNB): This multi-chain architecture provides a scalable and cost-effective platform for decentralized applications. Its growth in user base, transaction volume, and deployed DApps is a direct driver of BNB utility. Binance Launchpad and Launchpool: These platforms allow users to participate in new token launches by holding or staking BNB, creating consistent demand. Binance Pay: A contactless, borderless, and secure cryptocurrency payment technology that further integrates BNB into everyday transactions. NFT Marketplace: Binance’s foray into NFTs provides another avenue for BNB utility within the digital collectibles space. Binance Labs: The venture capital arm of Binance invests in promising blockchain projects, many of which build on the BNB Chain, fostering ecosystem growth. The continuous innovation and expansion of these facets ensure that BNB remains a cornerstone of a dynamic and evolving digital economy. Cryptocurrency Market Analysis: Broader Trends Affecting BNB No single cryptocurrency exists in a vacuum. A thorough cryptocurrency market analysis is vital to understanding BNB’s potential trajectory. Broader market trends, macroeconomic factors, and technological shifts play significant roles. Bitcoin’s Dominance: Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire crypto market. A strong Bitcoin bull run typically pulls altcoins, including BNB, upwards. Conversely, a Bitcoin correction can trigger broader market downturns. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape: Increasing regulatory scrutiny or clarity from governments worldwide can either boost confidence or create FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Regulations around stablecoins, DeFi, and exchanges like Binance will directly impact BNB. Technological Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive. Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche are constantly innovating. BNB Chain must continue to offer competitive advantages in terms of speed, cost, and developer tools to maintain its market share. Institutional Adoption: The entry of traditional financial institutions into crypto, offering products like spot Bitcoin ETFs, legitimizes the asset class and can bring in substantial capital, benefiting the broader market. Investors must consider these macro factors when forming their own BNB price forecast , as they can significantly alter even the most robust fundamental analysis. Investing in BNB: Actionable Insights For those considering an investment in BNB, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on predictions. Understand the technology, the team, the use cases, and the risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Spread your investments across various cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy can mitigate the impact of market volatility. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news regarding Binance, the BNB Chain, regulatory developments, and broader market trends. Understand the Risks: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. Prices can go down as well as up, and you could lose your entire investment. Challenges and Opportunities for BNB’s Future While the outlook for BNB appears promising, it faces both significant challenges and abundant opportunities. Challenges: Regulatory Headwinds: Binance, and by extension BNB, has faced regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions. Ongoing regulatory scrutiny could impact its operations and market sentiment. Centralization Concerns: Critics often point to the perceived centralization of the BNB Chain compared to other decentralized networks. Competition: The layer-1 blockchain space is fiercely competitive, with new innovations constantly emerging from rival networks. Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, BNB is subject to extreme price swings, which can be daunting for investors. Opportunities: Continued Ecosystem Expansion: Growth in DeFi, GameFi, Web3, and NFT sectors on the BNB Chain can drive increased utility. Technological Advancements: Further scaling solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and enhanced security features can solidify BNB Chain’s position. Emerging Markets: Binance’s strong presence in developing economies offers significant growth potential as crypto adoption expands globally. Burn Mechanism: The regular burning of BNB tokens reduces supply, which can be a deflationary force supporting price appreciation over time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Binance Coin Price Prediction Q1: What factors influence the Binance Coin price prediction? A1: Key factors include the overall cryptocurrency market trends (especially Bitcoin’s performance), the growth and adoption of the Binance exchange and BNB Chain ecosystem, regulatory developments, the token’s utility (e.g., transaction fees, staking, launchpad access), and the BNB token burn mechanism. Q2: Will BNB reach $1000 by 2025? A2: While highly optimistic, hitting $1000 by 2025 is within the realm of possibility under extremely bullish market conditions and significant growth in the Binance ecosystem. More conservative estimates place it in the $500-$750 range, with potential to test higher levels. Q3: What is the long-term outlook for BNB (2026-2030)? A3: The long-term outlook for BNB is generally positive, assuming continued innovation and adoption of the BNB Chain and the broader Binance ecosystem. Predictions suggest BNB could range from $1200 to over $2000 by 2030, though this depends heavily on market cycles and regulatory clarity. Q4: How does the BNB Chain compare to Ethereum or Solana? A4: The BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain) offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Ethereum , making it attractive for certain DApps and users. However, Ethereum is generally considered more decentralized and has a larger developer community. Solana also boasts high speeds and low costs, competing directly with BNB Chain for market share. Each has its unique strengths and trade-offs. Q5: Who founded Binance and BNB? A5: Binance and BNB were founded by Changpeng Zhao (CZ) in 2017. Conclusion: Unlocking BNB’s Future Potential The journey of Binance Coin (BNB) from a utility token to a powerhouse in the crypto world is a testament to the strength and innovation of the Binance ecosystem. While the question of whether BNB will hit $1000 or even higher marks by 2030 involves considerable speculation, the underlying fundamentals suggest a strong potential for growth. Its deep integration into one of the largest crypto platforms, coupled with the continuous expansion and technological advancements of the BNB Chain , positions it favorably for the coming years. Investors must approach these predictions with caution, understanding the inherent volatility and risks of the cryptocurrency market. However, for those seeking exposure to a robust ecosystem with significant utility and a proven track record, BNB presents a compelling case. The path to new all-time highs and beyond will be paved by ongoing innovation, broader adoption, and a favorable regulatory environment, making BNB a fascinating asset to watch in the evolving digital economy.

According to analyst Ali Martinez, citing data from Santiment , wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE have sold around one billion coins in the past seven days, triggering a sharp market correction that wiped approximately $5 billion from the meme coin’s market capitalization. DOGE whales sell-off. Source: Ali Martinez On-chain metrics show steady outflows from this whale cohort since mid-October, a group often associated with early accumulators and market makers. Their sustained selling has coincided with Dogecoin’s slide below the 18-cent threshold, suggesting that institutional and large private investors are taking profits or repositioning ahead of broader market volatility. At the start of last week, Dogecoin’s market capitalization stood at roughly $30.6 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data reviewed by Finbold. By November 4, that figure had fallen to $25.1 billion, reflecting a weekly decline of more than 17%. Over the same period, DOGE’s price tumbled to $0.1657, marking a 4.75% drop in the past 24 hours and underperforming the broader cryptocurrency market, which fell by about 3.7%. DOGE 1-week market cap. Source. CoinMarketCap Why is Dogecoin price crashing? The decline appears to have been exacerbated by a combination of market-wide liquidations, whale short positions, and a key technical breakdown. More than $1.36 billion in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated in the past day, with Dogecoin among the hardest-hit altcoins. One trader reportedly netted over $36 million shorting DOGE, Ethereum, and several other major tokens. The coin also slipped through a crucial support zone near $0.18, triggering a cascade of automated sell-offs across major exchanges. Despite the slump, trading activity surged, with daily volume rising by more than 90% to $3.9 billion. The spike suggests that while whales are exiting, retail traders may be attempting to capitalize on volatility or accumulate at lower levels.

It also comes as Berachain validators voted on Monday to halt the network after exposure to a vulnerability tied to the Balancer V2 exploit. According to the project’s core team, this decision was taken as an emergency step following the Balancer attack. The Berachain Foundation stated that: The Berachain validators have coordinated to purposefully halt the network as the core team performs an emergency hard fork to address Balancer V2-related exploits on the BEX. The halt has been executed purposefully, and the network will be operational shortly upon recovering all affected funds. BEX is currently the biggest decentralized exchange on Berachain and holds over $50 million worth of BERA tokens. The issue originated from the same Balancer vault access control flaw that enabled attackers to drain tens of millions of assets from liquidity pools on Monday. The attack saw over $100 million worth of various tokens drained from the Balancer DeFi platform. According to the Berachain Foundation, the network halt will allow developers to roll out an emergency hard fork to isolate compromised contracts and recover affected assets before resuming operations.

Imagine a future where your digital asset holdings aren’t just cryptocurrencies, but also include tangible assets and even digital currencies issued by central banks. This expansion is not just a possibility; CertiK’s 2025 Skynet Digital Asset Treasury Strategy report highlights it as an inevitable next step, pushing the boundaries of traditional digital asset management. Why Are Crypto Treasury Strategies Expanding Beyond Traditional Crypto? CertiK’s report points to a pivotal shift: the global crypto industry is moving into an era of clearer regulations. This newfound clarity is largely driven by landmark legislation like the CLARITY Act in the U.S. and the comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in the European Union. These regulations provide a much-needed framework, making it safer and more predictable for institutions to engage with digital assets. For companies managing digital asset treasuries, this regulatory environment is a game-changer. Those who proactively prioritize security and compliance are poised to secure significant market leadership. This isn’t just about following rules; it’s about building trust and stability in a rapidly maturing industry. Embracing Real-World Assets (RWA) and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) The core of CertiK’s prediction is the integration of Real-World Assets (RWA) and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) into crypto treasury strategies . But what exactly do these terms mean? Real-World Assets (RWA): These are physical or traditional financial assets, such as real estate, commodities, or even company equity, that are tokenized and brought onto a blockchain. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and easier transfer of these assets. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): These are digital forms of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and represent a direct liability of the central bank, offering a stable and regulated digital currency option. The inclusion of RWA and CBDCs offers compelling benefits. It provides diversification, potentially reducing volatility inherent in pure cryptocurrency portfolios. Furthermore, it bridges the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world, opening up new avenues for institutional adoption and stability in crypto treasury strategies . Security and AI: The Future Foundation for Robust Crypto Treasury Strategies As the digital asset landscape broadens, the emphasis on security and advanced technology intensifies. CertiK stresses that a strong security posture, coupled with unwavering compliance, will be non-negotiable for any successful digital asset treasury. Moreover, CertiK anticipates that AI-powered regulatory monitoring will become an industry standard. This means that artificial intelligence will play a crucial role in helping companies navigate complex regulatory frameworks, identify potential compliance issues, and ensure adherence to evolving standards. This technological leap signals a new phase for the digital asset treasury market, one firmly centered on operational stability and risk mitigation for all crypto treasury strategies . What Are the Key Benefits and Challenges of This Expansion? Expanding crypto treasury strategies to include RWA and CBDCs brings both exciting opportunities and potential hurdles: Benefits: Enhanced Stability: Integrating less volatile assets like RWA and CBDCs can help stabilize overall treasury portfolios. Diversification: Spreading assets across different categories reduces reliance on single asset classes, mitigating risk. Increased Liquidity: Tokenization of RWA can unlock liquidity for otherwise illiquid assets. Broader Adoption: The familiarity of RWA and the backing of CBDCs can attract more traditional institutions to the digital asset space. Challenges: Regulatory Complexity: Navigating diverse legal frameworks for RWA and CBDCs across different jurisdictions remains a significant challenge. Technical Integration: Seamlessly integrating various asset types onto blockchain platforms requires robust technological solutions. Security Risks: While security is paramount, new integrations can introduce new vulnerabilities if not managed expertly. Valuation Issues: Accurately valuing tokenized RWA and ensuring fair market practices can be intricate. Actionable Insights for Modern Digital Asset Treasuries For organizations looking to future-proof their crypto treasury strategies , CertiK’s report offers clear direction. It is no longer enough to simply hold cryptocurrencies; a more sophisticated approach is required. Prioritize Compliance: Stay ahead of regulatory changes and build robust compliance frameworks. Embrace AI: Invest in AI-powered tools for regulatory monitoring and risk management. Explore RWA and CBDCs: Begin researching and understanding how these assets can integrate into your treasury. Strengthen Security: Continuously audit and enhance your digital asset security protocols. These steps are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring the long-term viability of your digital asset holdings. The Future is Diversified and Secure CertiK’s bold prediction paints a clear picture: the future of crypto treasury strategies is one of diversification, regulation, and advanced technology. As the digital asset market matures, the integration of Real-World Assets and Central Bank Digital Currencies will become standard practice, driven by a global push for regulatory clarity and enhanced security. Companies that embrace these shifts, prioritizing compliance and leveraging AI, will not only navigate this evolving landscape successfully but will also lead the way in shaping the next generation of digital asset management. This expansion promises a more stable, secure, and integrated financial ecosystem for all. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Treasury Strategies Q1: What are Real-World Assets (RWA) in the context of crypto treasury strategies? A1: Real-World Assets (RWA) are tangible or traditional financial assets, such as real estate, art, or even company shares, that are tokenized and represented on a blockchain. This allows for their digital ownership, transfer, and integration into digital asset portfolios. Q2: How do Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) differ from cryptocurrencies? A2: CBDCs are digital versions of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank, making them centralized and stable. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are generally decentralized, not backed by a central authority, and their value is determined by market dynamics. Q3: Why is regulatory clarity important for the expansion of crypto treasury strategies? A3: Regulatory clarity provides a predictable and secure environment for institutions to operate. It reduces legal uncertainties, encourages mainstream adoption, and fosters trust, which is crucial for integrating new asset classes like RWA and CBDCs into digital treasuries. Q4: How will AI impact digital asset treasury management? A4: AI is expected to become an industry standard for regulatory monitoring. It will help companies track and comply with complex regulations, identify potential risks, and ensure operational stability, making crypto treasury strategies more efficient and secure. Q5: What are the main benefits of including RWA and CBDCs in a digital asset treasury? A5: The main benefits include enhanced portfolio stability, greater diversification, increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets, and broader institutional adoption of digital asset management.

Get ready for a significant update in the crypto trading world! Binance, a leading global exchange, has announced an exciting new listing: MMT perpetual futures . Starting today, traders can access MMT/USDT and MMT/USDC margin pairs, alongside MMT/USDT perpetual futures, offering an impressive leverage of up to 50x. This development opens up new avenues for experienced traders looking to capitalize on market movements. What are MMT Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? At its core, MMT perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of MMT without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not have an expiry date, giving traders more flexibility. This new listing on Binance is crucial for several reasons: Increased Liquidity: The availability of MMT on a major exchange like Binance, especially with perpetual futures, typically brings greater liquidity to the asset. Enhanced Trading Opportunities: Traders can now go long or short on MMT, enabling them to profit from both rising and falling prices. Market Exposure: It provides a new way for investors to gain exposure to MMT without the complexities of spot trading. How Does 50x Leverage Amplify Your Trading with MMT Perpetual Futures? The introduction of up to 50x leverage for MMT perpetual futures means traders can control a much larger position with a relatively small amount of capital. For instance, with 50x leverage, a $100 investment can control a $5,000 position. While leverage can significantly amplify potential profits, it is vital to understand that it also magnifies potential losses. A small adverse price movement can lead to a rapid liquidation of your position. Therefore, responsible use of leverage is paramount for any trader engaging with MMT perpetual futures . Experienced traders often employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, to mitigate the inherent risks associated with high leverage. Always trade within your means and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Navigating the New MMT Perpetual Futures Market Entering the MMT perpetual futures market requires careful consideration and a well-thought-out strategy. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this new opportunity: Research MMT: Understand the project behind MMT, its use cases, and market sentiment. Fundamental analysis remains crucial even for derivatives. Start Small: If you are new to perpetual futures or MMT, begin with smaller position sizes to gain experience without taking on excessive risk. Implement Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders. Consider taking profits at predefined targets to secure gains. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and announcements that could impact MMT’s price. Volatility is a constant in crypto. Binance’s decision to list these pairs underscores the growing interest and demand for diversified trading instruments within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This move provides a dynamic platform for traders to engage with MMT. Ready to Trade MMT Perpetual Futures? The listing of MMT perpetual futures on Binance presents an exciting opportunity for traders seeking high-leverage options. However, success in this volatile market hinges on a clear understanding of the instruments, disciplined risk management, and continuous market analysis. Remember, while the potential for significant gains is attractive, the risks are equally substantial.

Binance is making these new margin pairs and perpetual futures available starting at 12:00 p.m. UTC today. Ensure you are prepared before diving into the action.

Trust Wallet, the world’s leading self-custody Web3 wallet with over 210 million users, today announced the launch of Trust Premium, a new loyalty program that rewards users for their ongoing activity inside the wallet. Trust Premium recognizes Web3 participation, whether swapping, staking, funding, or simply holding assets, and turns it into lasting benefits through a tier system powered by Trust XPs and Trust Wallet Token (TWT). Trust Premium addresses a core gap in self-custody: while users own their assets, their loyalty has historically gone unrecognized. Early Quest programs across Web3 generated excitement but rarely offered meaningful progression or enduring rewards. Trust Premium shifts loyalty from “earn and forget” to “earn and unlock”; giving every action lasting value, visible progress, and real utility. With Trust Premium, users earn Trust XPs from everyday actions in Trust Wallet and progress through Bronze → Silver → Gold tiers. Holding or locking TWT strengthens and maintains higher tiers, unlocking immediate, in-wallet benefits such as gas and fee savings, and soon exclusive access to Trust Alpha, campaigns and airdrops, and evolving partner rewards. “In Web3, Trust deserves value. Trust Premium recognizes the journey every Trust Wallet user takes. Whether someone is swapping daily or simply safeguarding their assets, our users’ actions now build real progress and unlock meaningful benefits – all while remaining fully self-custodial,” said Eowyn Chen, CEO of Trust Wallet. How trust premium works Earn trust XPs Users collect XPs (Experience Points) from everyday actions, including daily check-ins, swapping, and funding the wallet. Level up through tiers XPs accumulate over time. Users progress from Bronze → Silver → Gold, with each tier unlocking higher benefits. Boost with TWT Holding or locking TWT amplifies XP progress and lets unlock higher tiers, and so provides access to deeper benefits, exclusive campaigns, and early product access. Unlock benefits seamlessly in-app Benefits are applied automatically, including: Gas fee savings 0 gas fee on swapping to TWT Discounted swap fees (limiter offer; where supported) Priority access to Trust Alpha and feature experiments – coming soon Access to exclusive campaigns,partner offers & more – coming soon “Trust Premium makes loyalty visible,” Chen continued. Your actions, your progress, your rewards; all onchain and owned by you. This is loyalty built for Web3. Trust Premium begins rolling out today across supported regions. Users can access the Premium dashboard in Trust Wallet to view their XPs, tier status, tasks, and upcoming benefits. About Trust Wallet Trust Wallet is the secure, self-custody Web3 wallet and gateway for people who want to fully own, control, and leverage the power of their digital assets. From beginners to experienced users, Trust Wallet makes it easier, safer, and convenient for millions of people around the world to experience Web3, access dApps securely, store and manage their crypto and NFTs, as well as buy, sell, and stake crypto to earn rewards — all in one place and without limits.

After a remarkable surge, followed by periods of intense volatility, investors and enthusiasts alike are now looking to the horizon, asking a pivotal question: What does the future hold for this high-performance blockchain? Specifically, is a SOL price target of $500 within reach, and what will its journey look like through 2025, 2026, and up to 2030? Our comprehensive Solana price prediction dives deep into the technology, ecosystem, and market dynamics shaping the path of SOL crypto . What is Solana and Why the Hype Around SOL Crypto ? Solana emerged as a formidable contender in the blockchain space, often touted as an ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its exceptional speed and low transaction costs. At its core, Solana leverages a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of History (PoH) , which works in conjunction with Proof of Stake (PoS) . This innovative combination allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), significantly outperforming many legacy blockchains. The hype surrounding SOL crypto is multi-faceted: Scalability: Solana’s architecture is designed for massive scale, making it ideal for high-throughput applications like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming. Low Fees: Transaction costs on Solana are typically fractions of a cent, a stark contrast to the often-high gas fees seen on other networks. Developer Activity: A vibrant and growing developer community continues to build innovative projects on the Solana blockchain, expanding its utility and ecosystem. Institutional Interest: Major players in the traditional finance world have shown increasing interest in Solana, recognizing its technological advantages and potential. Understanding these fundamental strengths is crucial for any credible Solana analysis and for projecting its long-term viability and price potential. A Look Back: Solana’s Journey and Key Milestones Solana’s journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster. Launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko , the network quickly gained traction, experiencing explosive growth during the 2021 bull run. Its rapid ascent was fueled by its technological prowess and a burgeoning ecosystem of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces. However, Solana also faced significant challenges: Network Outages: A series of network outages in 2022 raised concerns about its stability and decentralization, impacting investor confidence. FTX Collapse: The collapse of the FTX exchange, a major backer and investor in the Solana ecosystem, dealt a severe blow to the project, causing a dramatic price correction for SOL crypto . Despite these setbacks, Solana demonstrated remarkable resilience. The community and developers at Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation rallied, implementing critical upgrades and fostering new growth. This resilience is a key factor in our ongoing Solana analysis and our optimistic outlook for its future trajectory. Solana Price Prediction 2025: What Factors Will Drive Growth? Looking towards 2025, several critical factors will influence the Solana price prediction . The cryptocurrency market is maturing, and fundamental utility is becoming increasingly important for sustained growth. For Solana, these drivers include: Ecosystem Expansion: Continued growth in decentralized applications (DApps), especially in gaming, DeFi, and social media, will drive demand for SOL. Projects like Saga phone integrating web3 natively could be a significant catalyst. Network Stability & Upgrades: Successful implementation of upgrades like Firedancer, aimed at improving network reliability and throughput, will restore investor confidence and attract more institutional capital. Macroeconomic Conditions: A favorable global economic environment, with lower inflation and interest rates, typically encourages risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption: As more financial institutions explore blockchain technology, Solana’s speed and efficiency make it an attractive platform for various enterprise solutions. Given these factors, a conservative yet optimistic Solana price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential range: Minimum Price: $150 – $180 Average Price: $200 – $250 Maximum Price: $300 – $350 These figures are contingent on the broader market remaining bullish and Solana successfully executing its roadmap. Beyond 2025: Charting the SOL Price Target for 2026-2030 Projecting cryptocurrency prices several years into the future involves inherent uncertainties, but by analyzing trends, technological advancements, and market cycles, we can outline potential trajectories for the SOL price target . The period from 2026 to 2030 is expected to see further mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. Here’s a possible breakdown of the Solana price prediction for these years: Year Minimum SOL Price Target Average SOL Price Target Maximum SOL Price Target 2026 $280 $350 $420 2027 $380 $480 $580 2028 $450 $550 $680 2029 $520 $650 $800 2030 $600 $750 $950+ These projections are based on the assumption that Solana continues to innovate, maintains network stability, and expands its global footprint. A significant bull market, driven by increased institutional investment and widespread retail adoption, could push the SOL price target even higher, potentially breaching the $1000 mark by the end of the decade. Unlocking Solana’s Future : Technology, Ecosystem, and Adoption The true potential of Solana’s future lies in its continuous technological evolution and the vibrancy of its ecosystem. The development of projects like Firedancer, a new validator client, is critical. Firedancer aims to drastically improve Solana’s throughput and resilience, directly addressing past concerns about network stability. Key areas contributing to Solana’s future growth: DeFi Innovation: Solana’s low fees and high speed make it an ideal environment for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and other complex DeFi applications that require rapid transaction finality. NFTs and Gaming: The network’s efficiency has made it a popular choice for NFT projects and blockchain-based games, which demand high transaction volumes and low latency. The rise of GameFi on Solana is a significant growth driver. Mobile Integration: The Solana Saga phone represents a bold move into mobile web3 integration, aiming to onboard the next billion users by making crypto interactions seamless and native to mobile devices. Enterprise Solutions: Corporations are increasingly exploring blockchain for supply chain management, tokenization of real-world assets, and payment systems. Solana’s enterprise-grade performance positions it well for these applications. The cumulative effect of these developments will bolster the utility and demand for SOL crypto , forming the bedrock of any optimistic Solana price prediction . Challenges and Risks: What Could Hinder SOL Crypto ‘s Ascent? While the outlook for Solana is largely positive, it is imperative to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impede the ascent of SOL crypto . No investment is without its potential pitfalls, and Solana is no exception. Primary concerns include: Network Stability: Despite improvements, the perception of past outages lingers. Any future significant downtime could severely impact confidence and the SOL price target . Regulatory Scrutiny: The cryptocurrency industry faces increasing regulatory oversight globally. Unfavorable regulations, particularly in major markets, could impact Solana’s operations and adoption. Competition: Solana operates in a highly competitive landscape, facing strong rivals like Ethereum (especially with its scalability upgrades) and other high-performance blockchains such as Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. Centralization Concerns: Some critics argue that Solana’s high hardware requirements for validators could lead to centralization, which is antithetical to the core principles of blockchain. Market Volatility: The broader crypto market remains highly volatile. A significant downturn in Bitcoin’s price or a ‘crypto winter’ could drag down even strong altcoins like SOL. A thorough Solana analysis must weigh these risks against its potential benefits to provide a balanced perspective. Expert Insights and Solana Analysis : What Are the Pros Saying? Many prominent analysts and venture capitalists remain bullish on Solana’s long-term prospects. Their Solana analysis often highlights the network’s technical superiority and its potential to capture a significant share of the Web3 market. Common themes from expert opinions: Technological Edge: Experts frequently praise Solana’s throughput and low transaction costs as key competitive advantages that will drive adoption. Developer Ecosystem: The robust and growing developer community is seen as a strong indicator of future innovation and network utility. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major brands and integration into mainstream applications are viewed as crucial for expanding Solana’s reach. Resilience: The ability of Solana to recover from significant setbacks (like the FTX collapse) is often cited as a testament to its underlying strength and community support. While individual price targets vary, the consensus among many seasoned observers is that Solana is a strong contender for long-term growth, with its technology positioning it favorably for the next wave of crypto adoption. This reinforces the potential for a high SOL price target in the coming years. Is $500 the Next Realistic SOL Price Target ? The question of whether $500 is a realistic SOL price target is at the forefront of many investors’ minds. Based on our Solana price prediction and the factors discussed, achieving $500 for SOL is certainly within the realm of possibility, particularly by 2027 or 2028, and even sooner under optimal market conditions. Consider the following: Historical Precedent: During the 2021 bull run, Solana reached an all-time high of approximately $260. A move to $500 would represent roughly a 2x increase from that peak, which is not uncommon for leading altcoins in a strong bull market. Market Cap Implications: At a price of $500, Solana’s market capitalization would place it among the top cryptocurrencies, potentially challenging Ethereum for market share in certain use cases. This requires significant capital inflow and sustained demand. Utility and Adoption: The $500 mark will largely depend on Solana’s ability to continue expanding its utility, attracting more users, and onboarding enterprise solutions. If it becomes a dominant platform for Web3 gaming, DeFi, and payments, the demand for SOL crypto will naturally drive its value. While not guaranteed, the confluence of technological advancement, ecosystem growth, and a favorable macroeconomic environment makes $500 a highly plausible SOL price target in the medium to long term. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Solana Market For those considering an investment in SOL crypto or looking to understand its trajectory, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research beyond price predictions. Understand Solana’s technology, team, competitors, and roadmap. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and averages out your purchase price over time. Monitor Ecosystem Growth: Keep an eye on new projects launching on Solana, significant partnerships, and developer activity. A thriving ecosystem is a strong indicator of health. Stay Informed on Network Upgrades: Follow announcements from Solana Labs and the Solana Foundation regarding critical upgrades like Firedancer. These can significantly impact network performance and investor confidence. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single asset. Diversification helps spread risk across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes. Utilize Reputable Exchanges: Buy SOL crypto from established and regulated exchanges like Binance or Coinbase to ensure security and liquidity.

Crypto = range city: BTC and ETH both sat between big support and big resistance , producing fake-outs in both directions. Alts: First things first : Alts got absolutely murdered and chart structures have not yet been fixed. So pick your spots: with sentiment bruised after the Oct 10 liquidations, outliers with clean narratives (e.g., ZEC, HYPE, TAO ) drew the focus while newer names ( XPL ) showed how unforgiving this tape can be. Playbook: stay objective, trade the range, let leaders confirm strength and keep risk tight until the market chooses a direction . This is a good time to get comfortable with trading less. Vibe check October is often “Uptober,” but this one felt more like Down-tober . After the Oct 10 flush and a lot of chop since, the big question on the space: was it just coming up for air or did it mark a warning for the rest of the year? Macro in a minute US–China: rising trade-tension headlines framed Oct 10’s wobble; recent diplomacy cooled things a touch, but sentiment remains cautious. The Fed: a highly priced-in 25 bps cut landed, but Chair Powell’s “ December isn’t a foregone conclusion ” tone clipped risk appetite. Data and earnings: a delayed CPI came in softer; bank results started strong; big tech was mixed; crypto-adjacent names ( Coinbase, MicroStrategy ) printed decent numbers. AI remains the equity market’s locomotive. Bottom line: the macro backdrop leans constructive , but the path is jagged . “It doesn’t want to go up, but it’s not going down either. So… we’re chopping.” BTC: respect the range Higher-timeframe lens: through this cycle, BTC has often based around the 3-day 100EMA . We’ve logged about three weeks ping-ponging in that neighborhood. Structure: every dip into the support band has bounced, yet pushes into ~114–116 have repeatedly faded. What would help Bullish: reclaim the EMA cluster and hold above ~116 (roughly mid-range) to show trend intent. Bearish: a clean break and time spent below the June-low area (~ high-90s/low-100s ) without swift buy-back would dent the cycle case. Read: it’s a range. Treat it like one. ETH: same song, slightly softer Correlation with BTC remains high, but ETH’s structure looked a touch weaker on the Space: reclaim attempts have been less convincing, and EMAs still point down. Do business where it’s clean — either a proper flush and reclaim of obvious lows or a decisive EMA flip back up. Until then, patience. Alts: narratives or nothing Context: Oct 10 underscored the lack of bids down the tail. With majors undecided, broad “max-long alts” is not the base case. How the hosts bucketed things: Most alts — broke structure on Oct 10 and are lingering near lows without leadership. New launches (e.g., XPL) — harsh lesson in how unforgiving the current tape is. Clean-narrative outliers — still tradable with discipline: ZEC (Zcash): textbook strength out of a long consolidation; respected MAs even through the dump. Coming into multi-year resistance (2017/2021 reference points). No hero shorts; longs must accept rug-risk at inflection. HYPE: range-respecting outperformer. Attempts above range high failed cleanly; now mid-range retest is the tell. Leaders like this often front-run risk-on or warn when they can’t reclaim. TAO: strong relative trend; mid-range + yearly open acting as the gate. A hold or reclaim signals “risk can expand.” A deviate-and-fail says “not yet.” “If the outperformers can’t break out or hold support, the rest probably isn’t worth your attention.” Levels and triggers the hosts are watching BTC Support: the post-flush base area (the hosts’ composite around 106 repeatedly defended) and the June-low zone (~ high-90s/low-100s ). Resistance: the EMA stack and ~116 (mid-range). ETH Similar map: clustered EMA resistance + HTF range resistance + Q/O overhead; interest only on a clean sweep and reclaim lower down or a decisive flip back to uptrend. Leaders (ZEC / HYPE / TAO) ZEC at multi-year supply HYPE around mid-range TAO battling mid-range + yearly open Trading playbook Accept the regime: it’s range and chop until the market proves otherwise. Be selective: IF you trade , favor leaders with narratives over “everything beta.” Let price speak: wait for reclaims , closes and time-based confirmation ; avoid anticipating breakouts. Defensive sizing: keep risk tight and take profits ; this tape punishes overstaying. What’s next November often skews constructive, but October reminded us that seasonality isn’t a guarantee . With less fresh data flow and lingering macro watch-items, focus on levels , leadership and how quickly dips get bought or tops get sold . “Stay objective.

54021656,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=852644,1762257742,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54021656.jpeg,Stream Finance suspends deposits and withdrawals after $93M Stream Fund assets loss,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stream-finance-discloses-93m-loss/,"Stream Finance has reported that an external fund manager under its umbrella has disclosed a $93 million loss in Stream Fund assets. The loss prompted the DeFi protocol to temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals until the investigations, led by attorneys from Perkins Coie LLP, are completed. Stream Finance, which runs DeFi strategies, has also declared that it will withdraw all liquid assets pending the investigation. The news led to the company’s Staked Stream USD (XUSD) continuing to fall sharply, from $0.86 to $0.30, before further plunging to $0.24, according to Coingecko’s XUSD chart. The XUSD has lost approximately 76% of its value in the past 24 hours, and roughly 72.09% since Stream Finance’s announcement this morning. It is currently trading at $0.28 as of the time of publication. The company stated that it expects the investigations to be concluded soon, with a commitment to keep stakeholders informed. Periodic updates will be provided as and when new information becomes available. The DeFi protocol emphasized that any pending deposits and withdrawals will also not be processed before the investigation is closed. It has frozen over $160 million in user deposits. Stream Finance launches legal investigations In response to the loss disclosure, the company is engaging attorneys from Perkins Coie LLP to examine the incident and investigate the missing funds thoroughly. Stream Finance says its decision to retain Perkins Coie LLP reflects its unwavering commitment to strong corporate governance and transparency. Concerns about the company’s accounting had reportedly surfaced days before the collapse, when a discrepancy was noted between its published TVL and DeFiLlama’s data. The difference suggested potential mismanagement, or worse, hidden leverage. Stream Finance’s community reportedly speculates the fund manager may have used customer deposits for risky investments. Meanwhile, the protocol has not shared any evidence of a hack or external malicious attacks, suggesting the problem may have been internal, stemming from poor risk controls, human error, or unauthorized trading. The protocol offers users yield farming opportunities via access to market-making services and delta-neutral strategies. Operations focus on trading through DeFi solutions and DEX, and users may incur performance fees of up to 10%. However, DeFiLlama’s data shows that its TVL (total value locked) nosedived from $204 million in late October to roughly $98 million. XUSD’s depegging increases chaos across the industry PeckShield flagged the depegged XUSD first, noting that the XUSD had deviated from its peg by over 60%. The stablecoin’s depegging has reportedly caused ripples throughout the industry, especially for the Euler crypto lending protocol. There are concerns that the protocol’s oracle may not have been updated on time after the depegging, potentially leading to bad debt. The deviation currently fluctuates between 60% and 70%, as per Coingecko data. Stream Finance is reportedly the second yield-focused DeFi protocol to encounter major issues in just 24 hours, following Balancer’s loss of over $100 million to hackers. Nansen analysts were among the first to flag the exploit that transferred wstETH, WETH, and osETH to an unknown account for several hours. Meanwhile, the co-founder and CEO of Trading Strategy, Mikko Ohtamaa, suggested that a faulty smart-contract check was to blame. He pointed out that concurrent transactions were altering internal balance accounting. A recent PeckShield report also revealed that 20 major DeFi platforms were exploited in September alone, leading to a collective loss of over $127 million. However, September’s loss across DeFi platforms represents a 22% decline from August’s loss of $163 million. Meanwhile, total DeFi-related losses in 2025 amount to slightly over $3 billion, with the Bunni DEX being one of the adversely affected casualties. Bunni completely shut down after reportedly losing over $8 million to hackers, which left the company unable to cover new security audit costs. The DEX, however, announced that its users can still withdraw their assets. Token holders will get the remaining treasury funds.

Yet, the traditional finance realm, particularly the foreign exchange (FX) market, also grapples with significant swings. Recently, a major player, Deutsche Bank , has offered a compelling outlook: a notable decrease in FX volatility as the lingering effects of the Trump era dissipate. This shift could signal a period of greater stability, influencing everything from global trade to investment strategies, and even offering a comparative perspective for crypto enthusiasts observing broader financial landscapes. What is FX Volatility and Why Does it Matter for Everyone? FX volatility refers to the rate at which the value of a currency pair fluctuates over a given period. High volatility means prices are moving rapidly and unpredictably, while low volatility suggests more stable, predictable price movements. For businesses engaged in international trade, high volatility can erode profit margins through unexpected currency swings. For investors and traders, it presents both opportunities for quick gains and risks of significant losses. In the broader global economy, sustained periods of high FX volatility can deter foreign investment, complicate central bank policies, and even impact a nation’s economic stability. Impact on Businesses: Companies with international operations face currency risk. A sudden depreciation of a foreign currency can make imports more expensive or reduce the value of export earnings when converted back to the home currency. Impact on Investors: Forex traders thrive on volatility, but excessive or unpredictable swings can lead to stop-loss triggers and rapid capital erosion. Long-term investors prefer stability for clearer planning. Impact on Central Banks: Central banks often intervene in currency markets to manage volatility, aiming to stabilize their economies and maintain price stability. Deutsche Bank ‘s Insight: A Calmer Horizon for Currencies According to Deutsche Bank ‘s recent analysis, the global foreign exchange market is entering a phase of reduced volatility. Their economists point to several key factors contributing to this outlook. After years of significant political and economic uncertainty, a return to more predictable policy environments and a clearer global economic trajectory are paving the way for calmer currency movements. This assessment is particularly significant coming from one of the world’s largest foreign exchange dealers, whose insights often influence market sentiment and trading strategies. The bank’s research highlights a shift from reactive, event-driven market movements to more fundamental, economic-data-driven trends. This implies that while specific economic releases will still move markets, the overarching narrative will be less dominated by unexpected political shocks. For participants in the Forex market , this could mean a return to strategies that favor carry trades and long-term directional bets, rather than purely speculative, short-term plays. The Fading Echoes of the Trump Presidency on Global Currencies The Trump presidency , from 2017 to 2021, was characterized by a series of unconventional policies and a highly unpredictable communication style. This had a profound impact on global financial markets, and particularly on currency valuations. The administration’s ‘America First’ approach led to trade wars with major economic partners, imposition of tariffs, and frequent public commentary on the dollar’s strength, all of which fueled significant FX volatility . Consider the trade disputes with China and Europe. Each tariff announcement or negotiation breakdown introduced a wave of uncertainty, prompting investors to seek safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen or the Swiss Franc, while others like the Chinese Yuan faced pressure. The constant shifts in policy and rhetoric made it challenging for businesses and investors to plan, leading to spikes in currency fluctuations. Now, with the transition to a more conventional administration, the market perceives a return to established diplomatic and economic norms. This reduction in geopolitical noise is a primary driver behind Deutsche Bank ‘s prediction of lower volatility. Navigating Emerging Currency Trends in a Stable Environment With the anticipated decline in FX volatility , investors and businesses need to recalibrate their understanding of emerging currency trends . A more stable environment does not mean an absence of movement, but rather a shift towards movements driven by fundamental economic divergences, interest rate differentials, and global growth prospects. Key trends to watch include: Interest Rate Differentials: Central banks globally are on different paths regarding monetary policy. Currencies of countries with higher interest rates or prospects of rate hikes (assuming inflation is under control) may become more attractive for carry trades. Economic Growth Disparities: Stronger economic performance in one region compared to another will naturally attract capital flows, strengthening that region’s currency. Commodity Prices: Commodity-linked currencies (e.g., AUD, CAD) will continue to be influenced by global demand and supply dynamics for raw materials. Geopolitical Stability: While the Trump-era shocks fade, new geopolitical flashpoints or enduring conflicts could still introduce localized volatility. For example, if the Eurozone economy shows sustained recovery while the US Federal Reserve maintains a dovish stance, the Euro might strengthen against the US Dollar, driven by improving fundamentals rather than sudden political announcements. What Does This Mean for the Forex Market and Beyond? A period of lower FX volatility has several significant implications for the Forex market and the broader financial ecosystem: Increased Appetite for Carry Trades: When volatility is low, investors are more willing to borrow in low-interest-rate currencies and invest in high-interest-rate currencies, pocketing the interest rate differential. This strategy becomes more appealing as the risk of sudden adverse currency movements diminishes. Reduced Hedging Costs: Businesses involved in international trade may find that the cost of hedging their currency exposure decreases. This can improve profit margins and encourage more cross-border transactions. Focus on Fundamentals: Traders and analysts will likely shift their focus back to traditional economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation data, employment figures, and central bank communications, rather than headline-driven political events. Implications for Crypto: While not directly linked, a calmer traditional financial market might indirectly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Some investors might view traditional assets as less risky, potentially diverting some capital, or conversely, a stable traditional market might free up capital for speculative ventures in crypto. This shift could also impact emerging markets, which are often more susceptible to global currency fluctuations. A more stable global currency environment could provide a more predictable backdrop for their economic development and attract foreign direct investment. Challenges and Lingering Risks to FX Stability While Deutsche Bank ‘s outlook suggests a calmer period, it is crucial to acknowledge that the global financial landscape is never entirely free of risk. Several factors could still trigger renewed FX volatility : Unexpected Geopolitical Events: New conflicts, political instability in major economies, or significant policy shifts by other global powers could quickly reignite currency market turbulence. Inflationary Pressures: Persistent and unexpected inflation could force central banks to hike interest rates more aggressively than anticipated, leading to rapid currency adjustments. Economic Shocks: A severe global recession, a new pandemic, or a major financial crisis could disrupt the perceived stability and trigger safe-haven flows. Central Bank Divergence: While some convergence is expected, significant and uncommunicated divergences in monetary policy among major central banks could still lead to sharp currency movements. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses In this evolving landscape, what steps can market participants take to best position themselves? Re-evaluate Hedging Strategies: Businesses should assess if their current hedging strategies are still optimal given potentially lower volatility and reduced hedging costs. Focus on Fundamental Analysis: Investors should deepen their understanding of macroeconomic indicators and central bank policies, as these will likely be the primary drivers of currency trends . Diversify Portfolios: While volatility may drop, diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management, spreading exposure across different currency pairs and asset classes. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor global economic data, central bank statements, and geopolitical developments to anticipate shifts in market sentiment. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the New Normal Deutsche Bank ‘s projection of declining FX volatility signals a significant shift in the global financial environment. As the unpredictable ‘Trump shock’ fades into history, the Forex market appears poised for a period of greater predictability, driven more by economic fundamentals than by sudden political pronouncements. This transition presents both opportunities and challenges, encouraging a return to more traditional trading strategies while still demanding vigilance against unforeseen global events. For anyone involved in international finance, from corporate treasurers to individual investors, understanding these emerging currency trends is paramount to navigating the calmer, yet still dynamic, waters ahead.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/educator-alerts-xrp-investors-they-are-coming-for-your-crypto-heres-why/,"The crypto market is entering a new phase of transformation. Institutional investors, once skeptical of digital assets, are now moving in with immense capital , sophisticated tools, and clear intent. This shift is changing not only how prices move but also how ownership and control are defined. For XRP holders, the development presents both opportunities and risks. Educator and crypto analyst CryptoSensei recently issued a stern warning to investors on his X handle, urging them to rethink how and where they store their assets. His cautionary message highlights an overlooked reality: that while institutions bring legitimacy and liquidity, they also introduce complex risks that can reshape market behavior. Institutional Shift in Crypto Markets Institutional players are rapidly becoming dominant in the cryptocurrency ecosystem . Their presence brings scale, structure, and professional market-making. Yet, it also brings strategies capable of overwhelming retail traders. These entities have long histories of managing and manipulating traditional markets. In crypto, their influence can be even more pronounced due to lower liquidity and fewer regulatory safeguards. #XRP HOLDERS!!! THEY ARE COMING FOR YOUR CRYPTO!!! pic.twitter.com/UmAQF97CZi — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) November 3, 2025 CryptoSensei’s analysis draws parallels between today’s market and earlier financial eras where large institutions dictated price direction and trading sentiment. As more funds, banks, and asset managers gain exposure to XRP and other cryptocurrencies, the potential for sudden market swings grows significantly. Retail participants must therefore understand that institutional participation is not purely a positive development. Custody and the Question of Ownership At the heart of CryptoSensei’s warning lies a fundamental question — what does it truly mean to “own” your crypto? Many investors believe that having XRP exposure through exchange-traded funds or custodial platforms equals ownership. However, the reality is more nuanced. When XRP is held in a self-custodied wallet, the holder controls the private keys, hence, the asset itself. In contrast, ownership through custodial intermediaries, such as ETFs or managed funds, is indirect. The custodian retains legal control of the asset, and the investor holds a financial claim rather than the underlying cryptocurrency. If the custodian faces operational, legal, or financial trouble, investors could lose access to their assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This distinction mirrors lessons from traditional finance, where brokerage clients can suffer losses when institutions mismanage assets. In the crypto space, the FTX collapse remains a vivid reminder that “not your keys, not your coins” is more than a slogan — it is a principle of survival. Market Manipulation and Liquidity Traps Institutions entering crypto markets can move prices with precision. They can exploit thin order books, trigger liquidations, and profit from the volatility that follows. These “surgical liquidity events,” as CryptoSensei describes them, often target overleveraged retail positions. Such dynamics were observed in past Bitcoin and XRP corrections , where large sell-offs occurred after institutional inflows. While regulation is improving, transparency remains limited, giving major players an advantage in timing, execution, and information. For ordinary XRP investors, this creates a landscape where caution and awareness are critical. The Path Forward for XRP Holders CryptoSensei’s message is not one of fear but of empowerment. It underscores the importance of self-custody, due diligence, and education in navigating a maturing market. XRP holders must know exactly where their assets are stored and who controls them. As institutions tighten their grip on liquidity and market structure, individual investors can still maintain independence through informed decisions. True ownership begins with self-custody, continued vigilance, and understanding that security in crypto is not granted — it is earned. In a world where institutions are coming for your crypto, awareness is your first line of defense, and control is your greatest advantage.

The surge comes as large-scale investors continue accumulating Ethereum-based stablecoins amid volatile market conditions. The market capitalization of Ethereum stablecoins has increased by a record 1.36% weekly, surpassing $165 billion. Tether's USDT leads with 85.88 billion tokens circulating on Ethereum , experiencing a monthly growth rate of 8.12%. Circle's USDC comes next, with 48.2 billion tokens in circulation, which increased by 5.79% during the same period. Stablecoin transfer volume on Ethereum, Source: X On-chain data show that the aggregate amount of stablecoin transactions on Ethereum has increased by 1,000% since May 2023. This expansion positions stablecoins as a significant force in digital payments infrastructure. Market Position and Annual Performance Stablecoins control around 60% of the broader market with a total circulation of more than $308 billion. USDT leads with a market capitalization of over $183.6 billion. The USDC is ranked second with an approximate of $75 billion, which is 41% of the stablecoin market. The annual transaction volume for stablecoins has surpassed $27 trillion, accounting for approximately 1% of daily global payment flows. Present growth trends suggest that stablecoin settlement volumes may surpass those of traditional finance networks within the next ten years. The momentum of its adoption is driven by rising demand for cross-border transfers, real-time settlement, and access to payments outside traditional banking hours. They are now utilized in remittances, decentralized finance protocols, trading operations, capital markets, corporate treasury management, and consumer payments. Infrastructure Competition Intensifies According to Gate Research, the development of infrastructures is now of utmost importance to major issuers compared to token expansion. Stablecoin providers focus on building foundational settlement networks rather than simply broadening token issuance. Tether has introduced Plasma products, aiming at retail and institutional payment systems. Circle has recently opened Arc, an infrastructure-focused platform of stablecoins. These actions indicate a strategic shift towards utility and settlement infrastructure. Research Associate at Presto Research, Min Jung, observed the sector's momentum. The recent regulatory shifts, such as the passage of the GENIUS Act and the Circle's IPO, have accelerated this trend.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|USDT|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-04 12:06:21

Despite the recent drop, veteran Wall Street strategist Tom Lee remains confident that Bitcoin will reach new highs before the end of the year. Tom Lee Backs Crypto Recovery as BitMine Expands $12.5B Ethereum Holdings Lee, who also serves as Chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), sees the current correction as a healthy reset following last week’s volatility. “The market is consolidating,” he explained. “Ethereum and Bitcoin fundamentals are stronger than ever, stablecoin volumes are surging, and blockchain revenues are at record levels.” Tom Lee says Bitcoin can still reach $150,000 to $200,000 by end of year. pic.twitter.com/fX27y5xajt — Bitcoin Mindset Daily (@BitcoinsMind) November 3, 2025 BitMine’s aggressive expansion backs his optimism. The firm recently added 82,353 ETH, worth over $294 million, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to 3.39 million ETH, or 2.8% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. At current prices, that’s nearly $12.5 billion, making BitMine one of the largest institutional crypto holders. Lee predicts Bitcoin could rally toward $150,000–$200,000, while Ethereum might climb to $7,000, fueled by institutional adoption and renewed capital inflows into crypto infrastructure. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Faces Technical Pressure From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is under strain after breaking below a symmetrical triangle pattern that’s been forming since mid-September. The breach suggests a continuation to the downside, especially after multiple failed attempts to reclaim resistance near $111,000. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Recent candles show a series of wide-bodied red bars, signaling strong selling conviction. The 50-day EMA remains below the 200-day EMA, forming a bearish alignment. Meanwhile, the RSI near 30 shows oversold conditions but no bullish divergence yet, meaning downward momentum could persist. Key support zones now sit at $103,500 and $100,250. A daily close below $103,400 could push BTC toward the psychological $100,000 level, an area where institutional buyers might step in. Dip-Buying or More Downside? For traders, the current price zone presents both opportunity and caution. Short-term strategies include: Selling the retest around $106,300–$107,900, with stops above $111,000 and targets near $103,500–$100,250. Buying confirmation of a bullish engulfing candle above $108,000, supported by rising volume, for a potential recovery toward $111,000. Despite short-term pressure, the macro outlook remains constructive. As liquidity improves and institutional flows return, Bitcoin could stage a sharp reversal, aligning with Lee’s call for new all-time highs by year-end. For investors, this pullback may prove to be the kind of “reset moment” that historically precedes Bitcoin’s biggest rallies. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

The digital currency landscape is a realm of both immense opportunity and significant volatility, where assets like Ethereum have carved out a foundational role. For many, the question isn’t just about what Ethereum is, but what its future holds. As investors and enthusiasts gaze towards the horizon, a pivotal query emerges: what does the Ethereum price prediction look like for 2025, 2026, and even 2030? Can this pioneering smart contract platform truly ascend to a staggering $10,000 per ETH? This article delves deep into the factors influencing Ethereum’s trajectory, offering a comprehensive analysis of its potential growth, the hurdles it faces, and the innovative solutions driving its ecosystem forward. Join us as we explore the intricate dynamics that could shape Ethereum’s journey in the coming decade. Understanding the Foundation: What Drives Ethereum Price Prediction ? Before we project future prices, it is crucial to understand Ethereum’s core value proposition and the technological advancements that underpin its ecosystem. Ethereum is not merely a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized global computing platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This foundational technology has given rise to entire industries, including Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications. Key Drivers of Ethereum’s Value: Technological Innovation: The ongoing development, particularly the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Consensus Layer), which shifted from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), significantly enhances scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Updates like EIP-1559, which introduced a burning mechanism for transaction fees, have also made ETH a deflationary asset under certain conditions, influencing its supply dynamics. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum boasts the largest and most vibrant ecosystem of developers and dApps. This network effect creates a powerful feedback loop, attracting more users, developers, and capital, which in turn increases demand for ETH as the native gas token. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions, corporations, and even governments are exploring or integrating Ethereum-based solutions. The increasing interest in tokenized assets, enterprise blockchain, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) built on Ethereum-compatible networks adds significant credibility and potential for future demand. Global Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic trends, inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and the overall sentiment towards risk assets heavily influence the cryptocurrency market, including Ethereum. As a leading altcoin, ETH often correlates with Bitcoin’s movements and the wider crypto market sentiment. ETH Price 2025 : Navigating the Near-Term Horizon Looking ahead to ETH price 2025 , several factors will play a critical role in shaping its trajectory. The crypto market operates in cycles, often influenced by Bitcoin halving events and broader economic conditions. By 2025, the impact of the latest Bitcoin halving (expected in 2024) will likely be fully realized, potentially leading to an overall bullish market sentiment that could lift Ethereum along with it. Factors Influencing ETH in 2025: Scalability Solutions: The continued rollout and adoption of Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync, and StarkNet will be crucial. These technologies reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, making Ethereum more accessible and efficient for everyday use, thereby driving demand. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide grapple with how to regulate cryptocurrencies, clearer frameworks could emerge by 2025. Positive regulatory developments, especially in major economies, could attract more institutional investment and reduce market uncertainty. DeFi and NFT Evolution: The innovation within DeFi and NFTs is relentless. New use cases, improved user experiences, and increased mainstream adoption of these sectors will directly impact the demand for ETH as the underlying asset for these applications. Market Sentiment and Bitcoin’s Influence: Ethereum’s price often follows Bitcoin’s lead. A strong bullish run for Bitcoin, potentially fueled by institutional inflows and ETF approvals, would create a favorable environment for ETH. Conversely, a bearish turn for Bitcoin could drag Ethereum down. Many analysts suggest a conservative to moderately optimistic outlook for ETH price 2025 , with projections ranging from $4,000 to $8,000, depending on market conditions and the success of ongoing developments. The ability of Ethereum to maintain its dominance in dApps and smart contracts will be key. ETH Price 2030 : A Long-Term Vision for Ethereum’s Dominance Projecting the ETH price 2030 requires a long-term perspective, considering not just market cycles but fundamental shifts in technology and global finance. By 2030, Ethereum’s transformation into a fully scalable, secure, and sustainable blockchain is expected to be complete, solidifying its position as the backbone of the decentralized internet. Long-Term Catalysts for Ethereum by 2030: Full Sharding Implementation: The complete implementation of sharding, which will further decentralize and scale the network, is a significant milestone. This will dramatically increase Ethereum’s transaction processing capacity, making it capable of supporting a global user base for complex applications.

Sacks cautioned that the greatest threat from AI isn’t machines turning against humans. He commented, “What we’re really talking about is Orwellian AI. We’re talking about AI that lies to you, that distorts an answer, that rewrites history in real time to serve a current political agenda of the people who are in power.” Sacks urges regulations focusing on AI misuse instead of developers Sacks touched on the Trump administration’s approach to crypto and artificial intelligence, drawing a contrast to the last administration’s policies during an episode of Andreessen Horowitz’s’ The Ben & Marc Show, which aired on Monday. He criticized the Biden administration and Democratic-run states, such as California and Colorado, for being overly aggressive in their push for AI consumer protection rules that address “algorithmic discrimination.” He warned that excessive regulation poses a threat to AI, turning it into a political instrument that reflects government bias and erases the inconvenient truths of history. Sacks noted that an Orwellian system , one that can deliberately alter information to create a reality that suits the interests of political leaders, poses the greatest risk to the public. He explained, “You’ve got the surveillance issue. Where AI is gonna know everything about you. It’s gonna kind of be your personal assistant, and so it’s kind of the perfect tool for the government to monitor and control you. And to me, that is by far the biggest risk of AI.” Although he emphasized that the real issue isn’t with the technology itself, but with the people who choose to misuse it, he has advocated for rules that target individuals who weaponize AI rather than blanket regulations that curtail the industry and developers at large. He noted that laws against discrimination already exist, so regulators should focus on punishing the companies that misuse AI rather than the firms that build it. Sacks accused Anthropic of fear-mongering Sacks recently aimed at the AI research firm Anthropic, accusing it of stoking fear to shape future AI policies. The firm had released an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” which set off a heated discussion across social media platforms over the future of AI regulation. Sacks raised an issue with the essay, stating the firm wants to manipulate public fear of AI to influence regulations. Nonetheless, billionaire investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman came to Anthropic’s defense, calling the company “one of the good guys.” His post, however, prompted a quick rebuttal from Sacks, leading to a brief online exchange. In one of the posts, Sacks noted that the core issue was Anthropic’s supposed plan to influence blue states like California to pass politically biased AI rules quietly. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan CEO Dario Amodei has, however, pushed back against the official’s claims, calling them “inaccurate.” He insisted the company has consistently pushed for federal oversight to avoid a patchwork of conflicting state regulations. The company noted that its public benefit charter commits it to using AI for the greater good of society and to maintaining US leadership in the sector, adding that it’s working toward the same objectives as the Trump administration and citizens alike.

The selloff underscores the growing fragility in a market stretched by leverage, macro uncertainty, and shifting institutional sentiment. While traders grapple with losses, Outset PR , founded by crypto communications expert Mike Ermolaev, demonstrates how strategic, data-driven storytelling can help crypto projects build resilience and visibility even in turbulent markets. Over-Leveraged Traders Face Margin Calls Ethereum’s drop below $3,700 triggered a cascade of automated liquidations, forcing over-leveraged traders to close positions en masse. The move reflects a chain reaction typical of high-volatility markets: as prices dip below key support, margin calls and stop-loss orders amplify selling pressure. This forced liquidation cycle rapidly drains liquidity and accelerates price declines, leaving both retail and institutional traders scrambling for stability. Ethereum Faces a Triple Threat Ethereum’s correction illustrates a triple threat scenario: Forced unwinds of leveraged longs, Macro headwinds undermining risk sentiment, and Lingering DeFi security concerns dampening investor confidence. The critical question now is whether ETH can hold the $3,575–$3,600 support zone—the level corresponding to July’s swing low. A decisive close below that area could expose ETH to a deeper pullback toward $3,460, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. For bulls, maintaining this zone is vital. A rebound from here could signal a healthy reset in leverage, paving the way for stabilization and gradual recovery. But if macro conditions worsen or Bitcoin extends its drawdown, Ethereum could struggle to reclaim lost ground. Outset PR Crafts Communications Like a Workshop, Powered by Data Outset PR operates more like a workshop than a traditional agency—each campaign is built with market fit and timing in mind. Instead of relying on random placements or templated packages, the team crafts messaging that aligns precisely with market sentiment, ensuring a client’s story lands when attention is strongest. Media outlets are selected based on metrics such as discoverability, domain authority, conversion potential, and viral reach. Every pitch is tuned to match a platform’s editorial voice and audience demographics, and the rollout is timed to unfold organically—much like how successful traders map entry points in volatile markets. Outset PR’s boutique approach is backed by daily analytics and trend monitoring, allowing campaigns to follow market momentum rather than chase it. The result is a verifiable, data-led impact that translates communications into measurable visibility. The agency’s record speaks for itself: Step App: 138% rise in FITFI token value during the campaign. Choise.ai: CHO token surged 28.5x amid coverage of a business upgrade. ChangeNOW: Customer base grew 40% through multi-layered PR. StealthEX: 26 tier-1 media features, 3.62 billion estimated total reach. Whether through tier-1 pitching, editorial-focused content, or targeted media outreach for early-stage projects, Outset PR ensures clients gain traction that lasts beyond market cycles. For founders who want communications grounded in performance data and market logic, this is what PR should feel like. Outlook: Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Opportunity While the current liquidation storm highlights the risks of over-leveraged positioning, it also sets the stage for potential accumulation once excess leverage is flushed out. Historically, such deleveraging phases have preceded renewed uptrends, especially when underlying fundamentals—such as network activity and institutional inflows—remain intact. In the near term, traders will watch for Ethereum’s ability to defend $3,575–$3,600, the behavior of futures open interest, and ETF flow stability as key indicators of market resilience. Until macro headwinds ease and liquidity returns, Ethereum may remain range-bound—but for long-term investors, these volatile corrections often create strategic entry points rather than lasting breakdowns.

Specifically, is Zcash on your radar? The question of Zcash price prediction is on many investors’ minds as they consider the long-term viability and growth potential of this unique digital currency. In a world increasingly concerned with data privacy, Zcash (ZEC) stands out by offering robust anonymity for transactions. But what does its future hold, and more importantly, is ZEC a good investment for your portfolio over the next few years? Understanding Zcash: The Privacy Imperative Before diving into future price movements, it is crucial to understand what Zcash is and why it matters. Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency that prioritizes privacy and selective transparency of transactions. Built on a strong cryptographic foundation, it uses zero-knowledge proofs (specifically zk-SNARKs) to allow transactions to be validated without revealing sensitive information about the sender, receiver, or the amount transacted. This core feature sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, where all transaction details are publicly visible on the blockchain. The vision behind Zcash is to provide financial freedom and privacy, giving users control over their transactional data. This commitment to privacy is not just a feature; it is the project’s foundational principle, attracting users and investors who value anonymity in their digital financial dealings. Key Features of Zcash: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zk-SNARKs): This advanced cryptography enables transactions to be verified without revealing any information about the parties involved or the transaction amount. Selective Transparency: Users have the option to disclose transaction details for auditing or compliance purposes, providing flexibility not found in all privacy coins. Strong Community and Development: Backed by the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and a dedicated community, Zcash continues to innovate and improve its protocol. Bitcoin Fork: Zcash originated as a fork of Bitcoin, inheriting many of its robust security features while adding enhanced privacy. Historical Performance of ZEC: A Look Back Like many cryptocurrencies, ZEC has experienced significant volatility since its launch in October 2016. Its journey has been marked by periods of explosive growth, followed by corrections, reflecting the broader market trends and specific developments within the Zcash ecosystem. Understanding its past performance can offer context, though it is never a guarantee of future results. Initially, Zcash garnered considerable attention due to its innovative privacy features. Early investors saw substantial gains, but like the rest of the market, ZEC faced a bear market following the 2017-2018 bull run. It has since seen recoveries and dips, often correlating with Bitcoin’s price movements but also influenced by its own technological updates, regulatory news concerning privacy coins, and overall investor sentiment towards anonymity. Here’s a simplified overview of ZEC’s journey: Launch (2016): High initial interest due to unique privacy tech. 2017-2018 Bull Run: Experienced significant price appreciation alongside the broader crypto market. 2018-2020 Bear Market: Price corrections and consolidation. 2020-2021 Bull Run: Renewed interest and price surge, driven by institutional adoption and a more mature market. Post-2021: Market corrections, continued development, and ongoing debates around privacy coins. Factors Influencing Zcash’s Future Value Several critical factors will play a significant role in shaping the Zcash future and its price trajectory.

Unlocking the potential of privacy in a transparent digital world, Monero (XMR) stands as a unique force in the cryptocurrency market. As investors and enthusiasts look to the future, a critical question emerges: what does the Monero Price Prediction hold for the coming years? Will its commitment to absolute anonymity drive its value to unprecedented heights, potentially pushing the XMR Price beyond the significant $300 mark? This comprehensive analysis delves into the intricate factors shaping Monero’s trajectory, offering a detailed look at its prospects from 2025 through 2030. Understanding Monero: The Unwavering Privacy Coin Before we dive into future price movements, it is essential to grasp what Monero is and why it commands a unique position in the crypto ecosystem. Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency launched in April 2014, with a singular focus on privacy and fungibility. Unlike Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, where transactions are publicly recorded on a blockchain and can be traced, Monero is designed to be untraceable and unlinkable. Every transaction on the Monero network is confidential by default, meaning senders, recipients, and transaction amounts are obscured. Key Features of Monero’s Privacy: Ring Signatures: These mix a user’s transaction with a group of other transactions, making it impossible to determine which output was spent. Stealth Addresses: For every transaction, a unique, one-time address is generated, ensuring that only the sender and receiver know the destination of the funds. Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT): Introduced in 2017, RingCT hides the amount of XMR being transacted, adding another layer of privacy. Dandelion++: This network-level privacy protocol obscures the origin of transactions, preventing network observers from linking a transaction to a specific IP address. This unwavering commitment to privacy is Monero’s core value proposition, attracting users who prioritize financial sovereignty and anonymity. This foundational strength is a critical element in any long-term Monero Price Prediction . Factors Influencing XMR Price: A Multifaceted Analysis The price of any cryptocurrency, including Monero, is influenced by a complex interplay of market dynamics, technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and broader economic trends. Understanding these factors is crucial for an informed Monero Forecast . Market Dynamics and Demand: Adoption Rate: Increased usage for legitimate private transactions, especially in regions with economic instability or surveillance, can drive demand. Supply Mechanics: Monero has a tail emission, meaning new XMR are continuously minted at a low rate after the main emission phase. This ensures network security and prevents inflation from becoming deflationary. Exchange Listings: While a Privacy Coin , XMR’s availability on major exchanges impacts liquidity and accessibility. Delistings, conversely, can negatively affect price. Technological Developments: Protocol Upgrades: Continuous improvements to Monero’s privacy features, scalability, and network efficiency can bolster investor confidence. Security Audits: Regular audits and the swift resolution of any vulnerabilities are vital for maintaining trust. Integration with Wallets and Services: Easier access and integration into various crypto services can enhance user experience and adoption. Regulatory Environment: This is perhaps the most significant challenge for any Privacy Coin . Governments and financial regulators often view privacy-centric cryptocurrencies with suspicion due to concerns about money laundering and illicit financing. Potential regulatory crackdowns or delistings from exchanges due to compliance pressures can significantly impact the XMR Price . Conversely, a clearer regulatory framework that acknowledges legitimate privacy needs could stabilize its market position. Broader Crypto Market Trends: As with most altcoins, Monero’s price often correlates with the overall sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s performance. Bull runs in the broader market tend to lift XMR, while bear markets can exert downward pressure. Monero Price Prediction 2025: A Pivotal Year? Looking ahead to 2025, several factors could converge to shape Monero’s trajectory. The ongoing evolution of the regulatory landscape will play a crucial role. If governments continue to tighten their grip on privacy coins, XMR could face headwinds. However, if a balance is found, or if demand for privacy intensifies due to increasing digital surveillance, Monero could see significant gains. From a technical perspective, 2025 could be a year where Monero consolidates its position as a leading Privacy Coin . Assuming continued development and a stable crypto market, a moderate bullish outlook is plausible. Many analysts suggest that if the broader market experiences a recovery or a new bull cycle, Monero could ride this wave. We could see the XMR Price reach an average of $180-$220, with potential peaks challenging the $250-$280 range if institutional interest in truly private transactions grows. The market capitalization of Monero is relatively smaller compared to giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it more susceptible to volatility but also offering higher growth potential during bullish periods. A key driver for Monero Price Prediction in 2025 will be the successful implementation of any planned network upgrades and the overall health of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which could increasingly value privacy solutions. Navigating 2026-2028: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Monero? The mid-term outlook for Monero, spanning from 2026 to 2028, presents both opportunities and significant challenges. This period will likely be characterized by intensified regulatory scrutiny globally. As digital currencies become more integrated into traditional finance, the pressure on privacy-focused assets to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations will mount. This could lead to further delistings from centralized exchanges, potentially impacting liquidity and accessibility. However, this era could also solidify Monero’s niche. As surveillance capitalism expands and data privacy becomes a more pressing concern for individuals and businesses, the demand for a truly private digital cash system could surge. This dual pressure creates a nuanced Monero Forecast for these years. If Monero can maintain its technical superiority and adapt to or resist regulatory pressures effectively, it could thrive. Price-wise, if Monero successfully navigates these challenges, we could see a steady appreciation. An average XMR Price between $250-$350 by 2028 is a reasonable mid-range forecast, with bullish scenarios pushing it towards $400-$450. Bearish scenarios, heavily influenced by regulatory crackdowns, could see it struggle to maintain its 2025 levels. The community’s resilience and ability to innovate will be paramount during this period. Monero Price Prediction 2029-2030: Will XMR Price Cross $300? The long-term vision for Monero, stretching to 2029 and XMR 2030 , brings the much-anticipated question: can the XMR Price not just cross, but sustain itself above $300, and potentially much higher? By this point, the digital asset landscape will likely be vastly different. We might see a clear bifurcation between regulated, permissioned blockchains and truly decentralized, privacy-focused networks. For Monero to consistently cross and maintain above $300, several conditions need to align: Sustained Demand for Privacy: The global trend towards digital surveillance must continue to drive demand for robust privacy solutions. Technological Resilience: Monero must continue to innovate, staying ahead of any de-anonymization attempts and improving scalability. Community Strength: A strong, active, and decentralized community is crucial for ongoing development and resilience against external pressures. Macroeconomic Conditions: A generally favorable global economic environment and a mature, expanding cryptocurrency market would provide a tailwind. If these conditions hold, our Monero Price Prediction suggests a strong possibility for XMR to not only cross $300 but potentially reach new all-time highs. By 2029, an average price of $350-$500 seems achievable, with peaks potentially touching $600-$750 in extremely bullish scenarios. Looking specifically at XMR 2030 , a sustained move above $500, with ambitious targets reaching $800-$1000, is not out of the question if Monero solidifies its position as the undisputed leader in default transactional privacy and gains wider, albeit niche, acceptance. However, it’s vital to acknowledge the significant regulatory risks. If privacy coins are outright banned or severely restricted in major economies, the long-term price potential could be significantly curtailed, making the $300 target a much harder climb. The ability of Monero to adapt, perhaps through sidechains or other innovative solutions that offer optional compliance layers for specific use cases, could be key to its survival and growth. The Unique Value of Monero as a Privacy Coin Monero’s existence is a testament to the fundamental human desire for privacy. In an age where every click, purchase, and communication is tracked, a truly private digital currency offers an invaluable alternative. The core benefits of Monero as a Privacy Coin extend beyond mere anonymity: Fungibility: Unlike Bitcoin, where some coins might be ‘tainted’ by association with illicit activities, all XMR coins are equal and indistinguishable. This ensures that every unit of Monero holds the same value, without its history affecting its acceptance. Censorship Resistance: Monero’s privacy features make it highly resistant to financial censorship, allowing individuals to transact freely without fear of their transactions being blocked or monitored. Financial Sovereignty: It empowers individuals with full control over their financial data, aligning with the core ethos of decentralized cryptocurrencies. The challenges, however, are equally pronounced. The very features that make Monero a powerful Privacy Coin also make it a target for regulators. The ongoing battle between privacy advocates and state surveillance will heavily influence Monero’s long-term viability and its ultimate Monero Forecast . Technical Analysis of XMR: Charting the Path Forward While fundamental factors drive long-term value, technical analysis provides insights into short-to-medium term price movements for the XMR Price . Looking at historical data, Monero has shown periods of strong growth, often correlating with broader crypto bull markets. Key indicators to watch include: Support and Resistance Levels: Identifying historical price points where buying or selling pressure was significant can indicate future turning points. For XMR, breaking strong resistance levels (like the $200-$220 zone) could signal further upward momentum. Moving Averages: The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages help identify trends. A cross of the shorter-term average above the longer-term average is often a bullish signal. RSI (Relative Strength Index): This momentum oscillator indicates whether XMR is overbought or oversold, helping to predict potential reversals. Volume: High trading volume accompanying price movements adds credibility to the trend. Currently, XMR often trades within a defined range, consolidating after major market moves. A significant breakout above key resistance, fueled by positive market sentiment or specific Monero-related news, would be crucial for initiating a strong upward trend towards our Monero Price Prediction targets for 2025 and beyond. Risks and Opportunities: A Balanced View for XMR 2030 Investing in Monero, especially with a long-term outlook towards XMR 2030 , involves understanding both its inherent risks and compelling opportunities. Key Risks: Regulatory Pressure: As discussed, this remains the primary threat. Governments may impose stricter regulations or outright bans on privacy coins, forcing exchanges to delist XMR. Technological Obsolescence: While Monero’s privacy tech is robust, future cryptographic advancements could potentially challenge its dominance or even its privacy guarantees, though the Monero community is proactive in this regard. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. XMR is not immune to sudden price drops due to market crashes, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or large sell-offs. Key Opportunities: Increasing Demand for Privacy: As digital surveillance becomes more pervasive, the demand for truly private financial tools is likely to grow, positioning Monero favorably. Store of Value for Privacy Advocates: Monero could solidify its role as a preferred store of value for those prioritizing privacy and censorship resistance. Integration in Niche Markets: Potential for increased adoption in specific industries or communities where privacy is paramount, such as secure online transactions or remittances in restrictive regimes. The future Monero Forecast hinges on how these risks are mitigated and how effectively opportunities are seized. The community’s ability to innovate and advocate for financial privacy will be crucial. Actionable Insights for Potential Monero Investors For those considering an investment in Monero based on the Monero Price Prediction : Conduct Thorough Research: Understand Monero’s technology, its community, and the regulatory environment. Do not rely solely on price predictions. Diversify Your Portfolio: XMR, like any altcoin, carries significant risk. It is prudent to allocate only a portion of your investment capital to it. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Monero’s strengths are in its long-term vision for privacy. Short-term trading can be highly volatile. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory news, technological developments within Monero, and broader crypto market trends. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of a lump sum investment, consider investing a fixed amount regularly to mitigate the impact of market volatility. Conclusion: Monero’s Enduring Quest for Privacy and Value The journey of Monero from 2025 to XMR 2030 promises to be a compelling narrative of technological resilience, community determination, and a constant battle against regulatory headwinds. While the path to crossing and sustaining above $300 is fraught with challenges, the fundamental demand for privacy in an increasingly transparent digital world provides a strong undercurrent for its potential growth. Our Monero Price Prediction indicates that if Monero can successfully navigate the complex interplay of market forces, regulatory pressures, and continuous innovation, its value could indeed see a significant ascent, potentially reaching and even surpassing the $300, $500, and even higher milestones by the turn of the decade. As always, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable, and thorough due diligence is essential before making any investment decisions. Monero stands as a beacon for financial privacy, and its future price action will undoubtedly reflect the global appetite for true anonymity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Monero’s Future Q: How do regulators view privacy coins like Monero? A: Regulators often express concerns about privacy coins due to their potential use in illicit activities. Organizations like FATF (Financial Action Task Force) provide guidelines that often impact how exchanges and financial institutions interact with privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Law enforcement agencies, such as Europol , also monitor their usage. Q: What are the key technological features that make Monero a strong privacy coin? A: Monero employs several advanced cryptographic techniques. These include Ring Signatures , which mix a user’s transaction with others to obscure the sender; Stealth Addresses , which create a unique one-time address for each transaction to hide the recipient; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) , which conceal the amount of XMR being transacted. These features are continuously developed and improved by the Monero Core Development Team . Q: How does Monero compare to other privacy-focused cryptocurrencies? A: While Monero is a leader in transactional privacy, other projects like Zcash and Dash also offer privacy features. Zcash uses zk-SNARKs for optional privacy, while Dash offers PrivateSend, a CoinJoin implementation. Monero, however, enforces privacy by default, making all transactions opaque to external observers, a key differentiator. Q: What role does blockchain analysis play in tracking Monero? A: While Monero is designed to be highly resistant to blockchain analysis, firms like Chainalysis have developed tools and methodologies to attempt to de-anonymize transactions on various blockchains, including privacy coins. However, Monero’s default privacy features make it significantly more challenging to trace than transparent blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Q: Who founded Monero and what is its governance model? A: Monero was launched in April 2014 by a pseudonymous developer known as “thankful_for_all_the_help” , based on the CryptoNote protocol. Soon after, the project was largely taken over by the open-source community. It operates on a decentralized governance model, driven by community consensus and funded through a crowdfunding system called the Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) , where proposals are submitted and funded by community donations.

At the time of writing, the popular meme coin is trading at around $0.0000091, indicating a 5.25% decline over the last 24 hours. SHIB Price, Source: CoinMarketCap The token's descent represents more than a temporary correction. It is an indication of a long-term downtrend that has punctured several support lines, leaving traders questioning when the bleeding will stop. Unlike previous market cycles where sharp drops led to quick recoveries, this decline has been characterized by steady erosion rather than panic selling. Technical Indicators Paint Grim Picture The chart demonstrates a very alarming technical configuration. SHIB is trading below three important moving averages: 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day lines. This arrangement typically indicates that sellers remain in full control and no relief is forthcoming. The 200-day moving average has been an invincible obstacle since the end of summer. Any effort to recover has been denied at this stage, which has pushed the price downwards. This consistent inability to penetrate overhead resistance indicates the weak point of the present buying pressure. SHIB/USDT Chart, Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index is currently at 32, indicating an oversold position. However, the indicator does not reflect any evidence of bullish divergence that could indicate the impending reversal. Instead, the trend has been underperforming, and there are concerns that it will decline further instead of grow. Critical Support Levels Under Threat The next significant support zone lies between $0.0000075 and $0.0000080. This area previously served as a launchpad for SHIB's mid-2024 rally, making it psychologically important for bulls hoping to defend the price. A breach below this range could trigger a cascade of selling. The next logical target would be $0.0000065, representing a complete retracement of gains made throughout the previous year. Such a move would devastate portfolios and potentially spark capitulation among remaining holders. The current market structure offers little comfort for optimistic traders. The absence of strong buying pressure at current levels suggests limited appetite for catching the falling knife. Volume remains subdued, indicating that investors are either holding onto losses or have shifted their capital elsewhere. Shiba Inu's ecosystem has failed to produce meaningful catalysts in recent months. Shibarium , the project's layer-2 scaling solution, initially generated excitement within the community. However, on-chain activity has since stagnated.

The firm’s proprietary analytics system monitors daily media trends through the lens of Outset Data Pulse , allowing campaigns to align with momentum in real time. The result is communications that generate measurable impact, not empty exposure. For crypto projects looking to grow through cycles of volatility, Outset PR’s fusion of analytics and high-touch strategy provides an edge that mirrors how disciplined traders navigate uncertain markets. Solana Suffers 10% Drop as Liquidations Cascade Solana (SOL) plunged nearly 10% within 24 hours amid the liquidation storm, with $595 million in SOL-linked positions forcibly closed. The sell pressure intensified as SOL broke below the $173.52 support, slipping under its 200-day SMA ($179.59)—a key trend indicator for institutional traders. The RSI at 44.01 signaled entry into oversold territory, while the MACD (-4.8) remained deeply bearish, hinting that momentum has not yet stabilized despite a slight histogram uptick. From a technical standpoint, the breakdown below $173.52 marked a “lower low” pattern, prompting many algorithmic traders and momentum funds to exit positions. Analysts identify $157–$160 as the next critical support range—failure to hold it could trigger further automated sell-offs. ADA Extends Losses as Bulls Lose Momentum Cardano (ADA) also joined the selloff, breaking below $0.55, a key support that previously anchored its July–August rebound. The RSI at 34.62 now hovers near oversold territory, while the 200-day EMA ($0.74) sits far above current levels—illustrating the scale of ADA’s technical breakdown. A close below $0.55 confirms a bearish structure, invalidating the earlier recovery pattern. Analysts point to $0.49 (March 2025 low) as the next immediate support, followed by $0.45, corresponding to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement. To restore any short-term confidence, ADA would need to reclaim $0.58, a prior hourly resistance zone that could serve as the first sign of relief. Market Context: Liquidations and Macro Correlation The synchronized drop across major altcoins mirrors the broader deleveraging cycle triggered by high leverage and macro uncertainty. As risk assets faced renewed selling pressure amid rising Treasury yields and persistent inflation warnings from the Fed, crypto’s correlation with traditional markets tightened again. This reinforces a recurring theme in digital assets: excessive leverage magnifies macro shocks, transforming small pullbacks into large-scale liquidation waves. Outlook: Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Positioning While the near-term outlook for SOL and ADA remains fragile, these deep pullbacks often reset speculative leverage and pave the way for healthier accumulation phases. Traders are watching whether Solana can defend $160 and Cardano can stabilize above $0.49—levels that could determine whether this correction evolves into a full trend reversal or a temporary shakeout. As markets reset, the analogy to Outset PR’s approach becomes clear: data, discipline, and timing matter more than noise. Just as the agency crafts campaigns that align with market momentum, successful investors will focus on measured entries, structural support, and long-term positioning rather than short-term volatility.

Among the many projects vying for attention, the Pi Network has carved out a unique niche. Billed as a mobile-first cryptocurrency, it allows users to ‘mine’ Pi Coin directly from their smartphones, democratizing access to digital assets. However, as the project progresses, a pressing question looms large for its vast community of Pioneers: what does the future hold for the Pi Network price prediction , and more importantly, why is Pi Coin dropping in perceived value? This article dives deep into the current state of the Pi Network, exploring the factors influencing its potential price trajectory from 2025 through 2030. We will examine the challenges it faces, the opportunities it presents, and offer insights into what pioneers can expect from this ambitious project. Understanding the Pi Network: A Mobile-First Vision Before delving into price predictions, it’s essential to grasp the core concept of the Pi Network. Launched in 2019 by a team of Stanford graduates, including Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan , the project aimed to create a cryptocurrency accessible to everyone, without the need for expensive mining equipment or deep technical knowledge. Users simply download an app and tap a button daily to accumulate Pi Coin. Key aspects of the Pi Network include: Accessibility: Mining from a smartphone, making it easy for anyone to participate. Community Focus: Emphasizing network growth and user engagement through referrals. Enclosed Mainnet: Currently operating in an ‘Enclosed Mainnet’ phase, meaning Pi Coin cannot yet be freely traded on public exchanges. Utility Development: Building an ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) within the network. Why Is Pi Coin Dropping? Unpacking the Challenges The perception that Pi Coin is dropping in value stems from several factors, primarily related to its unique development phase and the broader cryptocurrency market’s expectations. Unlike most cryptocurrencies that launch with immediate trading capabilities, Pi Network has taken a cautious, phased approach. Here are the primary reasons contributing to this sentiment: Enclosed Mainnet Status: The most significant factor. With no official open trading, any ‘price’ seen for Pi Coin is purely speculative, often based on IOU (I Owe You) markets on a few exchanges. These are not reflections of actual market value and can fluctuate wildly based on sentiment, not supply and demand for an actual tradable asset. Lack of Liquidity and Exchange Listings: Without an open Mainnet, Pi Coin cannot be listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance or Coinbase . This absence of a liquid market means there’s no real mechanism for price discovery. Slow Pace of Development (Perceived): While the core team works diligently on blockchain infrastructure, KYC verification, and ecosystem building, the prolonged Enclosed Mainnet phase has led to impatience among some users. This perception of slow progress can dampen enthusiasm and speculative interest. Regulatory Uncertainty: The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving, and regulatory bodies worldwide are still defining their stance on digital assets. Projects with large user bases and unique distribution models like Pi Network may face scrutiny, adding an element of uncertainty. Speculative Nature of Crypto: Many early ‘Pioneers’ joined with the hope of quick gains. When these gains don’t materialize quickly due to the Enclosed Mainnet, frustration can lead to a perception of value depreciation. It’s crucial to distinguish between a genuinely dropping asset and one that hasn’t yet entered a free market. For Pi Coin, its value is largely undefined, making any ‘drop’ a reflection of speculative sentiment rather than market fundamentals. The Road Ahead: What Defines the Pi Network Future? The long-term viability and potential for a positive Pi Network future hinge on several critical developments. The project’s success is intricately tied to its ability to transition from its current state to a fully functional, open blockchain ecosystem. Key milestones that will shape its future include: Open Mainnet Launch: This is the single most anticipated event. An open Mainnet will allow Pi Coin to be freely traded, enabling price discovery and liquidity on exchanges. Successful KYC Verification: The Know Your Customer ( KYC ) process is vital for regulatory compliance and preventing fraud. A smooth and widespread KYC completion is necessary for users to migrate their mined Pi to the Mainnet. Robust Utility and Ecosystem: For Pi Coin to hold intrinsic value, it needs real-world utility. The development of dApps and services that use Pi as a medium of exchange within its ecosystem is paramount. Community Engagement and Growth: Maintaining its large user base and attracting new pioneers will be crucial for network effects and adoption. Technological Stability and Security: Ensuring the blockchain is secure, scalable, and resilient against attacks is foundational for trust and sustained growth. The Pi Network’s journey is a marathon, not a sprint. Its future depends on the successful execution of its roadmap and the sustained commitment of its core team and community. Pi Network Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Predicting the Pi Network price prediction 2025 is highly speculative due to its current Enclosed Mainnet status. However, we can outline potential scenarios based on the assumption of an open Mainnet launch within or before this timeframe. Factors influencing 2025 price: Open Mainnet Launch: If the open Mainnet launches, initial price action will be driven by supply and demand, and the willingness of early holders to sell. Utility Adoption: The number and quality of dApps utilizing Pi Coin will significantly impact its perceived value. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: A bullish market could lift Pi Coin, while a bearish one could suppress it. Exchange Listings: Listing on major exchanges would provide liquidity and exposure. Scenario Analysis for 2025: Scenario Assumptions Potential Price Range (USD) Conservative Open Mainnet, slow utility adoption, cautious market. $0.10 – $1.00 Moderate Open Mainnet, growing utility, stable market, minor exchange listings. $1.00 – $5.00 Optimistic Open Mainnet, strong utility, bullish market, major exchange listings. $5.00 – $20.00 These figures are highly theoretical. Without an open market, any price is purely an educated guess. The initial price could be much lower or higher depending on the market’s reaction to its launch. Pi Network Price Prediction 2026 – 2030: Long-Term Outlook Looking further into the future, the Pi Network price prediction for 2026-2030 involves even more variables. Long-term success will depend on sustained innovation, community loyalty, and the ability to compete with established cryptocurrencies. Factors influencing 2026-2030 price: Ecosystem Maturity: A thriving ecosystem with diverse and valuable dApps will be crucial. Scalability and Technology: The network’s ability to handle increasing transactions and evolve technologically. Global Adoption: Penetration into new markets and mainstream acceptance. Regulatory Landscape: Favorable or unfavorable regulations could significantly impact its trajectory. Competition: The emergence of new mobile-first or user-friendly crypto projects. Scenario Analysis for 2026-2030: Scenario Assumptions Potential Price Range (USD) Conservative Limited ecosystem growth, moderate adoption, competitive market. $0.50 – $10.00 Moderate Steady ecosystem growth, significant adoption, established market presence. $10.00 – $50.00 Optimistic Robust ecosystem, widespread global adoption, strong utility, major player. $50.00 – $200.00+ Again, these are broad estimations. The path to 2030 is long, and many unforeseen events could alter these predictions dramatically. Is Pi Network Mainnet the Key to Unlocking Value? Absolutely. The Pi Network Mainnet transition is not just a technical upgrade; it’s the fundamental step required to unlock the potential value of Pi Coin. Currently, Pi Coin exists as a digital ledger entry within the app. The Mainnet is the actual, immutable blockchain where these entries become real, transferable assets. Here’s why the Open Mainnet is so crucial: Enables Trading: Once on the open Mainnet, Pi Coin can be listed on public exchanges, allowing users to buy, sell, and trade it freely. This creates a liquid market. Facilitates Utility: dApps and services built on Pi Network can then genuinely integrate Pi Coin as a payment method, increasing its real-world use cases. Price Discovery: The market will determine the actual value of Pi Coin based on supply, demand, and utility, moving beyond speculative IOU prices. Trust and Transparency: A fully operational, open Mainnet enhances the credibility and transparency of the project within the broader crypto community. The challenges of transitioning to an open Mainnet are significant, involving extensive KYC verification for millions of users and ensuring the network’s stability and security. The core team’s careful approach aims to ensure a robust and compliant launch, which is vital for long-term success.
