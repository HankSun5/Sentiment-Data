The update follows a pause in open applications and sets a clearer path for funding across the ecosystem. The post positions the change within the ongoing growth of tools, protocols, and public goods. The team writes that the previous intake stretched its limited capacity, so the new approach concentrates efforts on areas identified alongside other Foundation groups. 1/ ESP’s grant applications are now OPEN! Our new grants program is structured through two pathways: Wishlist Requests for Proposals (RFPs) Explore the new opportunities and apply below! https://t.co/qg4gBL62ED — EF Ecosystem Support Program (@EF_ESP) November 3, 2025 ESP Grants: Wishlist and RFP Tracks “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the post reads. “However, with a lean team and broad scope, the growing volume of applications stretched our resources, limiting our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” “Our new model addresses this by shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach, working closely with other EF teams to ensure that funding aligns with the ecosystem’s priorities and drives meaningful impact,” said the Ethereum Foundation. ESP remains open to applicants while channeling submissions through two paths that frame needs and outcomes. The Wishlist sets high-level goals and leaves room for varied approaches, inviting builders to propose initiatives that meet those goals without prescribing a single design. Ethereum Community and Builder Impact Requests for Proposals describe a defined problem and the expected deliverables, including scope, requirements, application windows, and estimated duration. This creates a schedule and a measurement plan that applicants can review before submitting. Office Hours continue for guidance on whether a concept aligns with a Wishlist area or with an active RFP, so teams can target the right track from the start. ESP says the first set of Wishlist items and RFPs is live across cryptography, privacy, the application layer, security, and community growth . The team notes that “Wishlist items and RFPs will be added and updated based on the evolving needs of the ecosystem,” making an ongoing pipeline rather than a single round. The announcement also outlines coordination and support beyond funding. ESP plans to align grantmaking with other Foundation groups, provide guidance to grantees, connect projects to peers, and draw insights from outcomes to guide future calls.

53998284,https://cryptonews.com/?p=447012,1762209000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53998284.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, Aster by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-cardano-aster-by-the-end-of-2025w/,"Google’s advanced Large Language Model, Gemini AI, suggests that investors holding XRP, Cardano, and Aster will see returns many times their initial investment between now and the holiday season. Despite a prolonged downturn through most of October, optimism is still high thanks to the U.S. debut of Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs, alongside the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut. US regulators are still very much on the crypto ball, while macroeconomic concerns around inflation are cooling, creating an appetite for risk. These developments point toward strong altcoin performance driving the next bull cycle, which may even begin this year, with Gemini forecasting XRP, Cardano, and Aster as the leaders. XRP ($XRP): Gemini Predicts 400% Gains by Christmas Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) appears as one of the top breakout contenders in Gemini’s models, with projections showing a potential rally to between $5.85 and $13 by year-end, an increase of roughly 439% from its current price of $2.41. Source: Gemini AI Following a decisive legal victory over the SEC earlier this year, market confidence in Ripple surged, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past 12 months, XRP has jumped 378%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum by a wide margin. Ripple’s rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin, combined with CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s engagement with President Trump, has positioned the company as a regulatory frontrunner, strengthening its appeal to both retail and institutional investors. XRP’s technical chart continues to display several bullish flag formations into 2025, suggesting a potential year-end breakout. If catalysts such as ETF approvals, Ripple inking more strategic partnerships, or clear U.S. crypto regulations emerge, Gemini’s upper projections of $13 are feasible before the year closes. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini Forecasts 700% Surge in Q4 Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the strongest DeFi networks in development, building a reputation as Ethereum’s top challenger thanks to its thriving developer ecosystem and growing suite of decentralized applications. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically peer-reviewed framework emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and formal verification. With a market capitalization of about $21 billion, Cardano holds a prominent position among leading DeFi projects, though it still trails Solana and Ethereum in overall adoption. Gemini’s analysis suggests ADA could climb as high as $7 by the New Year, a remarkable 1,100% gain from its current price of approximately $0.58. If investor sentiment strengthens through the end of the year, Gemini’s models indicate ADA could trade around $3 by late 2025 and potentially surpass its 2021 all-time high of $3.09 should a full-scale bull run take shape. Aster ($ASTER): Project with Ties to CZ Touted for 4x to 5x Gains Aster ($ASTER) is a newly launched decentralized exchange token that’s making waves in the DeFi space. Born from the merger of Astherus and APX Finance in late 2024, the project officially debuted in September 2025 and was listed on Binance the next month. Built on BNB Chain and backed by the venture arm once associated with Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Aster is a next-gen perpetuals DEX, supporting spot and futures trading with up to 1001× leverage. Its standout feature is the “Trade & Earn” model: users can leverage yield-bearing assets as margin, thereby trading and earning simultaneously. In the last 24 hours, Aster’s price shot up 9% despite a general dip that has shaved 3% from crypto’s market cap. While still too new to identify definite trends, Aster briefly broke out of a post-launch downward channel thanks to a whale interest over the weekend. It soon dipped again as traders took profits, but its neutral RSI and relative newness set it up to meet Gemini’s targets over the next two months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin With 100x Potential One emerging project not yet featured in Gemini’s dataset has been generating significant buzz in presale markets. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most discussed meme coin launches of the season, attracting around $3.9 million from investors eager for the next Dogecoin. Marketed as Dogecoin’s louder and more rebellious successor, Maxi Doge captures the degen spirit of crypto through meme contests, community events, and a highly active social media presence. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI enjoys faster and cheaper transaction speeds compared to Dogecoin’s legacy network. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which fuels marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 80% APY in rewards, though returns will decrease as participation rises. The current presale price is $0.000266, with incremental price increases scheduled for each subsequent phase. Investors can purchase MAXI through MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although the slump has rattled many investors, long-term participants view it as a healthy reset, a purge of excess leverage and speculation before the next leg up. History has shown this pattern repeatedly in crypto: sharp corrections before massive bull runs. And this time round, Bitcoin is likely to lose dominance to top-tier altcoins like XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. In fact, the charts suggest these players may explode in price in the coming months. Ripple (XRP): Pioneering the Future of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a lightning-fast, low-cost payment network designed to replace lengthy legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple is also on the radars of the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Adoption is continuing apace thanks to strategic partnerships with multiple banks. All this helped XRP to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, now exceeding $144.5 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin demonstrates the company’s commitment to capturing what will probably be the most widely adopted part of crypto: the stablecoin sector. However, XRP remains a central part of the ledger’s operation as a small amount of it is burned in every transaction. Over the last year, XRP has skyrocketed 378%, hitting $3.65 in mid-July, its highest point since 2018, easily surpassing Bitcoin’s 58% rise during the same timeframe. At present, XRP’s RSI sits close to 41, with prices re-converging with the 30-day moving average, signaling stabilization despite the prolonged downturn. Technical readings still show two bullish flag formations from the summer, which have yet to break out. With U.S. regulators due to greenlight spot ETFs and deliver news about comprehensive crypto legislation before the year is out, a possible run to $5–$10 by the New Year is highly likely. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Rival Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its reputation as one of the fastest, most scalable blockchain ecosystems. With a market cap of around $97 billion and $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), the network’s growth trajectory remains robust. The recent launch of Grayscale’s and Bitwise’s spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to attract significant institutional capital, echoing inflows following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Following a spring low near $100, SOL has since recovered to about $176, while its low RSI of 37 and divergence beneath the 30-day moving average hint that SOL is undervalued right now. Key support holds near $150, with firm resistance around $250. Should ETF-driven demand take off heading into the festive season, SOL could revisit its all-time high of $293.31, and in a prolonged bull phase, even $500 or $1,000 isn’t out of the question. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Doge Army Still Chases the $1 Dream Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the trailblazer that gave us the meme coin concept, debuted in 2013 and remains the dominant token in its category, boasting a market capitalization of around $26.4 billion and an enthusiastic global “Doge Army” following. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Prices briefly broke above $0.30 in mid-September before easing back to about $0.17. Doge’s multi-billion market cap has made it one of the more resilient assets in the space, often tracking price trends of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Dogecoin’s practical use continues to expand as well. Tesla now accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while both PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin payments into their platforms. In a bull-case scenario, DOGE could challenge its 2021 peak of $0.7316 later this year, even potentially breaking past it, before the year is out. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Upgrade for 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Ostensibly a meme coin, $HYPER actually aspires to be an integral upgrade to the Bitcoin network. It’s a Layer 2 that will expand Bitcoin’s throughput while making transacting cheaper. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER introduces DAO-based governance, smart contract functionality, and a meme-bridge enabling frictionless Bitcoin transfers. The presale has already exceeded $25.6 million raised, with analysts like Borch Crypto predicting 100x potential. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, bolstering investor trust. HYPER tokens power every aspect of the network, from governance and staking to transaction fees, and early participants can earn up to 46% APY in staking rewards. Bitcoin is going HYPER. This could be the next major breakout project. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the altcoin’s strong debut, noting that the BSOL led inflows for the week across ETPs, outperforming even Bitcoin and Ethereum-based spot ETFs. What a week for $BSOL , besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m ($IBIT had a rare off week, it'll be back). It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut. pic.twitter.com/HpKUTdq1J5 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 1, 2025 BSOL offers a new touch point for U.S. investors to gain regulated access to SOL staking yields, a feature previously reserved for on-chain participants. This has effectively opened the floodgates for millions in fresh institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem. With SOL still awaiting its own spot ETF approval, BSOL’s success could signal the scale of pent-up demand ready to enter. Grayscale Investments estimates that Solana ETPs could capture 5% of all SOL tokens within two years, representing over $5 billion in value at current prices. Real institutional momentum is now flowing into Solana, and it’s starting on Wall Street . Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Could Spark the Next Major Rally With the consensus among analysts expecting spot Solana ETF approvals this month, sidelined institutional demand could fuel an escape from a 7-month ascending channel. SOL / USD 1-day chart, descending triangle fuels ascending channel. Source. TradingView. The altcoin now tests a strong confluence of support and a potential launchpad setup, with the channel’s lower boundary meeting a historic demand zone at $175. This zone also forms a descending triangle, now nearing its apex, creating a decisive moment for November’s price action. Momentum indicators remain mixed. The MACD histogram has crossed below the signal line, a typical early downtrend signal, while the RSI sits near a historical bottom around 33, suggesting limited downside room. Losing $175 could open the door for a 30% drop to $120, but holding it may prepare SOL for another breakout attempt. The $300 level remains the key breakout threshold. A successful flip of that resistance into support could mark the start of a new uptrend, targeting $500 for a potential 185% gain. Still, with Solana entering corporate balance sheets and institutional exposure deepening through spot ETFs, the rally could extend another 470%, pushing the Solana price toward $1,000 . PepeNode: The Smarter Way to Earn in Any Market With passive income strategies like staking ETFs gaining traction, investors are seeking ways to earn even when markets stand still. With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is accelerating fast. The presale has already surpassed $2 million, with early stakers still earning up to 633% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. As U.S. interest rate easing fuels capital rotation into high-risk assets, PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture meme coin upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

53999074,619467,1762210800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53999074.jpeg,Hong Kong Opens Doors to Global Crypto Markets in Bold Bid to Revive Financial Hub Status,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-opens-doors-to-global-crypto-markets/,"In a progressive decision announced during Fintech Week 2025 , Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has unveiled a sweeping regulatory reform allowing licensed crypto exchanges to connect directly with global order books. The move dismantles the city’s “ringfenced” model that previously restricted trading within its borders, enabling access to international capital and liquidity. SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung emphasized that the shift follows extensive work to ensure investor protection. “Once we are sure that we can protect investors, we do relax, as we did with global liquidity,” Leung stated. The reform aligns Hong Kong’s digital asset framework with international financial standards, signaling the city’s ambition to reclaim its reputation as a leading fintech hub in Asia. What it Means for Hong Kong’s Digital Asset Ecosystem The SFC’s policy shift is part of a broader effort to modernize the region’s digital finance landscape. Over recent years, Hong Kong has launched a licensing regime for crypto exchanges, approved Bitcoin and Ether-linked exchange-traded products, and expanded oversight for digital asset funds. In partnership, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing to issue the first stablecoin licenses by next year, while regulators are crafting new frameworks for crypto dealers and custodians. Additionally, the SFC has removed the 12-month trading history requirement for HKMA-approved tokens and stablecoins, a change expected to accelerate listings of new digital assets. Industry observers view these developments as pivotal for attracting institutional players. Global firms like Binance and Coinbase could soon gain entry via brokerage licenses, faster and less restrictive than full exchange approvals. Currently, 11 exchanges and 49 brokers operate under SFC oversight, a number expected to rise sharply under the new system. Hong Kong’s Bid to Reclaim Market Relevance This policy overhaul highlights Hong Kong’s determination to position itself as a global crypto hub amid fierce competition from jurisdictions like Singapore and the United States. While mainland China continues to ban crypto trading , Hong Kong has opted for a regulated innovation model balancing market access with strict compliance. Leung acknowledged the delicate balance regulators must strike: “Overly strict requirements risk driving liquidity and talent elsewhere, but too little oversight could undermine trust.” Hong Kong’s new policies on global liquidity and tokenization mark a shift toward deeper integration with international crypto markets.

Announced in a blog post Monday, the new structure will channel funding through two avenues: a “wishlist” of focus areas identified by EF teams, and formal requests for proposals (RFPs) addressing specific ecosystem needs. A Shift Toward Strategic Coordination The previous open grants process, paused earlier this year, had stretched the Foundation’s administrative capacity due to high demand. According to EF, the revamped program will better align funding decisions with Ethereum’s long-term priorities by coordinating directly with internal technical and research teams. “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the Foundation said. “But the growing volume of applications limited our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” The first batch of wishlist items and RFPs is now available, covering areas such as cryptography, privacy, scalability, and community growth. In 2024, the Foundation awarded around $3 million to 105 projects and initiatives, continuing its mission to foster open-source innovation since the program’s 2018 launch. Ethereum’s Technical Upgrades Continue The update comes just after Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade went live on its final testnet, Hoodi, ahead of a mainnet launch expected December 3. Fusaka introduces EIP-7594 (PeerDAS), allowing validators to access smaller data chunks from layer-2 networks, improving efficiency and scalability. Additional proposals, EIPs 7825 and 7935, aim to increase gas limits and boost performance in preparation for Ethereum’s shift to parallel execution — a critical milestone that will allow multiple transactions to process simultaneously.

Related Reading: Forget Billions—XRP Could Hit Trillions, Leading Expert Says According to reports, Zhao said he personally owns just over 2 million ASTER tokens — a holding that has been valued at about $2.5 million in coverage of the event. That admission prompted a rapid buying wave and heavy media noise, with traders and observers trying to sort what the move means for the project and the broader4 market. Aster Trading Activity On Fire As Price Rises Based on reports, ASTER climbed from roughly $0.91 to a peak near $1.26 on the day the disclosure hit newsfeeds. Volume also surged: one snapshot put 24-hour turnover at around $224 million before the announcement and at more than $2 billion afterward. Platform metrics moved too; total value locked on the Aster system reached about $1 billion dollars in recent updates. Market watchers pointed out that those jumps happened within hours of Zhao’s statement, pushing the token into headlines and onto many traders’ watchlists. Full disclosure. I just bought some Aster today, using my own money, on @Binance. I am not a trader. I buy and hold. pic.twitter.com/wvmBwaXbKD — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 2, 2025 Supply Concerns And Background Ties Reports have disclosed that Aster’s circulating supply stands at about 2 billion tokens while total supply is 8 billion. That gap has raised alarms among analysts who say future token unlocks could add selling pressure. At the same time, discussion has grown about whether Zhao’s stake represents a purely personal bet or something tied to past venture ties, like connections to YZi Labs (previously Binance Labs). Some community voices welcomed the vote of confidence, while others urged caution and more disclosure about timing and intent. Whales, Shorts And The Need For Transparency Traders already placed big bets in both directions after the pop. Some large holders were reported to be taking profits, while short sellers were opening positions on the belief that the rally could be fleeting. Based on reports, competition with other derivatives and exchange projects — names like Hyperliquid were mentioned in analyst commentary — will test whether Aster can keep user interest beyond the headlines. Observers also flagged that massive daily volume spikes are often followed by quick retracement if underlying usage does not grow. Related Reading: XRP’s Next Earthquake: Billions Set To Flow In, ‘Supply Shock’ Coming—Analyst Volume, Unlock Schedules, And Product Signals Investors and reporters will be watching three main things: whether high trading volume holds up, how many tokens are set to unlock and hit markets, and whether the project builds real, steady user activity on its platform. According to current data, those variables will likely determine if this move becomes a lasting repricing or a short-lived event.

These three tokens have suffered significant drops in the past 24 hours, yet these falls send them more firmly into oversold territory, meaning that a big rebound should be coming soon . We examine their technicals and provide price predictions in this article, while we also take a look at an up-and-coming token that could rally when it lists in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Imminent ETF Launches Will Send Alt to New ATHs XRP has declined by 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.40 also representing an 8% fall in a week and a 20% drop in a month. The altcoin does remain up by 375% in the past year, however, underlining its strong medium- and long-term momentum, which it should regain soon enough. The market is waiting patiently for the launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which some commentators suggest will launch in the next couple of weeks . These will result in a substantial increase in demand for XRP, which could surge as a result. Its chart today shows the coin in an oversold position, meaning that ETF launches could be the catalyst that causes a strong positive correction. Source: TradingView XRP’s two main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – has been in negative positions since August, indicating that the coin is well overdue a growth spurt. The bullish pennant in which XRP has been trading also suggests this, with the coin poised to reach $3 by the end of this month. And with Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company, it could top $4 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Altcoin Recovering After Release of Migration Figures At $0.2397, PI is down by 3% in a day and by 11% in a week, although it does hold on to an impressive 15% increase in the past fortnight. It has posted this fortnightly increase on the back of encouraging updates regarding mainnet migration, with the Pi Network team revealing towards the end of last month that 2.69 million ‘Pioneers’ have completed this migration, while 3.36 million have completed the KYC checks necessary for migration. Given that PI has had a bad time since reaching an ATH of $2.99 at the end of February, this update on migrations is reassuring, going some way to counteract earlier concerns that the mainnet migration had been handled poorly. And if we look at PI’s chart today, we see that it’s showing some bullish signs of recovery, with its relative strength index having risen above 50 in the past week. Source: TradingView Whether it can maintain this momentum is an open question, however, although the launch of altcoin ETFs could produce a market-wide optimism that will benefit its price. Longer term, Pi Network still faces skepticism from the wider cryptocurrency community, with the coin yet to list on major tokens such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Without such listings, PI may continue to struggle, whereas new listings could send it back up to whole figures quickly. It could potentially reach $1 by December, while good news could send it closer to $2. Crypto Price Prediction: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Meme Coin Close to Bottom, Could Double by 2026 SHIB is another coin that has been struggling in 2025, with its current price of $0.000009564 making for a 5% loss in 24 hours, an 8.5% loss in a week and a 23% decline in a month. Worse still, SHIB is actually down by 44% in the past year, whereas most top-50 coins have posted annual gains. This indicates the funk Shiba Inu is in right now, with whales and other traders neglecting the alt in favor of newer meme tokens (e.g. Fartcoin). And unlike Dogecoin, there aren’t any SHIB ETFs waiting to launch, something which could deprive the coin of a much-needed source of demand and momentum. Its chart today is reflective of its situation, given that its two main indicators are in very low positions. Source: TradingView Of course, the positive implication of oversold indicators is that the corresponding asset should bounce back strongly, but it’s hard to say whether SHIB has the fundamentals to mount a full and sustainable comeback. There have been efforts to boosts its utility, such as the launch of its layer-two network Shibarium a couple of years ago, but so far this has done little to impress the wider market. For instance, its 24-hour trading volume today is $145 million, whereas the figure for Dogecoin is $1.8 billion. This is a big difference, and without some positive news or update, SHIB may witness only modest growth. It could reach $0.000020 by December, and potentially see in the New Year at around $0.000040. PEPENODE Raises $2 Million in Presale: Is Mine-to-Earn Token the Next Big Thing? In addition to major tokens, some traders may also want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential gains. Newer coins can often show more volatility than more established alternatives, something which is often the case with presale coins. Such coins have the benefit of generating momentum during their sales, helping them to enjoy rallies once they list for the first time. The last thing you'd want to lose Luckily with PEPENODE the mining is 100% virtual… No hardware needed https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/n0Sre6uGgV — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 3, 2025 One presale coin looking to do this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token which has raised just over $2 million in its sale. This is a very promising figure, and highlights the excitement PEPENODE has been generating since it launched its presale. What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s crypto’s first mine-to-earn token, giving users the opportunity to earn rewards from their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, they can earn greater rewards, which the platform will pay out in third-party coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. Because users will need more PEPENODE to buy more nodes, the token could experience considerable demand. And by extension, it could see substantial price increases, especially when holders can also stake it. Investors can join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website. The coin currently sells for $0.0011317, although this will rise again in two days.

The token dropped 4% in the past 24 hours, but trading volumes have nearly doubled – a sign that whales are preparing for the next move. Data from on-chain supply clusters shows heavy accumulation between $2.52 and $2.54 , confirming this as a critical demand zone. If XRP bounces back above these levels, it would suggest strong underlying buyer confidence, potentially kickstarting the next leg up. Today’s dip likely stems from growing uncertainty around the Fed’s rate decision in December, which has triggered broader market jitters. Still, with fresh ETFs on the horizon and Ripple’s growing institutional partnerships, XRP may be positioning for a long-awaited breakout. XRP Price Prediction: $2.35 Level May Act as Launchpad for Higher Prices In the past 12 hours, XRP has dropped sharply after rejecting a move above $2.50 – a former support zone now acting as resistance, at least for the moment. However, if the downtrend finds a floor at the $2.30 to $2.35 support range, history suggests XRP could bounce strongly – and this time, the rebound may launch it toward new all-time highs. This key area has served as a reliable launchpad before, and a strong reaction from buyers could quickly flip the short-term narrative. On the 4-hour chart, XRP’s RSI has dipped below the 14-day EMA, signaling growing selling pressure. Yet, oversold signals could also mark the early stages of a reversal. As the broader crypto market struggles to stabilize, investors are increasingly turning to early-stage tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a presale project that could offer outsized returns once sentiment shifts back to risk-on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Nearly $4M to Bring Together Like-Minded Traders This bull market is not over yet as Bitcoin and altcoins are still sitting near all-time highs. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme that plans to take full advantage of the hype that comes along with positive cycles by launching a token that fully embraces retail traders’ ‘up only’ energy. Inspired by the popular Doge meme, this token plans to build a vibrant community of like-minded degens who can share ideas , strategies , and brag about their Ws to earn rewards and have fun. Meanwhile, through the Maxi Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds into the most promising tokens. The earnings will be reinvested on marketing efforts to make Maxi Doge known. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, you can simply visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect your favorite Ethereum wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to complete your transaction. Buy $MAXI Here.

In a post shared on X, Harris stated that his “money is on XRP all the way” when asked how he would allocate a hypothetical $1,000 investment between Bitcoin and XRP. He explained that, based on current prices, Bitcoin is trading around $107,000, and XRP at approximately $2.40 , the same investment would yield vastly different holdings, only 0.009 BTC or about 416 XRP. Harris used this comparison to illustrate why smaller-cap assets often appeal more to retail investors. In his view, XRP’s lower price and smaller market capitalization give it more room for rapid expansion during bullish phases. He argued that the chances of XRP doubling or even increasing tenfold in the short term are higher than Bitcoin achieving the same growth, given the disparity in market size. If you have $1000 to invest do you want: $1000 / $120,000 = 0.0083 BTC or $1000 / $2.40 = 416.67 XRP Then fast forward 90 days from today: Which is more likely to 2X, 4X or even 10X during the upcoming altseason? Now fast forward to 3 years from now and what will your return… — Daniel Harris (@DanielLHarrisUS) October 20, 2025 At present, XRP’s market capitalization sits near $145 billion, whereas Bitcoin’s exceeds $2.1 trillion. Harris suggested that it is far more feasible for XRP to reach $300 billion than for Bitcoin to double to $4.4 trillion, particularly within a 90-day timeframe. His analysis aligns with a growing sentiment among altcoin advocates who believe that smaller, utility-driven assets can outperform dominant cryptocurrencies during specific market cycles. Altcoins’ Accessibility and Appeal Harris’ remarks were made in response to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, who recently discussed the psychological barriers new investors face when entering the market. According to Kwok , the high unit price of Bitcoin discourages first-time buyers, even though fractional ownership is possible. He explained that many prefer purchasing entire coins of lower-priced tokens, which feels more tangible and rewarding than holding small fractions of Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Kwok emphasized that the issue is not financial capability but perception. New investors tend to associate owning a whole coin with greater value or progress, a mindset that continues to drive enthusiasm toward affordable altcoins such as XRP, ADA, and SOL. The Counterpoint: Bitcoin’s Fractional Advantage The conversation originated from comments made by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, who countered the claim that crypto is too expensive. Armstrong reiterated that investors can buy any portion of Bitcoin or Ethereum, removing barriers to entry for those with limited capital. Nonetheless, both Kwok and Harris argued that investor psychology remains a decisive factor. Even with fractional purchasing available, many people still gravitate toward coins with lower nominal prices, particularly in the early stages of an altseason, when such assets have historically delivered higher percentage gains. For example, over the past year, Bitcoin’s value has increased by about 60%, while XRP has recorded gains exceeding 380%. This performance gap supports Harris’ view that smaller-cap cryptocurrencies can generate stronger returns during speculative rallies. However, analysts also caution that this potential comes with greater risk. Unlike Bitcoin, which tends to experience moderate corrections, altcoins often face much steeper declines during market downturns. A 5% Bitcoin pullback can translate to losses of 30–50% in some lower-cap tokens, making timing and risk management crucial for investors drawn to XRP’s growth prospects.

Recently, whispers circulated about a potential legal battle brewing between prominent crypto market maker Wintermute and the global exchange giant Binance. But now, we have crucial clarity directly from the source regarding a possible Wintermute Binance lawsuit , putting an end to much speculation. Dispelling Rumors: No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit on the Horizon Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of Wintermute, has decisively put an end to speculation surrounding his firm’s intentions. He confirmed that Wintermute has absolutely no plans to sue Binance over the significant liquidation event that occurred in October. This statement directly addresses persistent rumors that Wintermute was preparing legal action against the exchange. Gaevoy took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation, emphasizing that these rumors are simply untrue. He sees no valid reason for such an action, providing a clear stance from the market maker. This clarification follows a significant event in October, which saw one of the largest forced crypto liquidations ever recorded. During this period, Binance’s auto-deleveraging (ADL) system reportedly experienced malfunctions. This system is designed to manage risks during volatile market conditions. However, its alleged malfunction led to unexpected losses for several trading firms involved in the market, sparking widespread concern across the crypto community. Understanding the October Liquidation and Initial Concerns Initially, after the October liquidation event, Gaevoy himself acknowledged the issues publicly. He had previously stated that he understood certain firms were preparing legal action against Binance. This earlier comment, reported by The Block, likely fueled the recent rumors of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit . It’s important to distinguish between Gaevoy’s understanding of other firms’ intentions and Wintermute’s own plans. His latest statement makes it unequivocally clear that Wintermute is not among those considering legal recourse. The incident highlighted the inherent risks and complexities within high-volume crypto trading. When such large-scale liquidations occur, the ripple effects can be substantial, impacting: Market stability: Sudden price movements and forced sales can increase volatility. Trader confidence: Firms experiencing losses may re-evaluate their strategies or trust in platforms. Operational integrity: Exchange systems are rigorously tested, but malfunctions can still occur under extreme stress. Despite these challenges, Wintermute’s decision is a significant development. Why No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit? A Strategic Choice Market makers like Wintermute play a vital role in the crypto ecosystem, providing liquidity and ensuring smooth trading across various assets. When an event like a large-scale liquidation occurs, it can significantly impact their operations and profitability. Despite the potential challenges posed by the ADL malfunction, Wintermute’s CEO has chosen a path of non-confrontation. This decision suggests that perhaps internal resolutions, direct communication, or different strategic considerations are at play. It avoids a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, which can be a drain on resources and reputation for both parties involved. The absence of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit helps to stabilize market sentiment and allows firms to focus on core business. This strategic choice by Wintermute could be driven by several factors: Maintaining business relationships: Legal disputes can strain crucial partnerships in a closely-knit industry. Cost-benefit analysis: The potential costs of litigation might outweigh the expected recovery. Focus on core operations: Avoiding lawsuits allows the firm to dedicate resources to market making and expansion. Alternative resolutions: It’s possible that other forms of redress or understanding have been reached between the parties. Implications for Market Trust and Future Relations Gaevoy’s direct and transparent communication helps to build trust within the often-opaque crypto industry. When leaders address rumors head-on, it provides much-needed clarity for investors and market participants. The decision not to pursue a Wintermute Binance lawsuit also signals a potential for continued, albeit cautious, collaboration or at least a non-adversarial relationship between two major players in the crypto space. This is generally positive for market stability and the broader health of the crypto ecosystem. It allows both entities to focus on their core operations rather than being entangled in litigation, fostering a more mature and predictable environment. Such clarity is essential for an industry still maturing and striving for broader institutional adoption. Transparency from key players like Wintermute and Binance helps to instill confidence and reduce speculative volatility driven by unverified information. The crypto community often reacts strongly to news, and definitive statements like this can prevent unnecessary market jitters. In conclusion, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy has unequivocally stated that his firm will not be suing Binance over the October liquidation event. This definitive statement puts an end to widespread speculation and provides a clear picture for the crypto community. While the liquidation event caused issues for some, Wintermute has chosen to move forward without legal action, fostering a more stable environment for crypto market participants.

The update was shared by the project’s marketing lead, Lucie, who revealed that Shiba Inu has been added to the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework, a joint initiative between Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell. According to Lucie’s post on X, the new classification places Shiba Inu under the “Consumer & Culture” category. This designation recognizes SHIB as part of the growing segment of cryptocurrencies that intersect with entertainment, culture, and online communities, an area where Shiba Inu has built one of the strongest global followings. Expanding Institutional Recognition The FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework was introduced in 2023 to categorize digital assets beyond the scope of traditional large-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The framework divides assets into five distinct segments: Financials, Smart Contract Platforms, Currencies, Utilities & Services, and Consumer & Culture. Good news for SHIB holders Grayscale’s Market Byte Here Come the Altcoins from October 2025 officially lists Shiba Inu SHIB under the Consumer & Culture crypto sector in the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors framework. SHIB is recognized by Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell as… pic.twitter.com/8jBpKkP9PL — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 2, 2025 When the index was first launched, tokens like ImmutableX (IMX), Decentraland (MANA), and ApeCoin (APE) were included under the Consumer & Culture classification. Shiba Inu was notably absent at the time. However, in the latest update, Grayscale has officially included SHIB in that category, a move Lucie says reaffirms the token’s staying power and the strength of its community-driven ecosystem. She added that this acknowledgment reflects the project’s long-term potential and confirms that its foundation remains strong and its vision is alive. SHIB Among Assets Eligible for Spot ETFs Beyond classification, Shiba Inu’s inclusion in the framework carries further significance. According to Grayscale’s latest report, SHIB is among the cryptocurrencies that satisfy the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Generic Listing Standards (GLS), a regulatory guideline that allows certain crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to be listed without individual SEC approval. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Under the GLS framework, exchanges can list spot ETFs for assets that meet defined eligibility criteria and have an effective registration statement. Grayscale’s analysis identified 11 cryptocurrencies across four sectors that qualify under these standards. In the Consumer & Culture category, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are the only two assets recognized. Other qualifying assets include XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash from the Currencies sector; Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche from Smart Contract Platforms; and Chainlink from Utilities & Services. Currently, Solana and Litecoin already have spot ETFs trading in the United States, while applications for Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash remain under review. SHIB Yet to Receive a Standalone ETF Filing Despite meeting the SEC’s Generic Listing Standards, there is still no individual application for a Shiba Inu spot ETF in the U.S. market. However, industry observers note growing institutional interest in SHIB, particularly following T. Rowe Price’s mention of the token as a possible component in its Active Crypto ETF product lineup. Outside the United States, the project has already seen success in traditional finance integration. Valour Inc., a European investment firm, previously launched a Swedish krona (SEK)-denominated ETP tracking Shiba Inu’s performance. While Grayscale’s latest framework update identifies Shiba Inu as eligible for a future ETF under current regulatory standards, it remains uncertain whether the firm intends to proceed with an official filing. Still, the token’s inclusion signals growing acknowledgment of SHIB’s influence and longevity within the broader crypto market.

Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-case-vs-bear-case/,"On November 2, 2025, crypto analyst Ignas | DeFi distilled crypto’s current standoff into a clean ledger of pros and cons. The Bearish Case For Crypto The first bear pillar is the “AI bubble” overhang. Late-October headlines crystallized the debate as Nvidia briefly breached a $5 trillion market value, a milestone that sharpened concern that equity valuations tied to AI infrastructure spending may be running ahead of realized returns. Point two—“bullish news fail to pump”—was on display as “Uptober” ended with a whimper for the crypto market. Despite intermittent policy tailwinds and strong ETF inflows mid-month, both Bitcoin and Ethereum faded into month-end, and US spot ETF flows turned sharply negative over the final three trading days of October, a pattern consistent with risk aversion after the Oct. 10–11 shock. Related Reading: Is Crypto ‘Boring’ Now? Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing That shock, the “10/10 crash,” is the third bear lever. The two-day downdraft followed a sudden tariff escalation threat from the White House and produced one of the largest one-day liquidations in crypto history, spurring a rush for downside hedges and leaving the market probing for “dead entities” and hidden impairments. Cycle timing is Ignas’ fourth bear note. The fourth Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024 (block 840,000). Prior cycles do not map one-for-one, but the post-halving window is a pattern which gets a lot of attention at the moment. If the “cycle is not dead,” a Bitcoin top may already be in or is looming by the end of the year. “Old OG wallets selling” is the fifth bear claimant—and, for once, the chain tells a clear story. Since mid-October, long-term holders have materially increased net distribution, with Glassnode and other trackers flagging outflows on the order of tens of thousands of BTC, alongside headline-grabbing awakenings of Satoshi-era wallets. This does not prove panic, but it does inject supply at a delicate moment. Negative ETF flows round out the bear list. Farside’s fund-by-fund ledger shows pronounced outflows on October 29–31 across several US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with total daily net redemptions exceeding $470 million on October 29 and $488 million on October 30, before another hit on October 31 (191 million). While October closed with a inflow total of 3.424 billion, the message: the “fast money” cohort that chased the summer breakout was, at least temporarily, in retreat. Buffett’s caution is the macro bear exclamation point. Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter print revealed a record $381.7 billion cash pile and a twelfth straight quarter as a net seller of equities—a posture that telegraphs wariness about broad risk assets and liquidity conditions even as operating earnings rise. For crypto, this is not a direct flow, but it is a bellwether for global risk appetite. The Bull Case For Crypto The bull case, however, is not hand-waving. Start with “liquidity easing & interest cuts.” The ECB has already delivered substantial easing this year and paused; the Bank of England has begun cutting; and in the US, the Federal Reserve is also expected to close out the year with two more cuts while ending quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Powell, The FOMC, And Crypto: The Message Everyone Missed Ignas also says “no clear euphoria,” and—empirically—he’s right. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index spent the past week toggling between “Fear” and low “Neutral,” printing in the mid-30s to low-40s as of November 3. That’s a long way from the 80s–90s “extreme greed” that often sets up blow-off tops, and it supports the idea that positioning is not yet dangerously crowded. Institutional adoption remains the quiet compounding force in the bull ledger. With $30.2 billion year-to-date inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs are fueling most of the market strength. On policy, the US did more than chatter in 2025: the Senate passed, and President Trump signed, a bipartisan stablecoin law in July. A broader market-structure bill remains in play, but even the stablecoin win is non-trivial for on-chain liquidity and payments rails. Seasonality also favors patience. Since 2013, Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter on average, with multiple cycles posting outsized November–December runs. Then there’s the stablecoin plumbing. Despite October’s chaos, aggregate stablecoin float sits around $307–308 billion and notched fresh all-time highs in mid-October—a sign that dry powder inside crypto’s own rails remains abundant and ready to mobilize if confidence stabilizes. As of today, DefiLlama pegs the total at roughly $307.6 billion. Finally, the US–China trade war has seen extremely positive progress. “This is the BIGGEST de-escalation yet. Under the new US-China trade deal, President Trump made a HUGE agreement with China: China will suspend ALL retaliatory tariffs announced since March 4th. And, China will suspend or remove ALL retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken since March 4th. This is not getting nearly enough attention,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X on Sunday. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.56 trillion.

54002411,619348,1762214449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54002411.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Retail Retreat: Shrimp Deposits Drop 5x Since Early 2023,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-retail-retreat-shrimp-deposits-drop-5x/,"Bitcoin is showing renewed fragility as price struggles to reclaim the $110,000 level, putting bulls on the defensive and exposing the market to further downside risk. Selling pressure has been building across the market, and BTC now finds itself probing lower demand zones as traders reassess positioning after recent volatility. While the macro backdrop remains broadly supportive, near-term sentiment has shifted toward caution as liquidity thins and speculative flows recede. A key dynamic shaping this cycle is the absence of retail participation. According to top analyst Darkfost, retail investor activity — measured through small holder inflows to Binance — has fallen sharply. Since early 2023, just after the bear market ended, the 90-day moving average of shrimp inflows has dropped from roughly 552 BTC per day to just 92 BTC today. This more than five-fold decline marks one of the steepest drops in retail engagement ever seen in a Bitcoin recovery phase. This structural shift underscores how different this cycle is from previous ones. With retail sitting on the sidelines, Bitcoin is being driven primarily by institutional flows, large holders , and long-term accumulation behavior. For bulls, the path forward likely hinges on whether new liquidity arrives — or whether current selling pressure pushes BTC into deeper support before the next leg higher can begin. Spot ETFs Reshape Market Participation as Retail Fades The decline in retail participation accelerated sharply with the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Before ETFs went live, small holders were sending roughly 450 BTC per day to Binance. Since the ETF debut, that figure has collapsed to just 92 BTC per day, and the downtrend has continued. This shift marks a structural change in how retail interacts with Bitcoin and where liquidity enters the market. Darkfost outlines three primary drivers behind this dramatic decline. First, a portion of the retail crowd migrated to ETFs, opting for the convenience and perceived security of regulated financial products over self-custody and traditional exchange activity. This naturally reduced on-chain inflows to Binance and similar platforms. Second, remaining retail investors have shifted behavior, choosing to hold long-term rather than trade, indicating stronger hands and a more disciplined class of small holders. Third, many early retail accumulators have simply graduated out of the shrimp cohort, now holding more than 0.1 BTC and no longer being counted in that data segment. These dynamics reveal a profound evolution in Bitcoin’s market structure. The current cycle is being driven not by speculative retail surges but by institutional flows, emerging whales, corporate treasury strategies, and long-term accumulation addresses that rarely sell. As a result, Bitcoin’s supply is tightening at the margins even as price consolidates — creating a slow-burning but powerful supply-demand setup unlike previous cycles. The forces supporting Bitcoin today are more structurally resilient, but they also produce a market rhythm that is quieter, more methodical, and less euphoric than traditional retail-led bull runs. Bitcoin Remains Trapped Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $107,250, holding above a key support zone after another rejection from resistance. The daily chart shows BTC struggling to regain momentum, with multiple attempts to reclaim the $110K–$112K band failing as sellers consistently step in around short-term resistance and moving average clusters. This area, highlighted on the chart, represents a critical liquidity and acceptance zone — until price breaks above it decisively, upside momentum will remain capped. BTC is currently trading below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a bearish short-term structure that points to continued market hesitation. The 200-day moving average sits slightly below current price and is acting as an important dynamic support. Losing that zone would open the door to a potential retest of the $104K–$105K region, where strong demand previously emerged during October’s flush. On the upside, a clean break above $112K, followed by a reclaim of the $117,500 Point of Control, is required to reset bullish momentum and put the next leg higher back in play. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound and cautious, with sellers defending overhead levels and buyers stepping in only at key supports. Volatility remains suppressed as the market waits for fresh catalysts and liquidity inflows.

The three months, which ended on Wednesday, saw $21 billion in short-term borrowing, down from the $590 billion forecast issued in July, indicating a decrease in short-term borrowing. Officials attribute most of the changes to more cash than expected at the beginning of the quarter. The data available suggests that in early October, the Treasury had approximately $891 in cash, which was above the $850 in summer gross cash. Using a substantial portion of the trove allowed the department to slow its rate of wealth increase for spending and debt repayment while still meeting all obligations. Treasury leverages a strong cash buffer The Treasury’s cut results from careful cash management, given there were months of heavy issuance to rebuild reserves following the suspension of the debt ceiling at the start of the calendar year. In previous quarters, the Treasury had increased sales of short-term bills to replenish its coffers. But strong tax inflows and cautious outlays have left it with a much larger cushion than expected. According to analysts, this could ease some of the tension in the bond markets, which have been pressured by the rapid pace of supply and an increase in longer-term interest rates. A borrowing reduction was a strong move to get the Treasury stabilizer working again, according to analysts quoted by the Financial Times. In addition, reductions in the borrowing requirement may help steady Treasury yields, making it easier for investors to anticipate interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, economists claim that the reduction is not an indication of general fiscal moderation. Spending at the federal level remains unchanged, and borrowing is still significantly higher than it was before the pandemic. Other obstacles remain for the Treasury. Treasury maintains high borrowing plans for early 2026 In summary, the Treasury plans to borrow approximately $578 billion between January and March 2026, contingent upon a year-end cash balance of $850 billion. This estimate aligns with its previous projections, underscoring that federal borrowing is expected to be extensive over the next few quarters. That is because the government continues to spend a significant amount on entitlement programs, its infrastructure plan, and other initiatives. However, market observers expect a balance between bill, note, and bond issues in the indicated bill cut. Therefore, the primary aim is to create an issuance plan that will provide the appropriate levels of liquidity across the maturity spectrum without destabilizing the Treasury market. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether the U.S. economy slows down and fiscal policymakers fail to pass a longer-term budget solution, this cut will be trivial compared to a historically large Q4 borrowing estimate. The final point is that persistent fiscal deficits will remain, and excellent debt management will be even more indispensable now than previously. This means that the oversupply issue will offer investors short-term relief from being bothersome. Still, their focus will instantly be on how the Treasury expects to transform its strategy for Q1 or 2026, given existing economic conditions and prevailing political states.

In the speech, Cook demonstrated her support for the recent interest rate cut and asserted that she is willing to consider further reductions. Notably, the Federal Governor has largely kept a low profile since Trump attempted to remove her in August due to allegations of mortgage fraud. To avoid trouble, Cook shifted her focus to the legal battles that have enabled her to remain at the central bank. Cook agrees on further rate cuts while facing legal battles Addressing the audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. On Monday, November 3, Cook highlighted her outlook regarding the country’s economic status and her opinion on monetary policy . She said the economy was strong; however, the Federal Governor pointed out risks to steady inflation and low unemployment. Cook agreed with the Federal Open Market Committee’s earlier decision to lower the central bank’s crucial interest rate by a quarter percentage point, which passed with a 10-2 vote. This decision marks the second consecutive meeting to result in a rate cut . In a statement, the Federal Governor expressed that she believes the decision was right because she felt that the threats surrounding job loss are more substantial than those related to surging inflation. Therefore, based on her argument, this latest reduction in the fed funds rate is another significant step towards normalizing their policy. Meanwhile, courts have stopped Trump from dismissing Cook. Sources close to the matter expressed that several individuals viewed the president’s move as a key problem for the central bank’s independence. On the other hand, White House officials accused Cook of issuing false details on her application for federally backed home loans. However, after several considerations, the Federal Governor was neither found guilty of any crime nor were any charges filed against her. Responding to these claims, Cook mentioned “clerical errors” in the loan applications. When reports requested her to provide information on the situation, she declined to respond. Still, Cook continues to undertake her responsibility at the Federal Reserve, which reduced its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December. Jerome Powell’s remarks on rate cuts raise concerns among individuals Looking ahead, Cook pointed out that she would continue to depend on the data released to make her decision. This was after FOMC officials hinted that there is a likelihood of another rate cut before the end of the year. “As always, I assess my monetary policy position at each meeting based on new data from various sources, my changing outlook, and the balance of risks,” she explained. According to Cook, every Federal meeting, including December’s, is crucial. When asked to comment on the impacts of Trump’s tariffs, the Federal Governor expressed their desire to determine if the impact of tariffs persists over time. She explained that this applies to whether companies are delaying price increases and what they have done with their stock, adding that there is much to expect and examine with the December meeting approaching. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised concerns in the market during his news conference after he stated that a cut in December is not guaranteed. Powell argued that there are many different opinions within the committee, which usually tend to agree on policy decisions Following his remarks, individuals are awaiting the December meeting to find out the Fed’s final decision.

This New Crypto Coin Could Lead Q1 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-cryptocurrency-to-25x-this-new-crypto-coin-could-lead-q1-2026-2/,"A significant change is observable as the crypto world is preparing to take 2026. Investors are drifting out of the household-brand coins and seeking new crypto tokens which do something, ventures that have real application and which can grow in the first place. The name that has continued to emerge is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi initiative that aims to make lending decentralised and more transparent. It has an organized presale, a strong audit in the books and actual momentum in the community, many people believe MUTM is one of the best crypto coins to hold before Q1 2026. Presale Heat and The Numbers That Matter Currently, Mutuum Finance is in the presale Phase 6. Tokens are sold at $0.035 price, which will rise to $0.04 in the next round and the actual price of launch is $0.06. To provide some background, the presale began at a very low price, of only $0.01, meaning that MUTM has already increased 250% and that is a strong indicator of demand. Up to this point, the project has raised over 18.3 million dollars, attracted in excess of 17,600 holders, and sold over 785 million tokens. That’s about 85% of Phase 6 done. Of the 4 billion, 45.5% will be reserved as presale or that is 1.82 billion. Every round is selling out quicker than the previous one which is only indicative of the fact that the interest is building up as Mutuum Finance nears launch. The presale also has a daily leaderboard where the best contributor in the day will win $500 in MUTM. It is an ingenious method of retaining people. What Mutuum Finance Is building In its simplest form, Mutuum Finance is assembling a non-custodial lending and borrowing platform that is decentralized. Smart contracts are the order of the day. Borrow and lend your crypto, generate passive income and offer collateral with no intermediaries in between. By depositing assets, you receive mtTokens as a receipt and yield generating instrument. Put in 1 ETH, you get 1 mtETH. The kicker? That the growth of the value of that mtETH is provided with the loan being paid in the form of interest. There is also a buy and distribute system. A portion of the platform charges is used to purchase MUTM tokens at the open market and sent to holders of the mtTokens. This makes demand constant and provides incentive to be patient in the long-term. Security’s a big deal here. Mutuum Finance already successfully had a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating and started a $50,000 bug bounty to identify any code problems prior to the launch of mainnet. Stablecoin and Oracle Plans Mutuum Finance has its own USD-pegged stablecoin plans, which are overcollateralized by the loans in the platform. That maintains things stable and liquid and the mint-and-burn system of operation means it can change supply when necessary. The stablecoin will further remit additional yield to the treasury of the project. In the case of price data, Mutuum Finance will be relying on trusted oracles such as Chainlink. In that manner, collateral values remain true despite the market becoming wild. Analysts believe that such features would make it highly adopted upon its launch. There are even those expecting that MUTM should be valued between $0.30 and $0.40 in the first year of operation – 9x to 12x higher than its present presale price. V1 Launch and the Big Players The initial edition of the protocol developed by Mutuum Finance is slated to go live in Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. That launch will involve the Liquidity Pool, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and a Liquidator Bot, which will intervene automatically in the event of undercollateralized positions. It is a breakthrough, as Mutuum Finance is not a mere thought anymore, but a product. It is then that both regular punters and larger entities tend to take notice. Actually evidence of big half a dozen figure presale purchases have already appeared, so you see some whales are already getting on to the boat before prices get inflated. Phase 6 is nearly complete, and a price increase is imminent, leaving a little less than one month to purchase below $0.04. Of course, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to take charge, but there are new DeFi projects with tangible fundamentals that typically promise a larger payoff. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an interesting case due to a number of factors: they are focused on transparent lending, they have developed smart tokenomics, and the community is actually active. Having already raised over $18 million dollars and with a clean audit and V1 on the horizon, Mutuum is fast becoming one of the best projects to follow over the next five years (2026).

This decline has sparked a renewed sense of bearish sentiment among investors, and experts caution that conditions could worsen in the coming days. November Deadline Approaches Market expert CryptoBirb recently expressed concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), noting that the market is already ten days into a bearish cycle. According to CryptoBirb, diving into on-chain data, the more alarming the picture appears. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? CryptoBirb’s analysis begins with cycle peak data: it has been 1,078 days since the low in November 2022, which is 101.2% of the crypto cycle complete. Additionally, it has been 563 days since the last Halving, with 45 days remaining within the typical 518 to 580-day peak range. Alarmingly, the anticipated rally leading to this peak has not materialized, and there are only 17 days left before the window for a peak closes on November 20. Missed breakouts during this time frame have signaled the end of previous bullish cycles. When comparing the current situation to the 2017 cycle, it is noted that Bitcoin reached its peak on December 17, 2017, 1,068 days after its low. With BTC now 1,078 days into the current cycle, the chances of a late top are diminishing with each passing day that the cryptocurrency remains below $113,000. From a performance standpoint, Bitcoin is down 16% from its all-time high of $126,200 and has only gained 8.2% year-to-date. The market’s leading crypto has faced repeated rejections near the $113,000 to $114,000 range and is currently trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $109,882. Historically, November typically sees an average gain of 17.5%, with positive performance in 10 out of the last 15 years. However, the expert points that when November begins in the red, it often indicates that the cycle is already shifting. Potential Bullish Factors Amid Ongoing Crypto Concerns Adding to this bearish sentiment, DeFi researcher DeFiIgnas has outlined several factors complicating the crypto market’s trajectory. These include what he calls “the speculative nature of the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble,” the failure of bullish news to invigorate crypto prices, uncertainty surrounding entities that collapsed after the October 10 crash, and the cyclical nature of the market. Additionally, the selling activity from long-term holders and negative crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) flows contribute to the prevailing concerns. Related Reading: XRP Bear Signal Triggered: Will The Top Altcoin Drop 70-80% From Here? Despite these challenges, DeFiIgnas also identified some potential bullish factors that could foster recovery instead of further declines. These include easing liquidity and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), a lack of euphoria in the crypto space, slow but steady institutional adoption, and the potential passage of a US crypto market structure bill. Historically strong performance in the fourth quarter, stablecoin supply at all-time highs, and a recent US trade deal with China could also provide a counterbalance to the prevailing bearish sentiment.

On the anniversary of its whitepaper publication, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent used the occasion to highlight Bitcoin’s consistency and prosperity, suggesting that Senate Democrats could learn something from its reliability and history. His remarks linked BTC’s nearly uninterrupted record of network activity to the challenges seemingly faced by the Democrats. What Senate Democrats Could Learn From Bitcoin In an X social media post on October 31, Bessent criticized Senate Democrats, suggesting that Bitcoin’s ability to remain functional through global crises and economic changes over the past 16 years shows a level of resilience that they could learn from. As a US republican, his comments came as the two major political parties continue to clash over federal budget issues, which have resulted in the ongoing government shutdown . Notably, October 31 also marks the anniversary of the publication of Bitcoin’s whitepaper . The whitepaper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, described a fully digital monetary system designed to run without central authorities or intermediaries. When the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009, it officially launched the network, introducing a framework that has now become globally recognized, extending its reach across multiple sectors and countries. Bitcoin’s adoption since its launch has been nothing short of remarkable, with prominent industry leaders calling it a “ store of value ” and “ digital gold .” Even Bessent has been a vocal advocate of the rapid advancement of the digital asset sector and the growth of BTC. In July, after US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , Bessent stated that stablecoins could be the key to propping up the US dollar. A month later, he said on X that Bitcoin forfeited to the Federal Government would be the foundation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve established by the President’s March Executive Order. He also stated that the US Treasury has since committed to identifying budget-neutral ways to acquire additional Bitcoin to expand the reserve and strengthen the country’s position in the digital asset economy. BTC Records 99.9% Uptime Since Launch Recent data have underscored Bitcoin’s network performance over the past 16 years. Crypto Developer Abhinav reported that the blockchain has achieved a 99.9% uptime since its launch in 2009, with only two brief outages recorded over the past 16 years. Related Reading: Here’s What Happened The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Closed October In The Red Supporters have also highlighted this remarkable technical performance as evidence of BTC’s reliability and its role as the cornerstone of decentralized technology. Additionally, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s network hash rate, a measure of computational power, recently reached an all-time high of around 1.204 ZH/s. Its current level of 1.202 ZH/s marks a 12.3% increase from the previous day and a 79% rise compared with one year ago. Over its 16-year history, BTC has also undergone four halving events, achieving a market value exceeding $2.1 trillion. On its anniversary, it traded above $110,000, after previously reaching an ATH of over $126,000 in October .",Bitcoin News|Abhinav|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network Hash Rate|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|digital gold|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Scott Bessent|Stablecoins|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 01:00:17

With this deal, Ripple’s total investments in the crypto ecosystem now hit $4 billion through strategic acquisitions and platform development. Ripple has been actively making acquisitions over the past year. In April 2025, the company acquired Hidden Road , a prime brokerage, for $1.25 billion, thereby enhancing Ripple’s liquidity capacity and gaining access to institutional trading infrastructure. Later, Ripple purchased Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, for $200 million, enhancing its real-time settlement and cross-border capability. Only a month ago, the company acquired GTreasury, a corporate treasury administration facility, for $1 billion to enter the trillion-dollar corporate treasury market and expand its reach to Fortune 500 companies managing various cash and liquidity systems. Now, with Palisade, Ripple is taking this ambition a step further by integrating custody and wallet technology that allows firms to control their assets in a tightly controlled crypto environment. Ripple acquires Palisade to deepen custody and wallet push The purchase will grant Ripple access to Palisade’s sophisticated multi-chain wallet t echnology and top-quality custody facility. Palisade’s wallet-as-a-service scheme enables fintechs and businesses of all sizes to store and manage digital assets securely on a platform. Ripple stated in a press release on Monday that the acquisition would enhance its ability to hold and secure digital assets for fintech companies, crypto-focused businesses, and large enterprises across multiple blockchains. The company’s president, Monica Long, stated that corporations are expected to drive the next major phase of cryptocurrency adoption. She explained that by combining Ripple’s highly secure vault system with Palisade’s fast and lightweight wallet technology, the company can now offer institutions a complete solution — covering long-term storage, global payments, and treasury management. The purchase also provides Palisade wallets with an easy-to-integrate API that enables the quick addition of multi-party computation wallet technology, according to Ripple. Palisade Custody, on the other hand, offers governed storage of digital properties. As corporate involvement in the cryptocurrency market expands, experts anticipate that more corporations will make major acquisitions, such as Ripple’s. According to the firm, the move aligns with its broader goal of making crypto infrastructure accessible to major corporations. It positions them as corporate partners. Corporate clients drive Ripple’s strategy According to Ripple, the next significant wave of adoption will be driven not by cryptocurrency enthusiasts but by corporations. The firm currently holds more than 75 regulatory licenses worldwide, enabling it to offer the most comprehensive, regulatory-compliant custody and payment solutions across multiple jurisdictions among digital asset firms. This compliance advantage will be further enhanced by Palisade’s integration, particularly in the digital asset custody sector, which is experiencing rapid growth due to stricter regulations and an increase in hacking cases. Finally, this move further demonstrates Ripple’s fundamental goal of backing additional digital ecosystems, not just XRP. Palisade technology supports tokens on Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains, enabling Ripple to venture beyond its traditional comfort zone. According to experts, this development is part of a larger trend in which the world’s top blockchain companies are merging their technologies as they prepare for a significant influx of institutions into the digital asset sector. A surge in demand for regulatory-compliant, secure custody has recently emerged among hedge funds, fintechs, and major corporations. With Palisade, Ripple intends to integrate the firm’s technology into its existing platforms, including Ripple Payments and Ripple Custody. Ultimately, Palisade aims to create a connected, end-to-end system that enables firms to store, transfer, and spend digital assets globally. It intends to do so inside Ripple’s platforms. Multi-chain support is also being expanded to allow for greater collaborative efforts among blockchain networks. It may lay the groundwork for more outstanding cross-border settlements and the integration of decentralized finance for firms. Due to this, experts predict that Ripple’s recent acquisitions will transform it into a major contender with crypto custodians such as Coinbase Institutional, Fireblocks, and Anchorage Digital.

The company holds 192 bitcoins, while its cash holdings stand at $389 million. The moonshots portfolio includes a stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS) worth $62 million. BitMine is close to its Alchemy of 5% goal BitMine, as previously mentioned, now controls 2.8% of the total circulating Ethereum supply. The company is at the halfway point toward its goal, known as the “Alchemy of 5%.” BitMine announced its “Alchemy of 5%” plan in March and has been accumulating Ethereum aggressively since then. Based on a Cryptopolitan report , the firm acquired 27,316 ETH worth $113 million from BitGo exchange. Last month, the crypto treasury company purchased a total of 662,169 ETH. The firm now leads other crypto treasury companies in terms of crypto NAV per share. It also maintains a high trading volume for its stock, BMNR.

He said, “Ethereum fundamentals continue to strengthen at an accelerating pace, with stablecoin supply on ETH rising >15% in the past 8 weeks and application revs reaching an all-time high.” Lee explained that in crypto, price leads fundamentals, and sometimes fundamentals take over, “but price converges higher.” He said that the recent market crash, which wiped out over $19 billion from crypto markets, is a health reset. Lee added, “[the liquidation event] sets the stage for price and fundamentals to eventually converge. BMNR shares are down by 8.12% Despite the positive news, BMNR shares dropped more than 8.12% on Monday due to a wider market sell-off. The stock closed trading at $42.86, based on Yahoo Finance data.

Explore Moonbull, Toncoin, And Sui to Find the Next Big Opportunity",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-crypto-to-join-now-explore-moonbull/,"What if the next big crypto moonshot is already in liftoff mode, and you’re still waiting at the gate? The chase for the best crypto to join now has investors scanning charts, watching presales, and hunting for early entries that can turn a few hundred dollars into serious profits. With meme coins making headlines and top layer 1s attracting significant capital, timing has become everything in the crypto game. Finding the best crypto to join now feels like trying to grab concert tickets before the crowd knows the show’s happening. One day it’s quiet; the next, prices explode. Toncoin and SUI continue to make headlines with real utility and growth, but MoonBull ($MOBU) is stealing attention with one of the most talked-about presales in 2025. MoonBull ($MOBU): Why It Could Be The Best Crypto To Join Now? MoonBull ($MOBU) is a community-first best crypto to join now built on Ethereum that’s mixing humor with real token mechanics. It’s designed to reward everyday traders through auto liquidity, holder reflections, and ongoing burns that shrink supply and support long-term growth. Every transaction boosts liquidity, rewards holders, and adds scarcity, giving the project both staying power and meme appeal. Unlike typical meme coins, MoonBull focuses on fairness. The team passed an external audit and locked liquidity early, showing real transparency. Community voting begins mid-presale, allowing holders to decide on burns, campaigns, and major initiatives. With a 23-stage presale structure, MoonBull ensures early participants get the best entry price while building steady demand. The presale is now in Stage 5 at $0.00006584, with over $550K raised and 1,700 holders. Returns from Stage 1 already sit at 163%, and the projected ROI to listing price ($0.00616) exceeds 9,000 percent. A $20,000 purchase today could turn into roughly $1.87 million post-listing. It’s like finding Bitcoin back when it still had training wheels. If the goal is joining early and holding strong, MoonBull might just be the best crypto to join now. Toncoin (TON) Pumps After Chainlink Deal And Telegram Payments Toncoin has been making serious moves lately. Its integration with Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and Data Streams connected TON to over 60 blockchains, unlocking faster liquidity and real-time data flow for developers. This step expanded Toncoin’s role in DeFi and multi-chain payments, pushing both adoption and credibility among large networks. Meanwhile, Telegram introduced QR-based Toncoin payments in Argentina, boosting on-chain activity and wallet growth by more than 6 percent. The latest upgrade, version 2025.10, also improved efficiency and reduced network costs. Analysts expect the TON price could range from $4.21 to $6.95 in 2025, with the potential to reach $10 if momentum continues. Toncoin is proving it’s not just hype, it’s infrastructure in motion. SUI (SUI) Jumps On Stablecoin Launch And ETF Hype SUI has grabbed attention with its launch of native stablecoins USDi and suiUSDe, lifting prices by about 5 percent in early October 2025. The move fueled DeFi activity and helped total value locked cross $2.63 billion, cementing SUI’s position as a top layer 1 blockchain. However, upcoming token unlocks worth $653 million could add short-term volatility, drawing mixed reactions from traders. On the institutional side, reports hint at a potential SUI-linked ETF that could open the door to broader exposure. With strong developer activity and growing stablecoin adoption, SUI continues to build relevance in DeFi. Despite the supply pressure, its roadmap signals long-term growth and increasing real-world traction. Final Thoughts MoonBull ($MOBU) offers the excitement of a community-powered presale and the fundamentals of a well-built crypto ecosystem. With staking rewards, locked liquidity, and top referrer bonuses paid in USDC, it’s a project built for long-term believers. Toncoin and SUI bring proven track records and network expansion, but MoonBull captures that rare early-stage energy investors chase. Based on research and market trends, this could be the best crypto to join now for anyone who wants to get in before the mainstream rush. MoonBull’s presale is live, holders are multiplying daily, and the next price jump is around the corner. Blink, and the rocket might already be gone.

Speaking on X, Gaevoy wrote : “literally nothing changed since this tweet and we never had plans to sue Binance, nor see any reason to do it in the future.” His post directly addressed social media speculation that Wintermute had suffered heavy losses and was preparing legal action against Binance. The rumors began circulating shortly after the October 10th market crash, which wiped out more than $20 billion in leveraged positions across crypto exchanges. The sudden sell-off led to widespread liquidations, sparking fears that some major market makers or trading firms were at risk of collapse. In a follow-up thread, Gaevoy wrote that Wintermute had no issue with Binance, noting that the firms had worked together for years and saw no reason to escalate anything legally. Wintermute clears the air after October crash Many crypto-watchers have described the October 10th crash as one of the largest liquidation events recorded in recent cryptocurrency history. According to analysts, more than $20 billion in open interest was wiped out in a matter of a few hours as a result of a liquidation spiral following the forced closure of countless leveraged positions on every major exchange. Experts claimed that the crash was the result of high levels of leverage combined with a sudden drop in liquidity, which created perfect storm conditions for even minor price canes to turn disastrous for traders. Individual traders, professional market makers, and centralized exchanges all suffered from ramped-up losses. A few days after the incident, Binance revealed that it had already paid $283 million in compensation to some affected traders after synthetic assets USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH went off-peg. In addition, the exchange also launched a $400 million rescue fund, including $100 million allocated as low-interest capital to aid institutional clients re-enter trading. Although Binance confirmed compensation for its market players, it is uncertain if Wintermute was among the reimbursed. In a Big Brain episode of The Block’s podcast, shared late October, Gaevoy admitted that some of Wintermute’s liquidation strikes were “very weird” and occurred at “completely ridiculous prices.” Nonetheless, he objected to stakeholders’ concerns that the firm’s overall financial security was undermined. He clarified that Wintermute had been fine, adding that the firm’s systems had worked precisely and managed risk effectively despite the intense volatility. According to other sources, Wintermute, one of Binance’s largest liquidity providers, sent more than $700 million worth of cryptos to the exchange a few hours before the crash. Gaevoy confirmed on “ Big Brain ” that the company withdrew “roughly the same amount.” Wintermute’s response calms market nerves Moreover, the obvious unwillingness of Wintermute to wage a legal battle regarding the spread of rumors about the lawsuit has a calming effect on the public. In the aftermath of October’s high volatility, when switching from Binance or one of its subsidiaries would have raised too many questions, a legal struggle between one of the market’s leading market makers and the world’s largest exchange could have exacerbated market anxiety, provoking possible liquidity crises in all exchanges. In contrast, Gaevoy’s assertion suggests that during those difficult times, Wintermute was able to maintain stability without attacking other projects behind the scenes. Market observers claim this is also a form of publicity worth considering. For Binance itself, the absence of threats of legal action means an alleviation of its position, as the exchange also continues to face pressure in various jurisdictions. Binance has been subject to a series of enforcement actions over the past several months, but it remains the leader in terms of market share.

This continues the scrutiny on the safety of the automaker’s products following several fatal crashes and incidents of passengers being trapped in their cars following crashes. Tesla Inc. is facing another major lawsuit after a Wisconsin family accused the automaker of negligence in a crash that killed five people. The case claims that Tesla’s Model S’s electronic doors failed to open after the vehicle caught fire, trapping the occupants inside. A Wisconsin family is suing Tesla over a fatal crash The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Wisconsin state court, is based on a crash that happened last November that killed Jeffrey Bauer, 54, and Michelle Bauer, 55, along with three others. According to the complaint filed by the couple’s children, the Bauers initially survived the impact when their Tesla sedan hit a tree, but were unable to escape the vehicle before it was engulfed in flames. A nearby homeowner who called 911 reported hearing screams from inside the burning car. A sheriff’s report described a cluster of bodies in the front seat, suggesting the victims tried to escape but couldn’t open the doors. “Tesla’s design choices created a highly foreseeable risk — that occupants who survived a crash would remain trapped inside a burning vehicle,” the family’s lawyers said. The suit accuses Tesla of negligence and argues that the company was aware of risks tied to its electronic door handles and the potential for battery fires, but did not act to fix them. The case has sparked a debate over the safety of Tesla’s handle design. The automaker makes use of retractable electronic handles that rely on power from the vehicle’s low-voltage battery. If that system fails during a crash, doors must be opened manually from inside, but many owners are unfamiliar with this method. The Dane County Sheriff’s Office found that speed, road conditions, and possible impairment contributed to the crash. Despite that, the plaintiffs argue that vehicle manufacturers must ensure the protection of passengers during and after a collision, including allowing escape in a fire. “Regardless of the cause of a crash, the manufacturer’s obligation includes designing vehicles that permit timely escape and rescue in the event of fire.” Tesla is also facing a suit in California filed by the families of three college students who allege that a similar design flaw led to their deaths in a fiery crash last year. Regulators in the U.S., Europe, and China address the dangers After several similar incidents of passengers getting trapped in their cars due to Tesla’s door design, regulators across multiple regions are taking action. Cryptopolitan reported earlier in October that the Dutch Vehicle Authority (RDW) revised its approval rules for all Tesla models sold in the European Union after reports of people getting trapped inside their cars after crashes, particularly when power systems fail. In the U.S., the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into Tesla’s Model Y to determine whether the design fails in emergencies and violates federal safety standards. At that time, Tesla’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, told Bloomberg that the company was working on a redesign of the handle to make it more “intuitive for occupants in a panic situation.” So far, there has been no update on a release date for the redesign. Chinese regulators are considering a national mandate that requires every passenger car to have mechanical door releases that work both inside and outside, even if the vehicle loses power.

This situation has supported the argument for the central bank to maintain its interest rate steady while it attempts to slow the rapidly emerging housing market. The announcement followed reports from the Ministry of Data and Statistics, which highlighted that consumer prices had soared by 2.4% compared to the same period last year. This percentage is up from a 2.1% increase in September. Additionally, this rate surpassed the average forecast of 2.2% from economists surveyed by a reliable source, marking the highest record since July 2024, when prices surged by 2.6%. Economist Bumki Son believes the BOK will focus on long-term inflation predictions Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, rose to 2.2%, up from 2% in September of this year. Following this progress, sources reported that overall and core inflation are currently above the Bank of Korea’s 2% target. This newly released inflation data comes at a pivotal moment when the Bank of Korea (BOK) has decided to maintain its crucial interest rate unchanged for the last three meetings. Despite the economy encountering challenges from Trump’s tariffs, concerns regarding asset bubbles and risks associated with household debt have prompted officials to make this rate decision. In his case, the relevant officials affirm that they will not start lowering rates again after they began last October. Meanwhile, reports from sources have acknowledged that whether policymakers view this recent report as another reason to maintain their pause likely depends on how they interpret the cause of the recent price increase. “Inflation surprised many by rising due to stronger price pressures from goods and services related to Chuseok, along with adjustments in imported car prices,” stated Bumki Son, an economist at Barclays Bank PLC. Son added that since part of this rise is related to seasonal spending, they believe that the BOK will focus on long-term inflation predictions and not worry too much about temporary changes. The economist also outlined Barclays’ intention to maintain its forecast for the central bank to reduce rates this month, due to concerns regarding Korea’s weak growth prediction. “Our main expectation still assumes that worries about financial stability will lessen as we approach the November Monetary Policy Committee meeting,” he added. The central bank expresses limitations in decision-making due to the latest pricing trends Currently, the latest pricing trends are limiting the central bank’s decisions as it considers the impact of 15% US tariffs on South Korean goods on the country’s economic status. According to the BOK’s expectation, these tariffs will weaken growth by 0.45 percentage points this year and by 0.6 points in 2026. In the meantime, after thorough research, the surge in inflation during October was primarily caused by a decline of almost 1.9% in the won against the dollar last month, according to sources. This scenario increased import charges for energy and food. Consequently, the currency hit its lowest point since March and has been ranked as one of the weakest Asian currencies compared to the dollar since October 1st. On the other hand, fuel prices escalated after the government lowered fuel tax subsidies in October, exerting more pressure on gasoline prices. At the same time, reports from the Korea Real Estate Board highlighted that apartment costs in Seoul continued to skyrocket for the 39th consecutive week as of October 27. In the same month, food and non-alcoholic beverage prices soared by 5% compared to last year, while costs for housing and utilities increased by 1.2%. Moreover, food and lodging prices escalated by 3.2%, and transportation expenses increased by 3.4%. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Related Reading: Crypto Exchanges Brace For EU Power Shift Toward Central Regulation The asset has struggled to maintain its uptrend, slipping below the $3,800 level and testing the critical $3,715 support zone. Analysts note that this level has been retested multiple times since October, serving as a key battleground between bullish and bearish sentiment. Technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and MACD show weakening momentum, suggesting that sellers remain in control. A decisive close below $3,680 could expose ETH to deeper losses toward $3,550 or even $3,500. However, a rebound from this level could allow buyers to target resistance zones near $3,920 and $4,000. Interestingly, despite the short-term bearish tone, Ethereum’s broader chart structure forms a falling wedge pattern, a setup often preceding a bullish reversal. Ethereum (ETH) On-Chain Data Signals Accumulation Despite Downtrend While technicals paint a cautious picture, on-chain activity reveals signs of underlying strength. According to Glassnode and Sentora data, over $600 million worth of ETH has been withdrawn from exchanges in just one week. This mass exodus often signals accumulation, as investors move holdings to cold wallets for long-term storage. Supporting this view, Ethereum’s MVRV ratio, a key valuation metric comparing market value to realized value, currently stands at 1.50, a level historically associated with market equilibrium before major uptrends. Notably, staked Ethereum maintains an even higher MVRV of 1.7, suggesting that long-term holders are confident in ETH’s recovery. With 36.1 million ETH staked, representing nearly a third of total supply, the data highlights reduced selling pressure and growing network resilience. Stablecoin Surge and Institutional Confidence Prepare for Rebound Beyond price action, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand. October saw a record $2.82 trillion in stablecoin transaction volume on the network, a 45% increase month-over-month, driven by yield farming and institutional liquidity management. Analysts interpret this as a sign of capital rotation rather than market exit, with traders parking funds in stablecoins while awaiting favorable conditions to re-enter ETH positions. Institutional inflows into Ethereum-based products have also topped $15 billion in 2025, reflecting steady confidence in Ethereum’s long-term role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and payments.

Parallel Channel Could Chart Out What’s Next For Ethereum In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a dream trajectory that Ethereum could follow with respect to a Parallel Channel. The “Parallel Channel” here refers to a TA pattern that forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Key Retest: Bounce Or $98,000 Next? The upper line of the pattern is assumed to be a source of resistance, so tops can be likely to occur during retests of it. Similarly, the bottom level can provide support to the price, helping it to rebound. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 3-day price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum retested the upper level of the Parallel Channel earlier in the year, but found rejection at it. The asset has since slipped down and arrived near the line, sitting a distance equal to three-fourths the height of the channel from the lower line. The analyst has noted that a dream scenario could be for ETH to find a rebound around here and smash past the $4,900 level, corresponding to the upper boundary of the Parallel Channel. Generally, Parallel Channel breakouts signal a continuation of the trend in that direction. This means that a surge above a Parallel Channel’s resistance can be considered a bullish sign, while a fall under the support level may lead to bearish action. Parallel Channel breakouts can be of the same length as the height of the channel. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, if ETH can break past the $4,900 mark, it may go all the way up to $8,000, corresponding to this length. For now, Ethereum is heading down, so it only remains to be seen whether its price will be able to find a rebound in the near future and retest the upper boundary of the Parallel Channel.

As the analyst has pointed out in another X post, Solana has also been trading inside the same type of channel on this timeframe. “Solana needs to reclaim $200 to confirm strength,” explained Martinez. “Only then a rebound to $260 comes into play.” ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,700, down almost 11% over the last week.

54005869,619994,1762222187,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54005869.jpeg,Warum Strategy jetzt weniger BTC kauft und wie Bitcoin Hyper trotzdem profitiert,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-saylor-kurs-btc-kauf/,"Strategy hat seine Bitcoin Käufe stark reduziert und liegt auf dem niedrigsten Niveau seit Jahren. Der Grund dafür sind schwierige Marktbedingungen und weniger Geld, das über Aktien aufgenommen werden kann. Trotzdem deutet Michael Saylor immer wieder an, bald erneut groß einzukaufen. Strategy gilt seit Jahren als das Unternehmen, das BTC am stärksten unterstützt und immer wieder große Mengen gekauft hat. Doch plötzlich stoppt der Konzern seinen rasanten Einkaufstakt und wirkt deutlich vorsichtiger. Viele Anleger fragen sich nun: Hat Strategy seine Meinung geändert – oder plant das Unternehmen im Hintergrund bereits den nächsten großen Schritt? Strategy stoppt seine schnellen Bitcoin-Käufe Strategy hat seine BTC-Käufe stark verlangsamt. Früher kaufte das Unternehmen manchmal zehntausende BTC in wenigen Tagen. Jetzt sind es nur noch etwa 200 BTC pro Woche. Das ist der niedrigste Wert seit 2020, also seit der Zeit, als Strategy überhaupt erst begann, Bitcoin regelmäßig zu kaufen. Die Veränderung ist deutlich und fällt Experten in der Branche sofort auf. Viele fragen sich, warum die aggressive Strategie plötzlich pausiert. Trotzdem betont das Unternehmen weiterhin: BTC bleibt der wichtigste Teil der Finanzstrategie. Es handelt sich also nicht um einen Ausstieg oder einen Kurswechsel. Vielmehr geht es darum, die aktuelle Marktsituation genau zu beobachten. Das Ziel bleibt langfristig, Bitcoin als digitalen Wertspeicher zu halten — ähnlich wie andere Firmen früher Gold gehalten haben. Warum Strategy aktuell vorsichtiger handelt Der Grund für die Pause liegt nicht daran, dass Strategy nicht mehr an Bitcoin glaubt. Stattdessen sind die Finanzbedingungen schwieriger geworden. Normalerweise hat Strategy neue Aktien ausgegeben, um mit diesem Geld BTC zu kaufen. Doch der Preis der Strategy-Aktie ist deutlich gefallen — etwa 50 % unter dem Höchststand. Auch Bitcoin selbst liegt rund 16 % unter seinem Rekordpreis . Dadurch lohnt es sich aktuell weniger, neue Aktien zu verkaufen. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Zusätzlich ist der Preisaufschlag auf die Strategy-Aktien fast verschwunden. Früher lag er bei über 200 %, jetzt sind es nur noch rund 4 %. Das bedeutet: Strategy kann aktuell viel schlechter Geld über den Aktienmarkt bekommen. Die Folge: Das Unternehmen muss vorsichtiger sein und kann nicht mehr so schnell einkaufen wie zuvor. Es geht also nicht darum, BTC aufzugeben — sondern darum, die richtige Zeit abzuwarten. Rückblick: Von Rekordkäufen zu einer Pause In den vergangenen Jahren war Strategy berühmt für seine massiven Bitcoin-Investitionen. Das Unternehmen kaufte einmal 55.500 BTC in einer einzigen Woche — ein Rekord, der weltweit Schlagzeilen machte. Insgesamt besitzt Strategy heute mehr als 640.000 BTC. Das entspricht rund 3,2 % aller verfügbaren Bitcoin. Kein anderes Unternehmen hält so viele. MICHAEL SAYLOR: ""If you want to be successful, adopt a Bitcoin Standard."" ""Buy Bitcoin, hold Bitcoin, support the Bitcoin protocol, do not sell your Bitcoin."" pic.twitter.com/FoBXS3oFkP — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) November 3, 2025 Dass Strategy nun fast zum alten, langsamen Kaufverhalten zurückkehrt, erinnert an die Anfangszeit der Strategie im Jahr 2020. Für viele Experten zeigt das eine Art „Ruhephase“ nach einer extrem schnellen Aufbaustrategie. Es ist typisch für Strategy, in Wellen zu kaufen — schnelle Phasen, gefolgt von Pausen. Diese Pause bedeutet also nicht automatisch, dass die Strategie vorbei ist. Saylor deutet trotz Pause neue Käufe an Michael Saylor, der Gründer und Vorsitzende von Strategy, bleibt weiterhin einer der größten BTC Fans weltweit. Er nutzt regelmäßig soziale Medien, um Nachrichten und Hinweise zu teilen. Kürzlich schrieb er erneut „Orange Dot Day“ — eine Botschaft, die er oft kurz vor neuen Käufen nutzt. Für viele Investoren ist das ein Alarmzeichen: Es könnte bald wieder losgehen. Saylor wiederholt ständig: Bitcoin ist das beste langfristige Vermögensgut. Er betrachtet BTC als die Zukunft des Geldsystems. Auch wenn gerade nicht gekauft wird, klingt sein Ton unverändert optimistisch. Wer Saylor kennt, weiß: Er handelt häufig dann, wenn andere zögern. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Wie geht es jetzt weiter? Es sieht so aus, als würde Strategy einfach auf den richtigen Moment warten. Sobald sich die Finanzmärkte wieder beruhigen und der Aktienpreis steigt, könnte das Unternehmen wieder aktiv BTC kaufen. Viele Beobachter rechnen damit, dass Strategy sogar noch größere Käufe vorbereiten könnte — gerade weil die Pause jetzt so auffällig ist. Für Einsteiger bedeutet das: Strategy bleibt ein wichtiger Spieler im Markt. Das Unternehmen handelt nicht aus Panik, sondern nutzt Finanzzyklen. Der nächste große Schritt könnte Überraschungen bringen — und die Märkte erneut bewegen. Bitcoin Hyper: Mehr Nutzen auf dem Fundament, das MicroStrategy stärkt MicroStrategy ist heute der größte börsennotierte BTC-Holder der Welt und spielt eine wichtige Rolle dabei, BTC im globalen Finanzsystem zu verankern. Je mehr große Investoren BTC halten, desto deutlicher zeigt sich: BTC wird immer mehr zum digitalen Wertspeicher der Zukunft. Genau hier setzt Hyper an. Während MicroStrategy BTC als strategisches Asset etabliert, erweitert Bitcoin Hyper dessen Möglichkeiten. Das Projekt nutzt die Sicherheit und Stabilität des Bitcoin-Netzwerks – kombiniert sie aber mit der hohen Geschwindigkeit, Skalierbarkeit und Programmierbarkeit von Solana. So entsteht ein System, in dem BTC nicht nur gehalten werden kann, sondern auch aktiv nutzbar wird – etwa für schnelle Transaktionen, Yield-Modelle, dApps und moderne Finanzanwendungen. Bitcoin bleibt das sichere Fundament, BTC Hyper baut darauf eine leistungsfähige Nutzungsschicht. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Mit BTC wachsen – und darüber hinaus Der $HYPER-Token ist das Herzstück dieser Erweiterung. Wenn institutionelles Interesse an Bitcoin weiter steigt – angefeuert durch Unternehmen wie MicroStrategy – wächst auch der Bedarf, Bitcoin effizient einsetzen zu können. Genau dann zeigt Hyper seine Stärke: Die Robustheit von Bitcoin, kombiniert mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana um BTC-Power in die Welt der modernen Blockchain-Anwendungen zu bringen Kurz gesagt: BTC legt den Wert. Hyper entfaltet ihn. Wer an den langfristigen Erfolg von Bitcoin glaubt, findet in $HYPER eine sinnvolle Ergänzung, um nicht nur am Wertwachstum, sondern auch an der aktiven Nutzung des Bitcoin-Ökosystems teilzuhaben.

Over the past six months, a remarkable 209,000 BTC has moved off centralized exchanges, according to data from Santiment, as reported by CryptoBriefing. This isn’t just a number; it signals a profound shift in investor behavior, driven by a desire for enhanced security and control in an increasingly volatile market. What’s Behind the Shrinking Bitcoin Exchange Balances? This dramatic decrease in Bitcoin exchange balances suggests a clear trend: investors are re-evaluating where they store their valuable digital assets. The primary catalyst appears to be the persistent market volatility that has characterized the cryptocurrency landscape. When prices fluctuate wildly, the perceived risk of keeping funds on exchanges, which can be vulnerable to hacks or regulatory actions, increases. Fear of Centralized Risks: Past incidents involving exchange failures or or security breaches have made investors wary. Desire for Sovereignty: Many Bitcoin proponents value the asset’s decentralized nature and prefer to hold their keys directly. The Rise of Self-Custody: Taking Control of Your BTC The reported drop in Bitcoin exchange balances directly correlates with a growing movement towards self-custody. Instead of leaving their Bitcoin on platforms managed by third parties, more investors are opting for “safer storage methods.” These methods typically involve moving Bitcoin to personal wallets, such as hardware wallets (often called cold storage) or secure software wallets. Hardware Wallets: Devices like Ledger or Trezor keep private keys offline, offering robust protection against online threats. Enhanced Security: Self-custody eliminates counterparty risk, meaning you don’t rely on an exchange’s security measures. Full Ownership: Holding your own keys grants you absolute control over your funds, aligning with Bitcoin’s core philosophy. Market Implications of Lower Bitcoin Exchange Balances This significant withdrawal of Bitcoin from exchanges has several crucial market implications. Firstly, a reduced supply of BTC available for immediate trading on exchanges can potentially lead to lower liquidity. This might make larger buy or sell orders more impactful on price. Secondly, historically, a decline in Bitcoin exchange balances is often seen as a bullish signal. Reduced Selling Pressure: When Bitcoin is moved off exchanges, it often indicates a long-term holding strategy (HODLing), reducing immediate selling pressure. Potential for Price Appreciation: A constrained supply on exchanges, coupled with consistent demand, could theoretically contribute to price increases. Decentralization Trend: It reinforces the core tenet of decentralization, as fewer Bitcoins are concentrated in centralized entities. Practical Steps to Secure Your Bitcoin Holdings If the trend of declining Bitcoin exchange balances inspires you to enhance your own crypto security, there are actionable steps you can take. Protecting your digital assets is paramount in the volatile crypto space. Invest in a Hardware Wallet: This is widely considered the gold standard for secure Bitcoin storage. Research reputable brands and ensure you buy directly from the manufacturer. Learn About Seed Phrases: Understand the importance of your 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. Store it securely offline, away from your device, and never share it. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For any remaining exchange accounts, always use strong 2FA (preferably an authenticator app, not SMS). Practice Good OpSec: Be wary of phishing attempts, use unique passwords, and keep your software updated. The substantial drop in Bitcoin exchange balances over the past six months is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of evolving investor sentiment. It highlights a collective move towards greater security and self-sovereignty in the face of market uncertainty. As the crypto landscape matures, the emphasis on robust personal security and independent asset control will likely only grow stronger, shaping the future of how we interact with digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are Bitcoin exchange balances? Bitcoin exchange balances refer to the total amount of Bitcoin (BTC) held by centralized cryptocurrency exchanges on behalf of their users. These holdings represent the BTC available for trading and withdrawal on these platforms. 2. Why are investors moving Bitcoin off exchanges? Investors are increasingly moving Bitcoin off exchanges primarily due to concerns about market volatility and a desire for enhanced security. This shift allows them to mitigate risks associated with exchange hacks, regulatory actions, or platform insolvency, opting for safer, self-custody methods. 3. What is self-custody in the context of Bitcoin? Self-custody means holding your own Bitcoin private keys, rather than entrusting them to a third-party service like a cryptocurrency exchange. This typically involves using hardware wallets (cold storage) or secure software wallets, giving you complete control and responsibility over your digital assets. 4. Is it safer to keep Bitcoin off exchanges? Generally, keeping Bitcoin in a self-custodied wallet (especially a hardware wallet) is considered safer than leaving it on an exchange. While exchanges offer convenience, they are centralized targets for hackers and subject to operational risks. Self-custody eliminates these counterparty risks, though it places the full responsibility of security on the individual. 5. How does lower Bitcoin on exchanges affect the market? A decrease in Bitcoin on exchanges can have several market effects. It often signals a long-term holding sentiment (HODLing), potentially reducing immediate selling pressure. Lower supply on exchanges can also lead to decreased liquidity, meaning larger trades might have a more significant impact on price, and it can be interpreted as a bullish indicator.

Blue chip chains roar. Transactions fly. Traders slam keyboards. And somewhere in the corner, a tiny mosquito circles the arena with big dreams and even bigger bite energy. With markets heating up again and early-cycle excitement building, the hunt for the best crypto to buy has never felt more dramatic or fun. This round is not just about giants like Ethereum and Solana. It is also about one buzzing newcomer, La Culex , trying to sting its way past giants and sneak into the same conversation. A bold move, but in crypto tiny wings often beat loud footsteps. History has seen stranger breakouts. As always, crypto carries market risks. This report is for research and entertainment. DYOR and always stay safe in markets, even when the memes start flying harder than charts. Now the match begins. Eight contenders. One throne. Who claims the title of best crypto to buy going into 2025? 1. La Culex: The Flying Bug With a Bite and a Shot at Best Crypto to Buy Glory Imagine a mosquito with a finance degree, an attitude, and a dream to turn tiny buzz into big gains. That is La Culex. This project arrives as a swarm-powered meme-alt hybrid aiming to run faster than typical early-phase coins. The La Culex presale currently sits in Stage 4 with a Hive Signal price of $0.00002458. Every market cycle hides a wildcard. Some break through with tech. Some ride memes. Sometimes a frog goes viral. And now a mosquito buzzes in with attitude. La Culex enters the jungle with tiny wings and big plans, calling itself the top crypto presale right now. Stage 4, titled Hive Signal, runs for $0.00002458. More than 500 million tokens are already gone, over $10,000 in funds swarm inside, and roughly 80 holders sit early waiting for the hive to fill. Stages shift every 5 days or when milestones snap. So timing matters. The target listing price sits at $0.007, and early hive members already saw roughly 26.2% gains from the earliest stage movement. Now here is the math exercise. A $5,000 entry at the current price equals around 203,417,413 tokens. If price goals land, that bag could sit near $1,423,921.89 at listing before fees. Pure speculation, sure. But crypto icons have grown from memes, animals, and pixels before. The top crypto presale chase always loves a surprise guest. 2. Solana: Fast, Loud, and Still Throwing Punches in Q4 2025 Solana has energy and traders love it. With fast transactions and low fees, it stays one of the most active blockchains worldwide. In October 2025, Bloomberg reported that Solana ETFs passed major inflow milestones and institutional attention jumped again. That is strength nobody ignores. For many analysts, Solana sits right behind Ethereum in long-term upside strength. High-speed DeFi, gaming projects, and payments build momentum. Anyone hunting the best crypto to buy with proven market strength keeps Solana on the short list. 3. Ethereum: The OG Smart Contract King Still Swinging Hard Ethereum enters 2025 as the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, tokenization, and enterprise blockchain. Upgrades on scalability keep rolling and Layer 2 networks keep stacking transactions. According to Glassnode, Ethereum staking participation crossed 32 million ETH locked in October 2025, showing growing confidence among long-term holders. Ethereum might not feel like the dramatic pick for the best crypto to buy title, but stability plus constant network usage can be just as powerful as early growth stories. Developers pick Ethereum first. Institutions recognize it. Smart contract traffic stays massive. A classic heavyweight that never sits out a cycle. 4. Ripple: The Utility-Driven Fighter With Global Influence Ripple, powered by XRP, remains laser-focused on real-world finance. Cross-border settlement keeps scaling and its institutional network touches banks worldwide. Ripple Labs reported new corridors expansion in Asia and the Middle East during late 2025, keeping demand lively. This coin does not try to be loud. It tries to be useful. In a world where real utility keeps winning, XRP still fights for the best crypto to buy label among serious investors and finance watchers. 5. Binance Coin: The Exchange Giant’s Fuel Token BNB stands strong because Binance stands strong. With millions using the exchange, BNB stays relevant for fees, launchpads, and chain participation. Even during market dips, activity around Binance keeps token demand alive. With Binance expanding products and compliance globally, BNB remains a top call in many best crypto to buy lists for traders who love big-brand endurance. 6. Cardano: Research-Built and Consistent Cardano maintains a slow but steady building style. Some call it too slow, others call it academic discipline. In 2025, multiple smart contract optimizations rolled out and DeFi liquidity climbed again. Messari data shows Cardano’s stable community and continued network health. Not the loud joker coin, but a solid chess-player coin. Sometimes the best crypto to buy is the one playing long games instead of short memes. 7. Chainlink: The Oracle Powerhouse Feeding Every Chain Data Chainlink powers price feeds, real-world data, and smart contract automation across ecosystems. It keeps proving that without data, blockchains cannot function. In Q3 2025, Chainlink crossed billions in value secured and expanded enterprise integrations. Whenever analysts debate critical infrastructure plays, LINK enters the chat. It may not meme, but real builders and institutions still call it the best crypto to buy for core utility. 8. Polkadot: The Multi-Chain Vision Still Charging Forward Polkadot continues building toward cross-chain futures. Parachains keep improving and governance upgrades rolled out across 2025. Fortune covered rising enterprise experimentation with cross-chain tech in September 2025, aligning with DOT’s vision. If markets reward interoperability next cycle, DOT has a clear runway to fight for best crypto to buy status again. Final Bite: Big Chains vs One Bold Bug Huge chains have stamina. They survived crashes, trends, and trade wars. But every bull cycle brings a surprise winner from nowhere. One project sneaks into charts like a mosquito buzzing into a board meeting. That is why La Culex stays on radar next to giants. Ethereum brings legacy. Solana brings speed. Ripple brings banking. BNB brings exchange power. Cardano brings research. Chainlink brings data. Polkadot brings cross-chain logic. La Culex brings a sting and a crowd whispering it could be the best crypto to buy before price wings flap too far. Crypto always rewards the bold and early. The next cycle might crown a heavyweight or shock everyone with a tiny flyer.

The title of best crypto to buy depends on momentum, adoption, and cycle strength. Big chains like Ethereum and Solana hold network power and real use. A buzzing newcomer like La Culex brings early-stage upside energy that traders watch closely for fast gains. Is La Culex a serious contender or just a meme-vibe project? a Culex mixes humor with real token utility, including staking structure and burn mechanics. It runs a structured presale phase that early buyers track closely. Like all early-stage assets, it carries risk, so research is key before entering the La Culex presale. Can large-cap altcoins still give strong returns in 2025? Yes, but returns may differ from early-phase coins. Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink already hold scale and steady network strength. They tend to move slower than micro-caps but provide stability and proven fundamentals across market cycles. Glossary Altcoin Any crypto asset that is not Bitcoin, often offering unique network features or utility. Presale Early token offering stage before public trading, typically at lower prices for first adopters. Listing Price The price at which a token launches on major exchanges for open-market trading. Tokenomics The structure of supply, rewards, vesting, and economic design behind a cryptocurrency. Staking Locking tokens to support network validation or earn network rewards. Burn Mechanism The process of permanently removing tokens from supply to increase scarcity and value potential. Liquidity The availability of tokens for trading on exchanges without heavy price impact. Summary The hunt for the best crypto to buy in Q4 2025 brings a lineup of heavyweight altcoins and one ambitious newcomer buzzing louder every week. Ethereum maintains smart contract dominance while Solana pushes ultra-fast transactions. Ripple builds banking corridors, Binance Coin fuels global exchange use, and Cardano leans on methodical research. Chainlink powers essential data layers and Polkadot backs cross-chain scaling. Then enters La Culex, a tiny-but-bold contender with a growing investor swarm and strategic token design. Its presale structure, utility concept, and viral messaging position it as a wildcard project many traders watch early in the cycle. Markets reward conviction and timing. Giants bring stability while small buzzing players can surprise with upside when momentum hits. As 2025 unfolds, the crown for best crypto to buy remains open, and tiny wings sometimes create the loudest results. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Nevertheless, analysts are identifying a collection of indicators suggesting that a bullish resurgence for the cryptocurrency could be on the horizon. What’s Fueling BTC’s Potential Surge This November? According to experts at The Bull Theory, November is poised to be the most bullish month of the year for Bitcoin, and the supporting numbers are quite compelling. Historically, November has been one of the strongest months not only for US equities but also for the Bitcoin price. For stocks, it consistently ranks as a top-performing month, while Bitcoin has historically recorded some of its most significant rallies during this time, averaging gains between 40% and 42%. What sets this November apart, however, are the underlying factors at play. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? One of the primary catalysts identified by the analysts is the anticipated end of the US government shutdown, which is expected to conclude this month. While this may seem like a political issue, its financial implications are substantial. They assert that the resumption of government spending means “billions of dollars” will start flowing back into contractors, projects, and public sectors. This return to fiscal spending acts as a mini liquidity injection into the economy. Historically, such movements of money have had a positive effect on risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies, as capital begins to rotate from the real economy into the financial system. Another significant factor is the planned ramp-up of corporate buybacks. Within the next few weeks, many major companies are expected to restart their buyback programs. This creates new demand in equities at a time when liquidity is improving, which historically has pushed stock indices higher. Given that cryptocurrencies often track global liquidity cycles, this corporate-driven demand could similarly benefit the crypto market. Bitcoin Price To Reach $160,000? Additionally, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has quietly re-entered the scene, as evidenced by a spike in daily overnight repo loans, which reached $29.4 billion—the highest level in nearly five years. This significant borrowing indicates that banks are short on dollars and are relying heavily on the Fed. Such activity typically signals stress in the short-term funding market. Related Reading: Pundit Elaborates On Ripple/SWIFT Theory That Will Send The XRP Price To $1,000 Historically, when repo activity surges, the Fed tends to inject liquidity to stabilize the situation. This influx of capital does not remain isolated within the banking system; it tends to flow through markets, lifting equities and eventually benefiting cryptocurrencies once confidence is restored. Moreover, the US Treasury’s General Account (TGA) balance has surged close to $1 trillion, sitting approximately $150 to $200 billion above normal levels. This capital is currently idle, but once government spending resumes following the shutdown, it is likely to begin circulating again. If the Bitcoin price performance this November mirrors its historical averages, the analysts anticipate a potential rally of around 40%. Such an increase could see the Bitcoin price reaching the $150,000 to $160,000 range.

The Noomez ($NNZ) ‘Stage X Million’ Airdrop is the Biggest Airdrop Crypto Event of the Year,https://timestabloid.com/looking-for-free-crypto-the-noomez-nnz-stage-x-million/,"Interest in free crypto is reaching new highs as traders search for projects offering real rewards instead of empty promises. That’s why attention is turning toward Noomez ($NNZ) and its massive “Stage X Million” Airdrop, now being called one of the biggest giveaway events of the year. The program rewards holders with millions of $NNZ tokens at the end of every presale stage, creating ongoing excitement without complicated requirements. With its transparent system and public results, Noomez is proving that free crypto can come from structure, not luck, and is reshaping how airdrops are viewed in 2025. How to Get Free Crypto Through the Noomez Airdrop Each stage of the 28-phase presale ends with a random draw that rewards one verified wallet with a token amount equal to the stage number in millions. For example, Stage 10 delivers 10 million $NNZ , while Stage 28 offers 28 million. The process is automatic and fully transparent, with results published publicly after every round. Unlike typical giveaways that rely on social tasks or referrals, this setup connects rewards directly to real meme coin presale participation. Noomez also gives a 10% bonus to both the buyer and the referrer during the presale. Projects that show verifiable proof of winners, like Noomez, offer a safer way to get free crypto instantly without hidden conditions. Pro Tip: Before joining any airdrop, always confirm that selection results and wallet addresses are viewable on-chain. How Participants Earn Free Crypto With Each Stage Noomez’s airdrop model stands out because it rewards ongoing participation rather than one-time sign-ups. Every presale stage functions as its own event, giving new and existing buyers a chance to win fresh allocations. The only requirement is a verified purchase of at least $20 during that stage , making it accessible to small investors as well as large ones. Once the timer expires or tokens sell out, the system automatically selects a wallet and sends the reward instantly, with all data visible on-chain. This system turns the presale into a live, recurring giveaway that sustains interest across all 28 stages. For those looking to earn free crypto , Noomez offers one of the most consistent and transparent models, proving that well-designed presales can balance community rewards with measurable fairness. Inside the Noomez “Stage X Million” Airdrop System Noomez ($NNZ) has built one of the most structured airdrop systems seen in recent presales. Each stage runs independently, closing with a random draw that sends tokens straight to the selected wallet – no waiting, no claiming forms, and no extra steps. The model ensures that every buyer who joins a stage has an equal chance of winning, whether they hold a small or large allocation. How it works: Each presale stage ends with an automated random selection. Rewards are sent instantly through smart-contract execution. Results and wallet IDs are published publicly for verification. This fair distribution has become a strong example of how to get free crypto without hidden rules or delays. The Airdrop Setting a New Standard for Presales The Noomez ($NNZ) “Stage X Million” event is quickly becoming one of 2025’s most buzzed-about crypto giveaways. Its blend of transparency, automation, and instant rewards has raised the bar for how presales operate. Each completed stage adds more visibility, while token burns and clear tracking keep the project grounded in measurable progress. Now, Stage 2 is live , priced at $0.0000123 per token, continuing this momentum. For traders exploring free crypto mining alternatives that don’t rely on heavy setups or hidden costs, Noomez offers a cleaner path, a presale where participation alone can lead to meaningful rewards, and a stronger connection to the project’s growth.

54006070,619474,1762225256,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54006070.jpeg,Bitcoin Supply Shrinks on Binance While $7B In Stablecoins Arrive – Bullish Fuel Loading,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shrinks-binance-while-7b-stablecoins/,"Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase as the market faces renewed selling pressure and short-term sentiment turns cautious. After weeks of volatility and failed attempts to hold above key resistance zones, investors are now watching closely to see whether BTC can stabilize and defend support as macro and liquidity factors continue to shift. Yet beneath the surface, new on-chain data points to a strong foundation forming — one that may be quietly setting the stage for the next major leg higher. According to fresh insights, Binance’s netflow data for October 2025 delivered one of the strongest bullish signals of this cycle. The exchange saw a record-breaking $7 billion net inflow, signaling a significant wave of capital preparing to enter the market. Even more importantly, the composition of this flow suggests a structurally bullish setup: the majority of incoming liquidity came from stablecoins, representing billions in sidelined buying power. At the same time, both Bitcoin and Ethereum registered net outflows from Binance — a sign that long-term holders are withdrawing funds to self-custody rather than preparing to sell. This divergence between incoming liquidity and decreased sell-side supply is historically associated with early accumulation phases and heightened bullish potential. In other words, while price action appears uncertain, the underlying capital rotation suggests Bitcoin may be gearing up for a decisive move. Stablecoin Surge + Bitcoin Outflows Create a Powder-Keg Setup for Next Move According to new data shared by CryptoQuant, one of the most compelling trends in recent months has been the scale and composition of capital flows into Binance. Over the past 30 days, the exchange recorded a net inflow of more than $5 billion in Tether (USDT) and an additional $2 billion in USD Coin (USDC). This is not ordinary liquidity — it is pure “dry powder”, capital deliberately positioned on the sidelines and waiting for favorable entry points. Such aggressive stablecoin inflows historically precede major market expansions, signaling that deep liquidity is preparing to re-enter risk assets. What makes this dynamic even more significant is that it is occurring alongside persistent outflows of crypto assets. Binance saw approximately $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and $500 million in Ethereum move off the platform in the same period — a classic hallmark of long-term accumulation. Investors withdrawing BTC and ETH to self-custody drastically reduces available sell-side supply, tightening the float and amplifying future price impact when demand accelerates. The combination is powerful: surging dollar liquidity + shrinking exchange balances = bullish supply-demand imbalance building beneath the surface. Additionally, flows into the “Other Altcoins” category have picked up noticeably, hinting that capital is beginning to position beyond majors — often an early signal of increasing risk appetite and the initial stages of an altcoin rotation. While price action remains choppy and sentiment cautious, this liquidity posture is historically aligned with pre-breakout market structure, not late-cycle exhaustion. Traders should watch closely for signs of stablecoin rotation into BTC and ETH; once that ignition point arrives, the resulting flow could mark the beginning of the market’s next major rally phase. BTC Retests Key Support as Market Awaits Direction Bitcoin continues to trade under pressure, currently hovering near the $107,000–$108,000 support zone after failing to reclaim the $110,000 level. The chart shows price struggling below the short- and medium-term moving averages, signaling weakening momentum in the near term. The repeated rejections near $117,500, a major resistance and former range high, reinforce this level as a critical battleground for bulls. Until BTC reclaims and holds above this threshold, upside conviction remains limited. Price is also interacting with the 200-day moving average, which has acted as a dynamic support during this cycle. A confirmed breakdown below this moving average could open the door toward deeper liquidity pockets around $103,000–$105,000, where prior demand emerged during the post-October crash recovery. Still, the structure has not decisively shifted bearish. Bitcoin remains within a broad consolidation range that began in late summer, and despite volatility, sellers have yet to break the market’s higher-timeframe structure. As long as BTC holds above the $100K–$105K region, bulls maintain a defensive position. With macro catalysts in play and large capital inflows sitting on the sidelines, the coming sessions may determine whether this drawdown becomes a launchpad — or the market heads for another liquidity sweep before trending higher.

Nach der Halbierung der Mining-Belohnung im April 2024 schrumpfte die Rentabilität drastisch und zwang viele Unternehmen zum Umdenken. Firmen wie IREN, früher Iris Energy, stürzten zunächst ab und erlebten dann eine dramatische Wende. Seit der strategischen Neuausrichtung und dem Rebranding im November 2024 legte die Aktie über 580 % zu. Konkurrenten wie Riot Platforms, TeraWulf und Cipher Mining verzeichneten ebenfalls enorme Kursgewinne zwischen 100 % und 360 %, was zeigt, wie stark der Markt auf die neue Ausrichtung reagiert. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Die Basis dieses Erfolgs liegt in einer überraschenden Stärke der Miner: riesige Energie- und Kühlkapazitäten, die bereits bestehen. Diese Infrastruktur ist über Jahre aufgebaut worden und erlaubt einen schnellen Übergang von Blockchain-Verarbeitung zu High-Performance-Computing. Während klassische Rechenzentren Zeit benötigen, um auszubauen, stellen Miner sofort nutzbare Fähigkeiten bereit. Analysten sehen darin ein außergewöhnliches Beispiel für unternehmerische Anpassungsfähigkeit, denn die Branche wechselt von digitalem Goldschürfen zur Bereitstellung kritischer KI-Ressourcen. Milliardenverträge bestätigen strategischen Wert Ein entscheidender Moment für den Sektor war der Milliarden-Deal zwischen IREN und Microsoft. Das Technologieunternehmen sicherte sich ein 9,7-Milliarden-Dollar-Abkommen für Rechenzentrumskapazitäten in Texas. Zudem verfügt IREN über ein weiteres Vertragsvolumen von 5,8 Milliarden Dollar für GPU-Lieferungen von Dell. Diese Partnerschaften katapultieren den Miner in die erste Reihe globaler KI-Dienstleister. Branchenbeobachter sehen darin eine klare Botschaft: Die Energie- und Infrastrukturkompetenz der Miner ist ein strategischer Vorteil im Zeitalter der KI. HIVE has surged 283% this year to reach 23 EH/s of global Bitcoin mining capacity. Now expanding 32.5 acres in New Brunswick to build a Tier III+ HPC campus capable of scaling to over 25K next-gen GPUs powered by renewables. This is the next chapter of digital infrastructure pic.twitter.com/rbgZqIVFO3 — HIVE Digital Technologies (@HIVEDigitalTech) November 3, 2025 Auch andere Tech-Giganten beobachten und handeln. Amazon prüft laut Branchenkreisen vergleichbare Vereinbarungen mit weiteren Mining-Anbietern. Hintergrund ist der immense Bedarf an grafischen Prozessoren und Rechenleistung für KI-Modelle. Traditionelle Data-Center-Projekte können nicht mithalten, denn sie benötigen Jahre bis zur Fertigstellung. Miner verfügen dagegen schon über Kühlung, Netzanschlüsse und Erfahrung im Betrieb von Hochleistungssystemen. Investoren bewerten daher heute Faktoren wie Megawatt-Kapazitäten und GPU-Zuteilungen statt Bitcoin Hashrate. KI-Nachfrage sprengt klassische Kapazitäten Die globale KI-Welle schafft einen nie dagewesenen Hunger nach Rechenleistung. Modelle werden größer, Märkte schneller und Innovationszyklen kürzer. Unternehmen, die rechtzeitig Kapazitäten sichern, erhalten Wettbewerbsvorteile. In dieser Umgebung bieten Miner etwas Seltenes: sofort verfügbare Infrastruktur in industrieller Größe. Die Fähigkeit, schnell zu skalieren und GPUs effizient zu betreiben, macht sie zu bevorzugten Partnern für Hyperscaler und KI-Startups. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei Bitcoin noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Marktstrategen betonen, dass diese Wende erst der Anfang ist. Viele Miner entwickeln neue Standorte oder erweitern bestehende Anlagen, um den steigenden Bedarf zu decken. Netzbetreiber beobachten wachsende Stromanfragen aus Regionen wie Texas und North Dakota. Damit entsteht ein neues Machtzentrum für digitale Infrastruktur in den USA, das nicht mehr von Kryptowährungen allein abhängig ist. Für Anleger gilt: Das Mining-Geschäft hat sich dauerhaft verändert und ein neues, robusteres Geschäftsmodell hervorgebracht. US-Politik schafft Wettbewerbsvorteile Neben wirtschaftlichen Kräften beeinflusst auch die Geopolitik den Markt. Die US-Regierung blockierte zuletzt den Export leistungsstarker Nvidia-Blackwell-Chips nach China. Offiziell aus Sicherheitsgründen, praktisch aber zur Sicherung technologischer Führung. Das Timing kurz vor dem Treffen zwischen Donald Trump und Xi Jinping unterstreicht die Bedeutung des Themas Bitcoin und Kypto. China verliert Zugang zu modernsten KI-Prozessoren, während US-Firmen bevorzugt beliefert werden und sofort profitieren. BREAKING- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slammed U.S. export bans on AI chips to China, saying they wiped out Nvidia’s market share — “from 95% to 0%.” China will not loose but develop alternatives. Trump is now destroying US companies & rebellion has started pic.twitter.com/vr96uf0GUb — Megh Updates (@MeghUpdates) October 20, 2025 Für US Bitcoin Miner bedeutet dies ein stabiles politisches Umfeld und exklusiven Zugang zu Spitzentechnologie. In China hingegen kämpfen Miner mit Krypto-Regulierungen und GPU-Knappheit. Diese strukturellen Unterschiede schaffen einen klaren Vorsprung für amerikanische Anbieter. So entwickeln sich Miner zu unverzichtbaren Stützen der nationalen Technologie-Strategie. Unternehmen, die früher nur Token generierten, liefern heute kritische KI-Infrastruktur für internationale Tech-Konzerne. Neue digitale Energie-Ökonomie entsteht Die Branche steht an einem historischen Wendepunkt. Energienetzwerke, Chips und Datenzentren werden zu den wertvollsten Ressourcen der digitalen Welt. Bitcoin Miner galten lange als Nischenplayer, doch jetzt zeigen sie, wie flexibel digitale Energieproduktion eingesetzt werden kann. Ihr Übergang von Proof-of-Work zu KI-Rechenleistung markiert eine neue Phase, in der Strom und Hardware mehr wert sind als Coins. In Zukunft dürften hybride Modelle entstehen: Mining bei günstiger Energielage, KI-Betrieb bei hoher Nachfrage. Analysten erwarten weitere Übernahmen, Fusionen und Investitionen in Netz- und Kühltechnologien. Für den Markt bedeutet das Stabilität und Diversifizierung, während Technologieunternehmen dringend benötigte Kapazitäten erhalten. Der Wandel der Miner zeigt: Wer Infrastruktur kontrolliert, kontrolliert die Zukunft der künstlichen Intelligenz. PepeNode: Mining neu gedacht im Zeitalter von KI und Krypto Während klassische Bitcoin Miningzentren zunehmend für die KI-Revolution umgebaut werden, geht PepeNode einen anderen Weg und führt Mining zurück zu den Nutzern – jedoch virtuell und spielerisch. Statt Hardware und Stromkosten gibt es digitale Serverräume, Mining-Nodes und Upgrades, mit denen man $PEPENODE erzeugt. So entsteht eine moderne Weiterentwicklung des Mining-Prinzips: zugänglich, strategisch und ohne technische Hürden. Hier kommst du zu einer langfristigen Prognose zu PepeNode! Ein Memecoin mit echter Idee – Chancen, aber auch Risiko PepeNode zeigt, dass Memecoins mehr können als nur Trend sein. Durch Gamification entsteht ein funktionierendes Mini-Mining-Ökosystem, das Aktivität belohnt und Utility bietet. Trotzdem bleibt es ein spekulativer Coin: hohe Chancen, hohe Schwankungen. Wer versteht, dass hier Humor, Innovation und Risiko Hand in Hand gehen, könnte früh bei einem spannenden neuen Mining-Ansatz dabei sein.

Amazon stated in a press release that OpenAI will utilize hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) in the United States to run workloads on AWS infrastructure, planning to increase capacity in the coming years. Amazon stated that the rapid advancement of AI technology has created an unprecedented demand for computing power. According to Amazon, the deal’s initial phase will utilize existing AWS data centers, and Amazon will subsequently expand its OpenAI infrastructure. In an interview, AWS Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services Dave Brown stated that “It’s entirely separate capacity that we’re putting down.” He added that OpenAI is utilizing some of that capacity that is already available.

The deal gives OpenAI massive access to Amazon Web Services — its first-ever collaboration with the cloud giant — signaling that the $500 billion #AI leader is expanding beyond its dependence on… pic.twitter.com/EARpnyiRsK — Defcon7 (@Defcon7_) November 3, 2025 Amazon and OpenAI’s partnership comes less than a week after the ChatGPT developer altered its relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft, which first invested $13 billion in OpenAI in 2019, has an exclusive cloud relationship with the artificial intelligence (AI) startup. Microsoft announced in January that it would no longer be the exclusive OpenAI cloud provider and was switching to a system that would give it the first say in any new requests. Microsoft’s special standing under its recently agreed commercial terms with OpenAI ended last week, allowing the developer of ChatGPT to expand its partnerships with the other hyperscalers. The AI startup had already signed cloud agreements with Google and Oracle, but AWS leads the market by a wide margin. Amazon stated in a press release that AWS’s infrastructure deployment for OpenAI features an advanced architecture design optimized for optimal AI processing performance and efficiency. Clustering NVIDIA GPUs, including both GB200s and GB300s, on the same network using Amazon EC2 UltraServers enables low-latency performance across linked systems. The clusters also enable the ChatGPT developer to run workloads effectively and at peak performance. The press release explained that the clusters are designed to handle a range of workloads, from training next-generation models to providing inference for ChatGPT with the ability to adapt to OpenAI’s evolving requirements. “Scaling frontier AI requires massive, reliable compute. Our partnership with AWS strengthens the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next era and bring advanced AI to everyone.” – Sam Altman , OpenAI CEO Altman claimed that as OpenAI continues to expand the realm of what is feasible, its AI goals will be supported by AWS’s top-notch infrastructure. He added that the scope and instant accessibility of optimized compute illustrate why AWS is uniquely positioned to handle the extensive AI workloads of OpenAI. Amazon exceeded analyst forecasts in its earnings release last week, announcing a more than 20% year-over-year increase in AWS sales. However, Microsoft and Google had quicker growth, reporting 40% and 34%, respectively, in cloud expansion. OpenAI expands global AI infrastructure projects Recently, OpenAI has been making numerous deals. The ChatGPT developer announced buildout agreements worth approximately $1.4 trillion with companies such as Nvidia, Broadcom, Oracle, and Google. OpenAI plans to construct 30 gigawatts of computer power, equivalent to the electricity used in nearly 22.5 million homes in the U.S. The ChatGPT developer will also be completing a corporate reorganization that will value the company at $500 billion and position it for what could be Silicon Valley’s most significant IPO. In January, President Trump, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, and SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son announced OpenAI’s $500 billion data center plan, Stargate. Since then, the project for the AI data center has undergone significant growth. In September, OpenAI announced five additional data center locations in the United States, bringing the total capacity to approximately 7 gigawatts. Over the next three years, the company plans to invest over $400 billion in U.S.-based data center and AI infrastructure projects. Oracle delivered the first Nvidia GB200 racks in June, and OpenAI is already executing early training workloads on next-generation research at the flagship location in Abilene, Texas. In addition to the announcement of Stargate Argentina in October, OpenAI is developing additional AI computer infrastructure locations in Shackelford County, Texas.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://cryptopotato.com/can-ethereum-eth-indeed-surge-to-8k-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $3,700 at press time, down over 4% in 24 hours and nearly 11% on the week. While near-term momentum has turned bearish, several analysts are looking at this zone as a possible springboard for a broader move. Analysts Watch $3,800 as Key Level Ali Martinez outlined what he called the “ dream scenario ” for Ethereum. In this view, ETH would hold above $3,800, break through resistance near $4,900, and continue toward $8,000. His chart shows a step-by-step path higher, with pauses near $5,600, $6,400, and $7,200. He stated , “Ethereum bounces off $3,800, smashes through $4,900, and rockets to $8,000.” This move would require a clear break above the $4,900 area, which previously acted as a cap. That level remains a focus for market participants watching for signs of trend reversal. Source: Ali Martinez/X Short-Term Signals Show Weakness While longer-term setups remain in play, shorter timeframes show pressure building. The daily RSI is at 39, pointing to a lack of buying strength. The MACD also shows the trend leaning bearish, with the signal and MACD lines both in negative territory. Source: TradingView Ted noted that Ethereum is at a make-or-break zone. “If this level holds, Ethereum could rally towards $4,000 this week. If ETH fails to hold this, expect a dump below the $3,500 zone,” he said. On the ETH/BTC chart, market watchers continue to monitor key support zones that have historically acted as strong foundations during previous cycles. In earlier commentary, Michaël van de Poppe referred to this broader area as an “ ideal zone for buys. ” Broader Market Setup Remains Intact Chart watchers are also pointing to larger structures still in place. Trader Tardigrade described a falling wedge pattern on the weekly ETH chart, saying it remains valid and could lead to a move. Merlijn The Trader compared ETH’s setup to a previous Bitcoin cycle. “If the echo continues, ETH is about to rip,” he said. Crypto Patel noted that ETH remains in a wide trading range between $2,560 and $5,760. He highlighted that the MVRV ratio is currently at 1.5, which reflects a neutral zone historically seen before major price moves. He described this period as “ the calm before every big move in past cycles. ” On-chain activity supports this, with Crypto Rand reporting that ETH stablecoin transfer volume hit $2.82 trillion in October, a new record and a 45% rise from September.

Despite a weak Wave (5) formation, the broader uptrend remains intact, and momentum is quietly building. If the push continues, the next major test lies near the $1,300 zone — a level that could define BNB’s bullish chapter. Wave (5) Weakness Signals Possible Completion Of The Bounce Providing an update to a previous post on BNB, More Crypto Online highlighted that the recent bounce visible on the chart may now be nearing its completion phase. While price action initially appeared promising, momentum has started to weaken, raising questions about the sustainability of the upward move. Related Reading: BNB Reclaims $1,100 As Binance Founder Receives Presidential Pardon – New Rally Coming? According to the analyst, Wave (5) in the current structure looks relatively weak, which could indicate that buying pressure is fading. This development may point to the market preparing for a potential retracement or sideways movement before establishing a clearer direction. More Crypto Online emphasized the importance of staying flexible at this point, as market structure remains uncertain. Despite the recent bounce, there’s still no clear indication that the broader Wave 4 pullback has concluded. Until confirmation appears, the possibility of another downward move within the corrective phase cannot be ruled out. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the analyst maintained a positive long-term outlook, stating that the overall uptrend remains intact on the higher timeframe, as long as key structural supports hold firm. Breakout Builds Strength — Bulls Target The $1,230–$1,300 Zone According to a recent update by crypto analyst BitGuru, BNB’s price action is showing early signs of renewed strength, with buyers gradually stepping back into the market. The recent upward movement suggests growing confidence among traders after a period of consolidation. Related Reading: BNB Price Retreats After Rally — More Downside Risks On The Horizon In his post, BitGuru outlined that if this breakout gains traction, BNB could climb toward the $1,230–$1,300 range in the next bullish leg. Such a move would signal a continuation of the broader uptrend and potentially attract more momentum-driven participants. He further emphasized the importance of monitoring the current price action closely, noting that momentum is steadily building. As of the time of writing, BNB has recorded a 6% decline in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $1,027. This drop reflects a cooling phase after recent bullish attempts, as traders assess short-term market conditions. The token’s market capitalization now stands at approximately $141.34 billion, positioning it among the top-performing assets despite the temporary pullback. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume of $2.85 billion indicates active participation across exchanges.
