The update follows a pause in open applications and sets a clearer path for funding across the ecosystem. The post positions the change within the ongoing growth of tools, protocols, and public goods. The team writes that the previous intake stretched its limited capacity, so the new approach concentrates efforts on areas identified alongside other Foundation groups. 1/ ESP’s grant applications are now OPEN! Our new grants program is structured through two pathways: Wishlist Requests for Proposals (RFPs) Explore the new opportunities and apply below! https://t.co/qg4gBL62ED — EF Ecosystem Support Program (@EF_ESP) November 3, 2025 ESP Grants: Wishlist and RFP Tracks “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the post reads. “However, with a lean team and broad scope, the growing volume of applications stretched our resources, limiting our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” “Our new model addresses this by shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach, working closely with other EF teams to ensure that funding aligns with the ecosystem’s priorities and drives meaningful impact,” said the Ethereum Foundation. ESP remains open to applicants while channeling submissions through two paths that frame needs and outcomes. The Wishlist sets high-level goals and leaves room for varied approaches, inviting builders to propose initiatives that meet those goals without prescribing a single design. Ethereum Community and Builder Impact Requests for Proposals describe a defined problem and the expected deliverables, including scope, requirements, application windows, and estimated duration. This creates a schedule and a measurement plan that applicants can review before submitting. Office Hours continue for guidance on whether a concept aligns with a Wishlist area or with an active RFP, so teams can target the right track from the start. ESP says the first set of Wishlist items and RFPs is live across cryptography, privacy, the application layer, security, and community growth . The team notes that “Wishlist items and RFPs will be added and updated based on the evolving needs of the ecosystem,” making an ongoing pipeline rather than a single round. The announcement also outlines coordination and support beyond funding. ESP plans to align grantmaking with other Foundation groups, provide guidance to grantees, connect projects to peers, and draw insights from outcomes to guide future calls.

53998284,https://cryptonews.com/?p=447012,1762209000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53998284.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, Aster by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-cardano-aster-by-the-end-of-2025w/,"Google’s advanced Large Language Model, Gemini AI, suggests that investors holding XRP, Cardano, and Aster will see returns many times their initial investment between now and the holiday season. Despite a prolonged downturn through most of October, optimism is still high thanks to the U.S. debut of Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs, alongside the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut. US regulators are still very much on the crypto ball, while macroeconomic concerns around inflation are cooling, creating an appetite for risk. These developments point toward strong altcoin performance driving the next bull cycle, which may even begin this year, with Gemini forecasting XRP, Cardano, and Aster as the leaders. XRP ($XRP): Gemini Predicts 400% Gains by Christmas Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) appears as one of the top breakout contenders in Gemini’s models, with projections showing a potential rally to between $5.85 and $13 by year-end, an increase of roughly 439% from its current price of $2.41. Source: Gemini AI Following a decisive legal victory over the SEC earlier this year, market confidence in Ripple surged, pushing XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past 12 months, XRP has jumped 378%, outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum by a wide margin. Ripple’s rollout of the RLUSD stablecoin, combined with CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s engagement with President Trump, has positioned the company as a regulatory frontrunner, strengthening its appeal to both retail and institutional investors. XRP’s technical chart continues to display several bullish flag formations into 2025, suggesting a potential year-end breakout. If catalysts such as ETF approvals, Ripple inking more strategic partnerships, or clear U.S. crypto regulations emerge, Gemini’s upper projections of $13 are feasible before the year closes. Cardano ($ADA): Gemini Forecasts 700% Surge in Q4 Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the strongest DeFi networks in development, building a reputation as Ethereum’s top challenger thanks to its thriving developer ecosystem and growing suite of decentralized applications. Created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically peer-reviewed framework emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and formal verification. With a market capitalization of about $21 billion, Cardano holds a prominent position among leading DeFi projects, though it still trails Solana and Ethereum in overall adoption. Gemini’s analysis suggests ADA could climb as high as $7 by the New Year, a remarkable 1,100% gain from its current price of approximately $0.58. If investor sentiment strengthens through the end of the year, Gemini’s models indicate ADA could trade around $3 by late 2025 and potentially surpass its 2021 all-time high of $3.09 should a full-scale bull run take shape. Aster ($ASTER): Project with Ties to CZ Touted for 4x to 5x Gains Aster ($ASTER) is a newly launched decentralized exchange token that’s making waves in the DeFi space. Born from the merger of Astherus and APX Finance in late 2024, the project officially debuted in September 2025 and was listed on Binance the next month. Built on BNB Chain and backed by the venture arm once associated with Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Aster is a next-gen perpetuals DEX, supporting spot and futures trading with up to 1001× leverage. Its standout feature is the “Trade & Earn” model: users can leverage yield-bearing assets as margin, thereby trading and earning simultaneously. In the last 24 hours, Aster’s price shot up 9% despite a general dip that has shaved 3% from crypto’s market cap. While still too new to identify definite trends, Aster briefly broke out of a post-launch downward channel thanks to a whale interest over the weekend. It soon dipped again as traders took profits, but its neutral RSI and relative newness set it up to meet Gemini’s targets over the next two months. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin With 100x Potential One emerging project not yet featured in Gemini’s dataset has been generating significant buzz in presale markets. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most discussed meme coin launches of the season, attracting around $3.9 million from investors eager for the next Dogecoin. Marketed as Dogecoin’s louder and more rebellious successor, Maxi Doge captures the degen spirit of crypto through meme contests, community events, and a highly active social media presence. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI enjoys faster and cheaper transaction speeds compared to Dogecoin’s legacy network. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which fuels marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Staking has already gone live, offering up to 80% APY in rewards, though returns will decrease as participation rises. The current presale price is $0.000266, with incremental price increases scheduled for each subsequent phase. Investors can purchase MAXI through MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Although the slump has rattled many investors, long-term participants view it as a healthy reset, a purge of excess leverage and speculation before the next leg up. History has shown this pattern repeatedly in crypto: sharp corrections before massive bull runs. And this time round, Bitcoin is likely to lose dominance to top-tier altcoins like XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. In fact, the charts suggest these players may explode in price in the coming months. Ripple (XRP): Pioneering the Future of Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a lightning-fast, low-cost payment network designed to replace lengthy legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple is also on the radars of the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House. Adoption is continuing apace thanks to strategic partnerships with multiple banks. All this helped XRP to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, now exceeding $144.5 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin demonstrates the company’s commitment to capturing what will probably be the most widely adopted part of crypto: the stablecoin sector. However, XRP remains a central part of the ledger’s operation as a small amount of it is burned in every transaction. Over the last year, XRP has skyrocketed 378%, hitting $3.65 in mid-July, its highest point since 2018, easily surpassing Bitcoin’s 58% rise during the same timeframe. At present, XRP’s RSI sits close to 41, with prices re-converging with the 30-day moving average, signaling stabilization despite the prolonged downturn. Technical readings still show two bullish flag formations from the summer, which have yet to break out. With U.S. regulators due to greenlight spot ETFs and deliver news about comprehensive crypto legislation before the year is out, a possible run to $5–$10 by the New Year is highly likely. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Strongest Rival Targets $1,000 Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its reputation as one of the fastest, most scalable blockchain ecosystems. With a market cap of around $97 billion and $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), the network’s growth trajectory remains robust. The recent launch of Grayscale’s and Bitwise’s spot Solana ETFs on the New York Stock Exchange is expected to attract significant institutional capital, echoing inflows following Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Following a spring low near $100, SOL has since recovered to about $176, while its low RSI of 37 and divergence beneath the 30-day moving average hint that SOL is undervalued right now. Key support holds near $150, with firm resistance around $250. Should ETF-driven demand take off heading into the festive season, SOL could revisit its all-time high of $293.31, and in a prolonged bull phase, even $500 or $1,000 isn’t out of the question. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Doge Army Still Chases the $1 Dream Dogecoin ($DOGE) , the trailblazer that gave us the meme coin concept, debuted in 2013 and remains the dominant token in its category, boasting a market capitalization of around $26.4 billion and an enthusiastic global “Doge Army” following. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. Prices briefly broke above $0.30 in mid-September before easing back to about $0.17. Doge’s multi-billion market cap has made it one of the more resilient assets in the space, often tracking price trends of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Dogecoin’s practical use continues to expand as well. Tesla now accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, while both PayPal and Revolut have integrated Dogecoin payments into their platforms. In a bull-case scenario, DOGE could challenge its 2021 peak of $0.7316 later this year, even potentially breaking past it, before the year is out. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): The Meme-Powered Bitcoin Upgrade for 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Ostensibly a meme coin, $HYPER actually aspires to be an integral upgrade to the Bitcoin network. It’s a Layer 2 that will expand Bitcoin’s throughput while making transacting cheaper. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER introduces DAO-based governance, smart contract functionality, and a meme-bridge enabling frictionless Bitcoin transfers. The presale has already exceeded $25.6 million raised, with analysts like Borch Crypto predicting 100x potential. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed zero vulnerabilities, bolstering investor trust. HYPER tokens power every aspect of the network, from governance and staking to transaction fees, and early participants can earn up to 46% APY in staking rewards. Bitcoin is going HYPER. This could be the next major breakout project. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the altcoin’s strong debut, noting that the BSOL led inflows for the week across ETPs, outperforming even Bitcoin and Ethereum-based spot ETFs. What a week for $BSOL , besides the big volume, it led all crypto ETPs by a country mile in weekly flows with +$417m ($IBIT had a rare off week, it'll be back). It also ranked it 16th in overall flows for the week. Big time debut. pic.twitter.com/HpKUTdq1J5 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 1, 2025 BSOL offers a new touch point for U.S. investors to gain regulated access to SOL staking yields, a feature previously reserved for on-chain participants. This has effectively opened the floodgates for millions in fresh institutional capital entering the Solana ecosystem. With SOL still awaiting its own spot ETF approval, BSOL’s success could signal the scale of pent-up demand ready to enter. Grayscale Investments estimates that Solana ETPs could capture 5% of all SOL tokens within two years, representing over $5 billion in value at current prices. Real institutional momentum is now flowing into Solana, and it’s starting on Wall Street . Solana Price Prediction: Wall Street Could Spark the Next Major Rally With the consensus among analysts expecting spot Solana ETF approvals this month, sidelined institutional demand could fuel an escape from a 7-month ascending channel. SOL / USD 1-day chart, descending triangle fuels ascending channel. Source. TradingView. The altcoin now tests a strong confluence of support and a potential launchpad setup, with the channel’s lower boundary meeting a historic demand zone at $175. This zone also forms a descending triangle, now nearing its apex, creating a decisive moment for November’s price action. Momentum indicators remain mixed. The MACD histogram has crossed below the signal line, a typical early downtrend signal, while the RSI sits near a historical bottom around 33, suggesting limited downside room. Losing $175 could open the door for a 30% drop to $120, but holding it may prepare SOL for another breakout attempt. The $300 level remains the key breakout threshold. A successful flip of that resistance into support could mark the start of a new uptrend, targeting $500 for a potential 185% gain. Still, with Solana entering corporate balance sheets and institutional exposure deepening through spot ETFs, the rally could extend another 470%, pushing the Solana price toward $1,000 . PepeNode: The Smarter Way to Earn in Any Market With passive income strategies like staking ETFs gaining traction, investors are seeking ways to earn even when markets stand still. With PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the process is a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No expensive setups, no tech barriers. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across top-performing meme coins. Momentum is accelerating fast. The presale has already surpassed $2 million, with early stakers still earning up to 633% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. As U.S. interest rate easing fuels capital rotation into high-risk assets, PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture meme coin upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

53999074,619467,1762210800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53999074.jpeg,Hong Kong Opens Doors to Global Crypto Markets in Bold Bid to Revive Financial Hub Status,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-opens-doors-to-global-crypto-markets/,"In a progressive decision announced during Fintech Week 2025 , Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has unveiled a sweeping regulatory reform allowing licensed crypto exchanges to connect directly with global order books. The move dismantles the city’s “ringfenced” model that previously restricted trading within its borders, enabling access to international capital and liquidity. SFC Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung emphasized that the shift follows extensive work to ensure investor protection. “Once we are sure that we can protect investors, we do relax, as we did with global liquidity,” Leung stated. The reform aligns Hong Kong’s digital asset framework with international financial standards, signaling the city’s ambition to reclaim its reputation as a leading fintech hub in Asia. What it Means for Hong Kong’s Digital Asset Ecosystem The SFC’s policy shift is part of a broader effort to modernize the region’s digital finance landscape. Over recent years, Hong Kong has launched a licensing regime for crypto exchanges, approved Bitcoin and Ether-linked exchange-traded products, and expanded oversight for digital asset funds. In partnership, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing to issue the first stablecoin licenses by next year, while regulators are crafting new frameworks for crypto dealers and custodians. Additionally, the SFC has removed the 12-month trading history requirement for HKMA-approved tokens and stablecoins, a change expected to accelerate listings of new digital assets. Industry observers view these developments as pivotal for attracting institutional players. Global firms like Binance and Coinbase could soon gain entry via brokerage licenses, faster and less restrictive than full exchange approvals. Currently, 11 exchanges and 49 brokers operate under SFC oversight, a number expected to rise sharply under the new system. Hong Kong’s Bid to Reclaim Market Relevance This policy overhaul highlights Hong Kong’s determination to position itself as a global crypto hub amid fierce competition from jurisdictions like Singapore and the United States. While mainland China continues to ban crypto trading , Hong Kong has opted for a regulated innovation model balancing market access with strict compliance. Leung acknowledged the delicate balance regulators must strike: “Overly strict requirements risk driving liquidity and talent elsewhere, but too little oversight could undermine trust.” Hong Kong’s new policies on global liquidity and tokenization mark a shift toward deeper integration with international crypto markets.

Announced in a blog post Monday, the new structure will channel funding through two avenues: a “wishlist” of focus areas identified by EF teams, and formal requests for proposals (RFPs) addressing specific ecosystem needs. A Shift Toward Strategic Coordination The previous open grants process, paused earlier this year, had stretched the Foundation’s administrative capacity due to high demand. According to EF, the revamped program will better align funding decisions with Ethereum’s long-term priorities by coordinating directly with internal technical and research teams. “The previous open grants program successfully supported hundreds of projects that contributed key building blocks across Ethereum,” the Foundation said. “But the growing volume of applications limited our ability to pursue strategic opportunities.” The first batch of wishlist items and RFPs is now available, covering areas such as cryptography, privacy, scalability, and community growth. In 2024, the Foundation awarded around $3 million to 105 projects and initiatives, continuing its mission to foster open-source innovation since the program’s 2018 launch. Ethereum’s Technical Upgrades Continue The update comes just after Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade went live on its final testnet, Hoodi, ahead of a mainnet launch expected December 3. Fusaka introduces EIP-7594 (PeerDAS), allowing validators to access smaller data chunks from layer-2 networks, improving efficiency and scalability. Additional proposals, EIPs 7825 and 7935, aim to increase gas limits and boost performance in preparation for Ethereum’s shift to parallel execution — a critical milestone that will allow multiple transactions to process simultaneously.

Related Reading: Forget Billions—XRP Could Hit Trillions, Leading Expert Says According to reports, Zhao said he personally owns just over 2 million ASTER tokens — a holding that has been valued at about $2.5 million in coverage of the event. That admission prompted a rapid buying wave and heavy media noise, with traders and observers trying to sort what the move means for the project and the broader4 market. Aster Trading Activity On Fire As Price Rises Based on reports, ASTER climbed from roughly $0.91 to a peak near $1.26 on the day the disclosure hit newsfeeds. Volume also surged: one snapshot put 24-hour turnover at around $224 million before the announcement and at more than $2 billion afterward. Platform metrics moved too; total value locked on the Aster system reached about $1 billion dollars in recent updates. Market watchers pointed out that those jumps happened within hours of Zhao’s statement, pushing the token into headlines and onto many traders’ watchlists. Full disclosure. I just bought some Aster today, using my own money, on @Binance. I am not a trader. I buy and hold. pic.twitter.com/wvmBwaXbKD — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 2, 2025 Supply Concerns And Background Ties Reports have disclosed that Aster’s circulating supply stands at about 2 billion tokens while total supply is 8 billion. That gap has raised alarms among analysts who say future token unlocks could add selling pressure. At the same time, discussion has grown about whether Zhao’s stake represents a purely personal bet or something tied to past venture ties, like connections to YZi Labs (previously Binance Labs). Some community voices welcomed the vote of confidence, while others urged caution and more disclosure about timing and intent. Whales, Shorts And The Need For Transparency Traders already placed big bets in both directions after the pop. Some large holders were reported to be taking profits, while short sellers were opening positions on the belief that the rally could be fleeting. Based on reports, competition with other derivatives and exchange projects — names like Hyperliquid were mentioned in analyst commentary — will test whether Aster can keep user interest beyond the headlines. Observers also flagged that massive daily volume spikes are often followed by quick retracement if underlying usage does not grow. Related Reading: XRP’s Next Earthquake: Billions Set To Flow In, ‘Supply Shock’ Coming—Analyst Volume, Unlock Schedules, And Product Signals Investors and reporters will be watching three main things: whether high trading volume holds up, how many tokens are set to unlock and hit markets, and whether the project builds real, steady user activity on its platform. According to current data, those variables will likely determine if this move becomes a lasting repricing or a short-lived event.

These three tokens have suffered significant drops in the past 24 hours, yet these falls send them more firmly into oversold territory, meaning that a big rebound should be coming soon . We examine their technicals and provide price predictions in this article, while we also take a look at an up-and-coming token that could rally when it lists in the coming weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Imminent ETF Launches Will Send Alt to New ATHs XRP has declined by 5% in the past 24 hours, with its current price of $2.40 also representing an 8% fall in a week and a 20% drop in a month. The altcoin does remain up by 375% in the past year, however, underlining its strong medium- and long-term momentum, which it should regain soon enough. The market is waiting patiently for the launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which some commentators suggest will launch in the next couple of weeks . These will result in a substantial increase in demand for XRP, which could surge as a result. Its chart today shows the coin in an oversold position, meaning that ETF launches could be the catalyst that causes a strong positive correction. Source: TradingView XRP’s two main indicators – the RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) – has been in negative positions since August, indicating that the coin is well overdue a growth spurt. The bullish pennant in which XRP has been trading also suggests this, with the coin poised to reach $3 by the end of this month. And with Ripple’s ongoing growth as a company, it could top $4 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pi Network ($PI) – Altcoin Recovering After Release of Migration Figures At $0.2397, PI is down by 3% in a day and by 11% in a week, although it does hold on to an impressive 15% increase in the past fortnight. It has posted this fortnightly increase on the back of encouraging updates regarding mainnet migration, with the Pi Network team revealing towards the end of last month that 2.69 million ‘Pioneers’ have completed this migration, while 3.36 million have completed the KYC checks necessary for migration. Given that PI has had a bad time since reaching an ATH of $2.99 at the end of February, this update on migrations is reassuring, going some way to counteract earlier concerns that the mainnet migration had been handled poorly. And if we look at PI’s chart today, we see that it’s showing some bullish signs of recovery, with its relative strength index having risen above 50 in the past week. Source: TradingView Whether it can maintain this momentum is an open question, however, although the launch of altcoin ETFs could produce a market-wide optimism that will benefit its price. Longer term, Pi Network still faces skepticism from the wider cryptocurrency community, with the coin yet to list on major tokens such as Binance, Coinbase and Kraken. Without such listings, PI may continue to struggle, whereas new listings could send it back up to whole figures quickly. It could potentially reach $1 by December, while good news could send it closer to $2. Crypto Price Prediction: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Meme Coin Close to Bottom, Could Double by 2026 SHIB is another coin that has been struggling in 2025, with its current price of $0.000009564 making for a 5% loss in 24 hours, an 8.5% loss in a week and a 23% decline in a month. Worse still, SHIB is actually down by 44% in the past year, whereas most top-50 coins have posted annual gains. This indicates the funk Shiba Inu is in right now, with whales and other traders neglecting the alt in favor of newer meme tokens (e.g. Fartcoin). And unlike Dogecoin, there aren’t any SHIB ETFs waiting to launch, something which could deprive the coin of a much-needed source of demand and momentum. Its chart today is reflective of its situation, given that its two main indicators are in very low positions. Source: TradingView Of course, the positive implication of oversold indicators is that the corresponding asset should bounce back strongly, but it’s hard to say whether SHIB has the fundamentals to mount a full and sustainable comeback. There have been efforts to boosts its utility, such as the launch of its layer-two network Shibarium a couple of years ago, but so far this has done little to impress the wider market. For instance, its 24-hour trading volume today is $145 million, whereas the figure for Dogecoin is $1.8 billion. This is a big difference, and without some positive news or update, SHIB may witness only modest growth. It could reach $0.000020 by December, and potentially see in the New Year at around $0.000040. PEPENODE Raises $2 Million in Presale: Is Mine-to-Earn Token the Next Big Thing? In addition to major tokens, some traders may also want to diversify into newer coins, so as to widen their exposure to potential gains. Newer coins can often show more volatility than more established alternatives, something which is often the case with presale coins. Such coins have the benefit of generating momentum during their sales, helping them to enjoy rallies once they list for the first time. The last thing you'd want to lose Luckily with PEPENODE the mining is 100% virtual… No hardware needed https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/n0Sre6uGgV — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 3, 2025 One presale coin looking to do this is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token which has raised just over $2 million in its sale. This is a very promising figure, and highlights the excitement PEPENODE has been generating since it launched its presale. What’s interesting about PEPENODE is that it’s crypto’s first mine-to-earn token, giving users the opportunity to earn rewards from their own virtual mining rigs. By spending PEPENODE to buy more virtual nodes, they can earn greater rewards, which the platform will pay out in third-party coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin. Because users will need more PEPENODE to buy more nodes, the token could experience considerable demand. And by extension, it could see substantial price increases, especially when holders can also stake it. Investors can join its sale by going to the official PEPENODE website. The coin currently sells for $0.0011317, although this will rise again in two days.

The token dropped 4% in the past 24 hours, but trading volumes have nearly doubled – a sign that whales are preparing for the next move. Data from on-chain supply clusters shows heavy accumulation between $2.52 and $2.54 , confirming this as a critical demand zone. If XRP bounces back above these levels, it would suggest strong underlying buyer confidence, potentially kickstarting the next leg up. Today’s dip likely stems from growing uncertainty around the Fed’s rate decision in December, which has triggered broader market jitters. Still, with fresh ETFs on the horizon and Ripple’s growing institutional partnerships, XRP may be positioning for a long-awaited breakout. XRP Price Prediction: $2.35 Level May Act as Launchpad for Higher Prices In the past 12 hours, XRP has dropped sharply after rejecting a move above $2.50 – a former support zone now acting as resistance, at least for the moment. However, if the downtrend finds a floor at the $2.30 to $2.35 support range, history suggests XRP could bounce strongly – and this time, the rebound may launch it toward new all-time highs. This key area has served as a reliable launchpad before, and a strong reaction from buyers could quickly flip the short-term narrative. On the 4-hour chart, XRP’s RSI has dipped below the 14-day EMA, signaling growing selling pressure. Yet, oversold signals could also mark the early stages of a reversal. As the broader crypto market struggles to stabilize, investors are increasingly turning to early-stage tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a presale project that could offer outsized returns once sentiment shifts back to risk-on. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Raises Nearly $4M to Bring Together Like-Minded Traders This bull market is not over yet as Bitcoin and altcoins are still sitting near all-time highs. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a meme that plans to take full advantage of the hype that comes along with positive cycles by launching a token that fully embraces retail traders’ ‘up only’ energy. Inspired by the popular Doge meme, this token plans to build a vibrant community of like-minded degens who can share ideas , strategies , and brag about their Ws to earn rewards and have fun. Meanwhile, through the Maxi Fund, the project will invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds into the most promising tokens. The earnings will be reinvested on marketing efforts to make Maxi Doge known. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, you can simply visit the official Maxi Doge website and connect your favorite Ethereum wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to complete your transaction. Buy $MAXI Here.

In a post shared on X, Harris stated that his “money is on XRP all the way” when asked how he would allocate a hypothetical $1,000 investment between Bitcoin and XRP. He explained that, based on current prices, Bitcoin is trading around $107,000, and XRP at approximately $2.40 , the same investment would yield vastly different holdings, only 0.009 BTC or about 416 XRP. Harris used this comparison to illustrate why smaller-cap assets often appeal more to retail investors. In his view, XRP’s lower price and smaller market capitalization give it more room for rapid expansion during bullish phases. He argued that the chances of XRP doubling or even increasing tenfold in the short term are higher than Bitcoin achieving the same growth, given the disparity in market size. If you have $1000 to invest do you want: $1000 / $120,000 = 0.0083 BTC or $1000 / $2.40 = 416.67 XRP Then fast forward 90 days from today: Which is more likely to 2X, 4X or even 10X during the upcoming altseason? Now fast forward to 3 years from now and what will your return… — Daniel Harris (@DanielLHarrisUS) October 20, 2025 At present, XRP’s market capitalization sits near $145 billion, whereas Bitcoin’s exceeds $2.1 trillion. Harris suggested that it is far more feasible for XRP to reach $300 billion than for Bitcoin to double to $4.4 trillion, particularly within a 90-day timeframe. His analysis aligns with a growing sentiment among altcoin advocates who believe that smaller, utility-driven assets can outperform dominant cryptocurrencies during specific market cycles. Altcoins’ Accessibility and Appeal Harris’ remarks were made in response to Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, who recently discussed the psychological barriers new investors face when entering the market. According to Kwok , the high unit price of Bitcoin discourages first-time buyers, even though fractional ownership is possible. He explained that many prefer purchasing entire coins of lower-priced tokens, which feels more tangible and rewarding than holding small fractions of Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Kwok emphasized that the issue is not financial capability but perception. New investors tend to associate owning a whole coin with greater value or progress, a mindset that continues to drive enthusiasm toward affordable altcoins such as XRP, ADA, and SOL. The Counterpoint: Bitcoin’s Fractional Advantage The conversation originated from comments made by Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, who countered the claim that crypto is too expensive. Armstrong reiterated that investors can buy any portion of Bitcoin or Ethereum, removing barriers to entry for those with limited capital. Nonetheless, both Kwok and Harris argued that investor psychology remains a decisive factor. Even with fractional purchasing available, many people still gravitate toward coins with lower nominal prices, particularly in the early stages of an altseason, when such assets have historically delivered higher percentage gains. For example, over the past year, Bitcoin’s value has increased by about 60%, while XRP has recorded gains exceeding 380%. This performance gap supports Harris’ view that smaller-cap cryptocurrencies can generate stronger returns during speculative rallies. However, analysts also caution that this potential comes with greater risk. Unlike Bitcoin, which tends to experience moderate corrections, altcoins often face much steeper declines during market downturns. A 5% Bitcoin pullback can translate to losses of 30–50% in some lower-cap tokens, making timing and risk management crucial for investors drawn to XRP’s growth prospects.

Recently, whispers circulated about a potential legal battle brewing between prominent crypto market maker Wintermute and the global exchange giant Binance. But now, we have crucial clarity directly from the source regarding a possible Wintermute Binance lawsuit , putting an end to much speculation. Dispelling Rumors: No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit on the Horizon Evgeny Gaevoy, the CEO of Wintermute, has decisively put an end to speculation surrounding his firm’s intentions. He confirmed that Wintermute has absolutely no plans to sue Binance over the significant liquidation event that occurred in October. This statement directly addresses persistent rumors that Wintermute was preparing legal action against the exchange. Gaevoy took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify the situation, emphasizing that these rumors are simply untrue. He sees no valid reason for such an action, providing a clear stance from the market maker. This clarification follows a significant event in October, which saw one of the largest forced crypto liquidations ever recorded. During this period, Binance’s auto-deleveraging (ADL) system reportedly experienced malfunctions. This system is designed to manage risks during volatile market conditions. However, its alleged malfunction led to unexpected losses for several trading firms involved in the market, sparking widespread concern across the crypto community. Understanding the October Liquidation and Initial Concerns Initially, after the October liquidation event, Gaevoy himself acknowledged the issues publicly. He had previously stated that he understood certain firms were preparing legal action against Binance. This earlier comment, reported by The Block, likely fueled the recent rumors of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit . It’s important to distinguish between Gaevoy’s understanding of other firms’ intentions and Wintermute’s own plans. His latest statement makes it unequivocally clear that Wintermute is not among those considering legal recourse. The incident highlighted the inherent risks and complexities within high-volume crypto trading. When such large-scale liquidations occur, the ripple effects can be substantial, impacting: Market stability: Sudden price movements and forced sales can increase volatility. Trader confidence: Firms experiencing losses may re-evaluate their strategies or trust in platforms. Operational integrity: Exchange systems are rigorously tested, but malfunctions can still occur under extreme stress. Despite these challenges, Wintermute’s decision is a significant development. Why No Wintermute Binance Lawsuit? A Strategic Choice Market makers like Wintermute play a vital role in the crypto ecosystem, providing liquidity and ensuring smooth trading across various assets. When an event like a large-scale liquidation occurs, it can significantly impact their operations and profitability. Despite the potential challenges posed by the ADL malfunction, Wintermute’s CEO has chosen a path of non-confrontation. This decision suggests that perhaps internal resolutions, direct communication, or different strategic considerations are at play. It avoids a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle, which can be a drain on resources and reputation for both parties involved. The absence of a Wintermute Binance lawsuit helps to stabilize market sentiment and allows firms to focus on core business. This strategic choice by Wintermute could be driven by several factors: Maintaining business relationships: Legal disputes can strain crucial partnerships in a closely-knit industry. Cost-benefit analysis: The potential costs of litigation might outweigh the expected recovery. Focus on core operations: Avoiding lawsuits allows the firm to dedicate resources to market making and expansion. Alternative resolutions: It’s possible that other forms of redress or understanding have been reached between the parties. Implications for Market Trust and Future Relations Gaevoy’s direct and transparent communication helps to build trust within the often-opaque crypto industry. When leaders address rumors head-on, it provides much-needed clarity for investors and market participants. The decision not to pursue a Wintermute Binance lawsuit also signals a potential for continued, albeit cautious, collaboration or at least a non-adversarial relationship between two major players in the crypto space. This is generally positive for market stability and the broader health of the crypto ecosystem. It allows both entities to focus on their core operations rather than being entangled in litigation, fostering a more mature and predictable environment. Such clarity is essential for an industry still maturing and striving for broader institutional adoption. Transparency from key players like Wintermute and Binance helps to instill confidence and reduce speculative volatility driven by unverified information. The crypto community often reacts strongly to news, and definitive statements like this can prevent unnecessary market jitters. In conclusion, Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy has unequivocally stated that his firm will not be suing Binance over the October liquidation event. This definitive statement puts an end to widespread speculation and provides a clear picture for the crypto community. While the liquidation event caused issues for some, Wintermute has chosen to move forward without legal action, fostering a more stable environment for crypto market participants.

The update was shared by the project’s marketing lead, Lucie, who revealed that Shiba Inu has been added to the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework, a joint initiative between Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell. According to Lucie’s post on X, the new classification places Shiba Inu under the “Consumer & Culture” category. This designation recognizes SHIB as part of the growing segment of cryptocurrencies that intersect with entertainment, culture, and online communities, an area where Shiba Inu has built one of the strongest global followings. Expanding Institutional Recognition The FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors Framework was introduced in 2023 to categorize digital assets beyond the scope of traditional large-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The framework divides assets into five distinct segments: Financials, Smart Contract Platforms, Currencies, Utilities & Services, and Consumer & Culture. Good news for SHIB holders Grayscale’s Market Byte Here Come the Altcoins from October 2025 officially lists Shiba Inu SHIB under the Consumer & Culture crypto sector in the FTSE Grayscale Crypto Sectors framework. SHIB is recognized by Grayscale Investments and FTSE Russell as… pic.twitter.com/8jBpKkP9PL — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) November 2, 2025 When the index was first launched, tokens like ImmutableX (IMX), Decentraland (MANA), and ApeCoin (APE) were included under the Consumer & Culture classification. Shiba Inu was notably absent at the time. However, in the latest update, Grayscale has officially included SHIB in that category, a move Lucie says reaffirms the token’s staying power and the strength of its community-driven ecosystem. She added that this acknowledgment reflects the project’s long-term potential and confirms that its foundation remains strong and its vision is alive. SHIB Among Assets Eligible for Spot ETFs Beyond classification, Shiba Inu’s inclusion in the framework carries further significance. According to Grayscale’s latest report, SHIB is among the cryptocurrencies that satisfy the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Generic Listing Standards (GLS), a regulatory guideline that allows certain crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to be listed without individual SEC approval. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Under the GLS framework, exchanges can list spot ETFs for assets that meet defined eligibility criteria and have an effective registration statement. Grayscale’s analysis identified 11 cryptocurrencies across four sectors that qualify under these standards. In the Consumer & Culture category, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are the only two assets recognized. Other qualifying assets include XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, and Bitcoin Cash from the Currencies sector; Polkadot, Cardano, Solana, and Avalanche from Smart Contract Platforms; and Chainlink from Utilities & Services. Currently, Solana and Litecoin already have spot ETFs trading in the United States, while applications for Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, and Bitcoin Cash remain under review. SHIB Yet to Receive a Standalone ETF Filing Despite meeting the SEC’s Generic Listing Standards, there is still no individual application for a Shiba Inu spot ETF in the U.S. market. However, industry observers note growing institutional interest in SHIB, particularly following T. Rowe Price’s mention of the token as a possible component in its Active Crypto ETF product lineup. Outside the United States, the project has already seen success in traditional finance integration. Valour Inc., a European investment firm, previously launched a Swedish krona (SEK)-denominated ETP tracking Shiba Inu’s performance. While Grayscale’s latest framework update identifies Shiba Inu as eligible for a future ETF under current regulatory standards, it remains uncertain whether the firm intends to proceed with an official filing. Still, the token’s inclusion signals growing acknowledgment of SHIB’s influence and longevity within the broader crypto market.

Bear Case: These Forces Divide The Market,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-bull-case-vs-bear-case/,"On November 2, 2025, crypto analyst Ignas | DeFi distilled crypto’s current standoff into a clean ledger of pros and cons. The Bearish Case For Crypto The first bear pillar is the “AI bubble” overhang. Late-October headlines crystallized the debate as Nvidia briefly breached a $5 trillion market value, a milestone that sharpened concern that equity valuations tied to AI infrastructure spending may be running ahead of realized returns. Point two—“bullish news fail to pump”—was on display as “Uptober” ended with a whimper for the crypto market. Despite intermittent policy tailwinds and strong ETF inflows mid-month, both Bitcoin and Ethereum faded into month-end, and US spot ETF flows turned sharply negative over the final three trading days of October, a pattern consistent with risk aversion after the Oct. 10–11 shock. Related Reading: Is Crypto ‘Boring’ Now? Bitwise CEO Says The Market Is Changing That shock, the “10/10 crash,” is the third bear lever. The two-day downdraft followed a sudden tariff escalation threat from the White House and produced one of the largest one-day liquidations in crypto history, spurring a rush for downside hedges and leaving the market probing for “dead entities” and hidden impairments. Cycle timing is Ignas’ fourth bear note. The fourth Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024 (block 840,000). Prior cycles do not map one-for-one, but the post-halving window is a pattern which gets a lot of attention at the moment. If the “cycle is not dead,” a Bitcoin top may already be in or is looming by the end of the year. “Old OG wallets selling” is the fifth bear claimant—and, for once, the chain tells a clear story. Since mid-October, long-term holders have materially increased net distribution, with Glassnode and other trackers flagging outflows on the order of tens of thousands of BTC, alongside headline-grabbing awakenings of Satoshi-era wallets. This does not prove panic, but it does inject supply at a delicate moment. Negative ETF flows round out the bear list. Farside’s fund-by-fund ledger shows pronounced outflows on October 29–31 across several US spot Bitcoin ETFs, with total daily net redemptions exceeding $470 million on October 29 and $488 million on October 30, before another hit on October 31 (191 million). While October closed with a inflow total of 3.424 billion, the message: the “fast money” cohort that chased the summer breakout was, at least temporarily, in retreat. Buffett’s caution is the macro bear exclamation point. Berkshire Hathaway’s third-quarter print revealed a record $381.7 billion cash pile and a twelfth straight quarter as a net seller of equities—a posture that telegraphs wariness about broad risk assets and liquidity conditions even as operating earnings rise. For crypto, this is not a direct flow, but it is a bellwether for global risk appetite. The Bull Case For Crypto The bull case, however, is not hand-waving. Start with “liquidity easing & interest cuts.” The ECB has already delivered substantial easing this year and paused; the Bank of England has begun cutting; and in the US, the Federal Reserve is also expected to close out the year with two more cuts while ending quantitative tightening. Related Reading: Powell, The FOMC, And Crypto: The Message Everyone Missed Ignas also says “no clear euphoria,” and—empirically—he’s right. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index spent the past week toggling between “Fear” and low “Neutral,” printing in the mid-30s to low-40s as of November 3. That’s a long way from the 80s–90s “extreme greed” that often sets up blow-off tops, and it supports the idea that positioning is not yet dangerously crowded. Institutional adoption remains the quiet compounding force in the bull ledger. With $30.2 billion year-to-date inflows, spot Bitcoin ETFs are fueling most of the market strength. On policy, the US did more than chatter in 2025: the Senate passed, and President Trump signed, a bipartisan stablecoin law in July. A broader market-structure bill remains in play, but even the stablecoin win is non-trivial for on-chain liquidity and payments rails. Seasonality also favors patience. Since 2013, Q4 has been Bitcoin’s strongest quarter on average, with multiple cycles posting outsized November–December runs. Then there’s the stablecoin plumbing. Despite October’s chaos, aggregate stablecoin float sits around $307–308 billion and notched fresh all-time highs in mid-October—a sign that dry powder inside crypto’s own rails remains abundant and ready to mobilize if confidence stabilizes. As of today, DefiLlama pegs the total at roughly $307.6 billion. Finally, the US–China trade war has seen extremely positive progress. “This is the BIGGEST de-escalation yet. Under the new US-China trade deal, President Trump made a HUGE agreement with China: China will suspend ALL retaliatory tariffs announced since March 4th. And, China will suspend or remove ALL retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken since March 4th. This is not getting nearly enough attention,” The Kobeissi Letter wrote via X on Sunday. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.56 trillion.

54002411,619348,1762214449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54002411.jpeg,Bitcoin Sees Retail Retreat: Shrimp Deposits Drop 5x Since Early 2023,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sees-retail-retreat-shrimp-deposits-drop-5x/,"Bitcoin is showing renewed fragility as price struggles to reclaim the $110,000 level, putting bulls on the defensive and exposing the market to further downside risk. Selling pressure has been building across the market, and BTC now finds itself probing lower demand zones as traders reassess positioning after recent volatility. While the macro backdrop remains broadly supportive, near-term sentiment has shifted toward caution as liquidity thins and speculative flows recede. A key dynamic shaping this cycle is the absence of retail participation. According to top analyst Darkfost, retail investor activity — measured through small holder inflows to Binance — has fallen sharply. Since early 2023, just after the bear market ended, the 90-day moving average of shrimp inflows has dropped from roughly 552 BTC per day to just 92 BTC today. This more than five-fold decline marks one of the steepest drops in retail engagement ever seen in a Bitcoin recovery phase. This structural shift underscores how different this cycle is from previous ones. With retail sitting on the sidelines, Bitcoin is being driven primarily by institutional flows, large holders , and long-term accumulation behavior. For bulls, the path forward likely hinges on whether new liquidity arrives — or whether current selling pressure pushes BTC into deeper support before the next leg higher can begin. Spot ETFs Reshape Market Participation as Retail Fades The decline in retail participation accelerated sharply with the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Before ETFs went live, small holders were sending roughly 450 BTC per day to Binance. Since the ETF debut, that figure has collapsed to just 92 BTC per day, and the downtrend has continued. This shift marks a structural change in how retail interacts with Bitcoin and where liquidity enters the market. Darkfost outlines three primary drivers behind this dramatic decline. First, a portion of the retail crowd migrated to ETFs, opting for the convenience and perceived security of regulated financial products over self-custody and traditional exchange activity. This naturally reduced on-chain inflows to Binance and similar platforms. Second, remaining retail investors have shifted behavior, choosing to hold long-term rather than trade, indicating stronger hands and a more disciplined class of small holders. Third, many early retail accumulators have simply graduated out of the shrimp cohort, now holding more than 0.1 BTC and no longer being counted in that data segment. These dynamics reveal a profound evolution in Bitcoin’s market structure. The current cycle is being driven not by speculative retail surges but by institutional flows, emerging whales, corporate treasury strategies, and long-term accumulation addresses that rarely sell. As a result, Bitcoin’s supply is tightening at the margins even as price consolidates — creating a slow-burning but powerful supply-demand setup unlike previous cycles. The forces supporting Bitcoin today are more structurally resilient, but they also produce a market rhythm that is quieter, more methodical, and less euphoric than traditional retail-led bull runs. Bitcoin Remains Trapped Below Key Moving Averages Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $107,250, holding above a key support zone after another rejection from resistance. The daily chart shows BTC struggling to regain momentum, with multiple attempts to reclaim the $110K–$112K band failing as sellers consistently step in around short-term resistance and moving average clusters. This area, highlighted on the chart, represents a critical liquidity and acceptance zone — until price breaks above it decisively, upside momentum will remain capped. BTC is currently trading below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, a bearish short-term structure that points to continued market hesitation. The 200-day moving average sits slightly below current price and is acting as an important dynamic support. Losing that zone would open the door to a potential retest of the $104K–$105K region, where strong demand previously emerged during October’s flush. On the upside, a clean break above $112K, followed by a reclaim of the $117,500 Point of Control, is required to reset bullish momentum and put the next leg higher back in play. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound and cautious, with sellers defending overhead levels and buyers stepping in only at key supports. Volatility remains suppressed as the market waits for fresh catalysts and liquidity inflows.

The three months, which ended on Wednesday, saw $21 billion in short-term borrowing, down from the $590 billion forecast issued in July, indicating a decrease in short-term borrowing. Officials attribute most of the changes to more cash than expected at the beginning of the quarter. The data available suggests that in early October, the Treasury had approximately $891 in cash, which was above the $850 in summer gross cash. Using a substantial portion of the trove allowed the department to slow its rate of wealth increase for spending and debt repayment while still meeting all obligations. Treasury leverages a strong cash buffer The Treasury’s cut results from careful cash management, given there were months of heavy issuance to rebuild reserves following the suspension of the debt ceiling at the start of the calendar year. In previous quarters, the Treasury had increased sales of short-term bills to replenish its coffers. But strong tax inflows and cautious outlays have left it with a much larger cushion than expected. According to analysts, this could ease some of the tension in the bond markets, which have been pressured by the rapid pace of supply and an increase in longer-term interest rates. A borrowing reduction was a strong move to get the Treasury stabilizer working again, according to analysts quoted by the Financial Times. In addition, reductions in the borrowing requirement may help steady Treasury yields, making it easier for investors to anticipate interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Nonetheless, economists claim that the reduction is not an indication of general fiscal moderation. Spending at the federal level remains unchanged, and borrowing is still significantly higher than it was before the pandemic. Other obstacles remain for the Treasury. Treasury maintains high borrowing plans for early 2026 In summary, the Treasury plans to borrow approximately $578 billion between January and March 2026, contingent upon a year-end cash balance of $850 billion. This estimate aligns with its previous projections, underscoring that federal borrowing is expected to be extensive over the next few quarters. That is because the government continues to spend a significant amount on entitlement programs, its infrastructure plan, and other initiatives. However, market observers expect a balance between bill, note, and bond issues in the indicated bill cut. Therefore, the primary aim is to create an issuance plan that will provide the appropriate levels of liquidity across the maturity spectrum without destabilizing the Treasury market. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether the U.S. economy slows down and fiscal policymakers fail to pass a longer-term budget solution, this cut will be trivial compared to a historically large Q4 borrowing estimate. The final point is that persistent fiscal deficits will remain, and excellent debt management will be even more indispensable now than previously. This means that the oversupply issue will offer investors short-term relief from being bothersome. Still, their focus will instantly be on how the Treasury expects to transform its strategy for Q1 or 2026, given existing economic conditions and prevailing political states.

In the speech, Cook demonstrated her support for the recent interest rate cut and asserted that she is willing to consider further reductions. Notably, the Federal Governor has largely kept a low profile since Trump attempted to remove her in August due to allegations of mortgage fraud. To avoid trouble, Cook shifted her focus to the legal battles that have enabled her to remain at the central bank. Cook agrees on further rate cuts while facing legal battles Addressing the audience at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. On Monday, November 3, Cook highlighted her outlook regarding the country’s economic status and her opinion on monetary policy . She said the economy was strong; however, the Federal Governor pointed out risks to steady inflation and low unemployment. Cook agreed with the Federal Open Market Committee’s earlier decision to lower the central bank’s crucial interest rate by a quarter percentage point, which passed with a 10-2 vote. This decision marks the second consecutive meeting to result in a rate cut . In a statement, the Federal Governor expressed that she believes the decision was right because she felt that the threats surrounding job loss are more substantial than those related to surging inflation. Therefore, based on her argument, this latest reduction in the fed funds rate is another significant step towards normalizing their policy. Meanwhile, courts have stopped Trump from dismissing Cook. Sources close to the matter expressed that several individuals viewed the president’s move as a key problem for the central bank’s independence. On the other hand, White House officials accused Cook of issuing false details on her application for federally backed home loans. However, after several considerations, the Federal Governor was neither found guilty of any crime nor were any charges filed against her. Responding to these claims, Cook mentioned “clerical errors” in the loan applications. When reports requested her to provide information on the situation, she declined to respond. Still, Cook continues to undertake her responsibility at the Federal Reserve, which reduced its key federal funds rate in September for the first time since December. Jerome Powell’s remarks on rate cuts raise concerns among individuals Looking ahead, Cook pointed out that she would continue to depend on the data released to make her decision. This was after FOMC officials hinted that there is a likelihood of another rate cut before the end of the year. “As always, I assess my monetary policy position at each meeting based on new data from various sources, my changing outlook, and the balance of risks,” she explained. According to Cook, every Federal meeting, including December’s, is crucial. When asked to comment on the impacts of Trump’s tariffs, the Federal Governor expressed their desire to determine if the impact of tariffs persists over time. She explained that this applies to whether companies are delaying price increases and what they have done with their stock, adding that there is much to expect and examine with the December meeting approaching. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell raised concerns in the market during his news conference after he stated that a cut in December is not guaranteed. Powell argued that there are many different opinions within the committee, which usually tend to agree on policy decisions Following his remarks, individuals are awaiting the December meeting to find out the Fed’s final decision.

This decline has sparked a renewed sense of bearish sentiment among investors, and experts caution that conditions could worsen in the coming days. November Deadline Approaches Market expert CryptoBirb recently expressed concerns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), noting that the market is already ten days into a bearish cycle. According to CryptoBirb, diving into on-chain data, the more alarming the picture appears. Related Reading: Solana Price Drops Below $180 Despite $199M ETF Inflows, What’s Behind the Decline? CryptoBirb’s analysis begins with cycle peak data: it has been 1,078 days since the low in November 2022, which is 101.2% of the crypto cycle complete. Additionally, it has been 563 days since the last Halving, with 45 days remaining within the typical 518 to 580-day peak range. Alarmingly, the anticipated rally leading to this peak has not materialized, and there are only 17 days left before the window for a peak closes on November 20. Missed breakouts during this time frame have signaled the end of previous bullish cycles. When comparing the current situation to the 2017 cycle, it is noted that Bitcoin reached its peak on December 17, 2017, 1,068 days after its low. With BTC now 1,078 days into the current cycle, the chances of a late top are diminishing with each passing day that the cryptocurrency remains below $113,000. From a performance standpoint, Bitcoin is down 16% from its all-time high of $126,200 and has only gained 8.2% year-to-date. The market’s leading crypto has faced repeated rejections near the $113,000 to $114,000 range and is currently trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $109,882. Historically, November typically sees an average gain of 17.5%, with positive performance in 10 out of the last 15 years. However, the expert points that when November begins in the red, it often indicates that the cycle is already shifting. Potential Bullish Factors Amid Ongoing Crypto Concerns Adding to this bearish sentiment, DeFi researcher DeFiIgnas has outlined several factors complicating the crypto market’s trajectory. These include what he calls “the speculative nature of the artificial intelligence (AI) bubble,” the failure of bullish news to invigorate crypto prices, uncertainty surrounding entities that collapsed after the October 10 crash, and the cyclical nature of the market. Additionally, the selling activity from long-term holders and negative crypto exchange-traded funds (ETF) flows contribute to the prevailing concerns.

Despite these challenges, DeFiIgnas also identified some potential bullish factors that could foster recovery instead of further declines. These include easing liquidity and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed), a lack of euphoria in the crypto space, slow but steady institutional adoption, and the potential passage of a US crypto market structure bill. Historically strong performance in the fourth quarter, stablecoin supply at all-time highs, and a recent US trade deal with China could also provide a counterbalance to the prevailing bearish sentiment.

On the anniversary of its whitepaper publication, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent used the occasion to highlight Bitcoin’s consistency and prosperity, suggesting that Senate Democrats could learn something from its reliability and history. His remarks linked BTC’s nearly uninterrupted record of network activity to the challenges seemingly faced by the Democrats. What Senate Democrats Could Learn From Bitcoin In an X social media post on October 31, Bessent criticized Senate Democrats, suggesting that Bitcoin’s ability to remain functional through global crises and economic changes over the past 16 years shows a level of resilience that they could learn from. As a US republican, his comments came as the two major political parties continue to clash over federal budget issues, which have resulted in the ongoing government shutdown . Notably, October 31 also marks the anniversary of the publication of Bitcoin’s whitepaper . The whitepaper, authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of BTC, described a fully digital monetary system designed to run without central authorities or intermediaries. When the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009, it officially launched the network, introducing a framework that has now become globally recognized, extending its reach across multiple sectors and countries. Bitcoin’s adoption since its launch has been nothing short of remarkable, with prominent industry leaders calling it a “ store of value ” and “ digital gold .” Even Bessent has been a vocal advocate of the rapid advancement of the digital asset sector and the growth of BTC. In July, after US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , Bessent stated that stablecoins could be the key to propping up the US dollar. A month later, he said on X that Bitcoin forfeited to the Federal Government would be the foundation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve established by the President’s March Executive Order. He also stated that the US Treasury has since committed to identifying budget-neutral ways to acquire additional Bitcoin to expand the reserve and strengthen the country’s position in the digital asset economy. BTC Records 99.9% Uptime Since Launch Recent data have underscored Bitcoin’s network performance over the past 16 years. Crypto Developer Abhinav reported that the blockchain has achieved a 99.9% uptime since its launch in 2009, with only two brief outages recorded over the past 16 years. Related Reading: Here’s What Happened The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Closed October In The Red Supporters have also highlighted this remarkable technical performance as evidence of BTC’s reliability and its role as the cornerstone of decentralized technology. Additionally, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s network hash rate, a measure of computational power, recently reached an all-time high of around 1.204 ZH/s. Its current level of 1.202 ZH/s marks a 12.3% increase from the previous day and a 79% rise compared with one year ago. Over its 16-year history, BTC has also undergone four halving events, achieving a market value exceeding $2.1 trillion. On its anniversary, it traded above $110,000, after previously reaching an ATH of over $126,000 in October .",Bitcoin News|Abhinav|bitcoin|Bitcoin Network Hash Rate|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|digital gold|Donald Trump|GENIUS Act|Scott Bessent|Stablecoins|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-04 01:00:17
